It has been reported that the UK and South African strains may have higher transmission capabilities, eventually in part due to amino acid substitutions on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The pathogenicity seems modified but is still under investigation. Here we used the experimental structure of the Spike RBD domain co-crystallized with part of the ACE2 receptor, several in silico methods and numerous experimental data reported recently to analyze the possible impacts of three amino acid replacements (Spike K417N, E484K, N501Y) with regard to ACE2 binding. We found that the N501Y replacement in this region of the interface (present in both the UK and South African strains) should be favorable for the interaction with ACE2, while the K417N and E484K substitutions (South African strain) would seem neutral or even unfavorable. It is unclear if the N501Y substitution in the South African strain could counterbalance the K417N and E484K Spike replacements with regard to ACE2 binding. Our finding suggests that the UK strain should have higher affinity toward ACE2 and therefore likely increased transmissibility and possibly pathogenicity. If indeed the South African strain has a high transmission level, this could be due to the N501Y replacement and/or to substitutions in regions located outside the direct SpikeCACE2 interface but not so much to the K417N and E484K replacements. Yet, it should be noted that amino acid changes at Spike position 484 can lead to viral escape from neutralizing antibodies. Further, these amino acid substitutions do not seem to induce major structural changes in this region of the Spike protein. This structureCfunction study allows us to rationalize some observations made for the UK strain but raises questions for the South African strain.","output":"In Silico Investigation of the New UK (B.1.1.7) and South African (501Y.V2) SARS-CoV-2 Variants with a Focus at the ACE2CSpike RBD Interface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There are scanty data on the occurrence of gastric tumours overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in Africa. Objective: To assess HER2 protein overexpression in gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GGEAC) samples from a single centre in Zambia. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional study of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks with GGEAC. Prepared slides were first stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and then evaluated for HER2 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. Results: A total of 57 gastric tissues were stained and evaluated for HER2 overexpression. Thirteen (23%) showed overexpression, 41/57 (72%) had negative and 3/57 (5%) had equivocal staining. The equivocal cases were excluded from the final analysis. Of the remaining 54 tissues, 28 (52%) were from females, and 26 (48%) were from males. The mean age was 59 years (SD 15 years). HER2 overexpression was highest in moderately differentiated tumours (p=0.0005). Intestinal type tumours had a higher occurrenc of HER2 overexpression than diffuse or mixed sub-types (p=0.0087). HER2 overexpression was not associated with age (p=0.27), sex (p=1.00) or anatomical location (p=1.00). Conclusion: The occurrence of GGEAC HER2 overexpression in Zambian patients is similar to proportions reported elsewhere, and it is associated with moderately differentiated tumours of the intestinal type.","output":"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression in gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in patients seen at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A smart environment is an assistive technology space that can enable people with motor disabilities to control their equipment (TV, radio, fan, etc.) through a human-machine interface activated by different inputs.

This article aims to present the different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were identified through the continuity of the networking between the French addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role: among the many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol. In parallel, the French addictovigilance network continued its communications efforts in the period, issuing a newsletter on tramadol, a press release on methadone and naloxone, and participating in the COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutic website (https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19). COVID-19 epidemic has been an important challenge for addictovigilance, and has proved that this monitoring is highly essential for alerting health professionals and health authorities to points of vigilance in the field of psychoactive substances.","output":"Addictovigilance contribution during COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe and report on the use of virtual clinical competency examinations (VCCEs) for D3 dental students in a radiology clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic and relate the technology to other clinical and educational applications. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Paper-based clinical competency examinations (CCEs) were converted to three different VCCEs to closely replicate the CCEs. Existing grading rubrics were used to assess students' abilities to evaluate technical issues and interpret intraoral full-mouth series and panoramic radiographs. The grading rubrics were modified from their clinical versions to eliminate non-reproducible skills, such as patient management and application of selection criteria. Radiographs were selected from clinic records and anonymized. VCCEs were conducted via WebEx conferences that were scheduled via an appointment app. These experiences can be extended to virtual patient contacts, teleradiology, and telemedicine, as well as continuing dental education experiences. RESULTS: Approximately 200 VCCEs were administered by four oral and maxillofacial radiology faculty over a 10-week period. Both students and faculty managed the technology well, with few missed appointments. All students were successful in challenging the examinations and appeared to be satisfied with the experience. CONCLUSIONS: Although direct comparisons between the CCEs and the new VCCEs are difficult, as there was no time to pilot the VCCEs, students were successful in challenging the examinations and informally reported satisfaction with the experience. Although components of CCEs that could not be replicated on the VCEs could not be assessed, it is felt that the students had adequate experience in selection of radiographs and patient management prior to the COVID-19 lockdown. Additional benefits of the VCCEs included contact with students to check on their well-being. The experience indicates that VCCEs can be used in the future in hybrid models of oral & maxillofacial radiology education, clinical care, patient screening, and telemedicine. Moreover, the success of this demonstration points to potential for personalized distance learning in continuing dental education.","output":"Development of virtual radiology clinical competency evaluation amidst COVID-19 at a dental school"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Was the European Central Bank able to assure the relaunch of the European project after the weakening of the post-crisis period? To answer this question, this paper presents an empirical analysis connecting citizen trust in the European Union with a variable intended to be a measure of the monetary policy strategy of the European Central Bank, namely, the interest rate on government bonds extracted from the 1-year maturity yield curve. The dynamic panel technique, applied to nineteen Eurozone countries for the time span of 2004C2018, estimates the presence of a long-run common relationship between the variables despite allowing different short-run adjustment mechanisms. Results are revealed to be not univocal: the easy monetary policy strategy is associated for the whole period with a decline of trust, and therefore, despite its impressiveness, it was not sufficient to relaunch the European Union project. However, when considering the change in strategy of the post-2013 period, it seemed to have contributed to a slight inversion of the decline of trust.

The inspiration of CHIO is originated from the herd immunity concept as a way to tackle coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The speed of spreading coronavirus infection depends on how the infected individuals directly contact with other society members. In order to protect other members of society from the disease, social distancing is suggested by health experts. Herd immunity is a state the population reaches when most of the population is immune which results in the prevention of disease transmission. These concepts are modeled in terms of optimization concepts. CHIO mimics the herd immunity strategy as well as the social distancing concepts. Three types of individual cases are utilized for herd immunity: susceptible, infected, and immuned. This is to determine how the newly generated solution updates its genes with social distancing strategies. CHIO is evaluated using 23 well-known benchmark functions. Initially, the sensitivity of CHIO to its parameters is studied. Thereafter, the comparative evaluation against seven state-of-the-art methods is conducted. The comparative analysis verifies that CHIO is able to yield very competitive results compared to those obtained by other well-established methods. For more validations, three real-world engineering optimization problems extracted from IEEE-CEC 2011 are used. Again, CHIO is proved to be efficient. In conclusion, CHIO is a very powerful optimization algorithm that can be used to tackle many optimization problems across a wide variety of optimization domains.","output":"Coronavirus herd immunity optimizer (CHIO)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foodborne illness resulting from the consumption of contaminated fresh produce is a common phenomenon and has severe effects on human health together with severe economic and social impacts.

This review provides a background on the various sources and pathways through which pathogenic bacteria contaminate fresh produce; the survival and proliferation of pathogens on fresh produce while growing and potential methods to reduce microbial contamination before harvest. Some of the established bacterial contamination sources include contaminated manure, irrigation water, soil, livestock/ wildlife, and numerous factors influence the incidence, fate, transport, survival and proliferation of pathogens in the wide variety of sources where they are found. Once pathogenic bacteria have been introduced into the growing environment, they can colonize and persist on fresh produce using a variety of mechanisms. Overall, microbiological hazards are significant; therefore, ways to reduce sources of contamination and a deeper understanding of pathogen survival and growth on fresh produce in the field are required to reduce risk to human health and the associated economic consequences.","output":"Sources and contamination routes of microbial pathogens to fresh produce during field cultivation: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perforin-deficient [perforin (-/-)] mice were infected with two strains of JHM virus (JHMV) to analyze the role of perforin-mediated cytotoxicity in acute lethal and subacute central nervous system (CNS) infections.

Perforin (-/-) mice survived longer than the controls, consistent with reduced morbidity. Both strains of virus were cleared from the perforin (-/-) mice as in the controls; however, the rate of clearance was delayed in the perforin (-/-) mice, indicating that perforin-mediated cytolysis is involved in viral clearance. The absence of perforin-mediated cytolysis did not prevent encephalomyelitis or extensive demyelination. Cells undergoing apoptosis were detected in the CNS of both the perforin (-/-) and control groups, indicating that perforin is not essential for programmed cell death. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected in either group of mice until day 9 postinfection, when the majority of the virus had been cleared.

To directly measure SARS-CoV-2 infection in diverse schools with either remote or onsite learning. Methods. 4 schools participated. Schools A and B served low-income Hispanic learners, school C special needs, and all three provided predominantly remote instruction. School D served middle and upper-middle income, White learners, with predominantly onsite instruction. 320 learners [10.5+/-2.1(SD); 7-17 y.o.]; 86% had phlebotomy. Testing occurred early in the fall (2020), at lower levels of COVID-19, and 6-8 weeks later during the fall-winter surge (tenfold increase in COVID-19 cases). Results: Nasal RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 and 21 respiratory pathogens was performed. Phlebotomy was obtained for circulating immunity. Face covering and physical distancing fidelity was measured by direct observation. 17 learners were SARS-CoV-2 positive during the surge. School A (97% remote) had the highest infection rate (9/70, 12.9%, p<0.01) and IgG positivity rate (13/70, 18.6%). School D had the lowest infection and IgG positive rate (1/86, 1.2%).

However, few studies have included important trauma-related characteristics such as known perpetrator, fear of life or injury, and negative reactions to disclosure. Little focus on potentially important subgroup differences including sexual/gender identity, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status as well as protective factors have been assessed. METHOD Participants (N = 2,880) completed four annual surveys during late adolescence and the transition to young adulthood as part of an ongoing longitudinal study. Latent class analysis was used to extract classes of victimization and trauma-related characteristics. Latent class regression was used to understand how demographic covariates were related to class membership. Finally, discrete-time survival mixture analysis was used to assess latency to opioid use from ages 17 to 24 years, and how demographic and protective factors influenced opioid use across emergent classes. RESULTS The four-class solution fit the data best: sexual abuse and indirect violence + high trauma characteristics (n = 79, 3.6%); high all + high trauma characteristics (n = 177; 8.1%); chronic emotional abuse + trusted perpetrator (n = 263; 12.1%); and low all (n = 1,656; 76.1%). Latent class regression results indicated differential risk of class membership by sexual/gender minority status, sex assigned at birth, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Survival analysis noted shorter latency to opioid use across all classes compared to the low all class. Self-efficacy and neighborhood cohesion emerged as important protective factors.

We review outcomes in patients with NDD and COVID-19 and discuss the hypothesis that due to putative commonalities of neuropathogenesis, COVID-19 may unmask or trigger NDD in vulnerable individuals. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on a systematic review of published literature, patients with NDD, including dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) make up a significant portion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Such patients are likely to present with altered mental status or worsening of their preexisting neurological symptoms. Patients with NDD and poor outcomes often have high-risk comorbid conditions, including advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and heart/lung disease. Patients with dementia including Alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death, whereas those with preexisting Parkinson's disease are not. MS patients have good outcomes and disease modifying therapies do not increase the risk for severe disease. Viral infections and attendant neuroinflammation have been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and MS, suggesting that COVID-19 may have the potential to incite or accelerate neurodegeneration. SUMMARY: Since patients with Alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death in the setting of COVID-19, additional precautions and protective measures should be put in place to prevent infections and optimize management of comorbidities in this vulnerable population.

Fever has been observed as one of the most common clinical manifestations, although the prevalence and characteristics of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients is inconclusive. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of fever and chills in addition to fever characteristics (low, medium, and high temperature) in both adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020176327). PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases were searched between 1st December 2019 and 3rd April 2020 without language restrictions. Both adult (&#8805;18 years) and paediatric (<18 years) COVID-19 patients were considered eligible. We used random-effects model for the meta-analysis to obtain the pooled prevalence and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and Cochran's Q test. Robustness of the pooled estimates was checked by different subgroups and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: We identified 2055 studies, of which 197 studies (n = 24266) were included in the systematic review and 167 studies with 17142 adults and 373 paediatrics were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients were 79.43% [95% CI: 77.05-81.80, I2 = 95%] and 45.86% [95% CI: 35.24-56.48, I2 = 78%], respectively. Besides, 14.45% [95% CI: 10.59-18.32, I2 = 88%] of the adult COVID-19 patients were accompanied with chills. In adult COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of medium-grade fever (44.33%) was higher compared to low- (38.16%) and high-grade fever (14.71%). In addition, the risk of both low (RR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.69-3.22, p<0.00001, I2 = 84%) and medium grade fever (RR: 2.79, 95% CI: 2.21-3.51, p<0.00001, I2 = 75%) were significantly higher compared to high-grade fever, however, there was no significant difference between low- and medium-grade fever (RR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.94-1.44, p = 0.16, I2 = 87%). 88.8% of the included studies were of high-quality. The sensitivity analyses indicated that our findings of fever prevalence for both adult and paediatric patients are reliable and robust. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fever in adult COVID-19 patients was high, however, 54.14% of paediatric COVID-19 patients did not exhibit fever as an initial clinical feature.

By combining this live imaging approach with pharmacological and genetic perturbations, we show that Mtb can maintain its intracellular pH independently of the surrounding pH in primary human macrophages. Importantly, we show that unlike bedaquiline (BDQ), isoniazid (INH) or rifampicin (RIF), the front-line drug pyrazinamide (PZA) displays antibacterial efficacy by acting as protonophore which disrupts intrabacterial pH homeostasis in cellulo. By using Mtb mutants with different intra-macrophage localisation, we confirmed that intracellular acidification is a prerequisite for PZA efficacy in cellulo. We anticipate this dual imaging approach will be useful to identify host cellular environments that affect antibiotic efficacy against intracellular pathogens.

The number of non-migratory species showed no spatial trend along the cascade system, but migratory and non-native richness increased toward downstream reaches. We also observed spatial variation in species composition along the cascade system, but some non-native fishes were widely distributed. Migratory fishes showed low relative abundance (usually < 10%), while non-native species were common and more abundant, especially in reservoirs downstream.

METHODS: A protocol has been drawn up with the aim of providing training in safety for every student of the degree courses in medicine and health area and for doctors in residency training. In this way it was possible to carry out training sessions with a maximum of 6 students engaged in the simulation activities offered by the Center (3D) virtual cadaver, laparoscopic pelvic trainer stations, ultrasound laboratory, microsurgery, etc.). The key points of the protocol were represented by i) internet booking of the training activity; ii) respect of safety measures (hand hygiene, safe distance, restricted total number of presences, constant use of the surgical mask) and iii) reorganization of the material and cleaning of the rooms. RESULTS: Our educational strategy allowed to resume training activity maintaining adequate levels of safety for students and teachers.

Methods: We analyzed publicly available provincial- and territorial-level data on the prevalence of VOCs in relation to mitigating factors (summarized in three measures: 1. strength of public health countermeasures: stringency index, 2. how much people moved about outside their homes: mobility index, and 3. vaccine intervention: proportion of Canadian population fully vaccinated). Using spatial agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (unsupervised machine learning), the provinces and territories were grouped into clusters by stringency index, mobility index and full vaccine coverage. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine the differences in the prevalence of VOC (Alpha, or B.1.1.7, Beta, or B.1.351, Gamma, or P.1, and Delta, or B.1.617.2 variants) between the clusters. Results: Three clusters of vaccine uptake and countermeasures were identified. Cluster 1 consisted of the three Canadian territories, and characterized by higher degree of vaccine deployment and lesser degree of countermeasures. Cluster 2 (located in Central Canada and Atlantic region) was typified by lesser implementation of vaccine deployment and moderate countermeasures. The third cluster was formed by provinces inthe Pacific region, Central Canada, and Prairie region, with moderate vaccine deployment but stronger countermeasures.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, which has been detected in at least 103 countries, has reached 1,970,225 worldwide as of April 14, 2020 with 124,544 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Based on the analysis of 85 representative E2 gene sequences, the location and intensity of positive selection in CSFV isolates from group one and group two were identified. These results suggest that these two groups employ evolutionary difference. Moreover, the mutations, potentially driven by positive selection, can be correlated with the virulence of CSFV by altering the conformation and function of E2 and/or changing its glycosylation pattern. Based on these results, a model for the evolution of virulence of CSFV is proposed.

Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was used to elicit the responses of Vietnamese students over 2 consecutive weeks (from April 25 to May 9, 2020, n = 1,003, 70.1% female students, mean age 21.4  3.1). The online survey questionnaire collected data on the sociodemographic characteristics of participants, DHL about COVID-19, information seeking behavior, and subjective well-being. Mediation analysis was conducted using the importance of searching COVID-19 related information as independent variables, subjective well-being as a dependent variable, and DHL as a mediator variable. Results: Among 1,003 students, the mean (SD) of DHL related to COVID-19 was 2.87  0.32. In the survey, 87.2% of the students reported sufficient well-being, while almost 13% reported low or very low well-being.

We tested the stability of both SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped virions based on a lentiviral system, as well as fully infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. For the former, tile surfaces were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped HIV-1 luciferase virus. At intervals virus was recovered from surfaces and target cells infected. For live virus, after illuminating tiles for 0-300 min virus was recovered from surfaces followed by infection of Vero E6 cells. % of infected cells was determined by flow cytometry detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 24 h post-infection. Results: After 1 h illumination the pseudotyped viral titre was decreased by four orders of magnitude. There was no significant difference between the TiO 2 and TiO 2-Ag coatings. Light alone had no significant effect on viral viability. For live SARS-CoV-2, virus was already significantly inactivated on the TiO 2 surfaces after 20 min illumination.

However, elements of Australia's arts sector have not been so fortunate. The financial damage of pandemic-driven closures of exhibitions, art events, museums, and art businesses has been compounded by complex government stimulus packages that have excluded many contracted arts workers. Contrarily, a booming fine art auction market and commercial gallery sector driven by stay-at-home local collectors demonstrated remarkable resilience considering the extraordinary circumstances. Nonetheless, this resilience must be contextualised against a decade of underperformance in the Australian art market, fed by the negative impact of national taxation policies and a dearth of Federal government support for the visual arts sector.

This work shows how the sharpness of the outer edge of discs can be used to constrain the stirring levels. Namely, the sharper the edge is the lower the eccentricity dispersion must be. For a Rayleigh distribution of eccentricities ($e$), I find that the disc surface density near the outer edge can be parametrised as $\\\\tanh[(r_{\\\\max}-r)/l_{\\\\rm out}]$, where $r_{\\\\max}$ approximates the maximum semi-major axis and $l_{\\\\rm out}$ defines the edge smoothness. If the semi-major axis distribution has sharp edges $e_\\\\mathrm{rms}$ is roughly $1.2 l_{\\\\rm out}/r_{\\\\max}$, or $e_\\\\mathrm{rms}=0.77 l_{\\\\rm out}/r_{\\\\max}$ if semi-major axes have diffused due to self-stirring. This model is fitted to ALMA data of five wide discs: HD 107146, HD 92945, HD 206893, AU Mic and HR 8799. The results show that HD 107146, HD 92945 and AU Mic have the sharpest outer edges, corresponding to $e_\\\\mathrm{rms}$ values of $0.121\\\\pm0.05$, $0.15^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$ and $0.10\\\\pm0.02$ if their discs are self-stirred, suggesting the presence of Pluto-sized objects embedded in the disc. Although these stirring values are larger than typically assumed, the radial stirring of HD 92945 is in good agreement with its vertical stirring constrained by the disc height. HD 206893 and HR~8799, on the other hand, have smooth outer edges that are indicative of scattered discs since both systems have massive inner companions.","output":"Constraining planetesimal stirring: how sharp are debris disc edges?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged as a pandemic.

Data on age, sex, hand-washing practices in the past 30 days, and severe food insecurity (i.e., proxy of socioeconomic status) were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression and meta-analysis with random effects based on country-wise estimates were conducted to assess associations. Adolescents (n = 209,584) aged 12C15 years [mean (SD) age 13.8 (1.0) years; 50.9% boys] were included in the analysis. Overall, the prevalence of hand-washing practices were as follows: never/rarely washing hands before eating (6.4%), after using toilet (5.6%), or with soap (8.8%). The prevalence of never/rarely washing hands after using the toilet (10.8%) or with soap (14.3%) was particularly high in low-income countries. Severe food insecurity was associated with 1.34 (95%CI = 1.25C1.43), 1.61 (95%CI = 1.50C1.73), and 1.44 (95%CI = 1.35C1.53) times higher odds for never/rarely washing hands before eating, after using the toilet, and with soap, respectively. A high prevalence of inadequate hand washing practices was reported, particularly in low-income countries and those with severe food insecurity.

However, it is also essential to know the cumulative number of infected cases at a given time point, which is not directly available from the SIS model's present structure. The objective is to provide a modified SIS model to address that gap.In this work, we propose a modified structure of the SIS model to determine the cumulative number of infected cases at a given time point. We develop a dynamic data-driven algorithm to estimate the model parameters based on an optimally chosen training phase to predict the number of cumulative infected cases.We demonstrate the proposed algorithm's prediction performance using COVID-19 data from Delhi, India's capital city. Considering different time periods, we observed the proposed algorithms performance using the modified SIS model is well to predict the cumulative infected cases with two different prediction periods 30 and 40.

The outbreak was declared by the government on June 8, 2016. The aim of this study was to rapidly investigate the outbreak epidemiologically and guide response activities in the affected Sub cities of Addis Ababa city administration. METHODS: An unmatched 1:2 case-control study was conducted in six selected sub-cities of the city administration. Different laboratory tests were also done from suspected possible risk factors identified to support the epidemiological findings. A case was a patient greater than 5 years old, who developed acute watery diarrhea with or without Vomiting. Control was an individual greater than 5 years' old who stayed in the same township and did not suffer from cholera. A structured questionnaire was used to select cases and controls. Epi Info(TM) statistical software was used to analyze the data. Results were presented in narratives, figures and tables. RESULTS: The present study found that, the study participants who used street-vended water (Odds Ratio (OR)=10.4; 95% CI: 1.20-90.9), those who reported holy water sources use (OR=2.7, 95% CI: 1.45-5.04), eating raw meat (OR=7.75; 95% CI: 3.86-15.54) or roasted meat (OR=2.16; 95% CI: 1.19-3.93) and vegetable salad (OR=2.07; 95% CI: 1.14-3.76) were associated with contracting cholera infection. The likelihood of contracting cholera was significantly higher among those who ate food from street vendor sources (OR=5.32; 95% CI: 1.82-15.56) and those who practiced open defecation (OR=8.12; 95% CI (2.20-29.81).

Human phage display technology has revolutionized the process of identifying and optimizing antibodies, providing facile entry points for further applications. Herein, we use this technology to search for antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of CoV-2. Specifically, we screened a na?ve human semisynthetic phage library against RBD, leading to the identification of a high-affinity single-chain fragment variable region (scFv). The scFv was further engineered into two other antibody formats (scFv-Fc and IgG1). All three antibody formats showed high binding specificity to CoV-2 RBD and the spike antigens in different assay systems. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated specific binding of the IgG1 format to cells expressing membrane-bound CoV-2 spike protein. Docking studies revealed that the scFv recognizes an epitope that partially overlaps with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-interacting sites on the CoV-2 RBD. Given its high specificity and affinity, we anticipate that these anti-CoV-2 antibodies will be useful as valuable reagents for accessing the antigenicity of vaccine candidates, as well as developing antibody-based therapeutics and diagnostics for CoV-2.","output":"Identification of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain-directed human monoclonal antibody from a na?ve semisynthetic library"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microbial communities of soil aggregate-size fractions were explored with molecular and networking assays for topsoil samples from a clayey rice paddy under long-term fertilization treatments. The treatments included no fertilizer (NF) as control, chemical fertilizer only (CF), chemical fertilizer with swine manure (CFM), and chemical fertilizer with rice straw return (CFS). Following a wet-sieving protocol, water-stable aggregates were separated into size fractions of large macroaggregates (L-MacA, >2,000 m), macroaggregates (MacA, 2,000-250 m), microaggregates (MicA, 250-53 m), fine microaggregates (F-MicA, 53-2 m), and fine clay (F-Clay, <2 m). Mass proportion was 32.3-38.2% for F-MicA, 23.0-31.5% for MacA, 19.0-23.1% for MicA, 9.1-12.0% for L-MacA, and 4.9-7.5% for F-Clay, respectively. The proportion of MacA was increased, but F-Clay was reduced by fertilization, whereas the mean weight diameter was increased by 8.0-16.2% from 534.8 m under NF to 621.5 m under CFM. Fertilization affected bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal 18S rRNA gene abundance in F-MicA and F-Clay but not in aggregates in size larger than 53 m. However, bacterial and fungal community -diversities and community structures were quite more divergent among the fertilization treatments in all size fractions. Organic carbon and gene abundance of bacteria and fungi were enriched in both L-MacA and MacA but depleted in F-Clay, whereas microbial Shannon diversity was rarely changed by fraction size under the four treatments. L-MacA and MacA contained more bacteria of r-strategists and copiotrophs, whereas F-MicA and F-Clay were demonstrated with a higher abundance of K-strategists and oligotrophs. Guilds of parasitic and litter saprotrophic fungi were enriched in F-MicA but depleted in L-MacA. Furthermore, most of bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units were strongly interacted in L-MacA and MacA rather than in MicA and F-Clay.

Persons with disabilities live within communities and are raised by the values that apply within their communal context. Policymaking is intricately linked to policy implementation, and the inclusion of local knowledge strengthens policy influence, impacting on implementation processes. OBJECTIVES: This research study explored the definition and foci of inclusion, whether local knowledge is included and how it is represented within the national inclusive education policy in South Africa, Ghana and Uganda. This study reports on the outcomes of the second objective on inclusion of local knowledge. METHOD: A qualitative, critical, interpretative and constructivist approach was utilised for the study. Data were gathered through a desktop review and in-depth, individual interviews. RESULTS: There is inclusion of some local knowledge within the national policies; however, this is minimal and insufficient. Participants argue that even when it is included, it is often embedded or implied, that local knowledge should be made more prominent within inclusive education policies as local knowledge is a community resource that supports policy implementation. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of local community knowledge and ways of knowing within inclusive education policies is viewed as a critical and an integral aspect of policymaking. It will help to address the challenges of stigma and negative attitudes, promoting a continuity of knowledge that supports local values and well-being of children with disabilities and their communities.","output":"Local knowledge in inclusive education policies in Africa: informing sustainable outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article explores hospital chaplains perspective on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the provision of spiritual care in Poland.

RESULTS Our patient delayed treatment of his biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma for 15 months. On follow-up, visual exam only showed a well healed biopsy scar, and treatment was delayed another two months. Finally, thorough physical exam found perineural invasion. This helped guide the Mohs approach, but due to the delays resulted in a larger final defect and poorer cosmetic outcomes. CONCLUSION Proper, deep palpation of skin lesions, especially prior biopsy sites, is imperative to the treatment of skin cancer in cosmetically sensitive areas.

The Novel Coronavirus is still spreading quickly in several countries and the peak has not yet been reached in many countries. We developed age-structured model for describing the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya under different non-pharmaceutical interventions. The first case in Kenya was identified in March 13, 2020 with the pandemic increasing to 465 confirmed cases by end of 3 rd May, 2020. We fitted an age-structured deterministic mathematical model in Kenyan context. Methods: We model the COVID-19 situation in Kenya using Age-structured Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered compartmental model. These compartments follow a cascade of the disease from the Susceptible to Exposed individuals who in return are either symptomatic or asymptomatic. The symptomatic depict mild signs, which can develop to severe symptoms warranting hospitalization or can otherwise recover. The severe cases can recover with some developing critical condition. The critical are admitted at intensive care units. The resulting age-dependent ordinary differential equations from the model are solved using fourth order Runge-Kutta methods. We controlled for school closure, social distancing and lockdown in terms of movement restrictions Results: The model shows varying epidemic peak by age-structure and the mitigation scenarios. The peak dates for unmitigated (UM), the 45% NPI (M45) and School closure-curfew-partial lockdown NPI (SCL) are May 21 st , October 17 th and December 13 th 2020, respectively.

Furthermore, they are a relatively hypo-anergic population, in which the development and duration of the immune and antibody response is still partially unknown. This may play a role in the possible susceptibility to reinfection. To date, only 3 cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection from strains prior to the Omicron variant in patients on chronic hemodialysis have been reported in literature. In all of them, the first infection was detected by screening in the absence of symptoms, potentially indicating a poor immune response, and there are no data about the antibody titre developed.

Swabs were negative in the interval between episodes (therefore excluding any persistence of positivity) and the lack of antibody protection after the first infection was documented by the serological test. The role of the potential lack - or rapid loss - of immune protection following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in hemodialysis patients needs to be better defined, also in consideration of the anti-COVID vaccination campaign and the arrival of the Omicron variant, which appears to elude the immunity induced by vaccines and by previous variants.

Healthcare workers (HWs), the main actors of the health system, are at higher risk because of their occupation. Serology-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HWs represent a measure of HWs exposure to the virus and could be used as a guide to the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and valuable in combating COVID-19. This information is currently lacking in Ethiopia and other African countries. This study aimed to develop an in-house antibody testing assay, assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Ethiopian high-risk frontline HWs. METHODS: We developed and validated an in-house Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for specific detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain immunoglobin G (IgG) antibodies. We then used this assay to assess the seroprevalence among HWs in five public hospitals located in different geographic regions of Ethiopia. From consenting HWs, blood samples were collected between December 2020 and February 2021, the period between the two peaks of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using questionnaire-based interviews. Descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine the overall and post-stratified seroprevalence and the association between seropositivity and potential risk factors. RESULTS: Our successfully developed in-house assay sensitivity was 100% in serum samples collected 2- weeks after the first onset of symptoms whereas its specificity in pre-COVID-19 pandemic sera was 97.7%. Using this assay, we analyzed a total of 1997 sera collected from HWs. Of 1997 HWs who provided a blood sample, and demographic and clinical data, 51.7% were females, 74.0% had no symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and 29.0% had a history of contact with suspected or confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall seroprevalence was 39.6%. The lowest (24.5%) and the highest (48.0%) seroprevalence rates were found in Hiwot Fana Specialized Hospital in Harar and ALERT Hospital in Addis Ababa, respectively. Of the 821 seropositive HWs, 224(27.3%) of them had a history of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 while 436 (> 53%) of them had no contact with COVID-19 cases as well as no history of COVID-19 like symptoms. A history of close contact with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases is associated with seropositivity (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1C1.8; p = 0.015).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of the local COVID-19 outbreak on routine child health services. METHODS: The District Health Information System data set for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provincial health services was accessed, and monthly child health-related data were extracted for the period January 2018 - June 2020. Chronological and geographical variations in sentinel indicators for service access, service delivery and the wellbeing of children were assessed. RESULTS: During April - June 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in KZN, significant declines were seen for clinic attendance (36%; p=0.001) and hospital admissions (50%; p=0.005) of children aged &lt;5 years, with a modest recovery in clinic attendance only. Among service delivery indicators, immunisation coverage recovered most rapidly, with vitamin A supplementation, deworming and food supplementation remaining low. Changes were less pronounced for in- and out-of-hospital births and uptake rates of infant polymerase chain reaction testing for HIV at birth, albeit with wide interdistrict variations, indicating inequalities in access to and provision of maternal and neonatal care. A temporary 47% increase in neonatal facility deaths was reported in May 2020 that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19-related disruption and diversion of health resources. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple indicators demonstrated disruption in service access, service delivery and child wellbeing.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical implications of COVID-19 cardiac involvement in young competitive athletes. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study with data from 42 colleges and universities, we assessed the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 cardiac involvement among collegiate athletes in the United States. Data were collected from September 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of definite, probable, or possible COVID-19 cardiac involvement based on imaging definitions adapted from the Updated Lake Louise Imaging Criteria. Secondary outcomes included the diagnostic yield of cardiac testing, predictors for cardiac involvement, and adverse cardiovascular events or hospitalizations. RESULTS: Among 19 378 athletes tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 3018 (mean age, 20 years [SD, 1 year]; 32% female) tested positive and underwent cardiac evaluation. A total of 2820 athletes underwent at least 1 element of cardiac triad testing (12-lead ECG, troponin, transthoracic echocardiography) followed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) if clinically indicated. In contrast, primary screening CMR was performed in 198 athletes. Abnormal findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement were detected by ECG (21 of 2999 [0.7%]), cardiac troponin (24 of 2719 [0.9%]), and transthoracic echocardiography (24 of 2556 [0.9%]). Definite, probable, or possible SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement was identified in 21 of 3018 (0.7%) athletes, including 15 of 2820 (0.5%) who underwent clinically indicated CMR (n=119) and 6 of 198 (3.0%) who underwent primary screening CMR. Accordingly, the diagnostic yield of CMR for SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement was 4.2 times higher for a clinically indicated CMR (15 of 119 [12.6%]) versus a primary screening CMR (6 of 198 [3.0%]). After adjustment for race and sex, predictors of SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement included cardiopulmonary symptoms (odds ratio, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.2, 7.7]) or at least 1 abnormal triad test result (odds ratio, 37.4 [95% CI, 13.3, 105.3]). Five (0.2%) athletes required hospitalization for noncardiac complications of COVID-19. During clinical surveillance (median follow-up, 113 days [interquartile range=90a??146]), there was 1 (0.03%) adverse cardiac event, likely unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We sequenced and analyzed two new PRVC strains, RV0104 (G3), and RV0143 (G6) and compared their pathogenesis with that of the historic strain Cowden (G1) in gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs. Near complete genome sequence analysis confirmed that these two strains were distinct from one another and the Cowden strain. VP1, VP2, VP6, NSP1-NSP3, and NSP5 genes were more similar between Cowden and RV0143, whereas VP3, VP7, and NSP4 shared higher nucleotide identity between Cowden and RV0104. Three-day-old and 3-week-old Gn piglets were inoculated with 10(5) FFU/piglet of Cowden, RV0104 or RV0143, or mock. All 3-day-old piglets developed severe diarrhea, anorexia, and lethargy, with mean PRVC fecal shedding titers peaking and numerically higher in RV0104 and RV0143 piglets on post infection day (PID) 2. Histopathological examination of the small intestine revealed that the 3-day-old Cowden and RV0104 inoculated piglets were mildly affected, while significant destruction of small intestinal villi was observed in the RV0143 inoculated piglets. Consistent with the highest degree of pathological changes in the small intestines, the RV0143 inoculated piglets had numerically higher levels of serum IL-17 and IFN- cytokines and numerically lower PRVC IgA geometric mean antibody titers. Milder pathological changes and overall higher titers of PRVC IgA antibodies were observed in 3-week-old vs. 3-day-old piglets. Additionally, diarrhea was only observed in RV0104 and RV0143 (but not Cowden) inoculated 3-week-old piglets, while levels of serum IL-10 and PRVC IgA antibodies were higher in Cowden inoculated pigs, consistent with the lack of diarrhea. Thus, we confirmed that these current, genetically heterogeneous PRVC strains possess distinct pathobiological characteristics that may contribute to the increased prevalence of PRVC diarrhea in neonatal suckling piglets.","output":"Comparative Sequence Analysis of Historic and Current Porcine Rotavirus C Strains and Their Pathogenesis in 3-Day-Old and 3-Week-Old Piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Greece was identified in February 2020.

The main aim of this study is to assess the impact of social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on these groups. METHODS: A program was implemented in Athens between December 2020 and January 2021 in a sample of PWUD and homeless recruited both in Substitution Treatment Units and the Homeless Shelters. The interview was conducted with a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The study included 303 participants (215 PWUD and 88 homeless individuals (HI)). The mean (SD) age was 49.2 (9.7) and 61.9 (10.2) years for PWUD and HI respectively. Chronic hepatitis C was reported by 33% of PWUD and 1.1% of HI. HIV infection was reported in 9.3% of PWUD. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was reported by 55% and 100% of PWUD and HI respectively; 0.8% of PWUD and 5.7% of HI were found positive. Compliance with individual measures against SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be high (98-100%) during lockdowns. 88.8% and 98.9% of PWUD and HI reported change in the quality life. Feelings of isolation were reported by 46.6% and 11.5% on PWUD and HI, respectively. PWID enrollment in OST programmes during the 1st and 2nd lockdown was 67.1% and 92.9% respectively. OST attendees did not report changes in treatment during lockdowns. Access to hygiene materials was 9.8% and 100% in 1st and 2nd lockdown.

A significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related deaths has been reported for the United States of America and other high-income countries in Europe and Asia, regardless of advanced medical facilities in those countries.

The aim of this study is to examine the CRP response in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and to determine the utility of CRP on admission for predicting inpatient mortality. METHODS: Data were collected between 27 February and 10 June 2020, incorporating two cohorts: the COPE (COVID-19 in Older People) study of 1564 adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to 11 hospital sites (test cohort) and a later validation cohort of 271 patients. Admission CRP was investigated, and finite mixture models were fit to assess the likely underlying distribution. Further, different prognostic thresholds of CRP were analysed in a time-to-mortality Cox regression to determine a cut-off. Bootstrapping was used to compare model performance [Harrell's C statistic and Akaike information criterion (AIC)]. RESULTS: The test and validation cohort distribution of CRP was not affected by age, and mixture models indicated a bimodal distribution. A threshold cut-off of CRP &#8805;40 mg/L performed well to predict mortality (and performed similarly to treating CRP as a linear variable). CONCLUSIONS: The distributional characteristics of CRP indicated an optimal cut-off of &#8805;40 mg/L was associated with mortality.

METHODS: SNAP-Ed staff in Louisiana distributed an electronic survey to potential participants and community partners which asked participants to report their attitudes about behaviors used to slow the spread of COVID-19 and preferences for the delivery of virtual nutrition education. Pearson chi squared tests were used to assess differences in responses across categories of race, age, and SNAP-Ed eligibility. Unadjusted odds ratios were then calculated using logistic regression to evaluate the effects of race, age, and SNAP-Ed eligibility on each dependent variable of interest. Finally, adjusted odds ratios were calculated using a model which included age, eligibility for SNAP-Ed, and race. RESULTS: Of 458 participants, the majority were white (62%), female (91%), aged 18C50 (65%), and eligible for SNAP-Ed (57%). Most agreed with the importance of handwashing (99%), maintaining physical distance (95%), and wearing face masks (79%). African Americans had significantly higher odds of agreeing that it was important to wear a mask compared to white participants, and this did not change in the adjusted model which included SNAP-Ed eligibility and age category (Adjusted OR 15.90 [6.25, 40.4]) African Americans were also more concerned about the risk posed by in-person programming and more likely to report that they would prefer live virtual lessons, online quizzes, and workbooks than white participants.

This paper considers the usage, popularity and spread of these terms, and through backing them with ICT advancement, LMS and Moodle improvements and the time-space-group triangle of elearning, it depicts the viral nature of these narratives. The paper concludes that the use of the terms follows the nature of epidemics. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"ICT-supported Learning: Concepts going viral"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of immunosuppression in SARS-CoV-2-related disease (COVID-19) is a matter of debate.

Patients were followed at our hospital for solid organ transplantation or systemic rheumatic disorders (RMDs) and were on calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based therapy. Selected patients were referred from the North of Italy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical course of COVID-19 in this setting. We evaluated 385 consecutive patients (220 males, 57%; median age 61 years, IQR 48C69); 331 (86%) received solid organ transplantation and 54 (14%) had a RMD. CNIs were the only immunosuppressant administered in 47 patients (12%). We identified 14 (4%) COVID-19 patients, all transplanted, mainly presenting with fever (86%) and diarrhea (71%). Twelve patients were hospitalized and two of them died, both with severe comorbidities. No patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or infectious complications. The surviving 10 patients are now fully recovered. The clinical course of COVID-19 patients on CNIs is generally mild, and the risk of superinfection seems low.","output":"Calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression and COVID-19: Results from a multidisciplinary cohort of patients in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To understand the preference and role of 'hybrid' urological meetings compared to face-to-face and online meetings during and after COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary outcome was finding out the most preferable webinar setting. METHODS: An online global survey was done between June 06 and July 05, 2020, using SurveyMonkey. The target participants were urology healthcare providers. The survey was disseminated via mailing lists and the Twitter platform. RESULTS: A total of 526 urology providers from 56 countries responded to the survey and it was completed by 73.3%. Participants' overall experience was better in a face-to-face meeting, followed by a hybrid and webinar only meeting. While opportunities for networking was identified as high in face-to-face meeting, online webinars were more cost effective, and learning opportunity and reach of audience was higher for hybrid meetings. For online webinar format, Zoom platform was used by 73% and majority (69%) saw it on their laptop or desktop. The preference was for a 1-hour webinar in the evenings with 3-5 speakers. Urology residents rated face-to-face meetings to have better cost-effectiveness when compared to consultants. Post COVID-19, more than half of all respondents would prefer hybrid meetings compared to the other formats. CONCLUSION: While there will be a place for face-to-face meetings, COVID-19 situation has led to a preference towards hybrid meetings which is ideal for a global reach in the future.

Continuous injections needed in some cases are an economic burden for patients/healthcare system, so real-life clinical practice tends to adopt a reactive approach, ie, watch and wait for worsening symptoms, which consequently increases the risk of undertreatment and edema recurrence. On March 7th 2019, a group of experts in retinal medicine and surgery held a roundtable meeting in Madrid, Spain to discuss how to (1) optimize clinical outcomes through earlier use of fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) implant (ILUVIEN(?)) in patients with persistent or recurrent DME despite therapy; and, (2) to provide guidance to assist physicians in deciding which patients should be treated with ILUVIEN. In this regard, a 36-month follow-up consensus protocol is presented. In conclusion, patients that achieve a complete or partial anatomical, and preferably functional, response following one or two intravitreal dexamethasone implants, but with recurrence of edema after 3C4 months, are deemed by the authors most likely to benefit from ILUVIEN, and the switch to FAc implant should not be delayed more than 12 months after the initiation of at least the first dexamethasone implant.","output":"Clinical-Decision Criteria to Identify Recurrent Diabetic Macular Edema Patients Suitable for Fluocinolone Acetonide Implant Therapy (ILUVIEN(?)) and Follow-Up Considerations/Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, connected devices are growing exponen-tially;their produced data traffic has increased unprecedent-edly.

This analysis is inspired by the Guidelines for an Institutional Code of Ethics in Higher Education drawn up by the International Association of Universities and the Magna Charta Observatory. These Guidelines refer to the principle of solidarity in the context of international cooperation between higher education institutions. However, the author of this paper believes that this principle might also be used in a broader academic context, in particular, in the field of academic ethics and academic integrity. Therefore, this paper aims at revealing the relevance of solidarity in academia and argues that the principle of solidarity can be considered as one of fundamental principles of academic ethics and should be reflected in the structure and provisions of the codes of academic ethics (conduct). For this purpose the author explores the philosophical and sociological approaches towards solidarity and defines the concept of academic solidarity, discusses the conceptual connection between academic solidarity, ethics and integrity and illustrates the impact of solidarity on the development of academic integrity. This analysis allows the author of the paper to recommend embedding the principle of solidarity in the codes of academic ethics of higher education institutions as well as extending the scope of its application by linking the rights and responsibilities of different groups within the academic community in a way that best expresses their unity, shared responsibility, mutual support in meeting the standards of social ethos.","output":"Solidarity in Academia and its Relationship to Academic Integrity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent pandemic SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affects all kinds of individuals worldwide.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with fully myeloablative conditioning may be curative but has been associated with poor outcomes. Reports of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and reduced-toxicity conditioning (RTC) regimens suggest these approaches are well tolerated, but outcomes are not well established. Retrospective data were collected from an international cohort of 40 patients with XIAP deficiency who underwent HCT with RIC or RTC. Thirty-three (83%) patients had a history of HLH, and thirteen (33%) patients had IBD. Median age at HCT was 6.5 years. Grafts were from HLA-matched (n = 30, 75%) and HLA-mismatched (n = 10, 25%) donors. There were no cases of primary graft failure. Two (5%) patients experienced secondary graft failure, and three (8%) patients ultimately received a second HCT. Nine (23%) patients developed grade IICIV acute GVHD, and 3 (8%) developed extensive chronic GVHD. The estimated 2-year overall and event-free survival rates were 74% (CI 55C86%) and 64% (CI 46C77%), respectively. Recipient and donor HLA mismatch and grade IICIV acute GVHD were negatively associated with survival on multivariate analysis with hazard ratios of 5.8 (CI 1.5C23.3, p = 0.01) and 8.2 (CI 2.1C32.7, p < 0.01), respectively.

To improve the stability and purity of synthesized RNA we had characterized a novel single-subunit RNA polymerase (RNAP) encoded by a psychrophilic phage VSW-3 from plateau lake to produce RNA at low temperature. The VSW-3 RNAP is capable of carrying out in vitro RNA synthesis at low temperature (4-25C) to reduce RNA degradation and alleviate the need of costly RNase inhibitor. Compared to routinely used T7 RNAP, VSW-3 RNAP provides comparable yield of transcripts, but is insensitive to class II transcription terminators and synthesizes RNA without redundant 3 -cis extension. More importantly, through dot-blot detection with the J2 monoclonal antibody, we found that the RNA products synthesized by VSW-3 RNAP contain much lower amount of or virtually no double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by-products, which are significant in most T7 RNAP products and may cause severe cellular immune response.

METHODS: An internet-based questionnaire survey was conducted, covering all 47 prefectures in Japan and including a total of 1476 households. The social contact matrix was quantified assuming reciprocity and using the maximum likelihood method. By imposing several parametric assumptions for the next-generation matrix, the empirical seroepidemiological data of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 was analysed and we estimated the basic reproduction number, R(0). RESULTS: In total, the reported number of contacts on weekdays was 10,682 whereas that on weekend days was 8867. Strong age-dependent assortativity was identified. Forty percent of weekday contacts took place at schools or workplaces, but that declined to 14% on weekends. Accounting for the age-dependent heterogeneity with the known social contact matrix, the minimum value of the Akaike information criterion was obtained and R(0) was estimated at 1.45 (95% confidence interval: 1.42, 1.49).

Here we present a systematic study on the growth parameters and post-growth annealing of SESAMs based on high-quality InxGa1-xAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) grown by MBE at growth temperatures of 450 C or higher. The good quality enables the QDs to survive the long DBR overgrowth at 600 C with only minimal shifts in the designed operation wavelength of 1030 nm required for growth of MIXSEL devices. The introduction of recombination centers with p-type modulation doping and additional post-growth annealing improves the absorption of the high-quality QDs. Hence, low saturation fluences < 10 J/cm2 and a reduction of the 1/e recovery time to values < 2 ps can be achieved.","output":"Temperature resistant fast InxGa1-xAs / GaAs quantum dot saturable absorber for the epitaxial integration into semiconductor surface emitting lasers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence has demonstrated the mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies have examined how pandemic-related stressors and resilience factors of anxiety affect women and men differently in Canada. METHODS: Population-based data from the Canadian Perspective Survey Series (CPSS-4: July 20 to 26, 2020) were analyzed to examine the relationship between Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7) with COVID-19 misinformation exposure, precarious employment, and health behavior changes, after adjusting for socio-demographic variables. Stratified by gender, two multinomial logistic regression were conducted to calculate the likelihood of having minimalCmild anxiety (1 GAD score <10) and moderateCsevere anxiety (GAD score 10), compared to no anxiety symptoms (GAD=0). RESULTS: Overall, respondents (n = 3,779) were mainly Canadian-born (76.3%), aged >25 years (85.4%) and high school graduate (87.9%). The population prevalence of moderateCsevere GAD was 13.6%, with women significantly higher than men (17.2% vs. 9.9%, p<0.001). For women (n = 2,016), GAD was associated with being absent from work due to COVID-19 reasons (OR=3.52, 99% CI:1.12C11.04), younger age (ORs range from 2.19 to 11.01, p's<0.01), being single/widowed (OR=2.26, 99% CI 1.18C4.33), no past-week contacts outside household (OR=2.81, 99% CI:1.24C6.37), no outdoor exercise (OR=1.86, 99% CI:1.13C3.07). For men (n = 1,753), GAD was associated with frequent fake news exposure (dose-response relations: ORs range from 3.14 to 6.55, p's<0.01), increased time of watching TV (OR=2.62, 99% CI: 1.31 C 5.27), no indoor exercise (OR=1.91, 99% CI:1.07C3.42). For both genders, GAD was associated with increased intake of alcohol, cannabis, and junk/sweet food (p's<0.01). LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional data prohibits causal inferences; self-reporting biases of GAD symptoms requires confirmation with diagnostic records. CONCLUSION: The gendered impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was observed in the associations between clinically significant anxiety with COVID-19 misinformation exposure, job precarity, and addictive behaviors in Canada. Mental health interventions need to be gender responsive and should tackle upstream social determinants of health in this public health emergency.","output":"Generalized anxiety disorder during COVID-19 in Canada: Gender-specific association of COVID-19 misinformation exposure, precarious employment, and health behavior change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To describe the most outstanding aspects in children and adolescents with acute symptomatic crisis or diagnosis of epilepsy in times of the COVID-19 pandemic Methods: The information was collected in PubMed/Medline, Scielo and Clinical Key databases using the keywords included in the Descriptor of Health Sciences in English or Spanish language, with not time limit, and looking for all kind of publications There were selected articles related to epilepsy, epileptic seizures and COVID-19 Results: In the consulted literature, it was justified the occurrence of epileptic seizures due to different causes in patients with COVID-19 and it is highlighted the therapeutic behaviour and the need of surveillance of the pharmacologic interactions among the drugs indicated for the prevention of epileptic seizures and the specific of this new disease Based in these precepts, we present a final proposal for the behaviour to follow in each situation Final considerations: It is proved the possibility of neurologic complications in patients with COVID-19 and specifically in the epileptic seizures and epilepsy The use of interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir, in case of being indicated in the action protocols, and to keep the previous treatment with the drugs to prevent the recurrence of crisis in epileptic patients considering the possible interactions and the required surveillance in each case, seems to be the best option in most of the children and adolescents with COVID-19 ? 2020, Editorial Ciencias Medicas All rights reserved","output":"Acute symptomatic crisis and epilepsy in children and adolescents in times of covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus(COVID-19) has created havoc for humanity by causing millions of deaths, adverse effects on physical and mental health and disastrous economic destruction.

Black and Latinx respondents engaged in several prevention behaviors, including social distancing, to a greater extent than White respondents. There were indirect effects of Black vs. White race on engaging in protective behaviors through greater perceived risk to others and beliefs in the importance of protecting distal others. Results indicate that targeted messages promoting prevention, including vaccination with pro-social messages, may resonate with communities of color.

With 17% of the global population, the African continent has an equivalent of 5% of the global confirmed cases and nearly 3% of fatalities. Although COVID-19 infections are at a minimal level in Africa, the similarities of COVID-19 with several other infections could mask accurate reporting of infections and associated deaths. In this correspondence, we sought to share our views on these and strategies for the improvement of reporting COVID-19 related deaths in the African context. Occasional interruption of the testing activity due to shortage of human and material resources has masked the true reflection of COVID-19 infection rates and associated deaths. Diagnosis and contact tracing of COVID-19 positives have been faced with many challenges on the African continent. In addition, incomplete data capture of COVID-19 deaths could impede the planning and implementation of policies which are needed in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, proper coordination and intensified efforts during the COVID-19 outbreak response are required to ensure complete documentation of COVID-19-related deaths.

We showed previously that rotaviruses block gene expression induced by type I and II IFNs, through a mechanism allowing activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2 but preventing their nuclear accumulation. This normally occurs through activated STAT1/2 dimerization, enabling an interaction with importin 5 that mediates transport into the nucleus. In rotavirus-infected cells, STAT1/2 inhibition may limit the antiviral actions of IFN produced early in infection. Here we further analysed the block to STAT1/2 nuclear accumulation, showing that activated STAT1 accumulates in the cytoplasm in rotavirus-infected cells. STAT1/2 nuclear accumulation was inhibited by rotavirus even in the presence of the nuclear export inhibitor Leptomycin B, demonstrating that enhanced nuclear export is not involved in STAT1/2 cytoplasmic retention. The ability to inhibit STAT nuclear translocation was completely conserved amongst the group A rotaviruses tested, including a divergent avian strain. Analysis of mutant rotaviruses indicated that residues after amino acid 47 of NSP1 are dispensable for STAT inhibition. Furthermore, expression of any of the 12 Rhesus monkey rotavirus proteins did not inhibit IFN-stimulated STAT1 nuclear translocation. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments from transfected epithelial cells showed that STAT1/2 binds importin 5 normally following rotavirus infection. These findings demonstrate that rotavirus probably employs a novel strategy to inhibit IFN-induced STAT signalling, which acts after STAT activation and binding to the nuclear import machinery.","output":"Rotavirus inhibits IFN-induced STAT nuclear translocation by a mechanism that acts after STAT binding to importin-."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The delivery of health care by primary care general practices rapidly changed in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in early 2020. AIM This study explores the experience of a large group of New Zealand general practice health-care professionals with changes to prescribing medication during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We qualitatively analysed a subtheme on prescribing medication from the General Practice Pandemic Experience New Zealand (GPPENZ) study, where general practice team members nationwide were invited to participate in five surveys over 16 weeks from 8 May 2020. RESULTS Overall, 78 (48%) of 164 participants enrolled in the study completed all surveys. Five themes were identified: changes to prescribing medicines; benefits of electronic prescription; technical challenges; clinical and medication supply challenges; and opportunities for the future. There was a rapid adoption of electronic prescribing as an adjunct to use of telehealth, minimising in-person consultations and paper prescription handling. Many found electronic prescribing an efficient and streamlined processes, whereas others had technical barriers and transmission to pharmacies was unreliable with sometimes incompatible systems. There was initially increased demand for repeat medications, and at the same time, concern that vulnerable patients did not have usual access to medication. The benefits of innovation at a time of crisis were recognised and respondents were optimistic that e-prescribing technical challenges could be resolved. DISCUSSION Improving e-prescribing technology between prescribers and dispensers, initiatives to maintain access to medication, particularly for vulnerable populations, and permanent regulatory changes will help patients continue to access their medications through future pandemic disruption.","output":"'Here to stay': changes to prescribing medication in general practice during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was identified and quickly developed into a pandemic in spring, 2020.

Zoom sessions were recorded and transcribed. Content analysis was used to identify themes. RESULTS: In all, 38 IPs who work at a critical access hospital or a healthcare facility in a rural location participated. Major challenges identified by IPs in this study included addressing the lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE), overwhelming workloads caused by the pandemic and multiple roles/responsibilities, inaccurate social media messages, and generalized disbelief and disregard about the pandemic among rural community members. CONCLUSIONS: Gaps in preparedness identified in this study, such as the lack of PPE, need to be addressed to prevent occupational illness. In addition, health disparities and inaccurate beliefs about COVID-19 heard by IPs in this study need to be addressed in order to increase compliance with public health safeguards among rural community members and minimize morbidity and mortality in these regions.","output":"Rural infection preventionists experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from focus groups conducted with association of professionals in infection control & epidemiology (APIC) members"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycoplasma genitalium and M. pneumoniae are two significant mycoplasmas that infect the urogenital and respiratory tracts of humans.

To gain insights on this, we infected HeLa cells independently with M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae and assessed gene expression by whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. The results revealed that HeLa cells respond to M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae differently by regulating various protein-coding genes. Though there is a significant overlap between the genes regulated by these species, many of the differentially expressed genes were specific to each species. KEGG pathway and signaling network analyses revealed that the genes specific to M. genitalium are more related to cellular processes. In contrast, the genes specific to M. pneumoniae infection are correlated with immune response and inflammation, possibly suggesting that M. pneumoniae has some inherent ability to modulate host immune pathways.","output":"Mycoplasma genitalium and M. pneumoniae Regulate a Distinct Set of Protein-Coding Genes in Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, an effective therapeutic treatment for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) remains elusive. PRRSV helicase nsp10 is an important component of the replication transcription complex that plays a crucial role in viral replication, making nsp10 an important target for drug development. Here, we report the first crystal structure of full-length nsp10 from the arterivirus PRRSV, which has multiple domains: an N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD), a 1B domain, and helicase core domains 1A and 2A. Importantly, our structural analyses indicate that the conformation of the 1B domain from arterivirus nsp10 undergoes a dynamic transition. The polynucleotide substrate channel formed by domains 1A and 1B adopts an open state, which may create enough space to accommodate and bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during unwinding. Moreover, we report a unique C-terminal domain structure that participates in stabilizing the overall helicase structure. Our biochemical experiments also showed that deletion of the 1B domain and C-terminal domain significantly reduced the helicase activity of nsp10, indicating that the four domains must cooperate to contribute to helicase function. In addition, our results indicate that nidoviruses contain a conserved helicase core domain and key amino acid sites affecting helicase function, which share a common mechanism of helicase translocation and unwinding activity. These findings will help to further our understanding of the mechanism of helicase function and provide new targets for the development of antiviral drugs.IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major respiratory disease agent in pigs that causes enormous economic losses to the global swine industry.

Our results show that the 1B domain of PRRSV nsp10 adopts a novel open state and has a unique C-terminal domain structure, which plays a crucial role in nsp10 helicase activity. Furthermore, mutagenesis and structural analysis revealed conservation of the helicase catalytic domain across the order Nidovirales (families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae).

We provide an updated analysis on the financial impact of pediatric fellowship training and model interventions that can influence the results. METHODS We estimated the financial returns a graduating pediatric resident might anticipate from fellowship training followed by a career as a pediatric subspecialist and compared them with the returns expected from starting a career as a general pediatrician immediately after residency. We evaluated the potential effects of eliminating medical school debt, shortening the length of fellowship training, and implementing a federal loan repayment program for pediatric subspecialists. We compared the financial returns of subspecialty training in 2018-2019 to those from our previous report. RESULTS Pursuing fellowship training generated widely variable financial returns when compared with general pediatrics that ranged from +$852 129 for cardiology to -$1 594 366 for adolescent medicine. Twelve of 15 subspecialties analyzed yielded negative financial returns. The differences have become more pronounced over time: the spread between the highest and lowest earning subspecialties widened from >$1.4 million in 2007-2008 to >$2.3 million in 2018-2019. The negative financial impact of fellowship training could be partially ameliorated by shortening the length of training or by implementing pediatric subspecialist specific loan repayment programs.

In contrast, a desire to close ranks within the national ingroup in the face of the pandemic threat was associated with more prosocial intentions towards national ingroup targets only, but it was associated with fewer prosocial intentions towards outgroup targets. This suggests that a focus on global solidarity (in the form of global common fate and identification with all humans) has positive effects on helping both within and across group boundaries, whereas a focus on national solidarity (in the form of closing ranks in the face of the pandemic threat) has positive effects on helping within the national group but negative effects on prosocial tendencies towards outgroup members.

When occurring, bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on the mesh surface affect the implant's tissue integration and host tissue regeneration, making preventive measures to control prosthetic infection a major goal of prosthetic mesh improvement. METHODS This article reviews the literature on the infection of prosthetic meshes used in hernia repair to describe the in vitro and in vivo models used to examine bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on the surface of different biomaterials. Also discussed are the prophylactic measures used to control implant infection ranging from meshes soaked in antibiotics to mesh coatings that release antimicrobial agents in a controlled manner. RESULTS Prosthetic architecture has a direct effect on bacterial adherence and biofilm formation. Absorbable synthetic materials are more prone to bacterial colonization than non-absorbable materials. The reported behavior of collagen biomeshes, also called xenografts, in a contaminated environment has been contradictory, and their use in this setting needs further clinical investigation. New prophylactic mesh designs include surface modifications with an anti-adhesive substance or pre-treatment with antibacterial agents or metal coatings. CONCLUSIONS The use of polymer coatings that slowly release non-antibiotic drugs seems to be a good strategy to prevent implant contamination and reduce the onset of resistant bacterial strains. Even though the prophylactic designs described in this review are mainly focused on hernia repair meshes, these strategies can be extrapolated to other implantable devices, regardless of their design, shape or dimension.","output":"Mesh Infection and Hernia Repair: A Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In this study, we propose an Artificial Intelligence framework based on 3D Convolutional Neural network (CNN) to classify CT scans of patients with COVID-19, Influenza/CAP, and no-infection, after automatic segmentation of the lungs and lung abnormalities.

Carnivore protoparvoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses, followed by CanineCV and CAdV. All the wolves tested positive for at least one of the DNA viruses screened, and 47.8% of the subjects were coinfected with two or three viruses. From viral sequences analysis, close correlations emerged between the viruses identified in the wolves and those circulating in domestic dogs, suggesting that the same viruses infect wolves and domestic dogs. Further studies are needed to investigate if pathogens are transmitted between the two species. ABSTRACT: In this study, internal organs (tongue, intestine, and spleen) of 23 free-ranging Italian wolves (Canis lupus italicus) found dead between 2017 and 2019 were tested for Carnivore protoparvovirus 1, Canine adenovirus (CAdV), and Canine circovirus (CanineCV) using real-time PCR assays. Genetic characterisation of the identified viruses was carried out by amplification, sequencing, and analysis of the complete viral genome or informative viral genes. All the wolves tested positive for at least one of the DNA viruses screened, and 11/23 were coinfected. Carnivore protoparvoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses (21/23), followed by CanineCV (11/23) and CAdV (4/23). From the analysis of the partial VP2 gene of 13 carnivore protoparvoviruses, 12 were canine parvovirus type 2b, closely related to the strains detected in dogs and wild carnivores from Italy, and one was a feline panleukopenia-like virus. Of the four CAdV identified, two were CAdV-1 and two were CAdV-2. The complete genome of seven CanineCVs was sequenced and related to the CanineCV identified in dogs, wolves, and foxes worldwide. Close correlations emerged between the viruses identified in wolves and those circulating in domestic dogs. Further studies are needed to investigate if these pathogens may be potentially cross-transmitted between the two species.","output":"Integrated Use of Molecular Techniques to Detect and Genetically Characterise DNA Viruses in Italian Wolves (Canis lupus italicus)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few therapeutic specialty molecules from in vitro cultures beyond paclitaxel have come to market and although other more complex products like ginseng have also appeared, success has been limited. Often it is not the science that is limiting, but rather regulatory issues that limit considerations of potential products mainly because of costs in getting the product to market. Here we discuss broader thinking of such specialty molecules in the form of dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, herbal medicines, botanical drugs, and pure molecules along with potential complex products from a regulatory standpoint and especially within the realm of approved botanical drugs, e.g., Veregen and Fulyzaq, that have new drug applications (NDAs).

Early prehospital identification of stroke and triage to the right level of care may result in more patients receiving acute treatment. Quality of communication between paramedics and the stroke centre directly affects prehospital on-scene time, emphasising this as a key factor to reduce prehospital delay. Prehospital stroke scales are developed for quick and easy identification of stroke, but have poor sensitivity and specificity compared to an in-hospital assessment with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The aim of the Paramedic Norwegian Acute Stroke Prehospital Project (ParaNASPP) is to assess whether a structured learning program, prehospital NIHSS and a mobile application facilitating communication with the stroke physician may improve triage of acute stroke patients. METHODS: A stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled intervention design will be used in this trial in Oslo, Norway. Paramedics at five ambulance stations will enrol adult patients with suspected stroke within 24 h of symptom onset. All paramedics will begin in a control phase with standard procedures. Through an e-learning program and practical training, a random and sequential switch to the intervention phase takes place. A mobile application for NIHSS scoring, including vital patient information for treatment decisions, transferring data from paramedics to the on-call stroke physician at the Stroke Unit at Oslo University Hospital, will be provided for the intervention. The primary outcome measure is positive predictive value (PPV) for prehospital identification of patients with acute stroke defined as the proportion of patients accepted for stroke evaluation and discharged with a final stroke diagnosis. One thousand three hundred patients provide a 50% surplus to the 808 patients needed for 80% power to detect a 10% increase in PPV. DISCUSSION: Structured and digital communication using a common scale like NIHSS may result in increased probability for better identification of stroke patients and less stroke mimics delivered to a stroke team for acute diagnostics and treatment in our population.

The Act mandates requests, instructions and orders for business suspension and shortened business hours, as well as stay-at-home requests. These measures limit freedom of movement and establishment, guaranteed rights under the Japanese Constitution. This article poses the following research question: Does the Japanese Constitution allow measures against COVID-19 such as requests, instructions and orders for business suspension and shortened business hours, and stay-at-home requests? It also asks: Are measures with penalties allowed by the Constitution? given the fact that the penalties were introduced in February 2021. This paper introduces constitutional concepts that guarantee or limit individual freedom. Concepts that guarantee individual freedoms include freedom of establishment and movement. These freedoms derive from the constitutional values of freedom to choose ones occupation and choose and change ones residence (Art. 22) and the right to own or hold property (Art. 29). Concepts that limit individual freedom include the right to life (Art. 13), welfare rights and public health (Art. 25), and public welfare (Art. 13). Individual freedom that threatens right to life, welfare rights and public health, and public welfare may not be guaranteed. This paper argues that the Constitution allows the measures against COVID-19 limiting freedom of establishment and movement from the perspectives of the right to life, welfare rights, public health, and public welfare, and the government is responsible for reducing the risk to life from COVID-19. It also argues that the Constitution permits measures with penalties, while proportionality needs to be considered.","output":"COVID-19ߤձϤ˘أͥե륨󥶵Ȍ؄e÷Ŀ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New York City (NYC) was in the eye of the COVID-19 pandemic storm in the spring of 2020.

However, contamination incidents from unauthorized GM rice varieties have been encountered. To date, no GM rice crop has been authorized for consumption and/or commercialization in Korea. Therefore, to enhance safety management of unauthorized genetically modified organisms (GMOs), accurate and reliable detection methods are needed to identify GMOs in crops or products. In this study, we developed rapid detection methods for GM rice events (Bt63, KMD1, Kefeng6, Kefeng8, and LLRice62) using ultra-fast PCR system. Ultra-fast PCR is a state-of-the-art technology and decreases PCR run-times dramatically. However, the ultra-fast PCR is not widely used in GMO analysis. Thus, we designed a detection method for five events of GM rice and confirmed them by performing specificity, sensitivity, and applicability assays. All results demonstrate that the ultra-fast PCR system is a specific, sensitive, and reliable method to identify and monitor GM rice events. Additionally, it can be utilized as a rapid and simple method for GMO analysis in crops or processed products. This study can be used as a reference for future research on new analysis methods of unauthorized GMOs.","output":"Development of a rapid detection method for genetically modified rice using the ultra-fast PCR system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Podocyte injury has recently been described as unifying feature in idiopathic nephrotic syndromes (INS). Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection represents a unique RNA virus-induced renal disease with significant proteinuria. The underlying pathomechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that PUUV infection results in podocyte injury, similar to findings in INS. We therefore analyzed standard markers of glomerular proteinuria (e.g. immunoglobulin G [IgG]), urinary nephrin excretion (podocyte injury) and serum levels of the soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a proposed pathomechanically involved molecule in INS, in PUUV-infected patients. Hantavirus patients showed significantly increased urinary nephrin, IgG and serum suPAR concentrations compared to healthy controls. Nephrin and IgG levels were significantly higher in patients with severe proteinuria than with mild proteinuria, and nephrin correlated strongly with biomarkers of glomerular proteinuria over time. Congruently, electron microcopy analyses showed a focal podocyte foot process effacement. suPAR correlated significantly with urinary nephrin, IgG and albumin levels, suggesting suPAR as a pathophysiological mediator in podocyte dysfunction. In contrast to INS, proteinuria recovered autonomously in hantavirus patients. This study reveals podocyte injury as main cause of proteinuria in hantavirus patients.

Many health promotion projects focus on increasing physical activity among their respective target groups. However, because they are mostly developed and implemented under laboratory conditions, they fail when being scaled to real-world settings. The community-based participatory research projects BIG and GESTALT have demonstrated their effectiveness regarding the physical activity promotion in real-world settings by employing a participatory method. MATERIAL AND ANALYSIS: Within the context of the BIG-5 and GET-10 projects, these previously implemented and tested participatory projects are scaled to 15 additional settings in Bavaria, Germany. By applying an overarching mixed-methods evaluation framework, the aim is to gain insights into a) the recruitment of communities for scale-up; b) the specific results of the projects according to the RE-AIM framework. In the recruitment of communities, standardized information on the first contact, the consultation process, the person in charge, and previously implemented health promotion projects are collected. A systematic web search will complete information on each community and their health promotion activities. Results will be compared with information on those communities most in need, here according to the deprivation index of communities in Bavaria, Germany. The scale-up process and its results will be measured using semi-structured interviews with project coordinators. A standardized questionnaire will be used with the course's participants. Applying the RE-AIM framework, the collected data will be analyzed deductively. DISCUSSION: We expect the results to be highly relevant for the effective scale-up of any health promotion project. The study will enhance the understanding of how to reach those communities most in need of health promotion projects and will identify the barriers coordinators face in reaching socially disadvantaged groups. CONCLUSION: Although participatory projects are often used as individual projects, little is known about the scaling up of participatory health promotion projects. This cross-cutting evaluation of two projects aims at producing data on the barriers and facilitators for the reach of settings most in need, and those success factors for a durable implementation.","output":"Scaling Up Physical Activity Promotion Projects on the Community Level for Women in Difficult Life Situations and Older People: BIG-5 and GET-10A Study Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multi-time scale surface water extent (SWE) dynamics are very important to understand climate change impacts on water resources. With Landsat 5/7/8 images and Google Earth Engine (GEE), an improved threshold-based water extraction algorithm and a novel surface water gaps (SWGs) interpolation method based on historical water frequency were applied to build surface water area (SWA, namely SWE without ice) and water body area (WBA, namely SWE with ice) monthly (January 2001-December 2019) and annual (1986-2019) time series in the upper reaches of the Yellow River (UYR). The Mann-Kendall test was used to analyse SWE trends, and the ridge regression was performed to figure out the relative contributions of meteorological factors to SWE dynamics. The pixels with modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) higher than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were identified as SWE. The mean relative error (MRE) of the SWGs interpolation results was below 10%. At the annual scale, the average SWA and number of lakes over 1 ha showed significant upward trends of 4.4 km2 yr-1 and 7.53 yr-1, respectively. The monthly WBA increased in summer and autumn while decreased in spring and winter. The maximum freezing and thawing ratios were 53.74% in December and 37.32% in May, respectively.

In this setting, apoptosis (programmed cell death) and necrosis may operate on a continuum. Because the latter is characterized by the loss of sarcolemmal integrity, we propose that an appropriately labeled tracer directed at a ubiquitously present intracellular moiety would allow non-invasive definition of cardiomyocyte necrosis. A trivalent arsenic peptide, GSAO (4-(N-(S-glutathionylacetyl)amino)phenylarsonous acid), is capable of binding to intracellular dithiol molecules such as HSP90 and filamin-A. Since GSAO is membrane impermeable and dithiol molecules abundantly present intracellularly, we propose that myocardial localization would represent sarcolemmal disruption or necrotic cell death. In rabbit and mouse models of myocardial infarction and post-infarct heart failure, we employed In-111-labelled GSAO for noninvasive radionuclide molecular imaging.

Separately for the BIO-RESORT and BIONYX trials, we assessed the 2-year clinical outcomes of diabetic patients, treated with various contemporary drug-eluting stents (DES). METHODS: We performed two prespecified secondary analyses of two randomized DES trials, which both stratified for diabetes. The main endpoint was target vessel failure (TVF), a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization.

The lung disease was complicated by SARS-COV-2 related pneumonitis in April 2020 and that led to treatment challenges. She was previously seen in multiple private hospitals and labelled as Rheumatoid arthritis. She was being treated with long term steroids and Methotrexate. After her initial presentation to our Rheumatology services, her diagnosis was correctly revised to Systemic Sclerosis with phenotype of CREST. Her treatment was adjusted to Vasodilators and Mycophenolate due to skin and Lung involvement. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: This is a case of 40-year-old Pakistani female who had been having multiple joint pains since 2010. She also experienced severe Raynauds. She presented to our Rheumatology clinic in December 2018. Her symptoms included recurrent digital ulcers, tight and tough skin at fingers and Raynauds worse during winter months. Her examination confirmed peripheral cyanosis with multiple digital ulcers with superimposed infection, marked sclerodactyly and calcinosis. She was started on Vasodilator therapy including calcium channel blocker and PDE5 inhibitor due to severity of ulceration. Infection was managed with prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy. Her immunology showed positive anti nRNP/Sm. Anti-centromere and anti Scl 70 were negative. Her condition fit description of CREST (Calcinosis, RP, Oesophageal dysmotility, telangiectasia). Her management included weaning off Methotrexate and reduction in the dose of corticosteroids. In February 2019, Respiratory work up showed normal Chest radiograph, High resolution CT chest showing no significant abnormality and FEV1 82%, FVC 86%, and DLCO 77%. Her PASP was 25mmHg. Overall, her condition remained stable over the course of next year. Her medication included Cellcept, low dose prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine, and Sildenafil. More importantly, Digital ulcers have been well controlled with combined vasodilator therapy. In April 2020, she developed SARS-CoV-2 with mild respiratory symptoms and was admitted to a different hospital. Fortunately, she responded well to ward based supportive and symptomatic treatment with no need for respiratory support. Subsequently, she has seen a different respiratory physician and had repeat imaging of chest which has led to dilemma whether the ground glass opacities in both lungs is due to scleroderma lung or COVID-19 related lung disease. She was given high dose prednisolone by the respiratory physician which has been reduced in rheumatology clinic. The new findings on chest imaging are sequelae of SARS-COV-2. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: 1. Systemic sclerosis diagnosis was not made for many years even though she has had severe digital ulcers for a long time. She was being managed as Rheumatoid arthritis. Systemic sclerosis remains a difficult disease to diagnose and is still under recognised. . 2. SARS-COV-2 related illness has not affected this patient adversely despite the fact of being on long term maintenance prednisolone of 7.5mg daily dose and Cellcept 2gm. Her cellcept was temporarily stopped during acute illness. . 3. We know that viral pneumonitis can present with typical ground glass opacities in bilateral areas of lungs and differential diagnosis does include connective tissue related lung disease but this lady had no significant respiratory involvement prior to COVID-19 illness and follow up scan will help to decide if this is disease progression or related to viral cause. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: 1. Continuity of care under same primary team can avoid confusion related to diagnosis and diagnosis related complications. This lady had none, or mild subclinical lung involvement related to systemic sclerosis prior to contracting COVID-19 illness. Her CT chest findings after the episode of SARS-COV-2 were attributed to systemic sclerosis as she was seen by different respiratory team. This continuity is not always possible, but MDT collaboration needs to be improved across hospitals and across various departments. . 2. Systemic sclerosis remains an under diagnosed and under recognized complex rheumatic disorder and more primary care physicians need to be educated so they can appropriately refer these cases to Rheumatology services. 3. Multi-disciplinary collaboration between Rheumatology, Respiratory and other specialties is the key point to manage these complex cases. . 4. This case also highlights an interesting observation that presence of significant immune disorder and immunosuppressant medication does not always equate to worse outcome if patient contracts SARS-COV-2. Supportive care, appropriate observation, and temporary suspension of DMARD in such cases can avoid any further complications.","output":"EP04 Is this scleroderma lung or COVID-19 lung?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The HIV/AIDS pandemic has struck regions, countries, and populations in different ways. With the introduction of antiretroviral drugs, people living with HIV (PLHIV) have a much better prognosis, even though there are still many new infections in young women. The role of widespread antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the incidence of HIV in young women is unknown. METHODS We will conduct a comprehensive search of MEDLINE (PubMed), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), World Health Organization's (WHO's) library database, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), conference abstracts, and gray literature sources to identify any relevant literature. We will include randomized and non-randomized clinical trials and cohort studies in which ART was offered to adults aged 18 and above reporting outcomes in females aged 15 to 24 years. The outcomes of interest are HIV incidence, ART initiation, adherence, retention, and viral load suppression. We will screen titles, abstracts, and the full texts of relevant articles in duplicate. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus. We will extract data on the risk of HIV infection in younger females after the use of ART in the adult population. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to look at the impact of ART use among adults on HIV incidence in young women. The results of this review will be used in a modeling study to simulate the effects of using ART as an effective tool to prevent sexual transmission of HIV to young women.

This viral infection causes acute diarrhea leading to death. Rapid identification of infected calves is essential to control BRV successfully. Therefore development of simple, highly specific, and sensitive detection method for BRV is needed. RESULTS: A reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed and optimized for rapid detection of BRV. Specific primer sets were designed to target the sequences of the VP6 gene of the neonatal calf diarrhea virus (NCDV) strain of BRV. The RT-LAMP assay was performed in a water bath for 60 minutes at 63C, and the amplification products were visualized either directly or under ultraviolet light. This BRV specific RT-LAMP assay could detect 3.32 copies of subtype A BRV. No cross-reactions were detected with other bovine pathogens. The ability of RT-LAMP to detect bovine rotavirus was further evaluated with 88 bovine rectal swab samples. Twenty-nine of these samples were found to be positive for BRV using RT-LAMP. The BRV-specific-RT-LAMP results were also confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assay.

During the pandemic, charitable donations have been made by the public, aimed at helping medical staff. Based on the open data, we investigate the charitable in-kind donations received by a large medical center in northern Taiwan (Taipei Veterans General Hospital [TPEVGH]) in Taiwan during the pandemic. METHODS: The period of investigation was the first half of the year 2020. TPEVGH has received various public donations. The list of donations published on the hospital's official website was analyzed. The variables in the analysis were donation category, donation percentage, number of donations, and total donation amount. RESULTS: Most in-kind donations were food and beverages (55.1%), with a monetary value of 3 124 510 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) (24.3%). Medical equipment accounted for the second-highest number of items (34.8%) but was the highest monetary value (70.6%; 9 275 945 of 12 875 855 NTD). Daily necessities accounted for the lowest number of items (10.1%) and had a total monetary value of 475 400 NTD (3.7%). Over two-thirds were beverages (68.4%), all of which were bottles or cans for easy storage. Despite only five items (13.2%) being juice, the donation size was the largest, accounting for nearly half (47.1%) of the total monetary value. Only one item was fruit, which was high-class organic apples. The monetary value of this item was the highest (7.8%) among all donated food. Most donated snacks were biscuits. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most public donations to TPEVGH were food and daily necessities. While every donation should be appreciated, accepting high volumes of donations might incur donation management problems. Further research could be focused on managerial aspects, for example, quality and safety checking, storage, and distribution.","output":"In-kind donations to healthcare facilities during COVID-19: Experiences from a large medical center in northern Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brady et al discuss the navigation of client relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic The impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are vast, touching multiple areas of people's lives and finances During volatile times, it is especially important for financial advisers to actively maintain their client relationships While the pandemic is truly unprecedented, there may be lessons from a recent period of volatility, the financial crisis of 2007--2009, that the financial industry can apply to the current situation During the upheaval of the crisis, many advisers were able to demonstrate their value and retain clients even as they lost wealth as a result of the downturn The value of building trust with clients may be especially important for relationships with older clients Older clients who personally trust their advisers may be more likely to retain their services through stressful life events Right now, people of all ages are looking for trusted sources of advice to help figure out how to navigate the financial upheaval of the pandemic while still working toward their longer-term plans and goals One important component of navigating communication and outreach is understanding that clients' life stages and responsibilities may shape the concerns they have related to COVID-19","output":"Navigating Client Relationships During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reactivation or reinfection cases of SARS-CoV-2 are known but there is scarce evidence about reactivation in immunocompromised patients.

As a result, the respiratory tract has evolved a variety of innate and adaptive immune defenses in order to prevent viral infection or promote the rapid destruction of infected cells and facilitate the clearance of the infecting virus. Successful adaptive immune responses often lead to a functional state of immune memory, in which memory lymphocytes and circulating antibodies entirely prevent or lessen the severity of subsequent infections with the same virus. This is also the goal of vaccination, although it is difficult to vaccinate in a way that mimics respiratory infection. Consequently, some vaccines lead to robust systemic immune responses, but relatively poor mucosal immune responses that protect the respiratory tract. In addition, adaptive immunity is not without its drawbacks, as overly robust inflammatory responses may lead to lung damage and impair gas exchange or exacerbate other conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Thus, immune responses to respiratory viral infections must be strong enough to eliminate infection, but also have mechanisms to limit damage and promote tissue repair in order to maintain pulmonary homeostasis. Here, we will discuss the components of the adaptive immune system that defend the host against respiratory viral infections.","output":"Pulmonary immunity to viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considerable progress has been made recently in the use of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) to diagnose intra-luminal gastrointestinal lesions and extra-luminal lesions near the gastrointestinal tract.

Although these statistical potentials are not to be confused with their physics-based counterparts of the same namei.e. PMFs obtained by molecular dynamics simulationstheir particular success in assessing the native-like character of protein structure predictions has lead authors to consider the computed scores as approximations of the free energy. However, this physical justification is a matter of controversy since the beginning. Alternative interpretations based on Bayes theorem have been proposed, but the misleading formalism that invokes the inverse Boltzmann law remains recurrent in the literature. In this article, we present a conceptually new method for ranking protein structure models by quality, which is (i) independent of any physics-based explanation and (ii) relevant to statistics and to a general definition of information gain. The theoretical development described in this study provides new insights into how statistical PMFs work, in comparison with our approach. To prove the concept, we have built interatomic distance-dependent scoring functions, based on the former and new equations, and compared their performance on an independent benchmark of 60,000 protein structures. The results demonstrate that our new formalism outperforms statistical PMFs in evaluating the quality of protein structural decoys. Therefore, this original type of score offers a possibility to improve the success of statistical PMFs in the various fields of structural biology where they are applied.

The challenges faced by patients with prolonged COVID-19-related hospitalizations - social isolation, disability, neurologic sequelae, adjustment-related anxiety, depression, and stress - may be mitigated by the novel use of VR as one modality of a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. This descriptive study aimed to understand patient satisfaction and perceived benefit of virtual reality on a COVID-19 recovery unit, as well as the logistical and operational feasibility of providing VR content for patients and staff. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the COVID-19 surge in New York City in 2020, the COVID-19 Recovery Unit (CRU) of a large academic hospital invited patients and staff to participate in VR sessions with three categories of experience: (1) Guided meditation, (2) Exploration of natural environments, (3) Cognitive stimulation games. Patients and staff were surveyed about satisfaction and perceived benefit. RESULTS: 13 patients and 11 staff were surveyed, with median patient satisfaction scores of 9 out of 10, with ten representing \\"extremely satisfied,\\" and median staff satisfaction scores of 10. 13/13 patients answered \\"yes\\" to recommending the therapy to others, and 12/13 answered \\"yes\\" to perceived enhancement of their treatment. 11/11 staff answered \\"yes\\" to recommending the therapy to others, and 11/11 answered \\"yes\\" to perceived enhancement of their wellbeing. DISCUSSION: A VR program implemented on a COVID-19 rehabilitation unit for patients and healthcare providers was rated as highly satisfactory with perceived benefit by survey respondents. Participants commented that the use of VR was useful in coping with isolation and loneliness, and could be implemented within the context of clinical care for COVID-19 patients as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation model. The use of VR was also logistically and operationally feasible on the CRU.

DTMUV is a public health concern because the infection spreads rapidly among birds. Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)serves as an innate immune sensor and plays a key role in host antiviral defenses. Tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is pivotal for RIG-I ubiquitination and activation. In addition, TRIM25 acts as an interferon-stimulated gene and mediates the antiviral activity. However, the effect of duck TRIM25 on DTMUV has not been assessed. Herein, we reportthe antiviral function of TRIM25 against DTMUV. First, we constructed the pcDNA3.1-c-myc-duTRIM25 plasmid. TRIM25 has a 2052 bp open reading frame that encodes a predicted 684 amino acid protein consisting of a RING finger domain, a B-box domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a PRY/SPRY domain. The protein sequence identity with chicken, mouse, and human TRIM25 is 69.7, 47.8, and 48.3%, respectively. TRIM25 was upregulated in BHK-21 cells, duck embryo fibroblasts, and 293T cellsupon DTMUV infection. The expression of viral RNA and proteins was significantly lower in cells over expressing TRIM25 than in control cells. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated silencing of TRIM25 increased the production of viral progeny. These results help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to DTMUV infection and suggest potential control measures for DTMUV outbreaks.","output":"The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase TRIM25 Inhibits Tembusu Virus Replication in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medicinal plants are still the major source of therapies for several illnesses and only part of the herbal products originates from cultivated biomass.

However, due to its stochastic nature, the prediction of solar global horizontal irradiance (GHI) with higher accuracy is a challenging task; but, vital for grid management: planning, scheduling & balancing. Therefore, this paper proposes an ensemble model using the extended scope of wavelet transform (WT) and bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) deep learning network to forecast 24-h ahead solar GHI. The WT decomposes the input time series data into different finite intrinsic model functions (IMF) to extract the statistical features of input time series. Further, the study reduces the number of IMF series by combining the wavelet decomposed components (D1-D6) series on the basis of comprehensive experimental analysis with an aim to improve the forecasting accuracy. Next, the trained standalone BiLSTM networks are allocated to each IMF sub-series to execute the forecasting. Finally, the forecasted values of each sub-series from BiLSTM networks are reconstructed to deliver the final solar GHI forecast. The study performed monthly solar GHI forecasting for one year dataset using one month moving window mechanism for the location of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. For the performance comparison, the na?ve predictor as a benchmark model, standalone long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), BiLSTM and two other wavelet-based BiLSTM models are also simulated. From the results, it is observed that the proposed model outperforms other models in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) & mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R(2)) and forecast skill (FS).

While structural damage to corticospinal pathways in people with CP is known, its impact on the activation of these pathways is not. OBJECTIVE To provide the first, complete activation profile of corticospinal pathways in adults with CP using a full range of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) intensities and voluntary contractions. METHODS TMS targeted the soleus muscle of 16 adults with bilateral spastic CP and 15 neurologically intact (NI) control participants. Activation profiles were generated using motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) produced by varying both stimulation intensity and degree of voluntary muscle activity. Anatomical integrity of corticospinal pathways was also measured with diffusion tractography. RESULTS Participants with CP had smaller MEPs produced by TMS at 1.2 active motor threshold during submaximal (20%) muscle activity and smaller maximal MEPs produced under any combination of stimulation intensity and voluntary muscle activity. At a fixed stimulation intensity, increasing voluntary muscle activity facilitated MEP amplitudes to a lesser degree in the participants with CP. Consistent differences in diffusion tractography suggested structural abnormalities in the corticospinal pathways of participants with CP that correlated with maximal MEPs. CONCLUSION People with bilateral spastic CP have impaired activation of low and high-threshold corticospinal pathways to soleus motoneurons by TMS and reduced facilitation by voluntary activity that may be associated with structural damage to these pathways. These impairments likely contribute to impaired voluntary movement.","output":"Full Activation Profiles and Integrity of Corticospinal Pathways in Adults With Bilateral Spastic Cerebral Palsy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The design of successful online learning systems that attract and sustain students active engagement with their learning activities remains an open question.

The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the virions surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2). Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV) in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of the RBD/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally occurring mutations to the RBD either slightly strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This means that the virus had sufficient binding affinity to its receptor at the beginning of the crisis. This also has implications for any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors.

We hypothesised that public awareness and support for the secondary use of health data and the NDOO would vary by participant demography and healthcare experience. We explored patient/public awareness and perceptions of secondary data use, grouping potential researchers into National Health Service (NHS), academia or commercial. We assessed awareness of the NDOO system amongst patients, carers, healthcare staff and the public. We co-developed recommendations to consider when sharing unconsented health data for research. METHODS: A patient and public engagement program, co-created and including patient and public workshops, questionnaires and discussion groups regarding anonymised health data use. RESULTS: There were 350 participants in total. Central concerns for health data use included unauthorised data re-use, the potential for discrimination and data sharing without patient benefit. 94% of respondents were happy for their data to be used for NHS research, 85% for academic research and 68% by health companies, but less than 50% for non-healthcare companies and opinions varied with demography and participant group. Questionnaires showed that knowledge of the NDOO was low, with 32% of all respondents, 53% of all NHS staff and 29% of all patients aware of the NDOO. Recommendations to guide unconsented secondary health data use included that health data use should benefit patients; data sharing decisions should involve patients/public. That data should remain in close proximity to health services with the principles of data minimisation applied. Further, that there should be transparency in secondary health data use, including publicly available lists of projects, summaries and benefits.

Unfortunately, most patients with rectal cancer are resistant to radiotherapy. This might be a genetic cause. The role of certain rectal cancer-causing genes has not been completely elucidated. This study aims to investigate the genes responsible for locally advanced rectal cancer patients not reacting to radiotherapy. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing of the DNA samples was performed on the samples. Bioinformatic analysis on the subjects was established. Individual genetic information was screened to identify differently expressed genes that more frequently appeared in non-complete response (NCR) compared to complete response (CR) patients after nCRT. All variations were verified by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Genotyping information and pathway analyses of the samples indicated genes such as FLCN, CALML5, and ANTXR1 to be commonly mutated in CR group, whereas genes such as GALNTL14, CNKSR1, ACD, and CUL3 were more commonly mutated in the NCR group. Chi-square test revealed some significant variants (<0.05) such as rs3744124 (FLCN), rs28365986 (ANTXR1), rs10904516 (CALML5), rs3738952 (CUL3), rs13394 and rs2293013 (PIH1D1), rs2274531 (GPA33), rs4963048 (BRSK2), rs17883366 (IL3RA), rs2297575 (PSMD5), rs2288101 (GALNT14), and rs11954652 (DCTN4). CONCLUSION: Identifying an array of genes that separate NCRs from CRs would lead to finding genetic biomarkers for early detection of rectal cancer patients that are resistant to nCRT. A further investigation to validate the significance of genetic biomarkers to segregate NCRs from CRs should be performed with a larger CRC dataset. Protein expression levels, as well as transcriptomic analysis, would also help us understand the mechanism of how these genes could play a role in preventing radiation therapy to patients.

This viral disease is known to infect the respiratory system, eventually leading to pneumonia. Crystallographic studies of the viral structure reveal its mechanism of infection as well as active binding sites and the druggable targets as scope for treatment of COVID-19. HYPOTHESIS: The role of tea polyphenols in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 was established in this study. STUDY DESIGN: Molecular docking interactions of tea polyphenols with some of the possible binding sites of SARS-CoV-2 were performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From various studies on the SARS-CoV-2 reported in the literature, we chose possible drug targets (Chymotrypsin-like protease, RNA dependant RNA polymerase, Papain like protease, Spike RBD and ACE2 receptor with spike RBD) which are vital proteins. These receptors were docked against two tea polyphenols, Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea and Theaflavin digallate (TF3) from black tea. These polyphenols have been previously reviewed for their antiviral activities, especially against single-stranded RNA viruses. Two antiviral drugs, Remdesivir and Favipiravir were studied for comparative docking results. RESULTS: A comparative study of docking scores and the type of interactions of EGCG, TF3 with the possible targets of COVID-19 showed that the tea polyphenols had good docking scores with significant in-silico activity.

Mortality rates specifically due to heart failure (HF) have increased since 2011, but estimates of heterogeneity at the county-level in HF-related mortality have not been produced. The objectives of this study were 1) to quantify nationwide trends by rural-urban designation and 2) examine county-level factors associated with rural-urban differences in HF-related mortality rates. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We queried CDC WONDER to identify HF deaths between 2011C2018 defined as CVD (I00-78) as the underlying cause of death and HF (I50) as a contributing cause of death. First, we calculated national age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) and examined trends stratified by rural-urban status (defined using 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme), age (35C64 and 65C84 years), and race-sex subgroups per year. Second, we combined all deaths from 2011C2018 and estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) in HF-related mortality for rural versus urban counties using multivariable negative binomial regression models with adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, risk factor prevalence, and physician density. Between 2011C2018, 162,314 and 580,305 HF-related deaths occurred in rural and urban counties, respectively. AAMRs were consistently higher for residents in rural compared with urban counties (73.2 [95% CI: 72.2C74.2] vs. 57.2 [56.8C57.6] in 2018, respectively). The highest AAMR was observed in rural Black men (131.1 [123.3C138.9] in 2018) with greatest increases in HF-related mortality in those 35C64 years (+6.1%/year). The rural-urban IRR persisted among both younger (1.10 [1.04C1.16]) and older adults (1.04 [1.02C1.07]) after adjustment for county-level factors. Main limitations included lack of individual-level data and county dropout due to low event rates (<20). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in county-level factors may account for a significant amount of the observed variation in HF-related mortality between rural and urban counties. Efforts to reduce the rural-urban disparity in HF-related mortality rates will likely require diverse public health and clinical interventions targeting the underlying causes of this disparity.","output":"Trends in heart failure-related cardiovascular mortality in rural versus urban United States counties, 2011C2018: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biological synthesis of gold nanostructures could potentially offer an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional chemical synthetic methods. During the last decades, various biomolecules, including amino acids, have been successfully used as reducing and capping agents to synthesize multi-shaped gold nanostructures. A grand challenge in this field is to increase our ability to control the size and shape of gold nanostructures formed precisely by systematic synthetic approaches based on the understanding of the mechanism for structural determination. In this study, using glycine as the model amino acid and chloroaurate (AuCl4 -) ions as the precursor solution, we report the finding that the shape of the gold nanostructures synthesized showed a strong correlation with the speciation of gold complexes determined by the pH, precursor concentration and chloride concentration of the solvent system. The gold chloro-hydroxy speciation [AuClx(OH)4-x]- (with x = 0-4) influenced the shape of the gold nanostructures formed, with gold nanoplatelets, nanotriangles, nanokites and nanoribbons observed at x = 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively, and spherical nanoparticles observed at x = 0. Glycine was found to play a role as a reducing agent, but no significant effect on the morphology was observed, indicating the dominance of gold chloro-hydroxy speciation in the structural formation.

Symptomatic COVID19 commonly causes mild to severe respiratory disease and fever, but some individuals experience serious complications that can result in death. Immune compromised, high risk, and elderly individuals are at an increased risk of more severe consequences of the illness such as respiratory failure, organ dysfunction, and shock.

Outcomes and biomarkers of patients treated with TCZ are compared to patients treated with standard of care regimens. Interleukin6 (IL-6), a prominent inflammatory cytokine involved in CRS in various inflammatory conditions, may have a vital role in the underlying mechanism involved in debilitating SARS-CoV-2 infections and could serve as a viable treatment target.

Computed tomography (CT) offers valuable clues to the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, little is known about the correlation between dynamic changes of CT scores and therapeutic response in the course of COVID-19. Objectives: To describe the temporal changes of CT findings and characterize the time window of disease progression on the follow-up CT scans of patients with COVID-19. Patients and Methods: In this historical cohort study performed in Shanghai, China, the follow-up chest CT images of 91 patients with COVID-19 with different therapeutic responses were reviewed in multiple centers, with an emphasis on characterizing the changing trend of CT scores for lung lesions at 13-15 days after the symptom onset and thereafter. The CT score curve patterns were categorized into type 1 (characterized by an increase to the peak level, followed by a decrease), type 2 (characterized by a steady change without an obvious peak), and type 3 (characterized by a progressive increase). Results: The CT scores of the progression group (n = 9) with a longer time to the peak were significantly higher than those of the non-progression group (n = 82) on the first day and days 13-15 (P < 0.05), except for the median CT scores before days 13-15. The CT curve type 1 and type 2 were commonly observed in the non-progression group (63.4% and 36.6%, respectively), while type 3 was more common in the progression group (88.9%). Conclusion: Most patients with COVID-19 show favorable responses to clinical treatments in Shanghai. Thirteen to fifteen days after the symptom onset can be considered as a turning point for the therapeutic response. The CT curve type 3 usually represents a poor response. The CT scores of patients with different therapeutic responses may overlap before days 13-15.

This study examines public attitudes, practices and perceived quarantine competency in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive design using an online survey was employed. Convenience and snowball sampling were adopted, and 1022 valid responses were received. FINDINGS: Most respondents demonstrated satisfactory practices, including wearing face masks (76.5%), keeping a safe distance (97.8%) and appropriate hand hygiene (99.2%). Fear of stigma (8.9%) and of financial consequences (0%) were minimal drivers of underreporting of symptoms among the respondents, whereas uncertainty of the relevance of symptoms (30.3%) was a main cause of not reporting to health authorities. Most participants (73.4%) abided by government instructions due to fear of infection rather than of legal penalties.

Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and then translated to English by certified translators. Transcript data were analysed using an integrated conceptual framework of policy implementation. Respondents identified several positive outcomes resulting from implementation of an extended maternity leave policy (Labour Code No. 10/2012/QH13) and further restrictions on marketing of breast milk substitutes (Decree No. 100/2014/ND-CP). Decree No. 100, in particular, was said to have reduced advertising of breast milk substitutes in mass media outlets and healthcare settings. Key implementation actors were national-level bureaucratic actors, local organizations and international partners. Findings reveal the importance of policy precedence and a broader set of policies to promote the rights of women and children to support implementation. Other facilitators were involvement from national-level implementing agencies and healthcare personnel and strength of government relationships and coordination with non-governmental and international organizations. Implementation challenges included insufficient funding, limited training to report violations, a cumbersome reporting process and pervasive misinformation about breast milk and breast milk substitutes. Limited reach for women employed in the informal labour sector and in rural communities was said to be a compatibility issue for the extended maternity leave policy in addition to the lack of impact on non-parental guardians and caretakers.

METHODS: A COVID-19 consultation service working group (CWG) was convened with stakeholders from palliative care, emergency medicine, critical care, and general internal medicine. The CWG connected with local palliative care teams to ensure a coordinated response, and developed a model to ensure high-quality palliative care provision. RESULTS: Our 3-step scalable model included: (1) consultant model enhanced by virtual care; (2) embedded model; and (3) cohorted end-of-life unit for COVID-19 positive patients. This approach was enabled through tools and resources to ensure specialist palliative care capacity and rapid upskilling of all clinicians to deliver basic palliative care. Enabling tools and resources included a triage tool for in-person versus virtual care, new medication order sets and guidelines to facilitate prescribing for common symptoms, and lead advance care planning and goals of care discussions.

This type of strategy has proven effective across several therapeutic indications including anticancer treatment. Pharmacokinetic boosting could improve anticancer drugs lacking or with otherwise unacceptable oral formulations through logistic, economic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic benefits.

APA and AHA could represent markers for early detection of patients at risk of developing pituitary deficiencies related to immune checkpoint inhibitors and undergoing closer follow-up. Furthermore, this study aims to evaluate the correlation between the presence of AHA and APA and the clinical response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. However, further prospective studies will be needed to confirm our results. ABSTRACT: Background: Autoimmune hypophysitis is a frequent immune-related adverse event (irAE) in cancer patients treated with immunecheckpoint inhibitors. Studies seeking anti-pituitary (APA) and anti-hypothalamus (AHA) antibodies in patients treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 are scarce. The aim of this study is to search for APA and AHA and related pituitary dysfunction in patients treated with these agents. Methods:Cross-sectional and preliminary longitudinal studies were conducted at the Medical Oncology Unit and Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases Unit of the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli. Fifty-four cancer patients on treatments with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 (Group 1) and 50 healthy controls were enrolled for a cross-sectional study; 13 cancer patients (Group 2) were enrolled for our preliminary longitudinal study. APA/AHA titers and changes in biochemical and hormonal profile were evaluated in Group 1; in Group 2, they were evaluated before and after nine weeks from the start of immunotherapy. Results: Patients of Group 1 showed a higher prevalence of APA and AHA than controls: 21 of them had APA, 16 had AHA, and 11 had both autoantibodies. In total, 7 of 13 patients in Group 2 became APA-positive and 3 became AHA-positive after nine weeks of immunotherapy, showing an increase in prolactin and a decrease in ACTH and IGF-1 levels compared with basal values.

The place of COVID-19 symptoms was sought among deaths that occurred from January to May 2020 (during the pandemic) vs. January to May 2019 (before the pandemic). First, death proportions were tested to seize differences between mortality rates for each month in 2020 vs. 2019. In the second time, we compared mean time-to-death between the two periods using the KaplanCMeier survival curve. Finally, a logistic regression was fitted to assess the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 symptoms between the two periods. We found statistical evidence of a higher death rate in May 2020 as compared to May 2019. Moreover, death occurred faster in 2020 (mean = 6.7 days, s.d. = 8.9) than in 2019 (mean = 7.8 days, s.d. = 10.9). Unlike in 2019, being a male was significantly associated with a much lower likelihood of dying with one or more COVID-19 symptom(s) in 2020 (odds ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.14C0.87).

Some meteorological factors were risks of ambulance transports, but it is difficult to predict in a classically statistical way because Japan has 4 seasons. We tried to make prediction models for ambulance transports using the deep learning (DL) framework, Prediction One (Sony Network Communications Inc., Tokyo, Japan), with the meteorological and calendarial variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the daily ambulance transports and meteorological data between 2017 and 2019. First, to confirm their association, we performed classically statistical analysis. Second, to test the DL frameworks utility for ambulance transports prediction, we made 3 prediction models for daily ambulance transports (total daily ambulance transports more than 5 or not, cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA), and trauma) using meteorological and calendarial factors and evaluated their accuracies by internal cross-validation. RESULTS: During the 1095 days of 3 years, the total ambulance transports were 5948, including 240 CPAs and 337 traumas. Cardiogenic CPA accounted for 72.3%, according to the Utstein classification. The relation between ambulance transports and meteorological parameters by polynomial curves were statistically obtained, but their r(2)s were small. On the other hand, all DL-based prediction models obtained satisfactory accuracies in the internal cross-validation. The areas under the curves obtained from each model were all over 0.947. CONCLUSION: We could statistically make polynomial curves between the meteorological variables and the number of ambulance transport. We also preliminarily made DL-based prediction models. The DL-based prediction for daily ambulance transports would be used in the future, leading to solving the lack of medical resources in Japan.","output":"Prediction Model of Deep Learning for Ambulance Transports in Kesennuma City by Meteorological Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 12 December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, began to spread around the world from Wuhan, China.

Maternal IgG provides pathogen- or vaccine-specific protection and comprises about 85% of colostral Ig. NAb-IgM is less abundant but provides broad and nonspecific reactivity, potentially contributing to protection against the dissemination of pathogens in the blood (septicemia) in a calfs first days of life. In the dairy and beef industries, failure of passive transfer (FPT) of colostral Ig (serum total protein [STP] <5.2 g/dL) is still a common concern. The objectives of this study were to: (1) compare colostral IgG concentrations and NAb-IgM titers between dairy and beef cows; (2) assess the effect of beef breed on colostral IgG; (3) compare passive transfer of colostral Ig in dairy and beef calves; and (4) estimate the heritability of colostral IgG and NAb-IgM. Colostrum was collected from Holstein dairy (n = 282) and crossbred beef (n = 168) cows at the University of Guelph dairy and beef research centers. Colostral IgG was quantified by radial immunodiffusion and NAb-IgM was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In dairy (n = 308) and beef (n = 169) calves, STP was estimated by digital refractometry. Beef cows had significantly greater colostral IgG (146.5  9.5 standard error of the mean [SEM] g/L) than dairy cows (92.4  5.2 g/L, P <0.01). Beef cows with a higher proportion of Angus ancestry had significantly lower colostral IgG (125.5  5.8 g/L) than cows grouped as Other (142.5  4.9 g/L, P = 0.02). Using the FPT cutoff, 13% of dairy and 16% of beef calves had FPT; still, beef calves had a significantly larger proportion with excellent passive transfer (STP 6.2 g/dL, P <0.01). The heritability of colostral IgG was 0.04 (0.14) in dairy and 0.14 (0.32) in beef. Colostral NAb-IgM titers in dairy (12.12  0.22, log(2) [reciprocal of titer]) and beef cows (12.03  0.19) did not differ significantly (P = 0.71). The range of NAb-IgM titers was 9.18C14.60, equivalent to a 42-fold range in antibody concentration. The heritability of colostral NAb was 0.24 (0.16) in dairy and 0.11 (0.19) in beef cows. This study is the first to compare colostral NAb-IgM between dairy and beef cows. Based on the range in NAb-IgM titers and the heritability, selective breeding may improve colostrum quality and protection for neonatal calves in the early days of life.","output":"Concentration and heritability of immunoglobulin G and natural antibody immunoglobulin M in dairy and beef colostrum along with serum total protein in their calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the new overall COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing face veils have become a significant piece of our lives To evade the spread of contamination Individuals are urged to cover their faces using a mask when in open territory The utilization of these face veils makes the orthodox facial recognition system inadequate for authentication in school/office participation, face access control, facial participation, facial security checks at airport and train stations, etc The recent progressed deep learning-based face acknowledgment approaches rely upon countless training samples and significant features of the entire face This paper addresses the issue of recognition of face and veil using Gabor wavelet and deep transfer learning Here the Gabor wavelet features are extracted from the non-masked region of the face and integrated with deep learned CNN features to generate a more robust feature vector for optimizing recognition The proposed method is experimented on 4 benchmark datasets and a manually prepared dates and achieved averaged 97% recognition accuracy ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Gabor-Deep CNN based Masked Face Recognition for Fraud Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"B Discussion: b Extended courses of deep sedation are often required in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients and may result in withdrawal phenomena not previously seen with standard sedation practices.

To tackle this problem, we propose XNBAD, a novel unsupervised network behavior anomaly detection framework, in this work. It integrates the timely high-order host states under the dynamic interaction context with the conversation patterns between hosts for behavior representation. High-order states can better summarize latent interaction patterns, but they are hard to be obtained directly. Therefore, XNBAD utilizes a graph neural network (GNN) to automatically generate high-order features from series of extracted base ones. We evaluated the detection performance of XNBAD in a publicly available benchmark dataset ISCX-2012. To report detailed and precise experimental results, we carefully refined the dataset before evaluation. The results show that XNBAD discovered various attack behaviors more effectively, and it significantly outperformed the existing representative methods by at least 3.8% relative improvement in terms of the overall weighted AUC.","output":"Interaction Context-Aware Network Behavior Anomaly Detection for Discovering Unknown Attacks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the ordinary course of life, choices vary with age and other factors because ones opportunities vary with ones circumstances.

The pre-exposure prophylactic efficacy of neutralizing antibodies that are engineered with mutations to extend their persistence in human serum and the neutralizing antibody titer in serum required for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly characterized. Methods The Fc-region of two neutralizing mAbs (COV2-2130 and COV2-2381) targeting non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was engineered to extend their persistence in humans and reduce interactions with Fc gamma receptors. We assessed protection by individual antibodies or a combination of the two antibodies (designated ADM03820) given prophylactically by intravenous or intramuscular route in a non-human primate (NHP) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings Passive transfer of individual mAbs or ADM03820 conferred virological protection in the NHP respiratory tract in a dose-dependent manner, and ADM03820 potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in vitro. We defined a protective serum neutralizing antibody titer and concentration in NHPs for passively transferred human antibodies that acted by direct viral neutralization. Conclusions In summary, we demonstrate that neutralizing antibodies with extended half-life and lacking Fc-mediated effector functions are efficient for pre-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHPs.

Physical illnesses, mainly cardiovascular diseases, substantially contribute to the high mortality rates in patients with SMI. Disparities in somatic health care access, utilisation, and provision contribute to these poor physical health outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews, was set up to explore SMI patients' and healthcare professionals' perspectives on somatic health care in different psychiatric settings of the three Belgian regions (Flanders, Brussels, Wallonia). Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed prior to qualitative inductive thematic analysis, using Nvivo software. The COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research (COREQ) were used for reporting methods and findings. RESULTS: Collaboration and information flows between psychiatric healthcare professionals, non-psychiatric healthcare professionals, and persons with SMI were troublesome. This seemed to be mainly due to stigma and prejudice and challenging communication and data transfer. Lack of sufficient training and experience to identify and treat somatic health problems in people with SMI (for psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses) and lack of psychiatric knowledge and feeling or sensitivity for psychiatric patients (for non-psychiatric healthcare professionals) further complicated adequate somatic health care. Finally, optimal somatic follow-up of patients with SMI was hampered by organisational problems (unavailability of equipment, unadapted infrastructure, understaffing, hospital pharmacy issues, and insufficient health promotion/lifestyle interventions), patient-related issues (unawareness of physical problems, non-adherence, need for accompaniment) and financial barriers. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for integrated somatic and mental healthcare systems and a cultural change. Psychiatrists and primary care providers continue to consider the mental and physical health of their patients as mutually exclusive responsibilities due to a lack of sufficient training and experience, poor or absent liaison links, time constraints and organisational and financial barriers.

One subgroup that may be of particular concern is U.S. veterans, who are susceptible to mental health and substance use concerns. The current study aimed to investigate changes in alcohol use and binge drinking before and during the first year of the pandemic among U.S. veterans, and how pre-pandemic mental health disorders, namely posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and COVID-19-related factors like loneliness, negative reactions to COVID-19, and economic hardship influenced alcohol use trends. METHODS 1230 veterans were recruited in February 2020 as part of a larger survey study on veteran health behaviors. Veterans were asked to complete follow-up assessments throughout the pandemic at 6, 9, and 12- months. RESULTS Overall, veterans reported a significant decrease in alcohol use (IRR = 0.98) and binge drinking (IRR = 0.11) However, women, racial/ethnic minority veterans, and those with pre-existing PTSD exhibited smaller decreases in alcohol use and binge drinking and overall higher rates of use compared to men, White veterans, and those without PTSD.

Reports have linked infections to breaches in infection control in the radiography unit (RU). With advances in medical imaging, a higher proportion of patients come into contact with RU staff increasing the need for good hand hygiene compliance. This study aimed to evaluate effectiveness on compliance of an intervention to improve awareness of hand hygiene in the RU of a district hospital. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study design including questionnaires assessing knowledge and attitudes of hand hygiene and direct observation of participants was used to evaluate an educational programme on hand hygiene of the RU of a large district hospital. All healthcare workers (HCW), comprising 76 radiographers, 17 nurses, and nine healthcare assistants (HCA), agreed to participate in the study. Of these, 85 completed the initial and 76 the post-test anonymous questionnaire. The hand hygiene compliance of all 102 HCW was observed over a 3-week period prior to and after the intervention. The 2-month intervention consisted of talks on hand hygiene and benefits of ABHR, provision of visual aids, wall-mounted ABHR dispensers, and personal bottles of ABHR. RESULTS: Before the intervention, overall hand hygiene compliance was low (28.9 %). Post-intervention, compliance with hand hygiene increased to 51.4 %. This improvement was significant for radiographers and HCA. Additionally, knowledge and attitudes improved in particular, understanding that ABHR can largely replace handwashing and there is a need to perform hand hygiene after environmental contact. The increased use of ABHR allowed HCW to feel they had enough time to perform hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: The educational intervention led to increased awareness of hand hygiene opportunities and better acceptance of ABHR use. The reduced time needed to perform hand rubbing and improved access to dispensers resulted in fewer missed opportunities. Although radiographers and other allied HCW make frequent contact with patients, these may be mistakenly construed as irrelevant with respect to healthcare associated infections. Stronger emphasis on hand hygiene compliance of these staff may help reduce infection risk.","output":"A quasi-experimental study to determine the effects of a multifaceted educational intervention on hand hygiene compliance in a radiography unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The stratification of patients at risk of progression of COVID-19 and their molecular characterization is of extreme importance to optimize treatment and to identify therapeutic options.

The objective of the study was to identify the frequency of symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in general practitioners and to estimate the association with particular psychosocial and demographic factors. This is a cross-sectional study, where a total of 531 general practitioners completed an online form that contained sociodemographic variables, questions about fear and perceptions concerning medical work during the COVID-19 pandemic, 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), questionnaire on psychosomatic problems and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The presence of symptoms of GAD was defined by a GAD-7 score of 10 or more points. Voluntary and anonymous participation, acceptance of terms, and informed consent were requested. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Symptoms of GAD were identified in 4 out of 10 Colombian general practitioners; the following psychosocial and demographic factors were associated with a greater presence of these symptoms: female gender, social discrimination, anguish, job disappointment, nightmares, stress and other symptoms of fear regarding the pandemic. Conversely, feeling protected by the state or employer, being satisfied with their job as a physician, and trusting government measures and information were associated with a lower presence of symptoms of GAD. These findings highlight the importance of timely psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions in these individuals.

The use of masks in preventing spread is controversial; masks are considered useless by many, while being mandated in some locations. Here, the effect of masking the general population on a COVID-19-like epidemic is estimated by computer simulation using three separate types of software. The main questions are whether mask use by the general population can limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a country and how to identify opportunities when mask use is cost-effective and safe. To address these questions, the protective effects of different types of masks, the side-effects of masks, and avenues for improvements of masks and masking are addressed. Main results: (i) Any type of mask, even simple home-made ones, may be of value, even if the protective effect of each mask (here dubbed one mask-protection) is low. Strict adherence to mask use does not appear to be critical but increasing one mask-protection to >50% was found to be advantageous. (ii) Masks do seem to reduce the number of new cases even if introduced at a late stage in an epidemic, but early implementation helps reduce the cumulative and total number of cases. (iii) The simulations suggest that it might be possible to eliminate a COVID-19 outbreak by widespread mask use during a limited period. There is a brief discussion of why the reported effect size of masking varies widely, and is expected to do so, because of different filtration abilities of different masks, differences in compliance and fitting, other routes of transmission, pre-existing immunity, and because a system of interconnected, disease-prone individuals has non-linear properties. A software solution to visualize infection spread is presented. The results from these simulations are encouraging, but do not necessarily represent the real-life situation, so it is suggested that clinical trials of masks are now carried out while continuously monitoring effects and side-effects. As mask use is not without risks and costs, it is suggested that governments and scientists have an important role in advising the public about the sensible use of masks.","output":"Challenges and Controversies in COVID-19: Masking the General Population may Attenuate This Pandemic's Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the etiology and clinical consequences of viral respiratory infections in 18 elderly care centers (ECC) in Lisbon, which housed a total of 1022 residents.

OBJECTIVE The study aimed to shed light on relations between caregiver mental reaction to the pandemic and caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms, memory impairment progression, and functional impairment of people with neurocognitive disorder during the period of confinement in Greece. METHODS The study included caregivers of patients with mild (N = 13) and major (N = 54) neurocognitive disorder. The caregiver-based telephone interview was based on items of the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire, the AD8 Dementia Screening Instrument, and the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale. Regarding the mental impact of the COVID-19 crisis on caregivers, four single questions referring to their worries in the last seven days were posed, in addition to the scales Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). A stepwise linear regression model was employed for studying the relationship between caregiver distress and demographic and clinical data and caregiver mental reaction to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. RESULTS Caregiver distress severity during the confinement period was influenced not only by memory deficits (p = 0.009) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (p < 0.001) of patients, but also by caregiver hyperarousal (p = 0.003) and avoidance symptoms (p = 0.033) and worries directly linked to the COVID-19 crisis (p = 0.022).

It is a bifunctional enzyme bearing 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities. ExoN hydrolyzes single-stranded RNAs and double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and is part of a proofreading system responsible for the high fidelity of CoV replication. nsp14 N7-MTase activity is required for viral mRNA cap synthesis and prevents the recognition of viral mRNAs as \\"non-self\\" by the host cell. In this work, a set of point mutants affecting different motifs within the ExoN domain of nsp14 was generated, using transmissible gastroenteritis virus as a model of Alphacoronavirus Mutants lacking ExoN activity were nonviable despite being competent in both viral RNA and protein synthesis. A specific mutation within zinc finger 1 (ZF-C) led to production of a viable virus with growth and viral RNA synthesis kinetics similar to that of the parental virus. Mutant recombinant transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) ZF-C (rTGEV-ZF-C) caused decreased cytopathic effect and apoptosis compared with the wild-type virus and reduced levels of dsRNA accumulation at late times postinfection. Consequently, the mutant triggered a reduced antiviral response, which was confirmed by evaluating different stages of the dsRNA-induced antiviral pathway. The expression of beta interferon (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferon-stimulated genes in cells infected with mutant rTGEV-ZF-C was reduced compared to the levels seen with the parental virus. Overall, our data revealed a potential role for CoV nsp14 in modulation of the innate immune response. IMPORTANCE The innate immune response is the first line of antiviral defense that culminates in the synthesis of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines to control viral replication. CoVs have evolved several mechanisms to counteract the innate immune response at different levels, but the role of CoV-encoded ribonucleases in preventing activation of the dsRNA-induced antiviral response has not been described to date. The introduction of a mutation in zinc finger 1 of the ExoN domain of nsp14 led to production of a virus that induced a weak antiviral response, most likely due to the accumulation of lower levels of dsRNA in the late phases of infection. These observations allowed us to propose a novel role for CoV nsp14 ExoN activity in counteracting the antiviral response, which could serve as a novel target for the design of antiviral strategies.","output":"Mutagenesis of Coronavirus nsp14 Reveals Its Potential Role in Modulation of the Innate Immune Response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: March 14, 2020, marked the beginning of an unexpected state of emergency in Spain due to the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) From that moment on, the educational system had to adapt so that millions of students could continue their education at home Through a descriptive study, the reality and perceptions that Spanish families have about the educational actions that took place during the compulsory lockdown of the Spanish population is presented Design/methodology/approach: 3,400 representatives of family units from 17 autonomous communities answered a survey, the data were analyzed using descriptive and frequency statistics Findings: Relevant conclusions were drawn from the results Despite the efforts of the authorities, the economic, cultural, social and digital divides leave many households without access to the fundamental right of education;families value the support of technologies but consider that they should not replace the face-to-face education that is necessary for the development process of minors;it is necessary to adapt the school content for a future postpandemic, discriminating the expendable from the essential in the school curriculum;priority must be given to the integral well-being of people in educational policies and also to the most vulnerable ones Originality/value: The study allows progress in the analysis of educational policy proposals in the face of future crisis ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Education online in lockdown: limits and possibilities.

SETTING: French refractive surgeons. DESIGN: Anonymous practice survey. METHODS: The questionnaire was sent in a single email invitation to 400 declared refractive surgeons. The following information was recorded between December 2019 and April 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic: demographics data, preoperative evaluation and preparation of the patient, surgical management, immediate and postoperative protocol, and infections reported after corneal refractive surgery. RESULTS: Eighty-three 83 of 400 surgeons (20.75%) responded to the questionnaire; 55 (66.0%) performed more than 50 corneal refractive surgeries a year, and 25 (30.1%) performed more than 200 procedures a year. Thirty-six (43.4%) surgeons wore 3 protective items, 37 (44.6%) 2, 5 (6.0%) 1, and 5 (6.0%) zero. Seventy-seven (92.8%) surgeons used povidone-iodine for skin area disinfection and 54 (65%) for conjunctival fornix disinfection. The contact time of povidone-iodine was less than 3 minutes for 71 (85.0%) surgeons. Twenty surgeons (24.1%) reported at least 1 post-refractive surgery infection. Twenty percent of surgeons who wore sterile gloves for PRK reported post-operative infections compared with 62.5% for those who did not (p=0.008).

Basal expression of DAXX is sufficient to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, and DAXX over-expression further restricts infection. DAXX restricts an early, post-entry step of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. DAXX-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV-2 is independent of the SUMOylation pathway but dependent on its D/E domain, also necessary for its protein-folding activity. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the re-localization of DAXX to cytoplasmic sites and promotes its degradation. Mechanistically, this process is mediated by the viral papain-like protease (PLpro) and the proteasome. Together, these results demonstrate that DAXX restricts SARS-CoV-2, which in turn has evolved a mechanism to counteract its action.","output":"Identification of DAXX as a restriction factor of SARS-CoV-2 through a CRISPR/Cas9 screen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As compared to many other viral pulmonary infections, there existed several peculiar manifestations in the COVID-19 patients, including the \\"silence\\" of pneumonia in both mild and severe cases and a long intensive care unit stay for those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

Our hypothesis is that fellowship applicants would find that recorded audiovisual radiology content adds value to the conventional selection process, may increase engagement by using their own smartphone device, and also facilitate understanding of imaging findings of radiology-based questions, while maintaining social distancing. METHODS: One senior staff radiologist of each subspecialty prepared 4 audiovisual radiology questions for each subspecialty. We conducted a survey using online questionnaires for 123 fellowship applications for musculoskeletal (39), internal medicine (61) and neuroradiology (23) programs to evaluate the experience of using audiovisual radiology content as a substitute for the conventional text evaluation.

In the previously reported primary analysis (Dimopoulos et al, Lancet 2020), a significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was demonstrated in patients treated with KdD vs patients treated with Kd (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63 [95% CI, 0.46-0.85];two-sided P=0.0027). However, after a median follow-up of 16.9 months, median PFS was not reached in the KdD arm. Here, we report updated efficacy and safety outcomes from the CANDOR study. Methods: Adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) received 28-day cycles of KdD or Kd (randomized 2:1). In the primary analysis, PFS was the primary endpoint and overall survival (OS) a key secondary endpoint. In this prespecified interim OS analysis, statistical testing was based on the actual number of OS events observed by the data cutoff (approximately 36 months after enrollment of the first patient);PFS was summarized descriptively. Disease progression was determined locally by investigators in an unblinded manner and centrally by the sponsor using a validated computer algorithm (Onyx Response Computer Algorithm [ORCA]) in a blinded manner. PFS and OS were compared between the KdD and Kd arms using a stratified log-rank test, and HRs were estimated by a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model. Results: Patients were randomized to KdD (n = 312) and Kd (n = 154). Of all randomized patients, median age was approximately 64 years;42% received previous lenalidomide, and 33% were lenalidomide refractory;90% received previous bortezomib, and 29% were bortezomib refractory. At the data cutoff date of June 15, 2020, 199 (63.8%) patients in the KdD arm and 88 (57.1%) in the Kd arm remained on study.

Median PFS by ORCA was 28.6 months for the KdD arm versus 15.2 months for the Kd arm (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.45-0.78];Figure). OS data were not mature and will be updated at a future prespecified analysis. Median treatment duration was 79.3 weeks with KdD versus 40.3 weeks with Kd. Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 87.0% and 75.8% of patients in the KdD and Kd arms, respectively, and fatal AEs occurred in 8.8% and 4.6%;one fatal AE in the KdD arm (due to arrhythmia) and one fatal AE in the Kd arm (due to COVID-19 pneumonia) had occurred since the primary analysis. Carfilzomib treatment discontinuation rates due to AEs were 26.0% with KdD and 22.2% with Kd. Exposure-adjusted AE rates per 100 patient years were: 171.2 and 151.9 for grade 3 AEs and 6.9 and 5.6 for fatal AEs in the KdD and Kd arms, respectively. Updated data by key subgroups will be presented. Conclusion: With approximately 11 months of additional follow-up, a 13.4-month improvement in median PFS was observed in patients treated with KdD (28.6 months) versus patients treated with Kd (15.2 months;HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.45-0.78]). Safety was consistent with previously reported results. KdD continues to show a favorable benefit-risk profile and represents an efficacious treatment option for patients with RRMM.

With the advent of the COVID19 pandemic, Telehealth has become a universal way to provide safe and quality patient care. However, Telehealth is a new experience for many providers and patients. We surveyed patients who received telehealth visits in sleep medicine between March and June 2020 to determine patient satisfaction and common technology-related barriers. The goal was to formulate actionable steps for improving patients experiences and determine the feasibility of long-term telehealth services for sleep medicine. METHODS: We interviewed 63 patients by phone, utilizing IRB approved surveys for telehealth satisfaction and technology. Responses were de-identified, tabulated, and analyzed in aggregate using Excel?. RESULTS: 85% of respondents had a high-school diploma or a higher level of education (9.6% students, 39.7% employed, 15.9% unemployed, and 19% retirees). 62% of participants participated in Telehealth for the first time. 89% preferred Telehealth, and 76% rated telehealth experience as good or better than in-person visits. 92% did not require technical assistance during the visit. Long-term telehealth care was acceptable to 63% of participants. Approximately 33% had technology-related barriers (no computer or webcam), and 12% did not have email. However, 89% had smartphones (70% connected to personal internet). Other barriers cited were lack of private space (13%) and taking time off work (9%). No clear preference for phone versus video Telehealth was noted (approximately 40% each), but 7% expressed concern about bi-directional video communication. This may be related to the privacy and security concerns expressed by 20% of respondents. However, only 5% reported using the electronic health record (EHR) based secure communication portal. CONCLUSION: Sleep care via Telehealth is preferred by most patients during the COVID pandemic and is acceptable to two-thirds of patients for the long-term. In addition to access to personal devices or the internet, privacy concerns were a barrier to Telehealth. We plan to increase patient enrollment in the EHR-based portal to deliver telehealth services and communication securely to mitigate these barriers.

Hence, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate whether the presence of an MP component has equal prognostic power as the MP predominant subtype. METHODS: Literature retrieval was performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases until December 23, 2019. Eligible studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included studies were divided into two subgroups, the MP component subgroup and the MP predominant subgroup, according to the proportion of the MP pattern to analyse the effect of this pattern on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted from each study. Review Manager 5.3 was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Finally, 10 studies, including a total of 4934 lung ADC patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Our results indicated a significantly worse pooled DFS (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.20-2.21) and OS (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.19-1.96) in the subgroup of MP predominant subtype patients. The pooled DFS (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.45-2.85) and OS (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.46-3.52) were also poor in the subgroup of patients with the presence of an MP component. CONCLUSIONS: Both the presence of an MP component and the MP predominant subtype are related to poor DFS and OS after lung ADC resection and represent adverse prognostic factor for lung ADC patients. However, there are some limitations in this meta-analysis, and quantitative stratification based on the proportion of the MP component is needed to explore its effect on prognosis of lung ADC patients in the future.","output":"Both the presence of a micropapillary component and the micropapillary predominant subtype predict poor prognosis after lung adenocarcinoma resection: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the pandemic progresses towards all corners of the globe, it becomes more noticeable how this crisis is undermining some of the central aspects that give meaning to urban life In this scenario, future urban planning must learn to implement city models capable of responding to this kind of challenge The constant reflections that appear regularly coincide in pointing out that COVID-19 has disrupted the dynamics of the contemporary city unveiling significant weaknesses in terms of management, social cohesion, and planning From this evidence, scholars argue that a new model of the city will emerge once we overcome this crisis But what kind of city?

Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 7 June 2020: notifications = 7,491; deaths = 102. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 215 cases notified between 8 and 21 June, 75% (163 cases) were notified from Victoria. Most of these cases were acquired locally. In contrast, cases notified from other states (NSW, Qld and WA) over this period were mostly overseas-acquired. Of locally-acquired cases in Victoria in this period, 51% were associated with contacts of a confirmed case or in a known outbreak, while 49% were unable to be linked to another case or were under investigation at the time of reporting. There are several clusters across a range of settings, including extended families, hotel quarantine facilities and a retail store, with most cases limited in geographic spread to a number of Local Government Areas around Melbourne. In response, the Victorian Government has re-introduced restrictions for household and outdoor gatherings, has delayed plans to ease other restrictions and has implemented enhanced public health response activities, particularly with regard to testing and contact tracing. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care, with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18 years, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, as of 21 June 2020, the largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 5.3%. Other countries in the Americas region, such as Brazil and Chile, are seeing rapid growth in case numbers. Case numbers in Europe remain relatively steady, while there is significant growth in the South East Asia region, including in India and Bangladesh. Reported cases are increasing in Africa, although the numbers are much smaller.

Therefore, the administration of proper disease\\\\modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS patients is critical during the pandemic status. On the one hand, both the autoimmune diseases and immunosuppressive drugs increase the risk of infection due to impairment in the immune system, and on the other hand, postponing of MS treatment has serious consequences on the central nervous system. In the present study, we discussed recent literature about the effect of DMTs administration on the severity of COVID\\\\19 in the MS patients. Overall, it seems that DMTs do not provoke the COVID\\\\19 infection in the MS patients by declining immune responses and cytokine storm.

However, the underlying mechanisms of BCG have not been completely clarified, to date. The role of macrophages in BCG therapy for BCa has still not been determined in vivo. In the present study, the role and potential mechanism of BCG (0.25, 1.25 and 6.25 g/mouse; intravenous) immunotherapy for BCa was investigated in a NOD/scid (IL2Rg?/?) (NSI) mouse model by targeting macrophages in vivo. Notably, it was observed that NSI mice with T24 BCa cells displayed high levels of the macrophage marker CD11b(+) F4/80(+) after injection via the tail vein of live BCG, as well as a significant reduction in tumor volume. The levels of the inflammatory and macrophage maturation cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12P70, TNF superfamily member 11 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, were significantly increased in the serum and the tumor supernatant compared to that in normal control subjects. Furthermore, BCG promoted the expression of the pro-differential genes Spi-1 proto-oncogene, early growth response protein 1, nuclear factor (NF)-B and proto-oncogene c-Fos in bone marrow. In conclusion, these observations indicate that the injection of live BCG can target macrophages against bladder tumor growth in vivo. The mechanism is likely related to the promotion of macrophage maturation, immune activation and increased numbers of macrophages infiltrating the bladder tumor.","output":"Immunotherapy of Bacillus Calmette-Gurin by targeting macrophages against bladder cancer in a NOD/scid (IL2Rg-/?) mouse model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Serology testing is explored for epidemiological research and to inform individuals after suspected infection. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. METHODS: In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralisation test, and a neutralisation assay using live SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: From baseline to week 6, 1080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from 217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4% in week 6, p < 0.001). In sera of convalescent patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using e.g. the spike 1 (S1) protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralisation. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the study period of 6 weeks. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralisation against live SARS-CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. CONCLUSION: When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.

The charge transport process in polymer dielectrics under a high electric field, which is considered to result in electrical aging and even breakdown of equipment insulation, has attracted considerable attention. Based on a localized charge transfer model, the charge transport mechanism for typical silicone rubber (SR) insulating materials was studied by multiscale methods. A model of silicone rubber oligomers under standard conditions was generated by classical molecular dynamics. The frontier molecular orbitals and projected density of states for the SR oligomer were obtained via quantum chemistry methods. The electronic coupling, reorganization energy, and free energy difference for both electron and hole transfer processes between adjacent SR molecules in the molecular dynamics model were calculated. Both hole transfer and electron transfer in SR conform to an intermolecular hopping mechanism due to their high intramolecular reorganization energy and low intermolecular electronic coupling. The results of normal mode analysis for reorganization energy indicate that the high-temperature approximation holds for charge transport in SR around or above room temperature. The charge transfer trajectory and charge mobility in SR were simulated based on kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The hole and electron mobilities at room temperature were calculated to be 7.24  10-11 and 2.76  10-9 cm2/Vs, respectively, which agrees with the experimental data. Both electron transport and hole transport in SR show thermal activation characteristics, with corresponding activation energies of 358 and 314 meV, respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequities for many populations including people with disabilities, and data is needed to develop inclusive public health response policies. OBJECTIVE: To identify how COVID-19 has uniquely impacted the lives of adults with disabilities. METHODS: 38 participants were recruited through disability advocacy groups and social media. Semi-structured virtual focus groups were conducted with adults (&#8805;18 years) who self-identified as having a disability. Focus groups were conducted for each of six disability sub-groups: vision, hearing, mobility and physical, mental health, cognitive, intellectual, and developmental, and chronic illness. Using inductive coding, major themes were identified and compared across the disability sub-groups. RESULTS: Three major themes and thirteen sub-themes were identified from the focus groups. The three major themes comprised: new problems created by the pandemic, obstacles in daily life that were exacerbated by the pandemic, and broader changes to accessibility and disability identity. Sub-themes such as difficulty with COVID-19 testing and regular medical care were reported by participants of all disability sub-groups, while other sub-themes like direct care needs and medical rationing were reported by participants from a subset of the disability sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate how the COVID-19 pandemic unequally impacts disabled people. The participants indicated that to fully address their needs, disability perspectives must be included in the public health pandemic response. As new research shows that COVID-19 can cause long-term disability, the urgency to ensure the disability community is part of public health policies will increase.","output":"New obstacles and widening gaps: A qualitative study of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. adults with disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a convergence unfolding between two formerly unique and separate areas of teaching research methodology: distance education and problem-based learning (PBL) environments. Much has been published on each field independently, however, in the modern-era of online, distance, and hybrid educational programs there is a need for more case and experiential-based learning activities which can effectively measure stated learning objectives. Trends in education have led to the development of various methods to instruct courses and conduct research online. Teaching research methodology and pedagogy have evolved to include video capture, remote conferencing, and other real-time communications techniques allowing faculty and students to collaborate across great distances. Meanwhile, PBL environments have been used extensively in teaching medicine, clinical practice, law, business/management, and many other disciplines to improve student learning. This has been further accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic through the use of technologies like Zoom, WebEx, GoToMeeting, Google Hangout Meet, etc. and the availability of PBL-ready environments in breakout rooms and asynchronous simulated projects. Student preference data from 2020 are reported as part of this study. One example of this merger between online delivery and PBLs was the development of a PBL statistical process control (PBL-SPC) module. A cross-functional academic team was created across both a college of business and college of education in which a PBL-SPC module was developed based on a real-life situation in which students immerse themselves in a potato chip factory environment. The motivation for the PBL-SPC was that this is a challenging topic to cover which students often find difficult to relate to and/or boring. Three different scenarios were developed and students, as individuals or in teams, must traverse the simulated factory to assess the situation. Learning outcomes are measured by the course instructors and the PBL environment is being used by faculty around the world. Additionally, the PBL-SPC module has now been scaled to other applications such as six-sigma simulated project training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pedagogical methods should be interactive, stimulate learning, improve the learning outcomes / critical thinking, and enhance student experience. This paper proposes that merging the effective and tech-friendly pedagogical methods of PBL-SPC, with the right modalities and model of online delivery, can help achieve these aforesaid goals. Even more, it can deliver a great opportunity to educators and institutions worldwide for advancing the reach of education.","output":"The Convergence of Online Teaching and Problem Based Learning Modules amid the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study an urban bike lane planning problem based on the fine-grained bike trajectory data, which is made available by smart city infrastructure such as bike-sharing systems. The key decision is where to build bike lanes in the existing road network. As bike-sharing systems become widespread in the metropolitan areas over the world, bike lanes are being planned and constructed by many municipal governments to promote cycling and protect cyclists. Traditional bike lane planning approaches often rely on surveys and heuristics. We develop a general and novel optimization framework to guide the bike lane planning from bike trajectories. We formalize the bike lane planning problem in view of the cyclists' utility functions and derive an integer optimization model to maximize the utility. To capture cyclists' route choices, we develop a bilevel program based on the Multinomial Logit model. We derive structural properties about the base model and prove that the Lagrangian dual of the bike lane planning model is polynomial-time solvable. Furthermore, we reformulate the route choice based planning model as a mixed integer linear program using a linear approximation scheme. We develop tractable formulations and efficient algorithms to solve the large-scale optimization problem.

The number of patients using insulin pumps has increased since the 1980s. This historical perspective has labeled pump therapy in endocrinology and metabolism synonymous with insulin pumps. However, certain other hormonal disorders might also benefit from this kind of treatment. Pump therapy is currently the best approach to achieve physiological mimicry. Furthermore, it may help in overcoming pharmacokinetic issues or allergies. Until now, hormone replacement via pumps has been a salvage method for complex cases at the expense of increased costs. However, it is believed that applications of pump treatment will widen in the future owing to the rapidly evolving technology. In this mini review, data on pump use for patients with adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, hypoparathyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and congenital hyperinsulinism have been briefly summarized.

However, the majority of currently available data are restricted to laboratory-confirmed cases for symptomatic patients, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection can manifest as an asymptomatic or mild disease. Therefore, the true extent of the burden of COVID-19 may be underestimated. Improved serological detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could help estimate the true numbers of infections. This article comprehensively reviews the associated literature and provides updated information regarding the seroprevalence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The seroprevalence can vary across different sites and the seroprevalence can increase with time during longitudinal follow-up. Although healthcare workers (HCWs), especially those caring for COVID-19 patients, are considered as a high-risk group, the seroprevalence in HCWs wearing adequate personal protective equipment is thought to be no higher than that in other groups. With regard to sex, no statistically significant difference has been found between male and female subjects. Some, but not all, studies have shown that children have a lower risk than other age groups. Finally, seroprevalence can vary according to different populations, such as pregnant women and hemodialysis patients; however, limited studies have examined these associations.

Effective treatment for COVID-19 is urgently needed. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antiviral effect of Arbidol vs. Chloroquine in treating COVID-19. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 62 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in China. They were divided into two groups depending on the antiviral drugs that they received. Participants in the Arbidol group (n=42) received 0.2 g Arbidol, tid for 10 days,and those in Chloroquine group (n=20) received 500 mg Chloroquine, bid for 10 days. The coronavirus negative conversion time and the length of hospital stay were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS There was no significant difference in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. After antiviral treatment, the nasopharyngeal specimen negative conversion time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the length of hospital stay in the Arbidol group were significantly shorter than those in the Chloroquine group (18.50 vs. 25.05 days, P=0.001; 23.52 vs. 28.75 days, P=0.001). Adverse events observed during the antiviral treatment period were comparable between the two groups. Overall, 3 (7.14%) participants in the Arbidol group and 4 (20.0%) in the Chloroquine group experienced adverse events during antiviral treatment.

Mortality in 60%-90% of the COVID-19 cases is attributed to either one or more of these comorbidities. However, healthcare management for control of COVID-19 involves public health and policy decisions that may critically undermine the existing health needs of the most vulnerable NCD patients. Temporary closure of outpatient health facilities in some secondary and tertiary care hospitals have deprived millions of NCD patients of their regular medication and diagnostic health needs. The lack of robust primary healthcare facilities in most states, and the failure to maintain physical distancing norms due to inadequate infrastructure is also problematic. In the absence of effective public health interventions, socioeconomically vulnerable patients are likely to become non-adherent increasing manifold their risk of disease complications. In this context, the feasibility of dispensing longer than usual drug refills for chronic NCD conditions at functional government health facilities, home delivery of essential drugs, running dedicated NCD clinics at PHCs, and utilisation of telemedicine opportunities for care and support to patients warrant aggressive exploration.

Currently debated is whether these difficulties arise from atypical neural sampling of (or entrainment to) auditory information in speech at slow rates (<10 Hz, related to speech rhythm), faster rates, or neither. MEG studies with adults suggest that atypical sampling in dyslexia affects faster modulations in the neurophysiological gamma band, related to phoneme-level representation. However, dyslexic adults have had years of reduced experience in converting graphemes to phonemes, which could itself cause atypical gamma-band activity. The present study was designed to identify specific linguistic timescales at which English children with dyslexia may show atypical entrainment. Adopting a developmental focus, we hypothesised that children with dyslexia would show atypical entrainment to the prosodic and syllable-level information that is exaggerated in infant-directed speech and carried primarily by amplitude modulations <10Hz. MEG was recorded in a naturalistic story-listening paradigm. The modulation bands related to different types of linguistic information were derived directly from the speech materials, and lagged coherence at multiple temporal rates spanning 0.9-40 Hz was computed. Group differences in lagged speech-brain coherence between children with dyslexia and control children were most marked in neurophysiological bands corresponding to stress and syllable-level information (<5Hz in our materials), and phoneme-level information (12-40 Hz). Functional connectivity analyses showed network differences between groups in both hemispheres, with dyslexic children showing significantly reduced global network efficiency. Global network efficiency correlated with dyslexic children's oral language development and with control children's reading development. These developmental data suggest that dyslexia is characterised by atypical neural sampling of auditory information at slower rates.

However, clinicians and clinical microbiology laboratories play an important role in the early detection of disease, the identification of the putative agent, and notification of the appropriate authorities. To be effective in this role, laboratories must be specially prepared to handle viral agents safely, and need, among other things, the appropriate rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests.

The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial. Methods: Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19. Results: Mean symptom duration of plasma donors was 11.9 and 7.8% (8/103) had been hospitalized. Antibody titers ranged from 0 to 1:3,892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1:3,289 (anti-spike). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titer were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever, and absence of myalgia (all p<0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (p=0.03) but not anti-spike antibody titer (p=0.11). In pairwise comparison among ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD titer than O negative donors (p=0.048) and higher anti-spike titer than O negative (p=0.015) or O positive (p=0.037) donors. Eight of the ten recipients were discharged, one remains on ECMO and one died on ECMO. No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion.

Endorsement of One Health Act by the Government of Nepal is an opportunity to initiate the joint programs for TB surveillance among human and animal species using one health approach to reduce the TB burden in Nepal.","output":"Insights into transmission dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate changes in life expectancy in 2010-18 and during the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 across population groups in the United States and to compare outcomes with peer nations. DESIGN: Simulations of provisional mortality data. SETTING: US and 16 other high income countries in 2010-18 and 2020, by sex, including an analysis of US outcomes by race and ethnicity. POPULATION: Data for the US and for 16 other high income countries from the National Center for Health Statistics and the Human Mortality Database, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth, and at ages 25 and 65, by sex, and, in the US only, by race and ethnicity. Analysis excluded 2019 because life table data were not available for many peer countries. Life expectancy in 2020 was estimated by simulating life tables from estimated age specific mortality rates in 2020 and allowing for 10% random error. Estimates for 2020 are reported as medians with fifth and 95th centiles. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2018, the gap in life expectancy between the US and the peer country average increased from 1.88 years (78.66 v 80.54 years, respectively) to 3.05 years (78.74 v 81.78 years). Between 2018 and 2020, life expectancy in the US decreased by 1.87 years (to 76.87 years), 8.5 times the average decrease in peer countries (0.22 years), widening the gap to 4.69 years. Life expectancy in the US decreased disproportionately among racial and ethnic minority groups between 2018 and 2020, declining by 3.88, 3.25, and 1.36 years in Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White populations, respectively. In Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations, reductions in life expectancy were 18 and 15 times the average in peer countries, respectively. Progress since 2010 in reducing the gap in life expectancy in the US between Black and White people was erased in 2018-20; life expectancy in Black men reached its lowest level since 1998 (67.73 years), and the longstanding Hispanic life expectancy advantage almost disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: The US had a much larger decrease in life expectancy between 2018 and 2020 than other high income nations, with pronounced losses among the Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations. A longstanding and widening US health disadvantage, high death rates in 2020, and continued inequitable effects on racial and ethnic minority groups are likely the products of longstanding policy choices and systemic racism.","output":"Effect of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 on life expectancy across populations in the USA and other high income countries: simulations of provisional mortality data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging variants of concern for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can transmit more efficiently and partially evade protective immune responses, thus necessitating continued refinement of antibody therapies and immunogen design.

CV3-1 bound to the (485-GFN-487) loop within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the \\"RBD-up\\" position and triggered potent shedding of the S1 subunit. In contrast, CV3-25 inhibited membrane fusion by binding to an epitope in the stem helix region of the S2 subunit that is highly conserved among {beta}-coronaviruses.

In this study, we compared the perioperative outcomes and complications of LA on large ( 6 cm) and (< 6 cm) adrenal tumors. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all clinical data of patients who underwent unilateral transperitoneal LA in our institution between April 2000 and June 2019. Patients were classified by tumor size into 2 groups. Patients in group 1 had tumor size < 6 cm (n = 408) and patient in group 2 had tumor size  6 cm (n = 48). Demographic data, perioperative outcomes, complications, and pathologic reports were compared between groups. RESULTS Patients in group 2 were significant older (p = 0.04), thinner (p = 0.001) and had lower incident of hypertension (p = 0.001), with a significantly higher median operative time (75 vs 120 min), estimated blood loss (20 vs 100 ml), transfusion rate (0 vs 20.8%), conversion rate (0.25 vs 14.6%) and length of postoperative stays ( 4 vs 5.5 days) than in group 2 (all p < 0.001). Group 2 patients also had significantly higher frequency of intraoperative complication (4.7 vs 31.3%; adjust Odds Ratio [OR] = 9.67 (95% CI 4.22-22.17), p-value < 0.001) and postoperative complication (5.4 vs 31.3%; adjust OR = 5.67 (95% CI 2.48-12.97), p-value < 0.001). Only eight (1.8%) major complications occurred in this study. The most common pathology in group 2 patient was pheochromocytoma and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy in large adrenal tumor  6 cm is feasible but associated with significantly worse intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, and recovery. However, most of the complications were minor and could be managed conservatively. Careful patient selection with the expert surgeon in adrenal surgery is the key factor for successful laparoscopic surgery in a large adrenal tumor.

COX-2 is frequently overexpressed in human cancers and plays a major tumor promoting function. Accordingly, many efforts have been devoted to efficiently target the catalytic site of this enzyme in cancer cells, by using COX-2 specific inhibitors such as celecoxib. However, despite their potent anti-tumor properties, the myriad of detrimental effects associated to the chronic inhibition of COX-2 in healthy tissues, has considerably limited their use in clinic. In addition, increasing evidence indicate that these anti-cancerous properties are not strictly dependent on the inhibition of the catalytic site. These findings have led to the development of non-active COX-2 inhibitors analogues aiming at preserving the antitumor effects of COX-2 inhibitors without their side effects. Among them, two celecoxib derivatives, 2,5-Dimethyl-Celecoxib and OSU-03012, have been developed and suggested for the treatment of viral (e.g., recently SARS-CoV-2), inflammatory, metabolic diseases and cancers. These molecules display stronger anti-tumor properties than celecoxib and thus may represent promising anti-cancer molecules.

Notably, in the countries dealing with massive casualties, clinicians have worked in new work conditions characterized by a heavy workload and a high risk of being infected. The issue of clinician burnout during pandemic has attracted considerable attention in healthcare research. Electronic health record (EHR) provides healthcare providers with several features to meet a health system's clinical needs. OBJECTIVE: We aim to examine how the use of EHR features affects the burnout of clinicians working in hospitals that have special wards for confirmed coronavirus cases. METHODS: Using an online survey, we collected data from 368 physicians, physician assistants, and nurses working in six hospitals that have implemented EHR in the city of Tehran in Iran. We use logistic regression to assess the association between burnout and awareness of EHR features, EHR system usability, concerns about COVID19, technology solutions, hospital technology interventions, hospital preparedness, and professional efficacy adjusted for demographic and practice characteristics. RESULTS: The primary outcome of our study was self-reported burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 368 respondents, 36% reported having at least one symptom of burnout. Participants indicated that the leading cause of EHR-related stress is inadequate training for using technology (43%), followed by having less face-to-face time with patients (38%). Positive perceptions about the EHR's ease of use are associated with lower odds of burnout symptoms. More interventions, such as clear communication of regulations and transparency in policies, expectations, and goals regarding the use of technology in the clinical workflow as well as the hospital preparedness to cope with the challenges of the pandemic, are associated with lower odds of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: The use of EHR applications, hospital pandemic preparation programs, and transparent technology-related policies and procedures throughout the epidemic can be significant drivers of technology-based stress and clinician burnout. Then, hospitals will be better positioned to devise or modify technology-related policies and procedures to support physicians' and nurses' well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Training programs, transparency in communications of regulations, and developing a clear channel for informing clinicians of changes in policies may help reduce burnout symptoms among physicians and nurses during a pandemic. Providing easily accessible mentorship through teleconsultation and 24-hour available information technology support may also help to mitigate the odds of burnout.","output":"The role of using electronic health records in mitigating workplace burnout among clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic: a field study in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A tanulmny az Eurpai Uniba irnyul k?zvetlen klf?ldi befektetsek tvilgtsi keretnek ltrehozsrl szl 2019. mrcius 19-i (EU) 2019/452 eurpai parlamenti s tancsi rendelet ltal ltrehozott keretet s egyttm?k?dsi mechanizmust vizsglja.

The Regulation merely gives a framework for the coordination of national legislation, and member states can still decide if they want to set up screening mechanisms and to screen foreign direct investments. The pandemic has accelerated these processes, and more and more European Union member states enacted legislation relating to the screening of foreign direct investments in strategic branches of the economy. The Commission has also issued a Guidance at the end of March 2020, in which it warns about the risk that the Coronavirus related economic shock might have on strategic industries, especially on healthcare related industries. At the same time, recognizing the importance of foreign direct investments for the economy, it pointed out in the Guidance the necessity to find a balance between the need for foreign capital and the protection of European Union strategic industries using appropriate screening tools.","output":"The Regulation of Screening of Foreign Direct Investments in the European Union"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to discuss the strategies to promote a culture of professional learning within an Australian academic library.

Firstly, liposomes with different composition were prepared and their properties were checked by dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering. The membrane properties were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy - especially generalized polarization (Laurdan) and anisotropy (Diphenylhexatriene). The same characteristic of liposomes was measured after the nebulization by vibrating mesh nebulizer. Cholesterol was capable of liposome stabilization because of increased membrane fluidity. The membrane properties of the outer and inner parts were not influenced by the nebulization process. Electrostatic stabilization was successful for the lowest concentration of phosphatidic acid, but after the nebulization process the hydration of the membrane outer part was changed. Higher amount of PEG needs to be added for successful steric stabilization. The nebulization process of the two lowest concentrations of PEG slightly influenced immobilized water and the rigidity of inner part of the membrane (especially around the phase transition temperature).","output":"Influence of liposomes composition on their stability during the nebulization process by vibrating mesh nebulizer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Whether certain activities can trigger spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains unknown.

METHODS We included consecutive patients diagnosed with ICH between July 1, 2013, and December 31, 2019. We interviewed patients on their exposure to 12 potential trigger factors (eg, Valsalva maneuvers) in the (hazard) period soon before onset of ICH and their normal exposure to these trigger factors in the year before the ICH. We used the case-crossover design to calculate relative risks (RR) for potential trigger factors. RESULTS We interviewed 149 patients (mean age 64, 66% male) with ICH. Sixty-seven (45%) had a lobar hemorrhage, 60 (40%) had a deep hemorrhage, 19 (13%) had a cerebellar hemorrhage, and 3 (2%) had an intraventricular hemorrhage. For ICH in general, there was an increased risk within an hour after caffeine consumption (RR=2.5 [95% CI=1.8-3.6]), within an hour after coffee consumption alone (RR=4.8 [95% CI=3.3-6.9]), within an hour after lifting >25 kg (RR=6.6 [95% CI=2.2-19.9]), within an hour after minor head trauma (RR=10.1 [95% CI=1.7-60.2]), within an hour after sexual activity (RR=30.4 [95% CI=16.8-55.0]), within an hour after straining for defecation (RR=37.6 [95% CI=22.4-63.4]), and within an hour after vigorous exercise (RR=21.8 [95% CI=12.6-37.8]). Within 24 hours after flu-like disease or fever, the risk for ICH was also increased (RR=50.7 [95% CI=27.1-95.1]). Within an hour after Valsalva maneuvers, the RR for deep ICH was 3.5 (95% CI=1.7-6.9) and for lobar ICH the RR was 2.0 (95% CI=0.9-4.2).

CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women increased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic. Pregnant women are more concerned about others than themselves during COVID-19, and younger pregnant women seem to be more prone to anxiety, while social support and physical activity can reduce the likelihood of anxiety and depression.

In contrast, participants exhibited significant reductions in perceived importance and compliance, with evidence of more negative changes in younger participants. The largest changes were a substantial reduction in perceived government effectiveness, from predominantly positive perceptions to predominantly negative perceptions. INTERPRETATION: These results illuminate evolving trends in public health compliance and perceptions over the course of the pandemic in Canada, revealing the malleability of public perceptions of public health recommendations and government effectiveness.

We use the outbreak of an infectious disease as our running example. The public health setting has several characteristics distinguishing it from typical bandit settings, such as distribution shift (the true disease prevalence is changing with time) and batched sampling (multiple decisions must be made simultaneously). Nevertheless, we demonstrate that several bandit algorithms are capable out-performing greedy resource allocation strategies, which often perform worse than random allocation as they fail to notice outbreaks in new areas.","output":"Reconciling Risk Allocation and Prevalence Estimation in Public Health Using Batched Bandits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

However, little is known about potentially vulnerable groups during the final stage of the lockdown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey study was to assess the mental health burden of different professions in China in order to find vulnerable groups, possible influencing factors, and successful ways of coping during the last 4 weeks of the lockdown in Hubei Province. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey asked participants about current residence, daily working hours, exposure to COVID-19 at work, and media preferences. We used a shortened version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess mental health. Further assessments included perceived stress (Simplified Chinese version of the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale), coping strategies for all participants, and specific stressors for health care workers. We followed the reporting guidelines of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement for observational studies. RESULTS: The sample (N=687) consisted of 158 doctors, 221 nurses, 24 other medical staff, 43 students, 60 teachers/government staff, 135 economy staff, 26 workers/farmers, and 20 professions designated under the \\"other\\" category. We found increased depression (n=123, 17.9%), anxiety (n=208, 30.3%), and stress (n=94, 13.7%) in our sample. Professions that were vulnerable to depression were other medical staff and students. Doctors, nurses, and students were vulnerable to anxiety; and other medical staff, students, and economy staff were vulnerable to stress. Coping strategies were reduced to three factors: active, mental, and emotional. Being female and emotional coping were independently associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. Applying active coping strategies showed lower odds for anxiety while mental coping strategies showed lower odds for depression, anxiety, and stress. Age, being inside a lockdown area, exposure to COVID-19 at work, and having a high workload (8-12 hours per day) were not associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. WeChat was the preferred way of staying informed across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: By the end of the lockdown, a considerable part of the Chinese population showed increased levels of depression and anxiety. Students and other medical staff were the most affected, while economy staff were highly stressed. Doctors and nurses need support regarding potential anxiety disorders. Future work should focus on longitudinal results of the pandemic and develop targeted preventive measures.","output":"Mental Health Burden in Different Professions During the Final Stage of the COVID-19 Lockdown in China: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aortic dissection is a rapid and critical cardiovascular disease. The automatic segmentation and detection of related organs and lesions in CT volumes of aortic dissection provide great help for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissection. However, the diagnosis of aortic dissection involves multi-organ and lesion segmentation, which is also a multi-label segmentation problem. It faces many challenges, such as small target scale, variable location of the true and false lumen, and complex judgment. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a deep model (MOLS-Net) to segment and detect aortic dissection from CT volumes quickly and automatically. First, the sequence feature pyramid attention module correlates CT image sequence features of different scales and guides the current image segmentation by exploring the correlation between slices. Secondly, combine the spatial attention module and the channel attention module in the decoder of the network to strengthen the models positioning accuracy of the target area and the feature utilization. Thirdly, this paper designs a multi-label classifier for the inter-class relationship of multi-label segmentation of aortic dissection and realizes multi-label segmentation on the end-to-end network. In this paper, we evaluate MOLS-Net on multiple datasets (self-made aortic dissection segmentation dataset and COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset), and the results show that the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.","output":"MOLS-Net: Multi-organ and lesion segmentation network based on sequence feature pyramid and attention mechanism for aortic dissection diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are believed to be reservoir hosts for a number of emerging and re-emerging viruses, many of which are responsible for illness and mortality in humans, livestock and other animals.

The detailed mechanism for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in infected cells remains elusive. In the current study, we demonstrate that mitochondria were a major ROS source in EV71-infected cells. Mitochondria in productively infected cells underwent morphologic changes and exhibited functional anomalies, such as a decrease in mitochondrial electrochemical potential (m) and an increase in oligomycin-insensitive oxygen consumption. Respiratory control ratio of mitochondria from infected cells was significantly lower than that of normal cells. The total adenine nucleotide pool and ATP content of EV71-infected cells significantly diminished. However, there appeared to be a compensatory increase in mitochondrial mass. Treatment with mito-TEMPO reduced eIF2 phosphorylation and viral replication, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS act to promote viral replication.

Chemical reductions of hypocrellins under anaerobic conditions identified the origin of hypomycin A (4), hypomycin C (5), and hypomycin E (6), which in turn served to confirm 4 and revise the absolute configurations of 5 and 6.

LDS Type 3 typically manifests as aortic aneurysms and early-onset osteoarthritis, however other dermatologic, cardiovascular, and skeletal abnormalities have been reported. Case: A 51-year-old woman was referred to the cardiology clinic for episodes of palpitations, syncope, chest pain, and shortness of breath during the COVID-19 pandemic. She had a history of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal aneurysm, pre-COVID myocarditis, mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation, and pericarditis. She also has a pertinent medical history of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her family and social history were remarkable for a daughter with SLE. Cardiopulmonary and general physical exams were remarkable for hypermobility. Evaluation with an ECG and Holter monitor showed normal sinus rhythm with unifocal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) that correlated with her symptoms. Decision-making: The patient was initially managed un-successfully with beta and calcium channel blockers. Cardiac ablation was subsequently performed on a left ventricular septal focus with remote magnetic navigation using the Niobe system from Stereotaxis inc. (due to its low risk for cardiac perforation). At 6 months follow up, the patient exhibited an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction from 40-50% to 55-60%, fewer symptoms, and fewer PVCs.

Generic product explanations, unhelpful images, and visually appealing user experiences are provided to average eyes in online shopping, and they are incompatible with visually impaired people, even with visually impaired assistive devices. Due to visual barriers and inaccessible user experiences, the visually impaired are struggling to do online shopping independently. During this COVID-19 pandemic situation, online shopping is one of the better ways to meet everyone's needs and wants. Ordinary individuals can meet their needs and desires, but the visually impaired and elderly people who live alone find it difficult to manage their daily life. Therefore, we have come up with a solution for this by having an online shopping mobile application. Our objective with this application is to assist visually impaired and elderly individuals in meeting their underlying needs and to help them in this pandemic situation. This paper presents an online shopping mobile application for visually impaired and elderly people that allows them to shop online in a variety of convenient ways. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"A Bilingual Audio Based Online Shopping Mobile Application for Visually Impaired and the Elderly People"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION In the past five years, there have been 1,936 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 27 countries, with a mortality rate of 35.6%. Most cases have arisen in the Middle East, particularly the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, however there was a large hospital-associated outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015. Exposure to dromedary camels has been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a risk factor in primary cases, but the exact mechanisms of transmission are not clear. Rigorous application of nationally defined infection prevention and control measures has reduced the levels of healthcare facility-associated outbreaks. There is currently no approved specific therapy or vaccine available. Areas covered: This review presents an overview of MERS-CoV within the last five years, with a particular emphasis on the key areas of transmission, infection control and prevention, and therapies and vaccines. Expert commentary: MERS-CoV remains a significant threat to public health as transmission mechanisms are still not completely understood. There is the potential for mutations that could increase viral transmission and/or virulence, and zoonotic host range. The high mortality rate highlights the need to expedite well-designed randomized clinical trials for direct, effective therapies and vaccines.","output":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: five years later."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, there is an increasing trend of air pollution that has brought the most alarming situation for the health of humans in some developing countries.

Currently there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Thus, early recognition of patients at high risk is important. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. We compared the effectiveness of three scoring systems: the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) systems, for predicting the prognosis of COVID-19. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used for these assessments, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to identify the cumulative risk for 28-day mortality according to the NEWS stratification. RESULTS: For predicting 28-day mortality, NEWS was superior to qSOFA (AUROC, 0.867 vs. 0.779, P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference between NEWS and SIRS (AUROC, 0.867 vs. 0.639, P = 0.100). For predicting critical outcomes, NEWS was superior to both SIRS (AUROC, 0.918 vs. 0.744, P = 0.032) and qSOFA (AUROC, 0.918 vs. 0.760, P = 0.012). Survival time was significantly shorter for patients with NEWS  7 than for patients with NEWS < 7.

As seen from the cases of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, worldwide crises associated with infections and their side effects are likely to recur in the future because of extensive international interactions. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify the factors that can mitigate disease spread. We observed that the transmission speed and severity of consequences of COVID-19 varied substantially across countries, signaling the need for a country-level investigation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate how distancing-enabling information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and medical ICT infrastructure, and related policies have affected the cumulative number of confirmed cases, fatality rate, and initial speed of transmission across different countries. METHODS: We analyzed the determinants of COVID-19 transmission during the relatively early days of the pandemic by conducting regression analysis based on our data for country-level characteristics, including demographics, culture, ICT infrastructure, policies, economic status, and transmission of COVID-19. To gain further insights, we conducted a subsample analysis for countries with low population density. RESULTS: Our full sample analysis showed that implied telehealth policy, which refers to the lack of a specific telehealth-related policy but presence of a general eHealth policy, was associated with lower fatality rates when controlled for cultural characteristics (P=.004). In particular, the fatality rate for countries with an implied telehealth policy was lower than that for others by 2.7%. Interestingly, stated telehealth policy, which refers to the existence of a specified telehealth policy, was found to not be associated with lower fatality rates (P=.30). Furthermore, countries with a government-run health website had 36% fewer confirmed cases than those without it, when controlled for cultural characteristics (P=.03). Our analysis further revealed that the interaction between implied telehealth policy and training ICT health was significant (P=.01), suggesting that implied telehealth policy may be more effective when in-service training on ICT is provided to health professionals. In addition, credit card ownership, as an enabler of convenient e-commerce transactions and distancing, showed a negative association with fatality rates in the full sample analysis (P=.04), but not in the subsample analysis (P=.76), highlighting that distancing-enabling ICT is more useful in densely populated countries. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate important relationships between national traits and COVID-19 infections, suggesting guidelines for policymakers to minimize the negative consequences of pandemics. The findings suggest physicians autonomous use of medical ICT and strategic allocation of distancing-enabling ICT infrastructure in countries with high population density to maximize efficiency.

In the present study, we explore how mitochondrial dysfunction impairs the coupling between metabolism and exocytosis in the pancreatic alpha and beta cells. We demonstrate that reduced mitochondrial ATP production is linked with the observed defects in insulin and glucagon secretion by utilizing computational modeling approach. Specifically, a 30C40% reduction in alpha cells mitochondrial function leads to a pathological shift of glucagon secretion, characterized by oversecretion at high glucose concentrations and insufficient secretion in hypoglycemia. In beta cells, the impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism is accompanied by reduced insulin secretion at all glucose levels, but the differences, compared to a normal beta cell, are the most pronounced in hyperglycemia.

Colorism or preference for lighter skin tones has a long history primarily linked to colonialism in parts of Asia and Africa. More recently, this preference for lighter skin has become amplified by growing and global whitening product industries dominated by multinational corporations. In India, the industry has tried to link lighter skin to economic success, specifically labor market success. However, the existence of such a link is yet to be explored given the lack of skin toneCspecific data in the global context. We implemented an experimental survey design in India to overcome this lack of data. Participants in our study were asked to evaluate job candidates on the basis of unchanging resumes paired with photographs manipulated to vary skin tones. We did not find a statistically significant bias in favor of resumes paired with lighter-skinned photographs. Overall, participants tended to evaluate both lighter-skinned and darker-skinned candidates similarly. Our findings suggest that colorism in India cannot be easily linked to direct instances of hiring discrimination. Differential outcomes due to preference for skin color though might operate in other economic contexts beyond entry into employment. It may also exist in social contexts like marriage and family or health outcomes and in situations where beauty ideals are more relevant.

There is an increasing number of neurological complications recognized with COVID-19 including patients with GBS and its variants. DEVELOPMENT: A review of the clinical cases of GBS associated to COVID-19 infection published in the last months has been developed. We included 48 patients (31 men, mean age 56.4 years). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were cough (60.4%) and fever (56.3%). Mean time from COVID-19 symptoms to neurologic manifestations was 12.1 days, but in nine patients (18.8%) developed GBS within seven days. Eleven patients (22.9%) presented cranial nerve involvement in the absence of muscle weakness; 36 presented the classic sensory motor variant (75%) and one had a pure motor variant (2.1%). The electrodiagnostic pattern was considered demyelinating in 82.4% of the generalized variants. The presence of hyposmia/dysgeusia was associated with a latency shorter than seven days to GBS onset of symptoms (30% vs 15.6%), and cranial nerve involvement in the absence of weakness (30.8% vs 17.1%). Most patients (87.5%) were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. Neurological outcome was favorable in 64.6%; 29.2% had respiratory failure and 4.2% died shortly after being admitted.

Edible insects have already proven to be safe for the environment and with a high nutritional value, but Westerners are still reluctant towards this novel food. Therefore, the aims of this paper are twofold, and were tested on a sample of 202 Italian consumers. On one hand, we aimed to further develop a recently validated psychological instrument, the Entomophagy Attitude Questionnaire (EAQ), by combining it with a measure of perceived risk. On the other hand, we wanted to test whether different animals fed with insects would be accepted by consumers. Our results clearly show that the perceived risk does not significantly improve the predictive validity of EAQ, while, with respect to the second aim, we found that beef and pork reared with insects were less accepted than fish and poultry. ABSTRACT: Insects are a promising alternative protein source and their possible integration in the human diet has been extensively studied, also with reference to the degree of consumer acceptability and the main factors determining reluctance among Western consumers. Several studies have also proposed the use of protein meals derived from insects in animal feed as a possible way to promote the development of the insect chain. Consumer attitudes, perceived risks, and intention to eat insect-based foods have been extensively researched, yet the relationships between those factors are still unclear. On a sample of 202 Italian consumers, the present research used the Entomophagy Attitude Questionnaire (EAQ) to analyse the degree of acceptability of insects as food and meat obtained from animals raised on insect-based feeds with a specific focus on the role of attitudes and perceived risk. The research also evaluated the differences in acceptability between different types of animals fed with insects. The results show that the intention to engage in entomophagy is significantly correlated with all three of the EAQs subscales, as well as with perceived risk. However, the effect of perceived risk does not significantly improve the predictive validity of EAQ with respect to the intention to eat insect-based food. The results also show that the degree of acceptability for different insect meal-reared animals changes among consumers: beef and pork are characterized by a lower degree of acceptability, while poultry and fish are more accepted by consumers.","output":"Perceived Risk of Insect-Based Foods: An Assessment of the Entomophagy Attitude Questionnaire Predictive Validity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An effective therapeutic cancer vaccine should be empowered with the capacity to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

Therefore, measuring and analyzing online health communication and public sentiment is essential for establishing effective and efficient disease control policies, especially in the early stage of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the trends of online health communication, analyze the focus of peoples anxiety in the early stages of COVID-19, and evaluate the appropriateness of online information. METHODS: We collected 13,148 questions and 29,040 answers related to COVID-19 from Naver, the most popular Korean web portal (January 20, 2020, to March 2, 2020). Three main methods were used in this study: (1) the structural topic model was used to examine the topics in the online questions; (2) word network analysis was conducted to analyze the focus of peoples anxiety and worry in the questions; and (3) two medical doctors assessed the appropriateness of the answers to the questions, which were primarily related to peoples anxiety. RESULTS: A total of 50 topics and 6 cohesive topic communities were identified from the questions. Among them, topic community 4 (suspecting COVID-19 infection after developing a particular symptom) accounted for the largest portion of the questions. As the number of confirmed patients increased, the proportion of topics belonging to topic community 4 also increased. Additionally, the prolonged situation led to a slight increase in the proportion of topics related to job issues. Peoples anxieties and worries were closely related with physical symptoms and self-protection methods. Although relatively appropriate to suspect physical symptoms, a high proportion of answers related to self-protection methods were assessed as misinformation or advertisements. CONCLUSIONS: Search activity for online information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak has been active. Many of the online questions were related to peoples anxieties and worries. A considerable portion of corresponding answers had false information or were advertisements. The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public anxiety and provide appropriate information in the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, including COVID-19.

The protease inhibitor assay on recombinant FIPV 3CL(pro) was performed to screen the inhibitory effect of the candidate compounds with IC(50) ranging from 6.36  2.15 to 78.40  2.60 M. As determined by the cell-based assay, the compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 showed better EC(50) values than the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir, under all the test conditions including pre-viral entry, post-viral entry, and prophylactic activity. The NSC87511 particularly yielded the best selective index (>4; range of SI = 13.80C22.90). These results indicated that the natural small-molecular compounds specifically targeted the 3CL(pro) of FIPV and inhibited its replication. Structural modification of these compounds may generate a higher anti-viral potency for the further development of a novel therapy against FIP.","output":"In silico and in vitro analysis of small molecules and natural compounds targeting the 3CL protease of feline infectious peritonitis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herd immunity offers protection to a population when adequate numbers of people are immune to an infectious disease to prevent its spread Those who recover from COVID-19 and those who receive a vaccine (as and when there is one) are expected to develop some immunity, at least for some period of time With Severe acute Respiratory Syndrome- coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2), how long the immunity will last is not yet known as currently there is no vaccine Achieving herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be the biggest leap toward returning to a near-normal pre-COVID-19 life, as social distancing guidelines and lockdowns may carry on while the virus persists and people continue to get infected and die This article is an attempt to throw some light on the concept of herd immunity in context to COVID-19 and the implications thereof","output":"Can herd immunity be relied on as a strategy to combat COVID-19?

To investigate the expression level of these SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry genes in lung airway, public gene expression datasets were used. We have found a differential expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal and bronchial airways relative to age and diseases status. Children were found to have significantly lower expression of COVID-19 receptors in the upper and lower airways (nasal and bronchial). Moreover, the lung airway expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found to be significantly upregulated in smokers compared to non-smokers; and in patients with COPD compared to healthy. No difference was observed in the blood expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between children and adults, or in COPD or diabetic patients. However, a significant increase in blood expression levels of these genes was observed in patients with essential hypertension; while only ACE2 was upregulated in the blood of asthmatic. These results suggest that the observed difference in COVID-19 severity between children and adults could, in part, be attributed to the difference in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 airways tissue expression levels.","output":"Expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 in the lung airways is lower in children compared to adults and increases due to smoking and COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid and accurate detection of community outbreaks is critical to address the threat of resurgent waves of COVID-19.

We hypothesized that possible changes in anxiety status during the COVID-19 pandemic might affect blood pressure in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: This is an observational cross-sectional study. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were applied to 71 prevalent HD patients. Pre-dialysis blood pressure was measured, and the systolic blood pressure measurements of 6 consecutive HD sessions were averaged. All assessments were performed both at the beginning (March) and after the end (June) of the partial lockdown, which was officially instituted by the Government in Turkey. Results: The mean age (+/- SD) was 59.2 +/- 14.8 years and 52% of the patients were female. The STAI-State score was higher in March than in June (44.6 +/- 12.6 vs. 42.3 +/- 11.5, respectively, P =.047), whereas the HADS-Anxiety, HADS-Depression, and STAI-Trait scores were not different. The pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in March than in June (127.9 +/- 20.3 vs. 124.8 +/- 22.8 mmHg, respectively, P =.029).

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to events related to COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. METHODS: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. RESULTS: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic.

Methods Plasmids carrying gene sequences containing 9 mutation types in 7 mutated sites (HV6970del, N501Y, K417N, P681H, D614G, E484K, L452R, E484Q and P681R) in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants were synthesized. Using the nucleic acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 nonvariant and a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 variant-carrying plasmid, a MALDI-TOF MS method based on the single-base mass probe extension of multiplex PCR amplification products was established to detect the above nine mutation types. The detection limit of this method was determined via the concentration gradient method. Twenty-one respiratory tract pathogens (9 bacteria, 11 respiratory viruses) and pharyngeal swab nucleic acid samples from healthy people were selected for specific validation. Sixteen samples from COVID-19 patients were used to verify the accuracy of this method. Results The 9 mutation types could be detected simultaneously by triple PCR amplification coupled with MALDI-TOF MS. SARS-CoV-2 and all six variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.429, B.1.526, P.1 and B.1.617) could be identified. The detection limit for all 9 sites was 1560 copies. The specificity of this method was 100%, and the accuracy of real-time PCR CT values less than 30 among positive samples was 100%. This method is open and extensible, and can be used in a high-throughput manner, easily allowing the addition of new mutation sites as needed to identify and track new SARS-CoV-2 variants as they emerge. Conclusions Multiplex PCR-MALDI-TOF MS provides a new detection option with practical application value for SARS-CoV-2 and its variant infection.","output":"A novel strategy for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants based on multiplex PCR-MALDI-TOF MS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current management efforts of COVID-19 include: early diagnosis, use of antivirals, and immune modulation.

Numerous antiarrhythmic agents, antimicrobial drugs, psychotropic medications, and methadone, as well as a growing list of drugs from other therapeutic classes (neurological drugs, anticancer agents, and many others), can prolong the QT interval and provoke torsades de pointes. Perhaps less familiar to clinicians is the fact that drugs can also trigger other arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, and Brugada syndrome. Some drug-induced arrhythmias (bradyarrhythmias, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia) are significant predominantly because of their symptoms; others (monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome, torsades de pointes) may result in serious consequences, including sudden cardiac death. Mechanisms of arrhythmias are well known for some medications but, in other instances, remain poorly understood. For some drug-induced arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, risk factors are well defined. Modification of risk factors, when possible, is important for prevention and risk reduction. In patients with nonmodifiable risk factors who require a potentially arrhythmia-inducing drug, enhanced electrocardiographic and other monitoring strategies may be beneficial for early detection and treatment. Management of drug-induced arrhythmias includes discontinuation of the offending medication and following treatment guidelines for the specific arrhythmia. In overdose situations, targeted detoxification strategies may be needed. Awareness of drugs that may cause arrhythmias and knowledge of distinct arrhythmias that may be drug-induced are essential for clinicians.

We aimed to examine the characteristics of the cells detected in the pathological rate and/or appearance and whether these findings are related to the clinical course by evaluating the peripheral blood smear at the time of diagnosis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Clinical features, laboratory data, peripheral blood smear of fifty patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR was evaluated at diagnosis. Peripheral smear samples of the patients were compared with the age and sex-matched 30 healthy controls. Pictures were taken from the patients peripheral blood smear. Patients were divided into two groups. Mild and severe stage patient groups were compared in terms of laboratory data and peripheral smear findings. The relationship between the laboratory values of all patients and the duration of hospitalization was analyzed. RESULTS: The number of segmented neutrophils and eosinophils were low, pseudo-Pelger-Huet, pseudo-Pelger-Huet/mature lymphocyte ratio, atypical lymphocytes, monocytes with vacuoles, bands, and pyknotic neutrophils rates were higher in the peripheral blood smear of the patient group (p <0.05). Increased pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly, pseudo-Pelger Huet/mature lymphocyte ratio, a decreased number of mature lymphocytes, and eosinophils in peripheral blood smear were observed in the severe stage patients (p <0.05). A negative correlation was observed between hospitalization duration and mature lymphocyte and monocytes with vacuoles rates (p <0.05). CONCLUSION: A peripheral blood smear is an inexpensive, easily performed, and rapid test.

Monitoring and treatment of PKU patients can be complicated in challenging circumstances as pandemics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of telemedicine for monitoring and treatment of PKU patients on metabolic outcome during coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed as PKU and treated with low Phe diet, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), or BH4 adjunct with low Phe diet were enrolled. Study period was divided into two periods: prepandemic period wherein patients were followed up in outpatients' clinic and during pandemic wherein telemedicine was used. Demographic findings, laboratory results, and therapy responses were reviewed retrospectively and compared between the two periods. All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the local ethical committee of Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty (17/11/2020-151640) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. Results: Ninety-three (n = 93) patients were enrolled to this study. The ratio of the samples with Phe levels in the recommended ranges was found to be statistically higher during the pandemic wherein an online monitoring system was used in all treatment modalities (p < 0.05). The decrease in Phe washout frequency was statistically significant during the pandemic in the low Phe diet group (p < 0.05). Considering the relationship between Phe tolerance before and during the pandemic, a significant increase in Phe tolerance was noted during the pandemic in the low Phe diet group (p < 0.05).

As secondary objectives, we would like to: i) assess the efficacy of the use of PrEP with hydroxychloroquine against placebo in healthcare workers with high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in reducing their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (defined by seroconversion) during an epidemic period, ii) evaluate the safety of PrEP with hydroxychloroquine in adults, iii) describe the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, iv) identify clinical, analytical and microbiological predictors of COVID-19 among healthcare workers at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, v) set up a repository of serum samples obtained from healthcare workers at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for future research on blood markers to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. TRIAL DESIGN: Multicentre double-blind parallel design (ratio 1:1) randomized controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 440 healthcare workers of four Spanish hospitals (Hospital Clnic of Barcelona, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau of Barcelona, Hospital Plat of Barcelona, Hospital General de Granollers, Barcelona) will be recruited. Participants are considered to be at high-risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their frequent contact with suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. For eligibility, healthcare workers with 18 years old or older working at least 3 days a week in a hospital with both negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and serological COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are invited to participate. Participants with any of the following conditions are excluded: pregnancy, breastfeeding, ongoing antiviral, antiretroviral or corticosteroids treatment, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine uptake the last month or any contraindication to hydroxychloroquine treatment. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention group (PrEP): participants will receive the standard of care and will take 400mg of hydroxychloroquine (2 tablets of 200 mg per Dolquine? tablet) daily the first four consecutive days, followed by 400 mg weekly for a period of 6 months. Control group: participants will receive placebo tablets with identical physical appearance to hydroxychloroquine 200 mg (Dolquine?) tablets following the same treatment schedule of the intervention group. Both groups will be encouraged to use the personal protection equipment (PPE) for COVID-19 prevention according to current hospital guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint will be the number of confirmed cases of a COVID-19 (defined by a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 with seroconversion) in the PrEP group compared to the placebo group at any time during the 6 months of the follow-up in healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology at day 0. As secondary endpoints, we will obtain: i) the SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in the PrEP group compared to placebo during the 6 months of follow-up in healthcare workers with negative serology at day 0; ii) the occurrence of any adverse event related with hydroxychloroquine treatment; iii) the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 among healthcare workers in the non-PrEP group, among the total of healthcare workers included in the non-PrEP group during the study period; iv) the risk ratio for the different clinical, analytical and microbiological conditions to develop COVID-19; v) a repository of serum samples obtained from healthcare workers confirmed COVID-19 cases for future research on blood markers to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. RANDOMISATION: Participants meeting all eligibility requirements will be allocated to one of the two study arms (PrEP with hydroxychloroquine or non-PrEP control group) in a 1:1 ratio using simple randomisation with computer generated random numbers. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, doctors and nurses caring for participants, and investigators assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment.

Molecular docking-based virtual screening studies predict that novel vitamin D and related lumisterol hydroxymetabolites are able to bind to the active sites of two SARS-CoV-2 transcription machinery enzymes with high affinity. These enzymes are the main protease (M(pro)) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which play important roles in viral replication and establishing infection. Based on predicted binding affinities and specific interactions, we identified 10 vitamin D3 (D3) and lumisterol (L3) analogs as likely binding partners of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and RdRP and, therefore, tested their ability to inhibit these enzymes. Activity measurements demonstrated that 25(OH)L3, 24(OH)L3, and 20(OH)7DHC are the most effective of the hydroxymetabolites tested at inhibiting the activity of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) causing 10%C19% inhibition. These same derivatives as well as other hydroxylumisterols and hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolites inhibited RdRP by 50%C60%. Thus, inhibition of these enzymes by vitamin D and lumisterol metabolites may provide a novel approach to hindering the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We examined changes in patterns of cancer diagnosis and surgical treatment in 2020 using real-time electronic pathology report data from population-based SEER cancer registries in Georgia and Louisiana. Methods: Bi-weekly numbers, distributions, and patterns of pathology reports were compared between January 1 and December 31 in 2020 and the same period in 2019 by age group and cancer site. Results: During 2020, there were 29,905 fewer pathology reports than in 2019, representing a 10.2% decline. Absolute declines were greatest among adults aged 50 years (N=23,065);percentage declines were greatest among children and young adults 18 years (38.3%). By cancer site, percentage declines were greatest for lung cancer (17.4%), followed by colorectal (12.0%), breast (9.0%) and prostate (5.8%) cancers. Biweekly reports were statistically significantly lower in 2020 than in 2019 from late March through the end of December in most biweekly periods. The nadir was the month of April 2020 - the number of reports was at least 40% lower than in April 2019. The number of reports in 2020 compared with 2019 also declined sharply in early November (26.8%) and late December (32.0%). Numbers of reports in 2020 never consistently exceeded those in 2019 after the first decline. Patterns were similar by cancer site, with variation in magnitude and duration of declines. Conclusions: Significant declines in cancer pathology reports from population-based registries during 2020 suggest substantial delays in screening, evaluation of signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment services for cancers with effective screening tests as well as in cancer sites and age groups without effective screening tests as an indirect result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study population consisted of adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccination hospitalized between May 1 and June 28 2021 with respiratory symptoms. Cases were defined as patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR during the first 48 hours of admission or within 14 days prior to hospital admission. Controls were patients tested negative at admission and did not have a positive test during the 2 weeks prior to hospitalization. VE was calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for calendar week, sex, age, comorbidity and nursing home residency. Subgroup analysis was performed for age, sex and different comorbidities. Secondary endpoints were ICU-admission and mortality. Results: 379 cases and 255 controls were included of whom 157 (18%) were vaccinated prior to admission.

Hence, new antiviral strategies must focus not only on synthetic molecules but also on potential natural compounds. In this report, we have combined the in vitro cell culture and in silico molecular docking methods to assess the novel anti-HBV activity and delineate the inhibitory mechanism of selected plant-derived pure compounds of different classes. Of the tested (2.5-50 g/ml) twelve non-cytotoxic compounds, ten (10 g/ml) were found to maximally inhibit HBsAg production at day 5.

Further assessment of quercetin in combination with the highly active compounds, enhanced its anti-HBV activity up to 10%. Being the most important drug target, a 3-D structure of HBV polymerase (Pol/RT) was modeled and docked with the active compounds, including lamivudine as standard. Docking of lamivudine indicated strong interaction with the modeled HBV Pol active-site residues that formed stable complex (?G = ?5.2 kcal/mol).

A substantial proportion of all human populations studied to date have MBL deficiency due to MBL2 polymorphisms, which potentially increases susceptibility to infectious disease. MBL binds numerous respiratory pathogens but the capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae abrogates its efficient binding. Clinical studies in humans have shown that MBL deficiency appears to predispose to severe respiratory tract infection. A recent meta-analysis shows that MBL deficiency was associated with death in patients with pneumococcal infection after adjusting for bacteraemia and comorbidities. Human clinical studies have also shown associations between MBL deficiency and various less common respiratory infections. Intracellular infections like tuberculosis may be less common with MBL deficiency because of reduced opsonophagocytosis. Lung secretions contain small amounts of MBL that are potentially sufficient to activate complement, but their measurement is confounded by dilution inherent in collection techniques. Therefore, if this protein does play a role in pulmonary immunity it is presumably through prevention of haematogenous dissemination of respiratory pathogens while adding to mucosal defences. Ficolins are collectins that are structurally and functionally related to MBL and are either present in serum or expressed in tissues including the lung. Limited variation in serum levels of L- and H-ficolin result from the presence of FCN2 and FCN3 polymorphisms. Initial studies on the impact of FCN2 polymorphisms or low L-ficolin levels do not seem to show major associations with respiratory infection. MBL is being developed as a new immunotherapeutic agent for prevention of infection in immunocompromised hosts. The available literature suggests that it may also be of benefit in MBL deficient patients with severe pneumonia.

For many, social distancing has become a form of civic duty and expression of unity. In the classic Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam describes community-mindedness as an important pillar of social capital that promotes civic engagement. We hypothesize that citizens who exhibit higher levels of social capital are more likely to socially distance. To test the hypothesis, we utilize publicly available county-level data from Kansas (105 counties) and Nebraska (93 counties) and proxy social capital with county voter turnout from the 2016 presidential election. To gauge social distancing, we use social distancing grades as assigned by Unacast, a company specializing in mobility data. We discover social capital has a significant impact on distancing. In other words, counties with the highest levels of voter turnout produced the best social distancing grades. Furthermore, population is not a signifi cant predictor of social distancing. A vast majority of the counties examined were in fact rural. Rural counties with high numbers of infections largely those with oligopoly in the meatpacking industry-yield better social distancing grades than the most populated counties. ? 2021 by the Center for Great Plains Studies, University of NebraskaCLincoln.","output":"Staying home on the range: Social capital and social distancing in the great plains during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Training is a company strategy to improve employee performance competencies.

Bovine lactoferrin (bLF) is a multifunctional protein with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This study aimed to clarify the inhibitory effects of bLF on the pathological progression of RA. The mannan-induced arthritis model in SKG mice (genetic RA model) was used. Orally applied liposomal bLF (LbLF) markedly reduced ankle joint swelling and bone destruction. Histologically, pannus formation and osteoclastic bone destruction were prevented in the LbLF-treated animals. Moreover, orally administered LbLF improved the balance between Th17 cells and regulatory T cells isolated from the spleen of mannan-treated SKG mice. In an in vitro study, the anti-inflammatory effects of bLF on TNF--induced TNF- production and downstream signaling pathways were analyzed in human synovial fibroblasts from RA patients (RASFs). bLF suppressed TNF- production from RASFs by inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. The intracellular accumulation of bLF in RASFs increased in an applied bLF dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of the lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) siRNA gene reduced bLF expression in RASFs, indicating that exogenously applied bLF was mainly internalized through LRP-1. Immunoprecipitated proteins with anti-TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2; an adapter protein/ubiquitin ligase) included bLF, indicating that bLF binds directly to the TRAF2-TRADD-RIP complex. This indicates that LbLF may effectively prevent the pathological progression of RA by suppressing TNF- production by binding to the TRAF2-TRADD-RIP complex from the RASFs in the pannus. Therefore, supplemental administration of LbLF may have a beneficial effect on preventive/therapeutic reagents for RA.","output":"Oral administration of bovine lactoferrin suppresses the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in an SKG mouse model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread uncontrollably worldwide while it remains unknown how vulnerable populations, such as Down syndrome (DS) individuals are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with DS have more risk of infections with respiratory complications and present signs of auto-inflammation. They also present with multiple comorbidities that are associated with poorer COVID-19 prognosis in the general population. All this might place DS individuals at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or poorer clinical outcomes. In order to get insight into the interplay between DS genes and SARS-cov2 infection and pathogenesis we identified the genes associated with the molecular pathways involved in COVID-19 and the host proteins interacting with viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2. We then analyzed the overlaps of these genes with HSA21 genes, HSA21 interactors and other genes consistently differentially expressed in DS (using public transcriptomic datasets) and created a DS-SARS-CoV-2 network. We detected COVID-19 protective and risk factors among HSA21 genes and interactors and/or DS deregulated genes that might affect the susceptibility of individuals with DS both at the infection stage and in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our analysis suggests that at the infection stage DS individuals might be more susceptible to infection due to triplication of TMPRSS2, that primes the viral S protein for entry in the host cells. However, as the anti-viral interferon I signaling is also upregulated in DS, this might increase the initial anti-viral response, inhibiting viral genome release, viral replication and viral assembly. In the second pro-inflammatory immunopathogenic phase of the infection, the prognosis for DS patients might worsen due to upregulation of inflammatory genes that might favor the typical cytokine storm of COVID-19. We also detected strong downregulation of the NLRP3 gene, critical for maintenance of homeostasis against pathogenic infections, possibly leading to bacterial infection complications.","output":"Network analysis of Down syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 identifies risk and protective factors for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since COVID-19 in the pediatric population is infrequently severe, the indirect costs of the pandemic, related to the measures implemented to deal with the spread of the virus, can be worse than the infection itself.

Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semi-permissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of vRNA at multiple timepoints, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in two respective studies, while respiratory transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To assess the durability of immunity, ferrets were re-challenged 28 or 56 days post-primary infection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets against infection, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S-protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined these studies demonstrate that in ferrets direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity. Importance The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against re-infection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract.

Two MCDA assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 N gene and ORF1ab was designed. The fastest time to detection and sensitivity of MCDA was compared to LAMP and rt-PCR using DNA standards and transcribed RNA. For N gene, MCDA was faster than LAMP and rt-PCR by 10 and 20 minutes, respectively with fastest time to detection at 5.2 minutes. rt-PCR had highest sensitivity with limit of detection at 10 copies/{micro}l compared with MCDA (100 copies/{micro}l) and LAMP (500 copies/{micro}l).

Could a large health care system safely and rapidly implement awake self-prone positioning in COVID-19 units to prevent respiratory failure from progressing among a surge of inpatients? REVIEW OF EVIDENCE The team extensively reviewed the literature. Using evidence from 22 case reports, peer-reviewed standards, and studies, they developed an awake self-prone positioning guideline. IMPLEMENTATION The guideline was implemented in April 2020 in critical care and COVID-19 units. Multimodal education included a concise guideline and real-time support from intensive care unit nurses, clinical nurse specialists, and nursing professional development specialists. EVALUATION Awake self-prone positioning was a new procedure, and relevant data were obtained from the electronic medical record. From March 18 to August 5, 2020, 1000 COVID-19-related admissions occurred; 272 patients had a high-flow nasal cannula, 111 (41%) of whom had documentation of awake self-prone positioning. SUSTAINABILITY This guideline is now an established part of COVID-19 care and has been integrated into practice in units caring for patients with the disease. CONCLUSIONS Nurses adapted quickly to using awake self-prone positioning as a plan of care for hypoxic patients.

Yet, nursing home routines frequently disturb residents sleep through use of noise, light, or efforts to reduce incontinence. Nursing home residents with Alzheimers disease and or related dementiasalmost two-thirds of long-stay nursing home residentsare likely to be particularly affected by sleep disturbance. Addressing these issues, this study protocol implements an evidence-based intervention to improve sleep: a nursing home frontline staff huddling program known as LOCK. The LOCK program is derived from evidence supporting strengths-based learning, systematic observation, relationship-based teamwork, and efficiency. METHODS: This study protocol outlines a NIH Stage III, real-world hybrid efficacy-effectiveness pragmatic trial of the LOCK sleep intervention. Over two phases, in a total of 27 non-VA nursing homes from 3 corporations, the study will (1) refine the LOCK program to focus on sleep for residents with dementia, (2) test the impact of the LOCK sleep intervention for nursing home residents with dementia, and (3) evaluate the interventions sustainability. Phase 1 (1 year; n = 3 nursing homes; 1 per corporation) will refine the intervention and train-the-trainer protocol and pilot-tests all study methods. Phase 2 (4 years; n = 24 nursing homes; 8 per corporation) will use the refined intervention to conduct a wedge-design randomized, controlled, clinical trial. Phase 2 results will measure the LOCK sleep interventions impact on sleep (primary outcome) and on psychotropic medication use, pain and analgesic medication use, and activities of daily living decline (secondary outcomes). Findings will point to inter-facility variation in the programs implementation and sustainability.

We prospectively validate InSep, a 29-mRNA blood-based host response test for the prediction of bacterial and viral infections. Methods: The PROMPT trial is a prospective, non-interventional, multi-center randomized, controlled clinical trial that enrolled 397 adult patients presenting to the ED with signs of acute infection and at least one vital sign change. The infection status was adjudicated using chart review (including a syndromic molecular respiratory panel, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein) by three infectious disease physicians blinded to InSep results. InSep (version BVN-2) was performed using PAXgene Blood RNA processed and quantified on NanoString nCounter SPRINT. InSep results (likelihood of bacterial and viral infection) were compared to the adjudicated infection status. Results: Subject mean age was 64 years, comorbidities were significant for diabetes (17.1%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13.6%), and severe neurological disease (6.8%); 16.9% of subjects were immunocompromised. Infections were adjudicated as bacterial (14.1%), viral (11.3%) and noninfected (0.25%): 74.1% of subjects were adjudicated as indeterminate. InSep distinguished bacterial vs. viral/noninfected patients and viral vs. bacterial/noninfected patients using consensus adjudication with AUROCs of 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.99) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.96), respectively. AUROCs for bacterial vs. viral/noninfected patients were 0.88 (95%CI 0.79-0.96) for PCT, 0.80 (95% CI 0.72-89) for CRP and 0.78 (95% CI 0.69-0.87) for white blood cell counts (of note, the latter biomarkers were provided as part of clinical adjudication). To enable clinical actionability, InSep incorporates score cutoffs to allocate patients into interpretation bands. The Very Likely (rule in) InSep bacterial band showed a specificity of 98% compared to 94% for the corresponding PCT band (>0.5 ug/L); the Very Unlikely (rule-out) band showed a sensitivity of 95% for InSep compared to 86% for PCT. For the detection of viral infections, InSep demonstrated a specificity of 93% for the Very Likely band (rule in) and a sensitivity of 96% for the Very Unlikely band (rule out). Conclusion: InSep demonstrated high accuracy for predicting the presence of both bacterial and viral infections in ED patients with suspected acute infections or suspected sepsis.

Patient pre-LTx and perioperative characteristics as well as post-LTx outcomes are presented. Results Seven patients underwent DLTx for COVID-19 ARDS. All required mechanical ventilation (MV) pre-LTx. Six patients were male (85%), 5 Hispanic (71%), with a median age of 48 (IQR 40-53) and median body mass index of 23.6 (IQR 21.7-25.6). Six patients (85%) were on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) pre-LTx (one conversion from VV to veno-arterial (VA)). Median duration of MV and ECMO pre-LTx was 140 days (IQR 82-165) and 71.5 days (IQR 58-149), respectively. Two patients developed acute kidney injury pre-LTx requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Median time from listing to transplant was 17 days (IQR 10-24). ECMO was discontinued in all but 1 patient post-LTx. Median length of stay in the hospital post-LTx was 30 days (IQR 15-57). All were discharged from the hospital (43% to rehabilitation facility). Two patients on pre-LTx CRRT remained hemodialysis dependent and had multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections post-LTx. One readmission occurred for presumed rejection, aspiration and infection with MDR Klebsiella now requiring oxygen. All surgical pathology showed diffuse interstitial fibrosis consistent with the fibrotic sequelae of alveolar damage due to COVID-19. At 3-month follow-up, 6 patients (85%) did not need supplemental oxygen and had good pulmonary function. Conclusion Lung transplantation for COVID-ARDS is feasible.

Although COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, evidence suggests a strong predisposition for pro-thrombotic states with COVID-19 infection, manifesting as both venous and arterial thromboembolism. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and its varying complications contribute to a significant portion or morbidity and mortality in addition to respiratory failure. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old woman with stage IV colorectal carcinoma, rheumatic mitral valve stenosis status-post recent balloon valvulotomy, and atrial fibrillation on warfarin presented with fever, cough, anosmia, ageusia, dyspnea, generalized weakness, and anorexia. She was admitted for neutropenic fever, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and sepsis in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia, as well as a more unusual finding of a large 7 x 4 x 7 cm left atrial mass (Figure 1), consistent in appearance with a thrombus. Comparison with CTA chest one month prior confirmed that the thrombus was acute. On admission, the patient also had a supratherapeutic INR of 4. Echocardiography confirmed the suspicion for thrombus and redemonstrated restricted mitral valve leaflets consistent with rheumatic valvular stenosis. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, vancomycin, cefepime and filgrastim. She responded well and had resolution of her neutropenia, sepsis, and hypoxia. Because she formed the thrombus while on warfarin, decision was made to discontinue warfarin and transition to enoxaparin for anticoagulation. She was subsequently discharged home on hospice. DISCUSSION: Although venous thromboembolism is commonly encountered with COVID-19 patients, to our knowledge this case represents the first report of COVID-19 associated left atrial thrombus. Rheumatic mitral valve disease is a known risk factor for left atrial thrombus formation and colorectal carcinoma may have also contributed to hypercoagulability. However, the patient in our vignette had a supratherapeutic INR at the time of thrombus formation. Furthermore, the absence of thrombus on imaging one month prior confirms a temporal association with COVID-19 infection. As such, evidence suggests that hypercoagulability secondary to COVID-19 contributed to the formation of her left atrial thrombus. CONCLUSIONS: This case adds to the growing body of literature surrounding the profound hypercoagulability provoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection and reiterates the role of anticoagulation in the management of COVID-19 patients during the ongoing pandemic.

Many countries have launched COVID-19 mobile apps with a wide range in how these apps work. While it is hoped that these apps can assist in the fight against COVID-19, many are worried about user privacy. China implemented health code systems, which assigned neighborhoods and citizens a specific health code, meant to indicate their risk of having been exposed to COVID-19. The most widely used health code systems were hosted on the popular apps WeChat and Alipay, each with billions of users. Some experts argued that China's use of mobile applications was essential to its successful combat against COVID-19. Included in this study are a summary of mobile technology usage in China, a review of previous studies of mobile technology in healthcare, and a brief survey of some existing mobile applications for COVID-19 that were implemented. Also included are outcomes of interviews with healthcare and public safety experts and a public survey to understand how mobile applications were used in China's response to COVID-19. The interviews revealed four important themes: personal privacy, community involvement, government involvement, and situational specificity. It was found that a key concern was maintaining a balance between collecting and utilizing personal information, as well as protecting this information. In addition, close collaboration between local communities and the national government was essential. Mobile applications assisted in communication and coordination but did not replace the work of people such as delivery drivers and contact tracers. Our results also showed that there was room for improvement, especially accessibility for the elderly or those unfamiliar with technology. Similar results were obtained from our survey. It was interesting to find that the apps were mostly used for accessing information on COVID-19. In addition, respondents overwhelmingly identified information as the most valuable feature of COVID-19 apps. Both interview and survey results revealed the importance of providing information as a primary function of COVID-19 apps. Based on our findings we distilled four main lessons: mobile applications should assist in existing COVID-19 responses, inform users, protect users personal information, and adapt to users environments. We recommend that public health officials and app developers take these lessons into consideration when developing COVID-19-related mobile applications. In addition, we encourage researchers to utilize this report as a jumping off point for further research.","output":"Lessons on Mobile Apps for COVID-19 from China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare resources have been greatly limited by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic halting non-essential surgical cases without clear service expansion protocols. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We sought to compare the peri-operative outcomes of patients undergoing spine surgery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to a matched cohort prior to the pandemic. METHODS: We identified a consecutive sample of 127 adult patients undergoing spine surgery between March 9, 2020, and April 10, 2020, corresponding with the state of emergency declared in New York and the latest possible time for 1-month surgical follow-up. The study group was matched one-to-one based on age, gender, and body mass index with eligible control patients who underwent similar spine procedures prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Surgeries performed for infectious or oncologic indications were excluded. Intra- and post-operative complication rates, re-operations, hospital length of stay, re-admissions, post-operative visit format, development of post-operative fever and/or respiratory symptoms, and SAR-CoV2 testing. RESULTS: A total of 254 patients (127 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 127 matched controls) were included. One hundred fifty-eight were male (62%), and 96 were female (38%). The mean age in the pandemic group was 59.8  13.4 years; that of the matched controls was 60.3  12.3. All patients underwent general anesthesia and did not require re-intubation. There were no significant differences in 1-month post-operative complication rates (16.5% pandemic vs. 12.6% control). There was one death in the pandemic group. No patients tested positive for the virus. CONCLUSION: This study represents the first report of post-operative outcomes in a large group of spine surgical patients in an area heavily affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Aim In this prospective study we assessed endothelial and inflammatory biomarkers in a cohort of COVID-19 patients, aiming to identify predictive factors of in-hospital mortality. Methods COVID-19 patients hospitalized in intensive care (ICU) and non-ICU units at 2 Bergamo (Italy) hospitals from March 23 to May 30, 2020, were enrolled. Markers of endothelium activation including von-Willebrand factor (vWF), soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and fibrinolytic proteins (t-PA and PAI-1) were measured. Additionally, D-dimer, Fibrinogen, FVIII, nucleosomes, C reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin were assessed. Results Sixty-three (45 ICU, and 18 non-ICU) patients, with a median age of 62 years were analyzed. Increased plasma levels of D-dimer, FVIII, fibrinogen, nucleosomes, CRP, and procalcitonin were observed in the whole cohort. Extremely elevated vWF levels characterized all patients (highest values in ICU-subjects). After a median time of 30 days, death occurred in 13 (21%) patients. By multivariable analysis, vWF-activity, neutrophil-count and PaO2/FiO2 were significantly associated with death. Using these variables, a linear score with 3-risk groups was generated that provided a cumulative incidence of death of 0% in the low-, 32% in the intermediate-, and 78% in the high-risk group. Conclusions COVID-19-induced hemostatic abnormalities are exacerbated by the severity of the disease and strongly correlate with the inflammatory status, underlying the link between coagulation, endothelial activation, and inflammation. Our study provides evidence for a role of vWF, together with neutrophils and PaO2/FiO2, as a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality by SARSCoV-2 infection.","output":"Endothelium Activation Markers in Severe Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: Role in Mortality Risk Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current commercially available methods for reliably detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remain expensive and inaccessible due to the need for whole blood collection by highly trained phlebotomists using personal protective equipment (PPE).

Protection is due in part to enhanced bacterial phagocytosis in vivo, changes in lipid metabolism and decreased activation of NF-B and the NLRP3 inflammasome. The inactivation of BTK leads to reduced innate immune cell recruitment and a phenotypic switch from M1 to M2 macrophages, aiding in the resolution of sepsis. We have also found that BTK expression in humans is increased in the blood of septic non-survivors, while lower expression is associated with survival from sepsis. Importantly no further reduction in organ damage, cytokine production, or changes in plasma metabolites is seen in Xid mice treated with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, demonstrating that the protective effects of BTK inhibitors in polymicrobial sepsis are mediated solely by inhibition of BTK and not by off-target effects of this class of drugs.","output":"X-Linked Immunodeficient Mice With No Functional Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Are Protected From Sepsis-Induced Multiple Organ Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GENERAL PURPOSE: To present the results of a scoping review exploring chronic wound care telemedicine before and during the pandemic, including the characteristics of the models implemented. TARGET AUDIENCE: This continuing education activity is intended for physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses with an interest in skin and wound care. LEARNING OBJECTIVES/OUTCOMES: After participating in this educational activity, the participant will:1. Identify the characteristics of the studies the authors examined for their scoping review of chronic wound care telemedicine.2. Choose the electronic methods commonly used for wound care telemedicine in the studies the authors examined.3. Recognize the implications for the patients who participated in chronic wound care telemedicine in the studies the authors examined. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVETo explore different chronic wound telemedicine models and identify current research on this topic.METHODSThe authors searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases on August 10, 2021 and identified 58 articles included in the analysis.RESULTSIncluded studies were published between 1999 and 2021, with more than half of the studies published between 2015 to 2019 (25.9%, n = 15/58) and 2020 to 2021 (25.9%, n = 15/58). There were 57 models identified, of which 87.7% (n = 50/57) used a blended model of care. Image assessment was the most common element in blended care (66.0%, n = 33/50), followed by video consultation (46.0%, n = 23/50), text (44.0%, n = 22/50), and telephone consultation (22.0%, n = 11/50). Purely virtual care was used in 12.3% (n = 7/57) of models, 85.7% (n = 6/7) of which were implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most studies conducted a quantitative analysis (62.1%, n = 36/58); 20.7% (n = 12/58) conducted a qualitative analysis, and 17.2% (n = 10/58) conducted both. The most frequently assessed results were wound outcomes (53.4%, n = 31/58) and patient opinions (25.9%, n = 15/58).CONCLUSIONSChronic wound care-related telemedicine has common elements: image assessment, video and telephone consultation, and text-based information that can be combined in a variety of ways with unique implementation barriers. Blended care models are more common than purely virtual alternatives. Heterogeneity among outcomes and reporting methods make the results difficult to synthesize.","output":"Chronic Wound Telemedicine Models Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organisations running operational technology (OT) systems seem to have taken a long time to wake up to the threat posed by Internet-connected systems.

The internet has decreased barriers of accessing quality educational resources for students of all backgrounds. In medical education, the costs of obtaining and maintaining cadavers for the understanding of the human body can be a major expense. Furthermore, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in minimizing in-person learning, the demand for quality anatomy resources is at an all-time high. Objectives This project aimed to create a quality and informative dissection of the anterior abdominal wall for learners, and to investigate the impact of virtual learning as a supplementary resource. Methods A complete and skilled dissection of the anterior abdominal wall was recorded. In addition, specific anatomical features were explained during the recording. The footage was then edited via Camtasia, a video editing software, where visual features, audio features, a comprehensive quiz, and the video's introductory and outgoing effects were prepared. The final production was uploaded to YouTube and prepared for medical students at the University of British Columbia, as well as the online community. A survey was linked at the end of the video, which was open for anyone who watched the production. Results People from across the world watched and provided feedback on this dissection. While a majority of feedback received came from respondents in North America, some comments were received from viewers in Brazil, India and China. 94.7% of respondents were actively completing or had completed an MD Degree and 5.3% of participants were actively completing or had completed an MBBS program. 84.2% of participants used this resource to prepare for their anatomy labs and dissections, 63.2% used this video to prepare for their anatomy lectures, and 68.4% of people used this to prepare for their examinations. Overall, 21.1% of respondents agreed and 78.9% of respondents strongly agreed that this online resource assisted them in fulfilling their purposes of watching this video. Conclusion Responses from the online survey indicate that using gross anatomy dissection videos helped improve the learning experience of anatomy and more resources should be created to fill this demand.

These stakeholders continue to tackle disruptions to supply chain systems through the introduction of strategy options for resilience. A better understanding of broader dimensions of potential disruptions to supply chains caused by uncertainties has become eminent, especially as currently experienced during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the outbreak in disrupting supply chains in the energy sector will, in the next decade, continue to be a likely concern for industry and research stakeholders. Balancing the increasing need for energy security to meet the continuous growth in energy demand through shortage reduction and increased uptime using optimization is the core of this research. This review paper provides an insight into recent studies in the field of natural gas supply chain resilience as a major player in the energy mix, and the continued disruption and subsequent shutdowns of plant nodes, which results in emission loss to the environment. This paper is motivated by the disparity between demand and supply triggered by the disruption of supply chain networks. Referenced in this paper are scientific work on supply chain resilience of biomass, water, power systems, and natural gas.

But, by the time an infected individual is tested, the infection starting from the person may have infected a chain of individuals. Hence, why should the testing stop at direct contacts, and not test secondary, tertiary contacts or even contacts further down? One deterrent in testing long chains of individuals right away may be that it substantially increases the testing load, or does it? We investigate the costs and benefits of such multi-hop contact tracing for different number of hops. Considering a large number of contact topologies, spanning synthetic networks of divergent characteristics and those constructed from recorded interactions, we show that the cost-benefit tradeoff can be characterized in terms of a single measurable attribute, the initial epidemic growth rate. Once this growth rate crosses a threshold, multi-hop contact tracing substantially reduces the outbreak size compared to traditional contact tracing. Multi-hop even incurs a lower cost compared to the traditional contact tracing for a large range of values of the growth rate. The cost-benefit tradeoffs and the choice of the number of hops can be classified into three phases, with sharp transitions between them, depending on the value of the growth rate. The need for choosing a larger number of hops becomes greater as the growth rate increases or the environment becomes less conducive toward containing the disease.","output":"Tracing and testing multiple generations of contacts to COVID-19 cases: cost-benefit tradeoffs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ventilation removing and spreading contaminants.A large number of people becoming sick due to the COVID -19 pandemic are infected in their homes.

However, skilled operators are essential for improved outcomes and patient safety which make efficient training and certification programs essential. Our aim was to explore the acquisition and assessment of EUS competencies in China as practiced in the past, today, and in the future. METHODS: We identified key opinion leaders (KOLs) from hospitals in different cities in China. Each KOL answered 43 questions regarding demographics and EUS experience, their learning experience as a trainee, experience as a supervisor, and their thoughts about current and future training. Descriptive statistics were used for reporting the results. RESULTS: Eleven men and five females from eight major Chinese cities (Beijing, Changsha, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wuhan) were included. They offered a good variance regarding age (33C53 years old), EUS experience (?C20 years), and performed procedures (20C6000 procedures). Most (n = 13) learned EUS through apprenticeship training model but three were self-taught. The KOLs also used the apprenticeship model to train their own trainees. First, they demonstrated EUS for median 2 months before their trainees took over the scope and performed a median 50 supervised procedures during a median of 3 months. Then they were allowed to perform EUS procedures independently. Simulation-based training and standardized assessment of competence were used very sparingly, but most of the KOLs wanted to shift towards these contemporary methods in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The classical apprenticeship training is still used to learn EUS in China and the amount of training required before being allowed to practice independently varies considerably. Several of the KOLs requested improved conditions for training and wanted a standardized curriculum leading to certification of new EUS operators based on a valid assessment of competence.","output":"Training and certification of EUS operators in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the effects of melatonin and its selected metabolites, i.e., N(1)-Acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine (AFMK) and 6-hydroxymelatonin (6(OH)Mel), on cultured human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) to assess their homeostatic activities with potential therapeutic implications. RNAseq analysis revealed a significant number of genes with distinct and overlapping patterns, resulting in common regulation of top diseases and disorders. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Reactome FIViZ, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed overrepresentation of the p53-dependent G1 DNA damage response gene set, activation of p53 signaling, and NRF2-mediated antioxidative pathways. Additionally, GSEA exhibited an overrepresentation of circadian clock and antiaging signaling gene sets by melatonin derivatives and upregulation of extension of telomere signaling in HEKs, which was subsequently confirmed by increased telomerase activity in keratinocytes, indicating possible antiaging properties of metabolites of melatonin. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) showed the activation of a keratinocyte differentiation program by melatonin, and GSEA indicated antitumor and antilipidemic potential of melatonin and its metabolites. IPA also indicated the role of Protein Kinase R (PKR) in interferon induction and antiviral response.

Elucidating which factors underlie this variation can help us better understand how to improve health trajectories. Here we used a case:control study of refugee and non-refugee youth, differentially exposed to war-related trauma, to investigate the effects of genetics and psychosocial environment on response to trauma. We investigated genetic variants in two genes (serotonin transporter, 5-HTT, and catechol-O-methyltransferase, COMT) that have been implicated in response to trauma. We collected buccal samples and survey data from 417 Syrian refugee and 306 Jordanian non-refugee youth who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a mental health-focused intervention. Measures of lifetime trauma exposure, resilience, and six mental health and psychosocial stress outcomes were collected at three time points: baseline, ~13 weeks, and ~48 weeks. We used multilevel models to identify gene x environment (GxE) interactions and direct effects of the genetic variants in association with the six outcome measures over time. We did not identify any interactions with trauma exposure, but we did identify GxE interactions with both genes and resilience; 1) individuals with high expression (HE) variants of 5-HTTLPR and high levels of resilience had the lowest levels of perceived stress and 2) individuals homozygous for the Val variant of COMT with high levels of resilience showed stable levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms. We also identified a direct protective effect of 5-HTTLPR HE homozygotes on perceived insecurity. Our results point to novel interactions between the protective effects of genetic variants and resilience, lending support to ideas of differential susceptibility and altered stress reactivity in a cohort of war-affected adolescents.","output":"Novel GxE effects and resilience: A case:control longitudinal study of psychosocial stress with war-affected youth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought many challenges into the field of transplantation. The infection itself leads to a broad activation of B-lymphocytes, which in combination with reduced immunosuppression and systemic pro-inflammatory state may possibly lead to an alloimmune response. The main objective of this retrospective single-center study was to evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on anti-HLA antibody dynamics and development of de novo donor specific antibodies (dnDSA) in lung transplant recipients (LTRs). We also aimed to determine the outcomes of treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) reduction. Methods A cohort of 27 LTRs infected by SARS-CoV-2 was retrospectively analyzed. The median age of LTRs at infection was 45.4 years (IQR 26.8-59.5) and median time between transplantation and infection was 16.8 months (IQR 8.0-56.9). The inclusion criteria were history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and screening for anti-HLA antibodies (Luminex technology, One Lambda) before and after infection (median 84, IQR 29-239 days and median 55, IQR 32-90 days resp.). Results No dnDSA were detected after SARS-CoV-2 infection. De novo class II anti-HLA antibodies with low mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were observed in 1 patient (3.7%) treated with favipiravir and MMF discontinuation without receiving CP. The standard therapeutic regimen consisted of specific antiviral therapy (remdesivir n=15, 55.6%; favipiravir n=12, 44.4%), reduced or discontinued MMF (n=10, 37.0% and n=17, 63.0%, resp.) and administration of CP (n=18, 66.7%) (Table 1). Conclusion In this retrospective study we did not observe a significant effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, MMF reduction or CP treatment on anti-HLA antibody dynamics and dnDSA incidence in LTRs. Therefore, CP and MMF withdrawal may be considered as safe therapeutic options regarding antibody-mediated rejection in LTRs affected by SARS-CoV-2. Future studies in larger cohorts are needed to confirm the findings.","output":"Effect of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Anti-HLA Antibodies and De Novo DSA Incidence in Lung Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic tested medical facilities readiness in terms of the number of available mechanical ventilators. Most countries raced to stock up on ventilators, which created a surge in demand and short in supply. Furthermore, other means of coping with the demand were proposed, such as using additive manufacturing. The purpose of this paper was to test whether the addition of 3D-printed splitters would help deliver required tidal volume to each patient, while supporting four patients on a single ventilator for 24 hours on pressure mode at 25-cm H(2)O, and to determine whether a fifth patient can be ventilated. The ventilation of four human lungs was simulated using 3D printed parts, a single ventilator, four test-lungs, and standard tubing. Peak pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, total tidal volume, individual tidal volume, total minute volume, and individual tidal volume data were collected. Usage of a 3D printed small size splitter enabled a 26% increase in individual tidal volume compared to standard tubing and a series of two-way splitters. The ventilator was able to supply the required pressure and tidal volume for 24 hours. A single ventilator with a four-way splitter can ventilate four patients experiencing respiratory failure for at least 24 hours without interruption. The equipment cannot sustain ventilating a fifth patient owing to minute volume limitation. This study expands on an earlier study that tested similar circuitry and reveals that the desired individual tidal volume is achieved. However, further research is required to provide the monitoring ability of individual patient parameters and prevention of cross-contamination.","output":"Increasing the efficiency of mechanical ventilators during pandemics through additive manufacturing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the New Year letter from the WSES board to wish everyone a new year full of positive surprises and good news, despite COVID-19 pandemic.We confirm the WSES primary aim: to promote education in emergency surgery putting together all the world experts on emergency surgery without restrictions or boundaries, in inclusivity, equality, and equal opportunities.

To organise safely and reliably a remote proficiency-test for admission to the Advanced Master of General Practice (AMGP), we developed a supervisor app tracking and tracing candidates behaviour. Methods: : A cross-sectional design was adopted with candidates applying for admission to the AMGP. The supervisor app operated on three levels to register events: recording actions, analysing behaviour, and live supervision. Each suspicious event was given a score. The outcome measures were the number of suspicious events and the exam outcome compared to the past year. To get more insight into candidates perceptions about the app, a post-test questionnaire was administered. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to explore quantitative data, while qualitative data were thematically analysed. Results: : In total, 472 (79%) candidates used the app in an off campus setting and 121 (20%) were on campus with live supervision. Test results of both groups were comparable. The app detected 22 candidates with a suspicious level >1, mainly due to background noise. All events occurred without fraud purpose. Out of 472 candidates, 304 filled in the post-test questionnaire. Two factors were extracted from the analysis and identified as candidates appreciation of the app and as emotional distress because of the app. Four themes were identified in the thematic analysis providing more insight on candidates emotional well-being. Conclusions: : A supervisor app registering and recording behaviour to prevent fraud during off-campus exams is efficient without influencing the exam outcome. Although candidates perceptions were mixed, increased anxiety was due to the lack of clear guidelines about the app. Future research should compare in a controlled design the cost-benefit balance between the supervisor app and candidates awareness of being monitored combined with a safe exam browsing plug in.","output":"Remote Proctored Exam for Proficiency-Testing: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latest diagnosis and treatment plan (4th edition) of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia has been issued.

Although TCZ is currently utilized in the treatment of critically ill coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients, data on survival impact is minimal. OBJECTIVES: To assess the mortality rate of patients presenting with COVID-19 who received TCZ for suspected CSS. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Henry Ford Health System between March 10, 2020 and May 18, 2020. Data collection began in May 2020 and was completed in June 2020. Patients included in the study required hospital admission and had positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab. Eligibility criteria to receive TCZ, per hospital protocol, included any of the following: persistent fever, defined as 38.0 C for at least 6 hours; a diagnosis of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); serum ferritin &#8805;1,000 (ng/mL) or doubling within 24 hours; D-Dimer &#8805; 5 (mg/L); serum lactate dehydrogenase &#8805;500 (IU/L); or interlukin-6 level &#8805;5 times the upper limit of normal. Dosing was initially determined by weight, then changed to a fixed 400 mg per hospital protocol. A comparator cohort was created from patients with COVID-19 and ARDS who did not receive TCZ. Patient survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log rank test. A multivariable cox regression was applied to evaluate the association between TCZ and mortality. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty patients were evaluated in the study, 54 (41.5%) of whom received TCZ. Patients who received TCZ were younger (mean age, 63.8 vs. 69.4 years; p=0.0083) and had higher body mass indices (mean, 33.9 vs. 30.4; p=0.005). Of the comorbid conditions evaluated, heart disease was more common in the comparator group than the TCZ group (27 patients [35.5%] vs. 10 patients [18.5%]; p=0.034). A Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated no difference in survival between TCZ and comparator patients (log rank p=0.495). In the multivariable Cox regression model for mortality at 30 days, treatment with TCZ was not associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-2.3; p=0.77). Lower mean C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were demonstrated within 48 hours of disposition in the TCZ group (mean TCZ, 4.9 vs. mean comparator, 13.0; p=<0.0001).

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019) epidemic created a need to rapidly evaluate potential treatment options to address the global pandemic including evaluation of azithromycin (AZM) as a mono or combination therapy. Due to the complicating medical conditions of COVID-19, in some cases patients may be unable to take medication orally and could require medication administration by alternate routes such as an EFT. The aim of this study was an in vitro assessment for the dose preparation and simulated administration of AZM suspensions, prepared from tablets and capsules, via nasogastric feeding tubes (NGT). AZM tablets and capsules were used to prepare aqueous suspensions from 250 to 2000 mg for administration via NGT. NGT between 8 and 12 French (Fr), from common materials of construction and typical lengths were evaluated. About 20 mL syringes were used with water as the diluent. The preparation and simulated NGT administration steps for AZM suspensions were evaluated in the laboratory studies and included assessment of in-use stability of the aqueous suspensions, chemical compatibility of prepared aqueous suspensions with the syringe and NGT, ease of delivery and accuracy of simulated administration. Analysis of the prepared sample solutions for assay/impurities was performed using chromatographic conditions based on the USP-NF monograph. Verification of dose preparation and simulated administration was performed for intact tablets, crushed tablets, and capsules. Aqueous suspensions prepared from intact tablets and capsules were exposed to dosing materials (enteral syringe and NGT) for a period of up to 4 hours at ambient conditions. Assessment of the ease of dose delivery and analyses of the resulting samples for assay, purity and total degradation products were performed. The laboratory studies verified a procedure to reliably prepare suspensions from AZM tablets and capsules, over a range of 250 to 2000 mg, that can be accurately administered through NGT in sizes of 8 to 12 Fr. No incompatibilities of the prepared aqueous AZM suspension with dosing materials were observed and acceptable stability was demonstrated for up to 4 hours.","output":"In Vitro Assessment for Dose Preparation and Simulated Administration of Azithromycin Suspensions via Enteral Feeding Tubes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The level of automation in mechanical ventilation has been steadily increasing over the last few decades.

However, recent evidences suggest that there has been injudicious prescription of antimicrobials. Moreover, a large number of people are self-medicating with antibiotics in a misguided attempt to protect themselves from the virus. This practice is especially prevalent in developing communities. Although common soaps are effective at inactivating enveloped viruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2, use of antibacterial products bearing biocides has increased during this pandemic. Current wastewater treatment techniques are unable to offer complete elimination of antibacterial biocides.

Non-fatal repetition is common (18% in 1 year), death from any cause shows a fourfold and suicide a 10-fold excess. Despite the scale of the problem, there is insufficient evidence for effective interventions for self-harm. Those who self-harm do so for a variety of different reasons. Different treatments may be more effective for subgroups of adolescents; however, little is known about which subgroups are appropriate for further study. This protocol outlines a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) to identify subgroups of adolescents for which therapeutic interventions for self-harm show some evidence of benefit. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic literature search was conducted in August 2019 (including Cochrane Library, Embase, trial registers and other databases). An update search is planned. Study selection will identify randomised controlled trials examining interventions to reduce self-harm in adolescents who have self-harmed and presented to services. Identified research teams will be invited to contribute data and form a collaborative group. Two-stage IPD-MA will be used to evaluate effectiveness of different therapeutic interventions compared with any active or non-active control on repetition of self-harm, general psychopathology, depression, suicidal ideation, quality of life and death. Subgroup analyses will identify adolescent subgroups in whom different therapeutic interventions may be more effective. Meta-regression will explore moderating study and intervention effects. Sensitivity analyses will incorporate aggregate data from studies lacking IPD and test the robustness of results to methods for handling missing data, within-study clustering, non-adherence and study quality.

Key to this are public health and syndromic surveillance systems that can analyze large data sets to discover patterns, trends, and correlations of public health significance. In 2020, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluated its public health surveillance system and identified areas for improvement. METHODS: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems, we assessed the ability of the Praedico Surveillance System to perform public health surveillance for a variety of health issues and evaluated its performance compared to an enterprise data solution (VA Corporate Data Warehouse), legacy surveillance system (VA ESSENCE) and a national, collaborative syndromic surveillance platform (CDC NSSP BioSense). RESULTS: Review of system attributes found that the system was simple, flexible, and stable. Representativeness, timeliness, sensitivity, and Predictive Value Positive were acceptable but could be further improved. Data quality issues and acceptability present challenges that potentially affect the overall usefulness of the system. CONCLUSIONS: Praedico is a customizable surveillance and data analytics platform built on big data technologies. Functionality is straightforward, with rapid query generation and runtimes. Data can be graphed, mapped, analyzed, and shared with key decision makers and stakeholders. Evaluation findings suggest that future development and system enhancements should focus on addressing Praedico data quality issues and improving user acceptability. Because Praedico is designed to handle big data queries and work with data from a variety of sources, it could be enlisted as a tool for interdepartmental and interagency collaboration and public health data sharing.

The duration of voice therapy and the prevalence of surgery were analyzed for males and females. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-eight patients (76 male and 82 female) were included. The percentage of professional voice users differed significantly between males and females. Vocal folds of females had a higher percent of reactive masses present. Females were also more likely to have a pseudocyst. Vocal folds of males showed a higher percent of masses of unspecified category on strobovideolaryngoscopy examination. A significantly greater proportion of females had abnormal high shimmer values, and abnormal low maximum phonation time; and a significantly greater proportion of females compared to males chose to participate in voice therapy. The average number of voice therapy sessions for males did not differ, nor did duration of voice therapy. A similar proportion of males and females underwent surgical mass excision. The treatment plan completed differed significantly between males and females with a higher percentage of males choosing to receive no treatment. For 45.54% of males and 59.70% of females the treatment plan consisted of voice therapy only. For 33.33% of males and 37.31% of females, the treatment plan included both voice therapy and surgery.

VOC are likely to be similar in size to the wild-type strain, thus implying that existing guidelines for use and re-use of face masks post disinfection remain relevant. Monitoring to avoid injudicious use of biocides during COVID-19 era is required as prolonged and excessive biocide usage may negatively impact our receiving environments; thus, highlighting the potential for alternative more environmental-friendly sustainable biocide solutions. Traditional biocides may promote cross-antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to antibiotics in problematical bacteria. Existing filtration efficacy of face masks is likely to perform similarly for VOC due to similar viral size; however, advances in face mask manufacturing by way incorporating new anti-viral materials will potentially enhance their design and functionality for existing and potentially future pandemics.","output":"Efficacy of frontline chemical biocides and disinfection approaches for inactivating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that cause coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with emergence of opportunities for green eco-solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide include viral infections, such as Ebola, influenza virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and recently COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus Currently, we can count on a narrow range of antiviral drugs, especially older generation ones like ribavirin and interferon which are effective against viruses in vitro but can often be ineffective in patients In addition to these, we have antiviral agents for the treatment of herpes virus, influenza virus, HIV and hepatitis virus Recently, drugs used in the past especially against ebolavirus, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, have been considered for the treatment of COVID-19 disease However, even if these drugs represent important tools against viral diseases, they are certainly not sufficient to defend us from the multitude of viruses present in the environment This represents a huge problem, especially considering the unprecedented global threat due to the advancement of COVID-19, which represents a potential risk to the health and life of millions of people The demand, therefore, for new and effective antiviral drugs is very high This review focuses on three fundamental points: (1) presents the main threats to human health, reviewing the most widespread viral diseases in the world, thus describing the scenario caused by the disease in question each time and evaluating the specific therapeutic remedies currently available (2) It comprehensively describes main phytochemical classes, in particular from plant foods, with proven antiviral activities, the viruses potentially treated with the described phytochemicals (3) Consideration of the various applications of drug delivery systems in order to improve the bioavailability of these compounds or extracts A PRISMA flow diagram was used for the inclusion of the works Taking into consideration the recent dramatic events caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the cry of alarm that denounces critical need for new antiviral drugs is extremely strong For these reasons, a continuous systematic exploration of plant foods and their phytochemicals is necessary for the development of new antiviral agents capable of saving lives and improving their well-being","output":"Phytochemicals from Plant Foods as Potential Source of Antiviral Agents: An Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic context is related to the interaction of human beings with the environment, as we invade and destroy important ecological niches, creating unsustainable models of animal production and trade Washing your hands is one of the most effective actions to prevent COVID-19 But how to follow this procedure where water is not guaranteed as often as necessary?

This study was to evaluate a pilot oral health interprofessional program that provided hands-on experiences for students across four disciplines: dentistry, medicine, nursing, and pharmacy. Methods: The 8-weeks program was built on four pedagogical principles: care, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration coupled with the 4Ms model: what matters, medication, mentation, and mobility. The curriculum contained four scenarios of a dental complication in an elderly: Alzheimer's Disease, oral cancer, Parkinson's Disease, and stroke. A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate this pilot program. Results: The average score of knowledge and attitude has increased from 2.94 to 4.39 (p < 0.05) on a 5-point Likert scale. The qualitative responses also showed that students became more confident in practicing within the Age-Friendly health system. Discussion: By the end of the program, all students recognized the significance of the interprofessional program to improve their knowledge and skills to work with professionals across disciplines. Two key features that contributed to the success of the program were (1) an interprofessional education that increased students' awareness of other types of services and (2) four scenarios that allowed students to solve the case and gain hands-on experience. Conclusion: An interprofessional education may equip students with competence to address the health of geriatric patients.

The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions. Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals. Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean  SD 3.0  1.6 kg) and loss (?2.9  1.5 kg), respectively. Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36C45 and >45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further. Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods. An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts. Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine.

The roots of this inequality predate the pandemic and even the global financial crisis. They lie rather in the uneasy relationship between labor and capital under conditions of declining economic growth, such as those who have prevailed in advanced economies for almost half a century. This paper explores the dynamics of that relationship using a simple stock-flow consistent (SFC) macroeconomic model of a closed economy. It examines in particular the role of two key factorsthe savings rate and the substitutability (elasticity of substitution) between labor and capitalon the severity of systemic inequality under conditions of declining growth. The paper goes on to test the efficacy of three redistributive measuresa graduated income tax, a tax on capital and a universal basic incomeunder two distinct structural scenarios for an economy with a declining growth rate. We find that none of these measures is sufficient to control structural inequality when institutions aggressively favor capital over labor (hyper-capitalism). Taken in combination, however, under conditions more favorable to wage labor (proto-socialism), these same measures have the potential to eliminate inequality, almost entirely, even as the growth rate declines. ? 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: We successfully genotyped samples of 408 Wilms tumor cases and 1198 controls which were collected from five hospitals across China. The unconditional logistic regression was adopted to analyze the contributions of YTHDF1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the risk of Wilms tumor. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were generated to evaluate the conferring risk of YTHDF1 gene SNPs (rs6011668 C>T, rs6090311 A>G). RESULTS: Neither of the two SNPs could contribute to the risk of Wilms tumor. A negative association was also detected in the combined effects of protective genotypes on Wilms tumor risk. The stratification analysis revealed that compared with those with CC genotype, rs6011668 CT/TT genotype was associated with increased Wilms tumor risk in those &#8804;18 months (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.02-2.30, p = 0.038), and with decreased Wilms tumor risk in those >18 months (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.50-0.97, p = 0.034).

The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) COVID Registry was created to compare peripartum outcomes and anesthetic utilization in women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection delivering at institutions with widespread testing. METHODS: Deliveries from 14 U.S. medical centers, March 19-May 31, 2020, were included. Peripartum infection was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test within 14 days of delivery. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with randomly selected control patients were sampled (1:2 ratio) with controls delivering during the same day without a positive test. Outcomes were obstetric (e.g., delivery mode, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, delivery < 37 weeks), an adverse neonatal outcome composite measure (primary), and anesthetic utilization (e.g., neuraxial labor analgesia and anesthesia). Outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations to account for clustering within centers. Sensitivity analyses compared symptomatic and asymptomatic patients to controls. RESULTS: 1454 peripartum women were included: 490 with SARS-CoV-2 infection [176 (35.9%) symptomatic]; 964 controls. SARS-CoV-2 patients were slightly younger, more likely non-nulliparous, non-white, and Hispanic than controls. They were more likely to have diabetes, obesity, or cardiac disease and less likely to have autoimmune disease. After adjustment for confounders, individuals experiencing SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited an increased risk for delivery < 37 weeks gestation compared to controls, 73 (14.8%) vs. 98 (10.2%) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.47 95% CI (1.03-2.09)]. Effect estimates for other obstetric outcomes and the neonatal composite outcome measure were not meaningfully different between SARS-CoV-2-patients versus controls. In sensitivity analyses, compared to controls, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients exhibited: increases in cesarean delivery [aOR: 1.57 95% CI (1.09-2.27)]; postpartum length of stay [aOR 1.89 95% CI (1.18-2.60)]; delivery < 37 weeks gestation [aOR 2.08 95% CI (1.29-3.36)]. These adverse outcomes were not found in asymptomatic women versus controls. SARS-CoV-2 patients (asymptomatic and symptomatic) were less likely to receive neuraxial labor analgesia [aOR: 0.52 95% CI (0.35-0.75)] and more likely to receive general anesthesia for cesarean delivery [aOR: 3.69 95% CI (1.40-9.74)] due to maternal respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, multicenter U.S. cohort study of women with and without peripartum SARS-CoV-2 infection, differences in obstetric and neonatal outcomes seem to be mostly driven by symptomatic patients. Lower utilization of neuraxial analgesia in laboring patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic infection compared to patients without infection requires further investigation.","output":"The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) COVID-19 Registry: An analysis of outcomes among pregnant women delivering during the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Blood test alterations are crucial in SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) patients. Blood parameters, such as lymphocytes, C reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, or D-dimer, are associated with severity and prognosis of SARS CoV-2 patients. This study aims to identify blood-related predictors of severe hospitalization in patients diagnosed with SARS CoV-2. METHODS: Observational retrospective study of all rt-PCR and blood-test positive (at 48 hours of hospitalization) SARS CoV-2 diagnosed inpatients between March-May 2020. Deceased and/or ICU inpatients were considered as severe cases, whereas those patients after hospital discharge were considered as non-severe. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of severity, based on bivariate contrast between severe and mild inpatients. RESULTS: The overall sample comprised 540 patients, with 374 mild cases (69.26%), and 166 severe cases (30.75%). The multivariate logistic regression model for predicting SARS CoV-2 severity included lymphocytes, C reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, total protein levels, glucose and aspartate aminotransferase as predictors, showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.895 at a threshold of 0.29, with 81.5% of sensitivity and 81% of specificity.

An interesting relationship between shrinkage parameter and label frequency is established. Second, we introduce a novel method of fitting logistic model based on simultaneous estimation of vector of coefficients and label frequency. Importantly, the proposed method does not require prior estimation, which is a major obstacle in positive unlabelled learning. The method is superior in predicting posterior probability to both naive method and weighted likelihood method for several benchmark data sets.

Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined. METHODS: We conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort. RESULTS: In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%.

This paper evaluates the in-sample and out-of-sample stock return predictive power of the global and Saudi geopolitical risk indices and crude oil returns in the context of six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Monthly data from February 2007 to December 2019 and the feasible generalized least square (FGLS) estimator for predictive modelling by Westerlund and Narayan (2012, 2015) are used. Global and Saudi GPR indices show weak evidence of in-sample predictability of excess stock returns. However, the out-of-sample forecasts show that only the global geopolitical risk index provides superior prediction in the context of Kuwaiti and Omani stock markets, compared to the historical average benchmark model. Crude oil prices are shown to be a better predictor in most cases, in both in-sample and out-of-sample forecast models The results imply that crude oil returns can be used for active prediction of GCC stock market returns, once econometric issues are accounted for. The findings remain mostly unaffected when excess risk adjusted returns are used.","output":"Predictability of GCC stock returns: The role of geopolitical risk and crude oil returns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives :To assess T cell responses in individuals with and without a positive antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

First, the dynamics of the evaporation meniscus and the onset and evolution of nanobubbles on nanopillar surfaces were characterized. The meniscus can be pinned at the top surface of the nanopillars during evaporation for perfectly wetting fluid. The curvature of the meniscus close to nanopillars varies dramatically. Nanobubbles do not originate from the solid surface, where there is an ultrathin nonevaporation film due to strong solid-fluid interaction, but originate and evolve from the corner of nanopillars, where there is a quick increase in potential energy of the fluid. Second, according to a parametric study, the smaller pitch between nanopillars (P) and larger diameter of nanopillars (D) are found to enhance evaporation but also raise the possibility of boiling, whereas the smaller height of nanopillars (H) is found to enhance evaporation and suppress boiling. Finally, it is revealed that the nanofilm thickness should be maintained beyond a threshold, which is 20 ? in this work, to avoid the suppression effect of disjoining pressure on evaporation. Moreover, it is revealed that whether the evaporative heat transfer is enhanced on the nanopillar surface compared with the smooth surface is also affected by the nanofilm thickness. The value of nanofilm thickness should be determined by the competition between the suppression effect on evaporation due to the decrease in the volume of supplied fluid and the existence of capillary pressure and the enhancement effect on evaporation due to the increase in the heating area. Our work serves as the guidelines to achieve stable and efficient nanofilm pure evaporative heat transfer on nanopillar surfaces.","output":"Stable and Efficient Nanofilm Pure Evaporation on Nanopillar Surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyclophilins play a key role in the life cycle of coronaviruses.

CRS is an excessive immunity of the body to external stimuli such as viruses, bacteria, and nanomaterials, which can cause tissue damage, local necrosis or even death. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the most effective CRS inducers, which can activate macrophages to release cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL- 6 and chemokines. We used RT-PCR to detect the expression of representative cytokines in mouse and human cells at different concentrations of Trichomicin, Ebosin, and 1487B after LPS stimulation. The results showed that the expression of TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, and CXCL10 all increased after LPS stimulation. Among the various drugs, Trichomicin had the most obvious inhibitory effect on cytokine expression in vitro, and it was further verified in vivo that Trichomicin can improve the survival rate of mice stimulated with LPS. Finally, it was proved that Trichomicin inhibited the Stat3 and NF-B pathways and reduced the phosphorylation of Stat3 and p65 after LPS stimulation, thereby inhibiting the response of macrophages to pro-inflammatory stimuli.

Knowledge of pre-COVID-19 trends in this gap is needed to assess the longer-term impacts of the pandemic. We provide evidence for England on recent trends in 1, 2 and 3-year mortality amongst care home residents aged 65+ compared with similar community-dwelling residents. We use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a nationally representative primary care database. For each of the ten years from 2006 to 2015, care home and community-dwelling residents aged 65+ were identified and matched in the ratio 1:3, according to age, gender, area deprivation and region. Cox survival analyses were used to estimate mortality risks for care home residents in comparison with similar community-dwelling people, adjusting for age, gender, area deprivation and region. The study sample consisted of ten overlapping cohorts averaging 5495 care home residents per cohort. Adjusted mortality risks increased over the study period for care home residents while decreasing slightly for matched community-dwelling residents. The relative risks (RRs) of mortality associated with care home residence were higher for younger ages and shorter follow-up periods, in all years. Over the decade, the RRs increased, most at younger ages and for shorter follow-up periods (e.g. for the age group 65-74 years, 1-year average RR increased by 61% from 5.4 to 8.8, while for those aged 85-94 years and over, 3-year RR increased by 22% from 1.3 to 1.6).

The fragility of these achievements has been shown, however, by the resurgence of measles since 2016. We describe trends in routine measles vaccine coverage at national and district level, SIA performance and demographic changes in the three regions with the highest measles burden. FINDINGS: WHO-UNICEF estimates of immunization coverage show that global coverage of the first dose of measles vaccine has stabilized at 85% from 2015 to 19. In 2000, 17 countries in the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean regions had measles vaccine coverage below 50%, and although all increased coverage by 2019, at a median of 60%, it remained far below levels needed for elimination. Geospatial estimates show many low coverage districts across Africa and much of the Eastern Mediterranean and southeast Asian regions. A large proportion of children unvaccinated for MCV live in conflict-affected areas with remote rural areas and some urban areas also at risk. Countries with low RI coverage use SIAs frequently, yet the ideal timing and target age range for SIAs vary within countries, and the impact of SIAs has often been mitigated by delays or disruptions. SIAs have not been sufficient to achieve or sustain measles elimination in the countries with weakest routine systems. Demographic changes also affect measles transmission, and their variation between and within countries should be incorporated into strategic planning. CONCLUSIONS: Rebuilding services after the COVID-19 pandemic provides a need and an opportunity to increase community engagement in planning and monitoring services.

Methods: Nested case-control study with propensity score matching. Patients operated on for full-thickness macular hole between January 2011 and March 2020 were enrolled. The primary outcome was failure of the macular hole closure, and the secondary outcome was unfavorable hole closure (V or l type closure) at 6 months after the surgery. Results: Five hundred and thirty-four eyes of 534 patients met the inclusion criteria. After 1:1 propensity score matching (127 pairs), patients demonstrating ERM were more likely to have a failure of hole closure (adjusted odds ratio, 2.71;95% confidence interval, 1.19-6.14) and unfavorable hole closure (adjusted odds ratio, 2.07;95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.71). Epiretinal membrane spanning the hole margin (hole marginal ERM) greatly increased the likelihood of unfavorable hole closure (adjusted odds ratio, 2.13;95% confidence interval, 1.12-4.07). Patients with hole marginal-ERM + epiretinal proliferation were more likely to have a failure of hole closure (38.4%) compared with those with no ERM (11.8%). Conclusion: Patients with ERM had a higher risk for adverse surgical outcomes for full-thickness macular hole closure.

Japan too imposed emergency remote teaching and learning at both the school and university level. In this study, we focus on a national university in Japan, and investigate how teaching and learning were facilitated during this pandemic period using an e-book platform, BookRoll. BookRoll was linked as an external tool to the universitys learning management system. Such an endeavor also reinforced the Japanese national thrust regarding explorations of e-book-based technologies and using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education. Teachers could upload reading materials, for instance their course notes, and associate an audio of their lecture. When students who registered in their courses accessed the learning materials, the system collected their interaction logs in a learning record store. Across the spring semesters from April to July 2020, the BookRoll system collected nearly 1.5 million reading interaction logs from more than 6,300 students across 243 courses in six domains with above 1,900 learners creating more than 78,000 reading logs weekly. While science and engineering courses mainly used the platform, law and language studies courses utilized the feature to upload audio tracks with reading materials. The interaction log analysis of the students with the content revealed that active learning actions, such as the use of annotations on text, were done more in humanities courses. Lastly, recommendations are created based on the analysis and the perception of the teachers about the emergency remote teaching and learning using the BookRoll system for orchestrating their course. ? 2021, Canadian Network for Innovation in Education.

METHODS: Between November 2006 and November 2009, 41 patients with a mean age of 69.6 years (range 51-86) underwent 51 bicompartmental knee arthroplasties with the Journey-Deuce knee prosthesis. All patients presented with symptomatic medial and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis, with intact cruciate ligaments and a preserved lateral compartment on plain radiographs and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Clinical assessment was undertaken pre-surgery and at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years post-surgery using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol Group 5-Dimension self-reported questionnaire (EQ-5D) and maximal active range of motion (ROM). RESULTS: 30 patients (37 knees) were followed-up at a mean time of 11.4 years (SD 1.1; range 10.5-14.0). Eight patients (ten knees) were deceased and three could not be contacted at final review. No major component revision was performed. Pre-operative OKS 25.4 (SD 5.2; range 15-40), knee flexion 116.4 (SD 10.3; range 100-140) and EQ-5D 70.5 (SD 19.9; range 25-95). 10-year OKS 43.5 (SD 4.1; range 32-48), knee flexion 127.3 (SD 11.1; range 105-144) and EQ-5D 77.4 (SD 9.3; range 60-100). The OKS (p < 0.0001), EQ-5D (p = 0.024) and active knee flexion ROM (p < 0.0001) all significantly improved from pre-surgery to 1-year post-surgery, with no further significant changes in these scores between any post-operative time period up until 10 years. 32% (7/22) of tibial and 45% (10/22) of femoral components showed progressive radiolucencies between 2 and 5-year and 10-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest cohort of patients having undergone BCKA (with the Journey-Deuce prosthesis) with longest follow-up described in the literature.

Benefits of bariatric surgery, however, extend well beyond weight loss and include dramatic improvement of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and reduction of overall mortality. Furthermore, studies in rodents and humans show that the anti-diabetes effect of certain bariatric procedures results from a variety of neuroendocrine and metabolic mechanisms secondary to changes in GI anatomy. The recognition that benefits and mechanisms of GI operations are not limited to weight reduction provided a rationale for the emergence of metabolic surgery intended as a surgical approach primarily aimed to the treatment of diabetes and metabolic disease. Consistent with the goals of improving glycemic and metabolic control, in contrast to mere weight loss, metabolic surgery implies the development of a new model of care distinct from traditional bariatric surgery.

The identification of variants was done by unique checkpoints of base nucleotide changes in the targeted spike gene. Moreover, we amplified one full-length genome using Sanger method and an in-house-developed primer library. Using NGS strains of the same sampling period from GISAID, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to examine the distribution pattern of variants in Hiroshima and to validate our Sanger method. The modified primer set provided 100% validation and 99.2% amplification. PANGO Lineage R.1 was detected in late in the third wave, followed by Alpha (B.1.1.7) domination in the fourth wave, Delta (B.1.617.2) domination in the fifth wave, and Omicron (B.1.1.529) domination in the sixth wave, and there was no significant difference in viral copies between variants (p = 0.09). The variants showed different transmission patterns, but the distribution of variants is consistent to that shown by the phylogenetic tree. The Sanger method also provided successful amplification of the full-length genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

In this context, retinal services are exploring novel ways to ensure access to healthcare. METHODS: We conducted a worldwide survey among retinal specialists between March 31, 2020 and April 12, 2020. The expert survey was developed on the basis of focus group discussions involving retinal specialists and literature searches. It included 44 questions on alternative ways of care provision including digital health domains such as teleophthalmology, home monitoring or decentralised patient care. RESULTS: 214 retinal experts participated in the survey, of which 120 (56.1%) had more than 15 years of experience in ophthalmology. Most participants were clinicians (n=158, 73.9%) practising in Western Europe (n=159, 74%). In the majority of institutions, teleophthalmology, home monitoring and decentralised patient care have not been implemented before the pandemic (n=46, 21.8.1%; n=64, 29.9%; n=38, 19.1%). During the pandemic, the use of teleophthalmology and home monitoring increased significantly (n=105, p<0.001; n=90, p<0.001).

As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, retained sensitivity over time is an important quality in an antibody assay that is to be used for the purpose of population seroprevalence studies. We compared 5,788 health care worker (HCW) serum samples by using two serological assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid total antibody) and a subset of samples (all Abbott assay positive or grayzone, n = 485) on Wantai SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For 367 samples from HCW with a previous PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we correlated the timing of infection with assay results. Overall, seroprevalence was 4.2% on Abbott and 9.5% on Roche. Of those with previously confirmed infection, 41% (150/367) and 95% (348/367) tested positive on Abbott and Roche, respectively. At 21 weeks (150 days) after confirmed infection, positivity on Abbott started to decline. Roche positivity was retained for the entire study period (33 weeks). Factors associated (P  0.050) with Abbott seronegativity in those with previous PCR-confirmed infection included sex (odds ratio [OR], 0.30 male ; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.60), symptom severity (OR 0.19 severe symptoms; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.61), ethnicity (OR, 0.28 Asian ethnicity; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.60), and time since PCR diagnosis (OR, 2.06 for infection 6 months previously; 95% CI, 1.01 to 4.30). Wantai detected all previously confirmed infections. In our population, Roche detected antibodies up to at least 7 months after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. This finding indicates that the Roche total antibody assay is better suited than Abbott IgG assay to population-based studies. Wantai demonstrated high sensitivity, but sample selection was biased. The relationship between serological response and functional immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be delineated. IMPORTANCE As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, retained sensitivity over time is an important quality in an antibody assay that is to be used for the purpose of population seroprevalence studies. There is a relative paucity of published literature in this field to help guide public health specialists when planning seroprevalence studies. In this study, we compared results of 5,788 health care worker blood samples tested by using two assays (Roche and Elecsys, anti-nucleocapsid antibody) and by testing a subset on a third assay (Wantai enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] anti-spike antibody). We found significant differences in the performance of these assays, especially with distance in time from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection, and we feel these results may significantly impact the choice of assay for others conducting similar studies.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Testing in Health Care Workers: A Comparison of the Clinical Performance of Three Commercially Available Antibody Assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread and huge impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the emerging SARS-CoV-2 have driven large efforts for sequencing and analyzing the viral genomes.

Therefore, appropriate delineation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants enables us to understand its evolution and transmission patterns. By focusing on the nucleotides that co-substituted, we first identified 42 co-mutation modules that consist of at least two co-substituted nucleotides during the SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Then based on these co-mutation modules, we classified the SARS-CoV-2 population into 43 groups and further identified the phylogenetic relationships among groups based on the number of inconsistent co-mutation modules, which were validated with phylogenetic trees. Intuitively, we tracked tempo-spatial patterns of the 43 groups, of which 11 groups were geographic-specific.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Zimbabwe imposed lockdown measures to prevent and control the spread of the pandemic. The inability of researchers to conduct field-based research led to office-based research to determine the impacts of the pandemic on conservation. The objective of this study was to find out how the pandemic had affected the security of wildlife in protected areas of Zimbabwe in 2020. The researchers divided 2020 into three periods, no lockdown, full lockdown, and partial lockdown. Data on wildlife protection, illegal activities and tourism performance was collected at the station level using a similar format and submitted to a central place for consolidation and analysis. Parametric and non-parametric tests were conducted based on the normality status of the data variables. The study findings are that (i) The number of rangers conducting law enforcement activities in 2020 remained the same, (ii) Rise in local poaching of wildlife with a peak in the dry season, increase in illegal fishing, and illegal mining activity during the period of full' lockdown, (iii) Tourist arrivals and revenue generated from regional and international tourism showed a significant decline during full' lockdown and partial' lockdown (iv) Domestic arrivals increased as expected during 'partial' lockdown. This study corroborates the potential negative implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on wildlife protection which would continue to worsen with the prolonging pandemic. One lesson from this study is that the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZPWMA) wildlife protection efforts in 2020 survived using financial reserves as a safety net and support from conservation partners.

METHODS: This cohort study compared sleep disruptions for pediatric inpatients admitted prior to (Sep 2018 C Feb 2020) and during (Apr 2020 C Aug 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic at a single site, urban academic medical center. Objective disruptions were measured as room entries detected by hand hygiene sensors for occupied rooms pre-pandemic (n_average=56) and during the pandemic (n_average=48) for 69 and 154 nights, respectively. Subjective reports of overnight disruptions, sleep quantity, and caregiver mood were measured by surveys adopted from validated tools: the Karolinska Sleep Log, Potential Hospital Sleep Disruptions and Noises Questionnaire, and Visual Analog Mood Scale. Caregivers of a convenience sample of pediatric general medicine inpatients completed surveys. Caregivers pre-pandemic were surveyed in person, and during the pandemic, surveys were conducted over the phone. RESULTS: 293 pre-pandemic (age_patients=4.14.4 years) and 154 pandemic (age_patients=8.75.6 years) surveys were collected from caregivers. The majority (71% pre-pandemic and 52% pandemic) of the study population identified as Black/African American. Nighttime room entries initially decreased 36% (95% CI: 30%, 42%, p<0.001), then returned towards pre-pandemic levels as the COVID-19 hospital caseload decreased. Despite this, caregivers reported more disrupted patient sleep (p<0.001) due to tests (21% vs. 38%) as well as stress (30% vs. 49%), anxiety (23% vs. 41%), and pain (23% vs. 48%). Caregivers also reported children slept 61 minutes less (95% CI: 12 min, 110 min, p<0.001) and had more awakenings. Caregivers self-reported feeling more sad and weary, less calm, and worse overall (p<0.001 for all). CONCLUSION: Despite fewer objective room entries, caregivers reported increased sleep disruptions and an hour less nighttime sleep with more awakenings during the pandemic for pediatric patients.

Haplotypes also provide an effective way to deal with untyped SNPs. Two major challenges arise in haplotype-based association analysis of family data. First, haplotypes may not be inferred with certainty from genotype data. Second, the trait values within a family tend to be correlated because of common genetic and environmental factors. RESULTS To address these challenges, we present an efficient likelihood-based approach to analyzing associations of quantitative traits with haplotypes or untyped SNPs. This approach properly accounts for within-family trait correlations and can handle general pedigrees with arbitrary patterns of missing genotypes. We characterize the genetic effects on the quantitative trait by a linear regression model with random effects and develop efficient likelihood-based inference procedures. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed methods. An application to family data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program Ancillary Genetic Study is provided. A computer program is freely available.

History reveals that deep recessions may cause output and total factor productivity (TFP) hysteresis, a permanent or highly persistent fall in the levels of output and TFP relative to pre-recession trends. This article analyses the output and welfare multipliers of fiscal stimulus during a recession using a macro model with TFP and output hysteresis. We find that transfer payments, public consumption and investment all have high output and welfare multipliers due to their positive effects on TFP in a recessionary environment. However, public investment has the highest output and welfare multipliers, because it has a more positive impact on labour productivity due to the increase in the public capital stock.","output":"Hysteresis and fiscal stimulus in a recession"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical diagnosis has seen a tremendous advancement in the recent years due to the advent of modern and hybrid techniques that aid in screening and management of the disease.

This algorithm is a global optimization wrapper approach that simulates the collective behavior of glowworms in nature during food search. However, it still suffers from being trapped in local minima. Hence in order to improve glowworm swarm optimization algorithm, differential evolution (DE) algorithm is utilized to enhance the behavior of glowworms. The proposed (DECGSOCANFIS) approach estimates suitable prediction parameters of ANFIS by employing DECGSO algorithm. The outcomes of the proposed model are compared with traditional ANFIS model, genetic algorithm-ANFIS (GA-ANFIS), particle swarm optimization-ANFIS (PSO-ANFIS), lion optimization algorithm-ANFIS (LOA-ANFIS), differential evolution-ANFIS (DE-ANFIS) and glowworm swarm optimization (GSO).

So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (CoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the fecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. In spite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (convention and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated.

To understand the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 in humans it is necessary to unravel the metabolic changes that are produced in the individuals once the infection has taken place. The goal of this work is to provide new information about the altered biomolecule profile and with that the altered biological pathways of patients in different clinical situations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is done via metabolomics using HPLCCQTOFCMS analysis of plasma samples at COVID-diagnose from a total of 145 adult patients, divided into different clinical stages based on their subsequent clinical outcome (25 negative controls (non-COVID); 28 positive patients with asymptomatic disease not requiring hospitalization; 27 positive patients with mild disease defined by a total time in hospital lower than 10 days; 36 positive patients with severe disease defined by a total time in hospital over 20 days and/or admission at the ICU; and 29 positive patients with fatal outcome or deceased). Moreover, follow up samples between 2 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also obtained from the hospitalized patients with mild prognosis. The final goal of this work is to provide biomarkers that can help to better understand how the COVID-19 illness evolves and to predict how a patient could progress based on the metabolites profile of plasma obtained at an early stage of the infection. In the present work, several metabolites were found as potential biomarkers to distinguish between the end-stage and the early-stage (or non-COVID) disease groups. These metabolites are mainly involved in the metabolism of carnitines, ketone bodies, fatty acids, lysophosphatidylcholines/phosphatidylcholines, tryptophan, bile acids and purines, but also omeprazole.

For example, water-soluble DNIC [Fe(2)(-SCH(2)CH(2)OH)(2)(NO)(4)] (DNIC-1) was explored for oral delivery of NO to the brain and for the activation of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the kinetics and mechanism for cellular uptake and intracellular release of NO, as well as the biocompatibility of synthetic DNICs, remain elusive.

METHODS: Prospective observational study in the general ICU of a tertiary care hospital for COVID-19. The right rectus femoris cross-sectional area and the right diaphragm thickness, as well as their echodensities were assessed within 24 hours from ICU admission and on day 7. Anthropometric and biochemical data, respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, daily fluid balance and the amount of calories and proteins administered were recorded. RESULTS: 28 patients were analysed (age 6510 years, 80% males, BMI 30.07.8). Rectus femoris and diaphragm sizes were significantly reduced at day 7 (-26.1 [-37.8;-15.2] and -29.2 [-37.8;-19.6]%, respectively) and this reduction was significantly higher in non-survivors. Both rectus femoris and diaphragm echodensity were significantly increased at day 7, with a significantly higher increase in non-survivors.

Highly pathogenic influenza virus infections generally coincide with early, high levels of inflammatory cytokines that some studies have suggested may be regulated in a strain-dependent manner. However, a comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamics of the inflammatory response induced by virulent influenza strains is lacking. Here, we applied gene co-expression and nonlinear regression analysis to time-course, microarray data developed from influenza-infected mouse lung to create mathematical models of the host inflammatory response. We found that the dynamics of inflammation-associated gene expression are regulated by an ultrasensitive-like mechanism in which low levels of virus induce minimal gene expression but expression is strongly induced once a threshold virus titer is exceeded. Cytokine assays confirmed that the production of several key inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, exhibit ultrasensitive behavior. A systematic exploration of the pathways regulating the inflammatory-associated gene response suggests that the molecular origins of this ultrasensitive response mechanism lie within the branch of the Toll-like receptor pathway that regulates STAT1 phosphorylation. This study provides the first evidence of an ultrasensitive mechanism regulating influenza virus-induced inflammation in whole lungs and provides insight into how different virus strains can induce distinct temporal inflammation response profiles.

One hundred and fifty-one workers (77.5% of day workers and 22.5% of shift workers) were followed up in the pre-pandemic period and during the pandemic. Data on anthropometry, food consumption, and adherence to nutritional counseling were collected during nutritional meetings, which focused on qualitative modification of food intake and control of energy consumption. The rate of adherence to the program did not differ between shifts. The pandemic significantly increased the intake of calories, macronutrients, and several micronutrients in workers of both shifts. Adherence to the nutritional counseling program had an impact on the consumption of proteins and some micronutrients, and also promoted a reduction in body weight and body mass index of workers of both shifts.

Whereas previously estimated to be 2.4 in 1000 live births, new developments in screening and diagnostic modalities have added to the incidence of TE. Further, incidence of TE has increased in those affected by coronavirus-19 (COVID-19). We present a case of a neonate born to a mother diagnosed with COVID-19, found to have thrombosis of the ductus arteriosus. Case: The patient is a full-term male neonate (3.2 kg), born to a healthy mother with mild gestational hypertension who was diagnosed for COVID-19 infection at 21 weeks gestation which had resolved perinatally. A routine fetal echocardiogram performed at 21 weeks showed a serpiginous PDA with mildly elevated velocity (2.3 m/s) and normal fetal cardiac anatomy. At birth, although he was initially stable with mild sinus bradycardia, he quickly developed respiratory distress with significant hypoxia. Four hours after birth, he was given oxygen supplementation and was evaluated for transient tachypnea of the newborn or persistent pulmonary hypertension. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed pulmonary hypertension with systemic right ventricular systolic pressure and bidirectional shunting at the foramen ovale. Additionally, he was noted to have a large thrombus (5 mm) occluding the proximal end of his large PDA (Figure 1). Due to concern for potential dislodgement of the thrombus and subsequent pulmonary or systemic embolism, anticoagulation therapy (enoxaparin) was initiated and supplemental oxygen was continued. A brain ultrasound and clotting factor assessment was also done, with serial echocardiograms. The thrombus disappeared by the eighth day. Enoxaparin was continued for a total of six weeks. Discussion: In a neonate with TE, several risk factors should be considered including congenital cardiac anomalies and hypercoagulability state. In this case, the neonate had a serpiginous ductus arteriosus. He also had umbilical catheters, which are considered risk factors for thrombosis, but these were not placed until after the thrombus was already identified. In addition, his birth history was significant for a mother who was diagnosed with COVID-19, but data on vertical transmission of COVID-19 and subsequent risk for TE has not been fully reported. With increased incidence of COVID-19 in the general population, further studies on its effects on fetal health should be explored.","output":"Between a rock and a hard place: A newborn with thrombosis of the patent ductus arteriosus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid urbanization and climate change trends are intertwined with complex interactions of various social, economic, and political factors.

The number of members was significantly greater in medical groups (21,215, SD 35,040) than in layperson groups (7623, SD 19,480) (P<.01). Medical groups were significantly more likely to require security checks to attain membership (81% vs 43%; P<.001) and less likely to be public (3 vs 123; P<.001) than layperson groups. Medical groups had the highest user engagement, averaging 502 (SD 633) reactions (P<.01) and 224 (SD 311) comments (P<.01) per post. Medical professionals were more likely to use the Facebook groups for education and information sharing, including academic posts (P<.001), idea sharing (P=.003), resource sharing (P=.02) and professional opinions (P<.001), and requesting for crowdsourcing (P=.003). Layperson groups were more likely to share news (P<.001), humor and motivation (P<.001), and layperson opinions (P<.001). There was no significant difference in the number of evidence-based posts among the groups (P=.10). CONCLUSIONS: Medical professionals utilize Facebook groups as a forum to facilitate collective intelligence (CI) and are more likely to use Facebook groups for education and information sharing, including academic posts, idea sharing, resource sharing, and professional opinions, which highlights the power of social media to facilitate CI across geographic distances. Layperson groups were more likely to share news, humor, and motivation, which suggests the utilization of Facebook groups to provide comedic relief as a coping mechanism. Further investigations are necessary to study Facebook groups' roles in facilitating CI, crowdsourcing, education, and community-building.","output":"Characterization and Comparison of the Utilization of Facebook Groups Between Public Medical Professionals and Technical Communities to Facilitate Idea Sharing and Crowdsourcing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The plasma suPAR level has previously been associated with postoperative complications and has been shown to be an independent predictor of coronary microvascular function and flow reserve. We investigated the association between preoperative suPAR levels and intraoperative sublingual microvascular perfusion in patients undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery. Methods: This study included 100 patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery between February 2019 and September 2020. The primary objective was to investigate the association between preoperative suPAR and intraoperative sublingual De Backer score, Consensus Proportion of Perfused Vessels (Consensus PPV), and Consensus PPV (small). Secondary objectives were to investigate the associations between these sublingual microcirculatory variables and (1) complications and (2) mean arterial pressure. EDTA blood was collected before induction of anesthesia and plasma suPAR levels were determined using the suPARnostic quick triage lateral flow assay. Sublingual microcirculation was monitored with Sidestream DarkField (SDF+) imaging technique at 20 minutes after induction of anesthesia before surgical incision (baseline) and then every 30 minutes until emergence from anesthesia. Results: A decrease of 0.7 mm-1 in the De Backer score, 2.5% in the Consensus PPV, and 2.8% in the Consensus PPV (small) from baseline measurement was observed for every 1 ng/ml increase of suPAR or 1 additional minute of intraoperative time. De Baker score did not change significantly from baseline (p=0.404), while Consensus PPV and Consensus PPV (small) decreased significantly from baseline (p<0.001 in both cases). The De Backer score, the Consensus PPV, and the Consensus PPV (small) correlated with postoperative complications. Mean arterial pressure correlated with De Backer score (p=0.487) but not with Consensus PPV (p=0.506) or Consensus PPV (small) (p=0.697) during the intraoperative period. Conclusion: Preoperative suPAR levels and prolonged operative duration were associated with intraoperative impairment of sublingual microvascular perfusion in patients undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery.","output":"Association of preoperative plasma suPAR levels with intraoperative sublingual microvascular perfusion in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although migration is a constant in human history, current trajectories have new quantitative and qualitative features with religious implications, which are addressed in this article. What is new and paradoxical about what is commonly referred to as globalization is the diffuse nature of worldwide migration and the mobility of people, ideas, and goods. This article therefore explores how members of Brazilian Pentecostal congregations in Berlin use specific functions and patterns of interpretation communicated or generated by discourses of the churches to cope with the lack of social capital in a new social and cultural environment and how their interpretations and orientations shape everyday actions. This article is an attempt to capture the ambiguous role of religious resources in the process of migration and social integration as well as the actions of community members. Although a growing body of literature explores the influence of migrant organizations on its members, new church actors of Christian migrants in Germany are rarely considered as drivers of religious pluralization. Therefore, this article reflects on the different functions of Brazilian Pentecostal congregations for the integration of Lusophone Pentecostal migrants in Berlin. In order to identify the functions of Pentecostal organizations, a theoretical framework is determined and related to the statements of the interview partners and to findings from observations. To answer the research question, this article draws on field research conducted between November 2019 and June 2020. The empirical analysis uses data from four narrative interviews and over 40 participant observations in four different transnational congregations belonging to a Brazilian Pentecostal network of churches. The results show that individual religiosity and belonging to a particular religious group not only provide social relationships and a network of solidarity for individuals, but also reinterpret the social exclusion and marginalization of migrants.","output":"Lusophony Pentecostal Churches in Berlin: Religious Identities Between Integration and Transatlantic Boundaries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a substantial increase in waiting times for cystoscopies, prompting concerns of delayed diagnoses and substandard surveillance of bladder cancer.

The assay successfully amplified all HRVs tested and could reproducibly detect 50 HRV RNA transcript copies, with a dynamic range of over 7 logs. In contrast, a quantified RNA transcript of human enterovirus 68 (HEV68) that showed the greatest sequence homology to the HRV primers and probe set was not detected below a concentration of 5 x 10(5) copies per reaction. Nucleic acid extracts of 111 coded respiratory specimens that were culture positive for HRV or HEV were tested with the HRV real-time RT-PCR assay and by two independent laboratories that used different in-house HRV/HEV RT-PCR assays. Eighty-seven HRV-culture-positive specimens were correctly identified by the real-time RT-PCR assay, and 4 of the 24 HEV-positive samples were positive for HRV. HRV-specific sequences subsequently were identified in these four specimens, suggesting HRV/HEV coinfection in these patients.

This condition can be more severe if the patient has comorbidities. Failure of viable treatment for such viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is due to lack of identification. Thus, modern and productive biotechnology-based tools are being used to manipulate target genes by introducing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system. Moreover, it has now been used as a tool to inhibit viral replication. Hence, it can be hypothesized that the CRISPR/Cas system can be a viable tool to target both the SARS-CoV-2 genome with specific target RNA sequence and host factors to destroy the SARS-CoV-2 community via inhibition of viral replication and infection. Moreover, comorbidities and COVID-19 escalate the rate of mortality globally, and as a result, we have faced this pandemic. CRISPR/Cas-mediated genetic manipulation to knockdown viral sequences may be a preventive strategy against such pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells (PAC-MAN) along with CRISPR/Cas13d efficiently degrades the specific RNA sequence to inhibit viral replication. Therefore, we suggest that CRISPR/Cas system with PAC-MAN could be a useful tool to fight against such a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. This is an alternative preventive approach of management against the pandemic to destroy the target sequence of RNA in SARS-CoV-2 by viral inhibition.","output":"Manipulation of genes could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes COVID-19 pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study examines the claim that social inequality in health in European populations was absent prior to 1750. This claim is primarily based on comparisons of life expectancy at birth in England between general and ducal (elite aristocrat) social classes from the 1550s to the 1870s. METHODS: We examined historic childhood mortality trends among the English ducal class and the general population, based on previously published data. We compared mid-childhood to adolescent mortality (age 5C14) and early-childhood mortality (age 0C4) between the ducal class and the general population from the 17(th) to 19(th) centuries. RESULTS: Prior to 1750, ducal early-childhood mortality was higher than the general population. However, mid-childhood to adolescent mortality was lower among the ducal class than the general population in all observed periods for boys, and almost all periods for girls. Among the ducal class, but not the general population, there was a sharp decline in early-childhood mortality around the 1750s which may partly explain the divergent trends in overall life expectancy at birth. CONCLUSION: Health inequality between the ducal class and general population was present in England from the 16(th) to mid-18(th) centuries, with disadvantages in mortality for ducal children in infancy and early childhood, but survival advantages in mid-childhood and adolescence. These opposing effects are obscured in life expectancy at birth data. Relatively high early-childhood mortality among ducal families before 1750 likely resulted from short birth intervals and harmful infant feeding practices during this time.","output":"Health inequality in Britain before 1750"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to change the way we used to handle education in our homes, through sanitary restrictions that seek to prohibit or reduce physical contact, moving from the traditional way to a virtual methodology;reason for which we must look for new solutions to adapt to this new teaching strategy.

The aim of this study was to compare moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activity levels in Spanish adults with chronic conditions before and during COVID-19 quarantine. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was administered during the COVID-19 quarantine in Spain. A total of 163 participants with chronic conditions (113 females and 47 males; age range 18-64 years) completed the survey. A total of 26 chronic conditions were included. Participants self-reported average minutes/day of moderate and vigorous physical activity before and during quarantine. Differences in moderate-intensity physical activity and vigorous-intensity physical activity levels before and during COVID-19 quarantine (overall, by gender, by age, by number of chronic conditions and by each chronic condition) were assessed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Many patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the University Hospital Aachen during an outbreak that first struck the Heinsberg district in February 2020. METHODS A comparative presentation of the clinical features of the first 50 COVID-19 patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were hospitalized in the University Hospital Aachen. RESULTS 24 intubated patients were treated in the intensive care unit for ARDS of varying degrees of severity, while 26 patients who were breathing spontaneously without ARDS, but nevertheless needed supplemental oxygen, were treated in a separate isolation ward. The median age of the patients was 65 (IQR 58-76). The median latency from symptom onset to hospitalization was four days (IQR 1-8). Patients with ARDS had preexisting respiratory diseases more commonly than patients without ARDS (58% [95% confidence interval: 39; 76] versus 42% [26; 61]) and were more commonly overweight or obese (83% [64; 93] versus 42% [26; 61]). The two groups did not differ in viral burden but displayed significant differences in laboratory findings: ARDS patients had persistently elevated values for leukocytes, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and D-dimers over the period of observation. Patients without ARDS had persistently elevated inflammatory parameters and fever for at least one week, with an accompanying need for supplemental oxygen. Three of the patients with ARDS died of multiorgan failure, while four in the non-ARDS group died of respiratory insufficiency. CONCLUSION This initial description of a cohort of COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS in Germany reveals that those with ARDS more commonly have preexisting respiratory diseases and obesity, as well as persistently elevated inflammatory markers. COVID-19 patients without ARDS may likewise require prolonged hospitalization because of persistently elevated inflammatory values with a simultaneous need for supplemental oxygen.","output":"The Characteristics of 50 Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients With and Without ARDS."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study suggests that an adequate level of social capital with a robust health profile might be associated with positive policy outcomes in combating COVID-19.

In particular, strong bilateral and family ties as well as better coordination and cooperation at the community level can facilitate the goal of fiscal policy measures. The results also reveal that the declining effect of fiscal policy on the pandemic mostly arises from the relatively high social capital levels, while it loses its effectiveness at low levels.

Using oxidized LDL (OxLDL) uptake and a cell toxicity assay, we screened more than 30 types of Chinese herbs. Western blotting was used to determine expressions of scavenger receptors (SRs) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activities. RESULTS We found that Gentiana scabra reduced oxidized LDL uptake effectively in THP-1 macrophages (p < 0.05 vs. OxLDL treated control). Moreover, treatment with Gentiana scabra in THP-1 macrophages resulted in decreased expression of scavenger receptor- A (SR-A) (p < 0.05 vs. control). Molecular investigation revealed that Gentiana scabra inhibited SR-A protein expression, possibly by regulating ERK signaling pathways (p < 0.05 vs. control).

To date, there is no specific drug or medicine available to cure these human viral diseases. Therefore, the early and rapid detection without compromising the test accuracy is required in order to provide a suitable treatment for the containment of the diseases. Recently, nanomaterials-based biosensors have attracted enormous interest due to their biological activities and unique sensing properties, which enable the detection of analytes such as nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), aptamers, and proteins in clinical samples. In addition, the advances of nanotechnologies also enable the development of miniaturized detection systems for point-of-care (POC) biosensors, which could be a new strategy for detecting human viral diseases.

The age range of the participants was between 17-26 years (M, 21.86; SD, 2.94). RESULTS: The results showed that the most frequently reported reactions by university students during COVID-19 is restricted daily routine (92%), preoccupation with cleanliness (86%), feeling uncertain about future (85%), feeling bored (84%) and low mood (84%). The least frequently reported reaction was financial crisis (48%). The findings further showed that 18% of the participants had mild, 34% had moderate, 29% severe and 19% very severe level of problems. CONCLUSIONS: The finding revealed that university students have significantly affected by this pandemic which need attention from mental health professionals.","output":"Psychosocial Reactions of Pakistani Students Towards COVID-19: A Prevalence Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the recent discovery of novel H17N10 and H18N11 influenza viral RNA in bats and report on high frequency of avian H9 seroconversion in a species of free ranging bats, an important issue to address is the extent bats are susceptible to conventional avian and human influenza A viruses. METHOD: To this end, three bat species (Eidolon helvum, Carollia perspicillata and Tadarida brasiliensis) of lung epithelial cells were separately infected with two avian and two human influenza viruses to determine their relative host innate immune resistance to infection. RESULTS: All three species of bat cells were more resistant than positive control Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to all four influenza viruses. TB1-Lu cells lacked sialic acid 2,6-Gal receptors and were most resistant among the three bat species. Interestingly, avian viruses were relatively more replication permissive in all three bat species of cells than with the use of human viruses which suggest that bats could potentially play a role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses. Chemical inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway in bat cells had no effect on virus production suggesting that type I interferon signalling is not a major factor in resisting influenza virus infection. CONCLUSION: Although all three species of bat cells are relatively more resistant to influenza virus infection than control MDCK cells, they are more permissive to avian than human viruses which suggest that bats could have a contributory role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses.","output":"Bat lung epithelial cells show greater host species-specific innate resistance than MDCK cells to human and avian influenza viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an important Tibetan medicine and a secondary protected plant in China, Pomatosace filicula is endemic to the country and is mainly distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, global climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions might lead to the extinction of P. filicula. To understand the potential spatial distribution of P. filicula in future global warming scenarios, we used the MaxEnt model to simulate changes in its suitable habitat that would occur by 2050 and 2070 using four representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and five global climate models. The results showed that the QTP currently contains a suitable habitat for P. filicula and will continue to do so in the future. Under the RCP2.6 scenario, the suitable habitat area would increase by 2050 but shrink slightly by 2070, with an average reduction of 2.7%. However, under the RCP8.5 scenario, the area of unsuitable habitat would expand by an average of 54.65% and 68.20% by 2050 and 2070, respectively. The changes in the area of suitable habitat under the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios were similar, with the unsuitable area increasing by approximately 20% by 2050 and 2070. Under these two moderate RCPs, the total suitable area in 2070 would be greater than that in 2050. The top three environmental factors impacting the habitat distribution were altitude, annual precipitation (BIO12) and annual temperature range (BIO7). The cumulative contribution rate of these three factors was as high as 82.8%, indicating that they were the key factors affecting the distribution and adaptability of P. filicula, P. filicula grows well in damp and cold environments. Due to global warming, the QTP will become warmer and drier; thus, the growing area of P. filicula will move toward higher elevations and areas that are humid and cold. These areas are mainly found near the Three-River Region. Future climate change will aggravate the deterioration of the P. filicula habitat and increase the species' survival risk.

They play a key role in the innate immune system, regulating both the initiation and the resolution of the inflammatory response. FPRs were originally identified as receptors with high binding affinity for bacteria or mitochondria N-formylated peptides. However, they can also bind a variety of structurally different ligands. Among FPRs, formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) is the most versatile, recognizing N-formyl peptides, non-formylated peptides, and synthetic molecules. In addition, according to the ligand nature, FPRL1 can mediate either pro- or anti-inflammatory responses. Hp(2-20), a Helicobacter pylori-derived, non-formylated peptide, is a potent FPRL1 agonist, participating in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric inflammation, thus contributing to the related site or not-site specific diseases.

Biological networks are typical complex networks with widely real-world applications. Many problems arising in biological systems can be boiled down to the identification of important nodes. For example, biomedical researchers frequently need to identify important genes that potentially leaded to disease phenotypes in animal and explore crucial genes that were responsible for stress responsiveness in plants. To facilitate the identification of important nodes in biological systems, one needs to know network structures or behavioral data of nodes (such as gene expression data). If network topology was known, various centrality measures can be developed to solve the problem; while if only behavioral data of nodes were given, some sophisticated statistical methods can be employed. This paper reviewed some of the recent works on statistical identification of important nodes in biological systems from three aspects, that is, 1) in general complex networks based on complex networks theory and epidemic dynamic models; 2) in biological networks based on network motifs; and 3) in plants based on RNA-seq data. The identification of important nodes in a complex system can be seen as a mapping from the system to the ranking score vector of nodes, such mapping is not necessarily with explicit form. The three aspects reflected three typical approaches on ranking nodes in biological systems and can be integrated into one general framework.

Of 7728 individuals who reported at least one vaccination dose, 7298 received an mRNA vaccine, and 5674 provided adequate data from the peri-vaccine period for analysis. We found that in most individuals, resting heart rate (RHR) increased with respect to their individual baseline after vaccination, peaked on day 2, and returned to normal by day 6. This increase in RHR was greater than one standard deviation above individuals normal daily pattern in 47% of participants after their second vaccine dose. Consistent with other reports of subjective reactogenicity following vaccination, we measured a significantly stronger effect after the second dose relative to the first, except those who previously tested positive to COVID-19, and a more pronounced increase for individuals who received the Moderna vaccine. Females, after the first dose only, and those aged <40 years, also experienced a greater objective response after adjusting for possible confounding factors. These early findings show that it is possible to detect subtle, but important changes from an individuals normal as objective evidence of reactogenicity, which, with further work, could prove useful as a surrogate for vaccine-induced immune response.","output":"Inter-individual variation in objective measure of reactogenicity following COVID-19 vaccination via smartwatches and fitness bands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the measures employed in the provision of patron services in Chinese academic libraries responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, noting the challenges and issues inherent in providing substantial services while undergoing a public health emergency. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses an analytical survey study of 137 Chinese academic libraries using data collected through a combination of website investigation, social media access and direct correspondences. Findings: Over 94% of Chinese academic libraries released COVID-19-related information through their websites; the majority switched their service focus to partly or solely remotely online, including remote access, free electronic resources, virtual references reachable 24/7 and research support services deliverable online; services of print materials were altered to e-books for conveniences. Research limitations/implications: It should be noted that the survey was conducted from February 12 to April 5, 2020; because of the rapid updates to the library's website and social media channels, the status of their patron services are in the process of dynamic changes and that there should be many libraries that have adopted some patron service methods, but this study is difficult to cover comprehensively. In addition, patron services carried out offline by the surveyed libraries but not disclosed on the online platform could not be analyzed in a way that would be consistent with the data provided by the survey. Originality/value: By providing evidence of the current status of patron services in Chinese academic libraries during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study helps fulfill the scant empirical attention given to the impact of nationwide public health crises on academic libraries and offers new data of the best practices that help library administrators enhance the impact, efficiency and value of library services to their target community users.","output":"The provision of patron services in Chinese academic libraries responding to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The battle against the COVID-19 pandemic is still the most important problem and a great challenge for the overburdened health system in the Republic of Croatia.

Besides, course types with different knowledge structures also exert certain influence on metadiscourse usage. Course types focusing on procedural knowledge (i.e. the knowledge related to practical process) tend to apply metadiscourse to enhance intelligibility and interactivity, while the ones stressing declarative knowledge (i.e. the knowledge related to explicit facts) attach more importance to reliability.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a massive natural experiment in the formation of mitigation strategies to prevent cases and to provide effective healthcare for those afflicted. Regional differences in the impact of the pandemic on morbidity and mortality have been driven by political and regional differences in the coproduction of public health and social policy. We explored the United States (US) experience of COVID-19 for trends and correlations with other nations and also at the national, regional, state and local levels. OBJECTIVE: To identify geographic and temporal trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: Population data on COVID-19 cases and mortality were acquired on a daily basis from multiple publicly available databases, including the New York Times and Johns Hopkins University. At each geographic level (national, state and county), geographic entities reported cases were evaluated for correlations using linear least-squares methods to identify patterns of correlation in the cases independent of scale. We evaluated for two specific characteristics: (i) the nature of the curvature of the line linking across percentile scores, ranging from concave to convex and (ii) the area under this curve, indicating how effectively a selected region (nation, state and county) is linked to its entire containing unit (world, country and state). We used this approach to identify three distinct COVID behavior phenotypes, each of which consisted of a number of states in the USA. RESULTS: We found that COVID activity in the USA follows a unique trend compared to other countries and that within the USA during the first year of the pandemic, three initial COVID phenotypes emerged: (i) the metropolitan outbreak (early outbreak phenotype); (ii) the regional outbreak (summer peak phenotype) and (iii) trans-regional outbreak (fall/winter peak phenotype), which, taken in sum, represent the overall USA national trend. Each phenotype has specific behavioral characteristics and is composed of a cluster of different states experiencing different conditions. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a new opportunity for public health strategy in the pandemic, namely to apply targeted public health approaches to address the specific needs of each phenotype. In the future, we should create databases that capture key health and hardship data elements at the smallest geographic level possible and use these to track trends, predict the future and apply targeted coproduction approaches to more effectively and efficiently safeguard population health, economic vitality and social well-being.","output":"International, national and local trends in the spread of COVID-19: a geographic view of COVID-19 spread and the role to be played by coproduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The effect of male age on pregnancy outcomes after assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment shown in the previous literature is controversial. In addition, the influence of male age on neonatal outcomes following ART treatment has less been investigated. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of male age on reproductive and neonatal outcomes in couples following ART treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective cohort study was performed in two Centres for Assisted Reproduction from June 2010 to February 2019. A total of 5512 frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles were included according to the criteria. The primary outcome measures were pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Patients were categorized into five groups according to male age (younger than 30, 31 - 35, 36 - 40, 41 - 45, and older than 45) and the group younger than 30 years old was treated as the reference group. RESULTS The logistic regression analysis showed that clinical pregnancy and live birth were all no statistic difference among the male age groups compared with the reference group (P values, 0.743, 0.979, 0.948, 0.28; P values, 0.823, 0.342, 0.817, 0.381, respectively). Furthermore, no significant differences were found in the preterm birth rate, child sex, neonatal malformation, birth weight, and gestational age (P > 0.05).

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to confirm the effect of patellofemoral contact mechanics after craniolateral and caudolateral transposition of tibial tuberosity in normal canine hindlimbs. METHODS: Craniolateral and caudolateral transposition of tibial tuberosity was performed in 5 specimens, respectively. The pressure was measured in the specimen before TTT, and then in the same specimen after TTT. In this process, data was obtained in 10 specimens. The measurement results were output as visualization data through the manufacturer's software and numerical data through spreadsheet. Based on these 2 data and the anatomical structure of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) surface, whole measurement area was analysed by dividing into medial, lateral and central area. RESULTS: In craniolateralization of tibial tuberosity, total, medial, central contact pressure was decreased and lateral contact pressure was not statistically changed lateral contact pressure than normal PFJ. In caudolateralization of tibial tuberosity, total, lateral contact pressure was increased and medial contact pressure was not statistically changed than normal PFJ. Although not statistically significant changed, central contact pressure in caudolateralization of tibial tuberosity was increased in all 5 specimens.

The aim of this study was to analyze the analgesic effect of intraperitoneal ropivacaine infusion in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS A prospective randomized clinical trial of all the patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) between January and November 2015 was performed. Patients were randomized to experimental (EG: those patients undergoing intraperitoneal ropivacain irrigation) and control groups (CG: those undergoing intraperitoneal irrigation with normal saline). RESULTS One hundred ten patients were included, 83 LRYGB (75.5 %) and 27 LSG (24.5 %). Mean pain, as measured by VAS score, was 21.7  14.5 mm in CG and 13.3  10.9 mm in EG (p = 0.002). Morphine needs during the first 24 h postoperatively were 21.8 % in CG and 3.6 % in EG (p = 0.01). Early taking of fluids by mouth was possible 6 h after surgery in 76.4 % in EG vs 34.5 % in CG (p = 0.001). Early mobilization ability (6 h after surgery) was feasible in 72.7 % in EG and 32.7 % in CG (p = 0.001). Median hospital stay was 3 days (range 2-10 days) in CG and 2 days (2-7 days) in EG (p = 0.009).

Since hospitals in high-income countries contribute significantly to climate change through their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the medical ethics imperative of 'do no harm' imposes a responsibility on hospitals to decarbonise. We investigated hospital stakeholders' perceptions of hospitals' GHG emissions sources and the sense of responsibility for reducing GHG emissions in a hospital. METHODS We conducted 29 semistructured qualitative expert interviews at one of Germany's largest hospitals, Heidelberg University Hospital. Five patients, 12 clinical and 12 administrative employees on different levels were selected using purposive maximum variation sampling. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using the framework approach. RESULTS Concerning GHG emissions, hospital stakeholders perceived energy and waste as most relevant emission sources followed by mobility. Climate change mitigation in general was considered as important. However, in their role as patients or employees, hospital stakeholders felt less responsible for climate change mitigation. They saw providing best possible medical care to be the top priority in hospitals and were often concerned that patients' health could be jeopardised by climate change mitigation measures. CONCLUSION Perceptions of most important emission sources did not coincide with those in literature, highlighting the need to inform stakeholders, for instance, about pharmaceuticals as important emission source. A frequently perceived conflict between reducing emissions and providing high-quality medical care could be eased, if reducing emissions would not only be justified as a contribution to mitigation, but also as a contribution to preventing ill health-a basic principle of medical ethics.","output":"'Climate change mitigation is a hot topic, but not when it comes to hospitals': a qualitative study on hospital stakeholders' perception and sense of responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tyler Littlefield, a software developer who is blind with only light perception, has created a fully accessible tracker of COVID\\\\19 statistics as a resource for those who are blind or visually impaired.

The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge, risk perception and practices of staff towards prevention and control of COVID-19 infection in schools to provide policy makers, education and health managers required information to manage the epidemic as the schools prepare to re-open. METHODS: This was a school-based survey conducted using purposive sampling of 55 schools located in nine LGAs with the highest number of reported COVID-19 cases as at October 2020. Five schools with the highest students'/pupils' enrollment in each of the LGA were selected and all staff were interviewed. Information on knowledge, risk perception and practices of prevention was collected. Descriptive statistics were generated using Stata v14 software. RESULTS: A total of 1065 staff in 55 schools completed the interview. Major sources of information are television (73%), radio (61%), and social media (57%);and 76% indicated that a virus is the causative agent of COVID-19. Overall, 70%, 19%, 7%, 9.3% and 0% respectively had adequate knowledge of cause, preventive measures, respiratory hygiene, modes of transmission and symptoms of COVID-19;however only 14% ever attended a workshop on COVID-19.

Addressing this knowledge gap could support the design of anti-viral agents, as well as further our understanding of viral-host protein interactions, infectivity, pathogenicity, and innate immune system clearance. Using lipidomics analyses, we revealed that the virus envelope comprised mainly phospholipids (PL), with little cholesterol or sphingolipids, indicating significant differences from the composition of host membranes. Unlike cellular membranes, procoagulant aminophospholipids were present on the external side of the viral envelope at levels exceeding those on activated platelets. As a result, virions directly promoted blood coagulation. To investigate whether these differences could enable selective targeting of the viral envelope in vivo, we tested whether oral rinses containing lipid-disrupting chemicals could reduce viral infectivity. Products containing PL-disrupting surfactants (such as cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)) met European virucidal standards in vitro; however, components that altered the critical micelle concentration reduced efficacy, and products containing essential oils, PVP-I, or Chlorhexidine were ineffective. This result was recapitulated in vivo, where a 30-second oral rinse with CPC mouthwash eliminated live virus in the oral cavity of COVID-19 patients for at least one hour, while PVP-Iodine and saline mouthwashes were found ineffective. We conclude the SARS-CoV-2 lipid envelope (i) is distinct from the host plasma membrane, which may enable design of selective anti-viral approaches; (ii) contains exposed PE and PS, which may influence thrombosis, pathogenicity, and inflammation; and (iii) can be selectively targeted in vivo by specific oral rinses.","output":"The SARS-CoV2 envelope differs from host cells, exposes pro-coagulant lipids, and is disrupted in vivo by oral rinses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To identify major barriers to video-based telehealth use among homebound older adults.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with high affinity for the 3'-UTRs of targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Interactions between host cells and viral genomes may induce the upregulation or downregulation of various miRNAs. Therefore, understanding the expression patterns of these miRNAs and their functions will provide insights into potential miRNA-based therapies. This review systematically summarizes the potential targets of miRNA-based therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection and examines the viability of possible transfection methods.","output":"The potential of miRNA-based therapeutics in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines churn prediction of customers in the banking sector using a unique customer-level dataset from a large Brazilian bank. Our main contribution is in exploring this rich dataset, which contains prior client behavior traits that enable us to document new insights into the main determinants predicting future client churn. We conduct a horserace of many supervised machine learning algorithms under the same cross-validation and evaluation setup, enabling a fair comparison across algorithms. We find that the random forests technique outperforms decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, elastic net, logistic regression, and support vector machines models in several metrics. Our investigation reveals that customers with a stronger relationship with the institution, who have more products and services, who borrow more from the bank, are less likely to close their checking accounts. Using a back-of-the-envelope estimation, we find that our model has the potential to forecast potential losses of up to 10% of the operating result reported by the largest Brazilian banks in 2019, suggesting the model has a significant economic impact. Our results corroborate the importance of investing in cross-selling and upselling strategies focused on their current customers. These strategies can have positive side effects on customer retention.","output":"Propension to customer churn in a financial institution: a machine learning approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that is characterized by multiple organ dysfunction due to abnormal host response to various pathogens, like bacteria, fungi and virus.

The following work suggests new insights into smartphone use behavior, mainly regarding two contradicting smartphone modes of use that affect quality of life in opposite ways. The Aware smartphone mode of use reflects an active lifestyle, while the Unaware mode of use reflects the use of the smartphone in conjunction with other activities. Using data from 215 individuals who reported their quality of life and smartphone use habits, we show that high levels of smartphone use in the Unaware mode of use have a significant negative effect on the quality of life. However, the results show a mild positive effect when the individual uses the smartphone in an aware mode of use. We identify three latent factors within the quality-of-life construct and measure the effect of the different smartphone modes of use on these quality-of-life factors. We find that (i) The functioning latent factor, which is an individuals ability to function well in his or her daily life, is not affected by smartphone use behavior. In contrast, (ii) the competence latent factor, which is a lack of negative emotions or pain, and (iii) the positive feelings latent factor both show a clear effect with the smartphone Unaware mode of use. This implies that the unaware use of smartphones, which is its use in conjunction with other activities or late at night, can be related to lower levels of quality of life. Since smartphones currently serve as an interface between the self and the cyber space, as well as an interface between the self and other individuals online, these results need to be considered for social wellbeing in relation to digital human behavior, smartphone addiction and a healthy mode of use.","output":"Smartphone use behavior and quality of life: What is the role of awareness?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission of pathogens through currency notes has become very relevant in today's world due to COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the CrossFit Barbara which can be applied easily at home during the off-season or some situations such as the epidemic limitation to classic resistance training methods used to maintain the strength performance of national kickboxers. METHODS: Forty-three national kickboxers, CrossFit (CF, n= 22), and resistance training (RT, n= 21), participated in this study. While CF performed 20 pull-ups, 30 push-ups, 40 sit-ups, and 50 squat exercises, RT performed bench press, lat pull down, leg press, biceps curl, and triceps extension exercises twice per week for six weeks. Before and after the six weeks, the following variables were measured;body mass (BM) and body fat percentage (FP), VO2max, bench press (BP), squat (SQ), leg strength (LS), hand grip strength (HGS), pull-up, push-up and counter movement jump (CMJ). RESULTS: BP (p&lt; 0.001, F= 41.125, p2= 0.501), SQ (p&lt; 0.001, F= 26.604, p2= 0.394), LS (p&lt; 0.001, F= 15.234, p2= 0.271), push-up (p&lt; 0.001, F= 31.978, p2= 0.438) and pull-up (p&lt; 0.001, F= 24.410, p2= 0.373) values changed significantly in group-time interaction between CF and RT groups, while there was no significant difference for the BM (p= 0.198, F= 1.715, p2= 0.040), Fat (p= 0.265, F= 1.279, p2= 0.030), HGS (p= 0.665, F= 0.190, p2= 0.005, CMJ (p= 0.054, F= 3.946, p2= 0.088) and VO2max (p=0.747, F= 0.106, p2= 0.003).

Network-based methods usually utilize a drug-protein association network and predict DPIs by the information of its associated proteins or drugs, called \\"guilt-by-association\\" principle. However, the \\"guilt-by-association\\" principle is not always true because sometimes similar proteins cannot interact with similar drugs. Recently, learning-based methods learn molecule properties underlying DPIs by utilizing existing databases of characterized interactions but neglect the network-level information. RESULTS We propose a novel method, namely BridgeDPI. We devise a class of virtual nodes to bridge the gap between drugs and proteins and construct a learnable drug-protein association network. The network is optimized based on the supervised signals from the downstream task - the DPI prediction. Through information passing on this drug-protein association network, a graph neural network can capture the network-level information among diverse drugs and proteins. By combining the network-level information and the learning-based method, BridgeDPI achieves significant improvement in three real-world DPI datasets.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 493 Polish health sciences students (314 women, 179 men) aged 21.5  2.25 years. The intensity of health behaviors was examined using the Health Behavior Inventory (HBI). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was carried out to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels were examined with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). The online versions of psychological scales were created using Google Forms software. RESULTS: Mild anxiety symptoms were observed in 21% of examined students and moderate-to-severe in 28%. Mild depressive symptoms were observed in 14% of the study group, and 8% of the examined students suffered from moderate-to-severe depression. The mean perceived stress result was high (22.2  4.1 pts.). The overall intensity of health behavior was, at the mean level, significantly higher in females compared to males. The odds of developing severe symptoms in terms of anxiety, depression, and stress in students with high levels of health-related behaviors were respectively: four times, more than seven times, and nine times lower compared to students with lower levels of these behaviors.

Nasal sampling could enable self-sampling and increase acceptability. The term nasal sampling is often not used uniformly and sampling protocols differ. METHODS: This manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, compared professional anterior nasal and nasal mid-turbinate sampling for a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test. The second group of participants collected a nasal mid-turbinate sample themselves and underwent a professional nasopharyngeal swab for comparison. The reference standard was real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using combined oro-/nasopharyngeal sampling. Individuals with high suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested. Sensitivity, specificity, and percent agreement were calculated. Self-sampling was observed without intervention. Feasibility was evaluated by observer and participant questionnaires. RESULTS: Among 132 symptomatic adults, both professional anterior nasal and nasal mid-turbinate sampling yielded a sensitivity of 86.1% (31/36 RT-PCR positives detected; 95%CI: 71.3C93.9) and a specificity of 100.0% (95%CI: 95.7C100). The positive percent agreement was 100% (95%CI: 89.0C100). Among 96 additional adults, self nasal mid-turbinate and professional nasopharyngeal sampling yielded an identical sensitivity of 91.2% (31/34; 95%CI 77.0C97.0). Specificity was 98.4% (95%CI: 91.4C99.9) with nasal mid-turbinate and 100.0% (95%CI: 94.2C100) with nasopharyngeal sampling. The positive percent agreement was 96.8% (95%CI: 83.8C99.8). Most participants (85.3%) considered self-sampling as easy to perform. CONCLUSION: Professional anterior nasal and nasal mid-turbinate sampling are of equivalent accuracy for an antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test in ambulatory symptomatic adults.

Dexamethasone use might attenuate lung injury in these patients. Objective To determine whether intravenous dexamethasone increases the number of ventilator-free days among patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter, randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted in 41 intensive care units (ICUs) in Brazil. Patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, according to the Berlin definition, were enrolled from April 17 to June 23, 2020. Final follow-up was completed on July 21, 2020. The trial was stopped early following publication of a related study before reaching the planned sample size of 350 patients. Interventions Twenty mg of dexamethasone intravenously daily for 5 days, 10 mg of dexamethasone daily for 5 days or until ICU discharge, plus standard care (n =151) or standard care alone (n = 148). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was ventilator-free days during the first 28 days, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 28 days, clinical status of patients at day 15 using a 6-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1, not hospitalized to 6, death), ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (range, 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater organ dysfunction) at 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days. Results A total of 299 patients (mean [SD] age, 61 [14] years; 37% women) were enrolled and all completed follow-up. Patients randomized to the dexamethasone group had a mean 6.6 ventilator-free days (95% CI, 5.0-8.2) during the first 28 days vs 4.0 ventilator-free days (95% CI, 2.9-5.4) in the standard care group (difference, 2.26; 95% CI, 0.2-4.38; P = .04). At 7 days, patients in the dexamethasone group had a mean SOFA score of 6.1 (95% CI, 5.5-6.7) vs 7.5 (95% CI, 6.9-8.1) in the standard care group (difference, -1.16; 95% CI, -1.94 to -0.38; P = .004). There was no significant difference in the prespecified secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality at 28 days, ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, or the 6-point ordinal scale at 15 days. Thirty-three patients (21.9%) in the dexamethasone group vs 43 (29.1%) in the standard care group experienced secondary infections, 47 (31.1%) vs 42 (28.3%) needed insulin for glucose control, and 5 (3.3%) vs 9 (6.1%) experienced other serious adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS, use of intravenous dexamethasone plus standard care compared with standard care alone resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free of mechanical ventilation) over 28 days.

The phylogenetically divergent shrew HBVs comprise separate species termed crowned shrew HBV (CSHBV) and musk shrew HBV (MSHBV), each containing distinct genotypes. Recombination events across host orders, evolutionary reconstructions, and antigenic divergence of shrew HBVs corroborated ancient origins of mammalian HBVs dating back about 80 million years. Resurrected CSHBV replicated in human hepatoma cells, but human- and tupaia-derived primary hepatocytes were resistant to hepatitis D viruses pseudotyped with CSHBV surface proteins. Functional characterization of the shrew sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp), CSHBV/MSHBV surface peptide binding patterns, and infection experiments revealed lack of Ntcp-mediated entry of shrew HBV. Contrastingly, HBV entry was enabled by the shrew Ntcp. Shrew HBVs universally showed mutations in their genomic preCore domains impeding hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) production and resembling those observed in HBeAg-negative human HBV. Deep sequencing and in situ hybridization suggest that HBeAg-negative shrew HBVs cause intense hepatotropic monoinfections and low within-host genomic heterogeneity. Geographical clustering and low MSHBV/CSHBV-specific seroprevalence suggest focal transmission and high virulence of shrew HBVs. HBeAg negativity is thus an ancient HBV infection pattern, whereas Ntcp usage for entry is not evolutionarily conserved. Shrew infection models relying on CSHBV/MSHBV revertants and human HBV will allow comparative assessments of HBeAg-mediated HBV pathogenesis, entry, and species barriers.","output":"Highly diversified shrew hepatitis B viruses corroborate ancient origins and divergent infection patterns of mammalian hepadnaviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In the background of the global pandemic, we aim to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on diagnosis and treatment delay in urology patients.

The baseline characteristics and residential population of different types of diseases were compared in the two groups. Patients who underwent delay of diagnosis or treatment with poor outcomes were described. RESULTS: Our result revealed a 33.1% decrease of total resident population as well as a 44.8% decline in bed utilization rate after the outbreak. Significant differences were found between group A and group B in gender (P=0.024) and patients living alone or not (P=0.026).

The survey websites subscribers could access the questionnaire through the Tencent online platform, and a total of 1948 participants voluntarily completed it. Most of the participants were female (n = 1257, 64.528%), between the ages of 18C29 (n = 999, 51.284%), university graduates (n = 1015, 52.105%), and had an annual family income below 100,000 yuan (n = 1119, 57.444%). The differences in COVID-19 prevention behaviors among different social classes, the mediating role of infectious threat perception and the moderating role of perceived epidemic transparency were examined. RESULTS: 1) There were significant differences in prevention behaviors among different social classes. 2) The level of infectious threat perception played a mediating role in the relationship between social class and prevention behavior. When the individuals were from a lower social class, the level of threat perception and the level of COVID-19 prevention behaviors were also lower. 3) Perceived epidemic transparency played a moderating role in the relationship between social class and COVID-19 prevention behavior. It also played a moderating role in the relationship between social class and infectious threat perception. CONCLUSION: In the implementation of epidemic prevention and control measures, different social classes should be targeted and guided differently.

Sequence identity with the corresponding region of IBVs and coronaviruses from turkeys was > 95%. A RT-PCR for part of the S1 region of the spike protein gene was positive with 13/21 of the samples. Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products derived from nine of the pheasant viruses revealed that some of the viruses differed from each other by approximately 24%, similar to the degree of difference exhibited by different serotypes of IBV. Further analysis of the genome of one of the viruses revealed that it contained genes 3 and 5 that are typical of IBV but absent in both the transmissible gastroenteritis virus and murine hepatitis virus groups of mammalian coronaviruses. The nucleotide sequences of genes 3 and 5 of the pheasant virus had a similar degree of identity (approximately 90%) with those of coronaviruses from turkeys and chickens, as is observed when different serotypes of IBV are compared.

The DLR nitrogen dioxide (NO2) retrieval algorithm for the TROPOMI instrument consists of three steps: the spectral fitting of the slant column, the separation of stratospheric and tropospheric contributions, and the conversion of the slant column to a vertical column using an air mass factor (AMF) calculation. In this work, an improved DLR tropospheric NO2 retrieval algorithm from TROPOMI measurements over Europe is presented. The stratospheric estimation is implemented using the STRatospheric Estimation Algorithm from Mainz (STREAM), which was developed as a verification algorithm for TROPOMI and does not require chemistry transport model data as input. A directionally dependent STREAM (DSTREAM) is developed to correct for the dependency of the stratospheric NO2 on the viewing geometry by up to 21014 molec./cm2. Applied to synthetic TROPOMI data, the uncertainty in the stratospheric column is 3.51014 molec./cm2 in the case of significant tropospheric sources. Applied to actual measurements, the smooth variation of stratospheric NO2 at low latitudes is conserved, and stronger stratospheric variation at higher latitudes is captured.For AMF calculation, the climatological surface albedo data are replaced by geometry-dependent effective Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (GE_LER) obtained directly from TROPOMI measurements with a high spatial resolution. Mesoscale-resolution a priori NO2 profiles are obtained from the regional POLYPHEMUS/DLR chemistry transport model with the TNO-MACC emission inventory. Based on the latest TROPOMI operational cloud parameters, a more realistic cloud treatment is provided by a Clouds-As-Layers (CAL) model, which treats the clouds as uniform layers of water droplets, instead of the Clouds-As-Reflecting-Boundaries (CRB) model, in which clouds are simplified as Lambertian reflectors.For the error analysis, the tropospheric AMF uncertainty, which is the largest source of NO2 uncertainty for polluted scenarios, ranges between 20 % and 50 %, leading to a total uncertainty in the tropospheric NO2 column in the 30 %C60 % range. From a validation performed with ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements, the new DLR tropospheric NO2 data show good correlations for nine European urban/suburban stations, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.78. The implementation of the algorithm improvements leads to a decrease of the relative difference from -55.3 % to -34.7 % on average in comparison with the DLR reference retrieval.

Developing high throughput diagnostics which does not involve handling of infectious material becomes imperative in the case of pandemics such as the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV2. Methods: A protein microarray technology was used to detect the plurality of antibody response to four novel antigens namely S1 glycoprotein, Receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein of the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 using serum samples. A DBS card was additionally used to compare its performance with a venipuncture-based serum separator tube (SST) draw. Results: The three main subclasses of antibodies IgM, IgA and IgG were analyzed to see the variations in immune responses in the affected population and compared to their microbial RT-PCR based NP swab results. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 98.1% and 98.6%. In the matrix comparison study, which would enable patients to test without risk of transmitting the virus, DBS matched with higher than 98% accuracy to a venipuncture-based SST collection. Conclusion: Multiplex testing enables higher sensitivity and specificity which is essential while establishing exposure on a population scale. This flexible platform along with a discrete collection methodology would be crucial and broadly useful to scale up testing in current and future pandemics.

Despite global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now found in over 200 countries and has caused a death toll of over 1 million human lives as of November 2020. To date, only one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic drug (remdesivir) and a monoclonal antibody (MAb), bamlanivimab, are available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. As with other viruses, studying SARS-CoV-2 requires the use of secondary approaches to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells. To overcome this limitation, we have generated replication-competent recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) constructs expressing fluorescent (Venus or mCherry) or bioluminescent (Nluc) reporter genes. Vero E6 cells infected with reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be easily detected via fluorescence or luciferase expression and display a good correlation between reporter gene expression and viral replication. Moreover, rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes has plaque sizes and growth kinetics comparable to those of wild-type virus, rSARS-CoV-2/WT. We used these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 constructs to demonstrate their feasibility to identify neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or antiviral drugs. Our results demonstrate that reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 represents an excellent option to identify therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, where reporter gene expression can be used as a valid surrogate to track viral infection. Moreover, the ability to manipulate the viral genome opens the feasibility of generating viruses expressing foreign genes for their use as vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has significantly impacted the human health and economic status worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify effective prophylactics and therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19.

Here, we generated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) constructs expressing fluorescent (Venus and mCherry) or luciferase (Nluc) reporter genes and demonstrated that these viruses represent an excellent option to track viral infections in vitro. Importantly, reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 constructs display growth kinetics and plaque phenotypes similar to those of their wild-type counterpart (rSARS-CoV-2/WT), demonstrating their usefulness for identifying drugs and/or neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) for the therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

Most are associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs) but can be associated serious disease. More recently, novel coronaviruses associated with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 have emerged and are often associated with serious disease and death. With this report, we compare presenting clinical characteristics and some outcomes of patients hospitalized with RTIs caused by ECs or by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). METHODS: Patients admitted to the Summa Health System with RTIs associated with EC were identified via multiplex PCR method (BioFire?). Patients admitted with COVID-19 were identified by real-time, reverse transcriptase-PCR method using one of several platforms. Patients were selected from two existing quality improvement registries encompassing EC and COVID-19 cases. We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of EC patients to those of COVID-19 patients using chi-squared tests for proportions and independent samples t-tests for means. RESULTS: Shown in Table 1. Significant differences in patient characteristics with EC vs. COVID-19 included: older age, primarily Caucasian, smoking history, requiring O2 supplementation on admission, and having chronic heart, lung, or renal disease. Significant differences in patient characteristics with COVID-19 vs. EC included: admission from extended care facility, obesity, presenting with fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and/or myalgia, presence of radiographic infiltrates, abnormal liver tests, and longer length of stay (LOS).

An understanding of the utility of LUS in COVID-19 is crucial to determine its most suitable role based on local circumstances. Method: Online databases, specialist websites and social media platforms were searched to identify studies that explore the utility of LUS in COVID-19. Case reports and recommendations were excluded. Findings: In total, 33 studies were identified which represent a rapidly expanding evidence base for LUS in COVID-19. The quality of the included studies was relatively low; however, LUS certainly appears to be a highly sensitive and fairly specific test for COVID-19 in all ages and in pregnancy. Discussion: There may be LUS findings and patterns that are relatively specific to COVID-19; however, specificity may also be influenced by factors such as disease severity, pre-existing lung disease, operator experience, disease prevalence and the reference standard.

High-quality research is needed into various aspects of LUS including: diagnostic accuracy in undifferentiated patients; triage and prognostication; monitoring progression and guiding interventions; the persistence of residual LUS findings; inter-observer agreement and the role of contrast-enhanced LUS.","output":"The utility of lung ultrasound in COVID-19: A systematic scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage remains the standard staging system for the assessment of endometrial cancer (EC) prognosis. Thus, we aim to identify the significant genes or biomarkers associated with the stage of endometrial cancer, which may also help reveal the mechanism of EC progression and assess the prognosis of patients with EC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the mRNA expression levels of EC patients with stages I and II as well as stages III and IV in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of EC patients at different stages were selected by volcano plot and Venn analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Pathways were applied to analyze the identified genes. Protein protein interaction (PPI) network was employed to identify the correlation. The survival analyses based on TCGA database were conducted for further screening. The Human Protein Atlas, quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry were utilized to confirm the differences in expression of DEGs in endometrial cancer samples at different FIGO stages. RESULTS: CKMT1A was identified as a candidate gene. Through survival analyses, we found that CKMT1A may be a poor prognostic factor in the overall survival of endometrial cancer patients. GO and Pathways revealed that CKMT1A is closely associated with the metabolic process. More importantly, Human Protein Atlas and quantitative PCR confirmed the differences in expression of CKMT1A in endometrial cancer samples at different FIGO stages. CONCLUSION: In summary, this study shows that CKMT1A is a newly identified essential tumor progression regulator of endometrial cancer, which may give rise to novel therapeutic strategies in the management of endometrial cancer patients to prolong its prognosis and prevent tumor progression.","output":"CKMT1A is a novel potential prognostic biomarker in patients with endometrial cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the mid-2010s, with memories of the global financial crisis of 2008 (GFC) progressively fading, there has been increasing recognition of the potential contributions of market-based finance. This refers to credit intermediation conducted by non-bank entities, effectively what was termed in 2007 shadow banking. A number of policy-makers in the post-crisis years have praised the opportunity to reconcile shadow banking with resilient market-based channels of intermediation. The G30 in 2016 stressed particularly the potential that lies in securitisation and other forms of market-based finance. In the process though, market-based finance is also proposing the re-emergence of a business model that in the pre-crisis years was known as securitised banking.The post-crisis narrative suggests that the regulatory corrections that have been implemented since 2008 should contribute to transforming shadow banking into resilient market-based finance. The Basel III framework sits at the heart of the post-crisis regulatory architecture, and it was designed to protect large financial institutions from the risks flowing from market-based channels of intermediation. This general optimism though clashed with the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020, particularly insofar as it exposed some deep-seated fragilities in the financial system.This article therefore engages with a critical appraisal of that regulatory edifice, analysing in particular its capacity to respond to risks associated with pre-2008 securitised banking, as well as the challenges emerging from the more recent morphing in market-based channels of intermediation. The new Basel framework appears to provide the necessary safeguards to guarantee the stable operations of restored capital markets. This article observes though that despite providing much needed regulatory improvements from the pre-crisis regime, the current framework is still falling short in protecting the financial system from the risks that are generated by the evolution of market-based finance.","output":"Basel III and the Regulation of Market-Based Finance: The Tentative Reform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spike in deleterious mental health This dual-center retrospective cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence of depression in young adults during this pandemic and explored its association with various physical fitness measures Methods: This study enrolled 12,889 (80% female) young adults (mean age 20  1) who performed a National Student Physical Fitness battery from December 1st, 2019, to January 20th, 2020, and completed a questionnaire including Beck's Depression Inventory in May 2020 Independent associations between prior physical fitness and depression during the pandemic were assessed using multivariable linear and binary logistic regressions accordingly, covariates including age, dwelling location, economic level, smoking, alcohol, living status, weight change, and exercise volume during the pandemic Sex- and baseline stress-stratified analyses were performed Results: Of the study population 13 9% of men and 15 0% of women sampled qualified for a diagnosis of depression After multivariable adjustment, anaerobic (mean change 95% CI -3 3 [-4 8 to 1 8]) aerobic (-1 5 [-2 64 to -0 5]), explosive (-1 64 [-2 7 to -0 6]) and muscular (-1 7 [-3 0 to -0 5]) fitness were independently and inversely associated with depression for the overall population These remained consistent after sex- and baseline stress-stratification In binary logistic regression, the combined participants with moderate, high or excellent fitness also showed a much lower risk compared to those least fit in anaerobic (odd ratio (OR) 95% CI 0 68 [0 55-0 82]), aerobic (0 80 [0 68-0 91]), explosive (0 72 [0 61-0 82]), and muscular (0 66 [0 57-0 75]) fitness Conclusions: These findings suggest that prior physical fitness may be inversely associated with depression in young adults during a pandemic ? 2021 Dun et al","output":"The association between prior physical fitness and depression in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic-a crosssectional, retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the resident workforce to a particularly powerful and unexpected extent. Given the drastic changes to resident roles, expectations, and responsibilities, many valuable lessons regarding resident concerns and wellness can be garnered from this unique experience. METHODS: A voluntary survey was sent to 179 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited orthopaedic surgery residency program directors to distribute to their residents. Questions focused on issues that may have occurred, program's responses, and expectations of programs during the pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 507 residents completed the survey, and 10% reported being deployed to do nonorthopaedic-related care, with junior classes being more likely to receive this assignment (P < 0.001). The greatest concern for respondents was the possibility of getting family members sick (mean = 3.89, on scale of 1-5), followed by personally contracting the illness (mean = 3.38). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous changes and novel sources of adversity for the orthopaedic surgery resident. Contrary to popular opinion, most residents are comfortable with the proposition of providing nonorthopaedic care. The possibility of bringing a pathogen to the home environment and infecting family members seems to be an overarching concern, and efforts to ensure resident and family safety are key.","output":"Resident Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Nationwide Survey of Orthopaedic Residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of particle physics was completed. This description encompasses all known subatomic particles and their interactions. Much of the public interest in high-energy physics now focuses on experimental searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Yet it would be a mistake to imagine that the Standard Model is now fully understood. Many questions remain about the ways in which known fundamental particles interact and unite, especially at the very high energies needed to produce the most exotic varieties, such as heavy quarks (quarks are the constituents of hadrons, which include the ordinary nuclear particles protons and neutrons) and heavy leptons (leptons are members of the family that includes electrons). The Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPC), operated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of High Energy Physics, is one of the installations that are probing these questions. It has been running since 1988, using a detector called the Beijing Spectrometer (BES). (The site also houses the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility for conducting studies in condensed matter using intense X-rays.) Since 2008, these two instruments have been operating in upgraded form: the BESIII detector and BEPCII accelerator. The facility is now one of the key international centers for investigating the properties and behavior of new exotic hadrons, in particular those that include the charm quark. Italian physicist Luciano Maiani, Director of the European particle physics center CERN in Switzerland from 1999 to 2003, is one of the world leaders in this area of high-energy physics, and played a central role in the identification of the charm quark itself.

We develop a discrete-time soft-constrained linear-quadratic dynamic game under a worst-case design with multiple disturbances. Within this context, we introduce a resilience feedback response and compare the case where the policymakers counter in response the external incident with the case when they do not counter. This framework is especially applicable to large-scale macroeconomic tracking control models and wavelet-based control models when formulating the magnitudes of the policy changes necessary for the unemployment rate and national output variables to maintain acceptable tracking errors in the periods following a major disruption.

Among SARS-CoV-2Cpositive patients, 40 patients were hospitalized, and 17 patients required intensive care unit admission due to COVID-19 (76.9% and 32.7%, respectively).

In the logistic regression analysis, antipsychotic dose, and comorbidity score were independently associated with a greater risk of severe COVID-19 disease in patients with schizophrenia. Our study suggests that factors such as age, sex, comorbidities, and a daily antipsychotic dose may have effects on the poor outcome of SARS-CoV-2 disease in schizophrenia patients. In addition, the current findings propose that mortality may be associated with an older age, comorbidity score, and a longer duration of psychiatric disease among the SARS-CoV-2Cpositive patients with schizophrenia.

The hazards stem from chemical and microbiological agents whose nature and magnitude depend heavily on the degree of sorting and on the composting methods. Three main routes of exposure can be determined and are quantified in the literature: (i) The ingestion of soil/compost mixtures by children, mostly in cases of pica, can be a threat because of the amount of lead, chromium, cadmium, PCDD F and fecal streptococci that can be absorbed. (ii) Though concern about contamination through the food chain is weak when compost is used in agriculture, some authors anticipate accumulation of pollutants after several years of disposal, which might lead to future hazards. (iii) Exposure is also associated with atmospheric dispersion of compost organic dust that convey microorganisms and toxicants. Data on hazard posed by organic dust from municipal composts to the farmer or the private user is scarce. To date, microorganisms are only measured at composting plants, thus raising the issue of extrapolation to environmental situations. Lung damage and allergies may occur because of organic dust, Gram negative bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi.

To fill this need, we implemented a two hidden-layers artificial neural networks (ANN) on 376 antibodies and 19 biological traits measured in the plasma of 1388 DVT patients, with or without PE, of the MARTHA study. We used the LIME algorithm to obtain a linear approximate of the resulting ANN prediction model. As MARTHA patients were typed for genotyping DNA arrays, a genome wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on the LIME estimate. Detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with PE risk in MARTHA. Main findings were replicated in the EOVT study composed of 143 PE patients and 196 DVT only patients.

This article explores the potential value of using triage tests before reference tests when the capacity of the reference test is constrained. METHODS: We developed a simple model with inputs: prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and reference test capacity. We included a case study of rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 antigens used as triage tests before a reference polymerase chain reaction test. Performance data were obtained from an evaluation performed by an academic center on 425 samples from testing centers in the United Kingdom and Germany. RESULTS: When reference test capacity is constrained, the use of a triage test leads to a relative expansion of the population tested and cases identified; both are higher with a high-specificity triage test. When reference test capacity is not constrained, the potential advantages of introducing a triage test can be assessed using a standard cost-utility framework, balancing the utility of the reduction in the number of reference tests required against the disutility of missed cases associated with the use of a lower-sensitivity triage test. In the constrained case, the advantage of a triage testing strategy in terms of population covered and cases identified is reduced as the prevalence increases. In the unconstrained case, the reduction in reference tests required is reduced and the number of cases missed increase as the prevalence rises. CONCLUSION: When the availability of the reference test is constrained, tests added in a triage position do not need high levels of accuracy to increase the number of cases diagnosed.

Their grip strength has not, to our knowledge, been compared. This article compares a needle-free suture technique to a standard whip stitch by testing grip strength in vitro. METHODS Twelve uniform ovine flexor tendons were prepared; six tendons with a standard, non-locking whip stitch and six tendons with a grasping suture. All the samples were tested to failure in uniaxial tension in a materials testing machine. Load/displacement curves were generated, and qualitatively assessed and peak loads were compared. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the groups in tendon length or diameter. Modes of failure between the groups, as characterised by the load/displacement curves, were quite distinct. Peak load to failure was lower in the utility suture group (mean peak load at failure 121.28 N) than the whip stitch group (mean peak load to failure 188.82 N). All failures in the utility suture group occurred when the suture snapped.

Here, we utilized nationwide surveys that assess COVID-19 associated symptoms to analyse the effect of the lockdown policy in Israel on the prevalence of clinical symptoms in the population. Daily symptom surveys were distributed online and included fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia and Ageusia. A total of 1,003,298 surveys were filled out to date. We used a single measure of symptoms, Symptoms Ratio (SR), defined as a weighted mean of symptoms found to be prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Notably, following severe lockdown measures, we found that between March 15 and April 22, the mean SR sharply declined by 78.9%, as did every individual symptom, including our most common symptoms of cough and rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, which decreased from 14.5% and 13.8% of the survey responders, respectively, to 2.4% and 2.5%. We also observed reduction in symptoms separately in the vast majority of cities in Israel. Overall, these results demonstrate a profound decrease in a variety of clinical symptoms following the implementation of a lockdown in Israel.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the level of learning engagement and its relationship with students' perceived learning satisfaction in an online clinical nursing elective course. DESIGN: A prospective interventional study. SETTINGS: A nursing course was converted to an online format because of the coronavirus disease COVID pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Part-time post-registration nursing undergraduates enrolled in an elective online clinical course. METHODS: Related teaching and learning strategies were deployed in the course using the Community of Inquiry framework. All students who completed the course were invited to complete an online survey that included a validated Online Student Engagement questionnaire (OSE). Pearson's correlations were used to determine the association between perceived learning satisfaction and learning engagement. A logistic regression model was used to explore the associations of gender, age, working experience and perceived learning satisfaction with higher learning engagement. RESULTS: The questionnaires were completed by 56 of 68 students (82%). The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the mean perceived learning satisfaction and OSE scores was 0.75 (p < .001). Twenty-five students (45%) were identified as highly engaged, using a cut-off of &#8805;3.5 for the mean OSE score. The mean perceived learning satisfaction (SD) score differed significantly between highly engaged and not highly engaged students [4.02 (0.49) vs. 3.27 (0.62), p < .001]. The logistic regression model showed that a greater perceived learning satisfaction [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 17.2, 95% C.I.: 3.46-86.0, p = .001] was associated with an increased likelihood of higher learning engagement, and >1 year of working experience (adjusted OR: 0.11, 95% C.I.: 0.01-0.89, p = .0039) was associated with a decreased likelihood of higher learning engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that perceived learning satisfaction predicts learning engagement among nursing students in this online learning course.","output":"Evaluating online learning engagement of nursing students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, with its accompanying isolation measures, has led to increasing loneliness among older adults. In this study, we examine whether the increased level of loneliness observed in the Netherlands persisted into the fall of 2020, whether there were differences in emotional, social, and existential loneliness, and whether the presence of well-known risk factors for loneliness also led to further increases in loneliness during the pandemic. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, with observations of 404 community-dwelling older adults aged 74C96 years from 2019 and fall 2020. RESULTS: Loneliness increased between 2019 and 2020, and the increase was particularly high for emotional loneliness (partial  (2) = 0.19). Having a partner and a high mastery and good physical functioning before the pandemic provided some protection against an increase in loneliness. DISCUSSION: Loneliness increased for almost all older people. Targeted policies can reduce the negative impact of vulnerabilities. Efforts to combat loneliness during the pandemic should focus not only on groups traditionally considered vulnerable, such as socially isolated people, but also on older adults with a partner and who have daily contact with others.","output":"Emotional, Social, and Existential Loneliness Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Prevalence and Risk Factors Among Dutch Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pilot program for automated directional drilling was implemented as a part of the roll out plan in Norway to drill three dimensional wells in an automated mode, where steering commands were carried out automatically by the automation platform. The rollout plan also targeted the use of remote operations to allow personnel to be relocated from the rig location into remote drilling centers. The goal of the program was to optimize the directional drilling performance by assessing the benefits of automation using the latest rotary steerable system technologies and machine learning smart algorithms to predict and manipulated the BHA performance, as well as the ability to predict the best drilling parameters for hole cleaning. The automation was implemented on three different rigs and the data was compared with the drilling performance from the last two years, with three dimensional wells drilled in the conventional method. The main benefits between drilling wells in the conventional method versus drilling wells with the new drilling automation model include the following. ? Reduce the overall cost per meter - Improve the rate of penetration - Improve running casings ? Consistence process adherence - Reduce human errors - Reduce POB without sacrificing lost of technical experience ? Optimize workforce resources - Allows continuity of service (COVID-19 restrictions) Drilling automation can drill smoother wells by reducing the friction factors and tortuosity. This is translated in direct cost savings per meter and reduction in the overall well delivery time, with the advantage of performing the execution and monitoring of the well performance remotely. This new drilling model open the door of new opportunities, especially for the challenges where the work force resources, and drilling performance is a priority for the operations. ?

Little is known about the immunisation cascade in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), defined as how children move from zero dose to full immunisation. METHODS: Using data from national surveys carried out in 92 LMICs since 2010 and focusing on the four basic vaccines delivered in infancy (BCG, polio, DPT and MCV), we describe zero-dose prevalence and the immunisation cascade in children aged 12 to 23 months. We also describe the most frequent combinations of vaccines (or co-coverage) among children who are partially immunized. Analyses are stratified by country income groups, household wealth quintiles derived from asset indices, sex of the child and area of residence. Results were pooled across countries using child populations as weights. RESULTS: In the 92 countries, 7.7% were in the zero-dose group, and 3.3%, 3.4% and 14.6% received one, two or three vaccines, respectively; 70.9% received the four types and 59.9% of the total were fully immunised with all doses of the four vaccines. Three quarters (76.8%) of children who received the first vaccine received all four types. Among children with a single vaccine, polio was the most common in low- and lower-middle income countries, and BCG in upper-middle income countries. There were sharp inequalities according to household wealth, with zero-dose prevalence ranging from 12.5% in the poorest to 3.4% in the wealthiest quintile across all countries. The cascades were similar for boys and girls. In terms of dropout, 4% of children receiving BCG did not receive DPT1, 14% receiving DPT1 did not receive DPT3, and 9% receiving DPT3 did not progress to receive MCV. Interpretation. Focusing on zero-dose children is particularly important because those who are reached with the first vaccine are highly likely to also receive remaining vaccines.","output":"Zero-dose children and the immunisation cascade: Understanding immunisation pathways in low and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity are major medical problems globally.

Meanwhile, it has been established that coronavirus infection can extend beyond the respiratory system and unfortunately, can also affect our nervous system. Multiple neurological symptoms and signs had been documented during and post covid conditions. This virus gets access to the central nervous system (CNS) via the bloodstream leading to infect the endothelial lining cells. Also, it was reported that the virus can enter the peripheral nervous system via retrograde neuronal routes.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that overall progress in malaria control has plateaued for the first time since the turn of the century. Researchers and policymakers are therefore exploring alternative and supplementary malaria vector control tools. Research in 1900 indicated that modification of houses may be effective in reducing malaria: this is now being revisited, with new research now examining blocking house mosquito entry points or modifying house construction materials to reduce exposure of inhabitants to infectious bites. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of house modifications on malaria disease and transmission. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CAB) Abstracts (Web of Science); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), up to 1 November 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/) to identify ongoing trials up to the same date. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials, including cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), cross-over studies, and stepped-wedge designs were eligible, as were quasi-experimental trials, including controlled before-and-after studies, controlled interrupted time series, and non-randomized cross-over studies. We only considered studies reporting epidemiological outcomes (malaria case incidence, malaria infection incidence or parasite prevalence). We also summarised qualitative studies conducted alongside included studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used risk ratios (RR) to compare the effect of the intervention with the control for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we presented the mean difference; and for count and rate data, we used rate ratios. We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS Six cRCTs met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in sub-Saharan Africa; three randomized by household, two by village, and one at the community level. All trials assessed screening of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings or any combination of these; this was either alone, or in combination with eave closure, roof modification or eave tube installation (a \\"lure and kill\\" device that reduces mosquito entry whilst maintaining some airflow). In two trials, the interventions were insecticide-based. In five trials, the researchers implemented the interventions. The community implemented the interventions in the sixth trial. At the time of writing the review, two of the six trials had published results, both of which compared screened houses (without insecticide) to unscreened houses. One trial in Ethiopia assessed screening of windows and doors. Another trial in the Gambia assessed full screening (screening of eaves, doors and windows), as well as screening of ceilings only. Screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused by Plasmodium falciparum (rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 1 trial, 184 participants, 219.3 person-years; low-certainty evidence; Ethiopian study). For malaria parasite prevalence, the point estimate, derived from The Gambia study, was smaller (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17; 713 participants, 1 trial; low-certainty evidence), and showed an effect on anaemia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42, 0.89; 705 participants; 1 trial, moderate-certainty evidence). Screening may reduce the entomological inoculation rate (EIR): both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. In the Gambian trial, there was a mean difference in EIR between the control houses and treatment houses ranging from 0.45 to 1.50 (CIs ranged from -0.46 to 2.41; low-certainty evidence), depending on the study year and treatment arm. The Ethiopian trial reported a mean difference in EIR of 4.57, favouring screening (95% CI 3.81 to 5.33; low-certainty evidence). Pooled analysis of the trials showed that individuals living in fully screened houses were slightly less likely to sleep under a bed net (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; 2 trials, 203 participants). In one trial, bed net usage was also lower in individuals living in houses with screened ceilings (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 1 trial, 135 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on the two trials published to date, there is some evidence that screening may reduce malaria transmission and malaria infection in people living in the house.

In the current work, we aimed to investigate the impact of formulation type on biodistribution profile for two clinically relevant nanoformulations. We performed a comparative study of biodistribution in healthy rats at several dose levels and durations up to 14-day post-injection. The studied nanoformulations were nanostructured lipid carriers incorporating the fluorescent dye IR780-oleyl, and polymeric nanoparticles containing the anticancer agent cabazitaxel. The biodistribution was approximated by quantification of the cargo in blood and relevant organs. Several clear and systematic differences in biodistribution were observed, with the most pronounced being a much higher (more than 50-fold) measured concentration ratio between cabazitaxel in all organs vs. blood, as compared to IR780-oleyl. Normalized dose linearity largely showed opposite trends between the two compounds after injection. Cabazitaxel showed a higher brain accumulation than IR780-oleyl with increasing dose injected. Interestingly, cabazitaxel showed a notable and prolonged accumulation in lung tissue compared to other organs. The latter observations could warrant further studies towards a possible therapeutic indication within lung and conceivably brain cancer for nanoformulations of this highly antineoplastic compound, for which off-target toxicity is currently dose-limiting in the clinic.

It is evident from these studies that individuals experienced elevated levels of anxiety and depression in the acute phase, when they first became aware of the pandemic, and that the psychological distress persisted into subsequent weeks. It is becoming apparent that technological tools such as SMS text messages, web-based interventions, mobile interventions, and conversational agents can help ameliorate psychological distress in the workplace and in society. To our knowledge, there are few publications describing how digital tools have been used to ameliorate psychological symptoms among individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify existing SMS text message, web-based, mobile, and conversational agents that the general public can access to ameliorate the psychological symptoms they are experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To identify digital tools that were published specifically for COVID-19, a search was performed in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases from the inception of the databases through June 17, 2020. The following search strings were used: NCOV OR 2019-nCoV OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus OR COVID19 OR COVID and mHealth OR eHealth OR text. Another search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE to identify existing digital tools for depression and anxiety disorders. A web-based search engine (Google) was used to identify if the cited web-based interventions could be accessed. A mobile app search engine, App Annie, was used to determine if the identified mobile apps were commercially available. Results: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were identified.

For the present observational study, the first 100 patients who were scheduled to have an appointment between April 20 and May 18 during the partial lockdown and also had been treated regularly before the lockdown were recruited. Clinical and demographical characteristics and treatment-related data from the previous visits were extracted from charts. Time delay, symptom severity assessment, and TSUI score (if applicable) were gathered at the first coronavirus pandemic lockdown emergency visit for each patient. Of the 94 patients who could come to the clinic, 48 reported a delay and 44 reported worsening during the delay. Delays ranged from 1 to 63 days, the mean delay was 23 days, and the mean worsening was 26% compared to the previous visit. A significant correlation was found between the duration of the delay and the patients rating of worsening (PwP). In CD patients, the physicians rating of CD worsening by the TSUI score (ATUSI-PTSUI) was significantly correlated with general worsening (DwP) and the TSUI at the last visit (PTSUI). A small delay of a few weeks led to a similar worsening of symptoms in CD and all other disease entities and to relapse on a higher level of severity. This relapse can only be compensated by continuous treatment up to at least 1 year until patients reach the same level of treatment efficacy as that before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Lockdown on a Botulinum Toxin Outpatient Clinic in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A chatbot is emerged as an effective tool to address the user queries in automated, most appropriate and accurate way.

The data of the study were collected using online questionnaires, and the proposed hypotheses were tested and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of the study revealed that COVID-19-related suspicion positively and significantly predicted COVID-19-related fear and anxiety. In this context, the increased suspicion of graduate students due to COVID-19 also increased their fear and COVID-19-related anxiety, and this increased the possibility that they would exhibit depressive behaviors. However, a positive and significant relationship was found between COVID-19-related suspicion and depression. This result confirms that the increased suspicion of the participant students due to COVID-19 led to an increase in their depression scores. SEM results have shown a positive relationship between fear and anxiety related to COVID-19 and Internet addiction, and that the increase in students' anxiety and fear levels also increases their Internet addiction levels.

Early data brought hope that acquired immunity was possible1 but subsequent studies suggested that immune protection might be short-lived. The results of recent studies provide greater insight into the human immune response to COVID-192,3. The Qatar Gas medical department's strategy in preventing spread of infection among offshore and onshore workers consisted of maximizing the opportunities for COVID-19 polymerise chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing. A large amount of data revealing the possible lifespan of COVID-19 antibodies in the study population was collected. Methods: Out of hundreds of employees who volunteered in this study about seroprevalance of COVID-19 antibodies, 52 whose results were reactive were tested for COVID-19 PCR before being selected. Employees with reactive or inconclusive PCR test results were excluded. Age, medical/surgical/social history, apart from past COVID-19 infection, were not selection criteria. We measured the period of time between the date of diagnosis and the antibody test result, segregating those still reactive from those who tested non-reactive at any point in time. The reactive group were retested for antibodies every 90 days as long as results continued to be reactive. Any cured employee was retested if they developed symptoms or was exposed to a confirmed positive case, to rule out the possibility of re-infection during this timeframe. Results: Only one employee was non-reactive after 110 days of COVID-19 PCR positive test result. 22 employees tested reactive although their PCR result had been negative. 30 employees tested reactive after a positive PCR with an average duration of 145 days, the shortest and longest being 24 and 223 respectively (Figure 1). Conclusion: We determined that antibodies' longevity may extend to more than 6 months following COVID-19 infection and that there may be an early decay of antibodies in a limited proportion of the population, however further studies are recommended on larger populations. We noticed no cases of COVID-19 reinfection.","output":"Life span of Covid-19 antibodies following infection in a sample worker population in Qatar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first 1000 days of life, from conception to 2 years, are a critical window for the influence of environmental exposures on the assembly of the oral microbiome, which is the precursor to dental caries (decay), one of the most prevalent microbially induced disorders worldwide.

Many issues could reduce the quality of students' Wi-Fi use, e.g., devices using different Wi-Fi standards than those used on campus, and numerous students accessing Wi-Fi through a single access point simultaneously. Understanding where, when and how students use Wi-Fi on campus can help IT administrators to provide an adequate Wi-Fi service. This pre-COVID study adopted a mixed method approach. Questionnaires were completed by a representative sample of 373 students on the Westville campus of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Two Information Communication Services (ICS) staff members were interviewed to gain insights into how the Wi-Fi was set up, and their perspectives on how students utilise the Wi-Fi. The questionnaire data were analysed statistically, and interview results were used to explain results. The students' most used venues, and the places they encountered poor and best Wi-Fi signal quality, are presented, along with the durations of use and problems encountered. When analysing these results by students' residence type, each category showed a different pattern of use. These results can help IT administrators understand where to improve the Wi-Fi quality, if necessary.

We aimed to gather evidence to establish whether nitrous oxide affects perioperative cardiovascular risk. METHODS We did an international, randomised, assessor-blinded trial in patients aged at least 45 years with known or suspected coronary artery disease having major non-cardiac surgery. Patients were randomly assigned via automated telephone service, stratified by site, to receive a general anaesthetic with or without nitrous oxide. Attending anaesthetists were aware of patients' group assignments, but patients and assessors were not. The primary outcome measure was a composite of death and cardiovascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac arrest) within 30 days of surgery. Our modified intention-to-treat population included all patients randomly assigned to groups and undergoing induction of general anaesthesia for surgery. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00430989. FINDINGS Of 10,102 eligible patients, we enrolled 7112 patients between May 30, 2008, and Sept 28, 2013. 3543 were assigned to receive nitrous oxide and 3569 were assigned not to receive nitrous oxide. 3483 patients receiving nitrous oxide and 3509 not receiving nitrous oxide were assessed for the primary outcome. The primary outcome occurred in 283 (8%) patients receiving nitrous oxide and in 296 (8%) patients not receiving nitrous oxide (relative risk 096, 95% CI 083C112; p=064). Surgical site infection occurred in 321 (9%) patients assigned to nitrous oxide, and in 311 (9%) patients in the no-nitrous oxide group (p=061), and severe nausea and vomiting occurred in 506 patients (15%) assigned to nitrous oxide and 378 patients (11%) not assigned to nitrous oxide (p<00001). INTERPRETATION Our findings support the safety profile of nitrous oxide use in major non-cardiac surgery. Nitrous oxide did not increase the risk of death and cardiovascular complications or surgical-site infection, the emetogenic effect of nitrous oxide can be controlled with antiemetic prophylaxis, and a desired effect of reduced volatile agent use was shown.

However, prevailing views do not clearly explain how to drive dual business model innovation. Based on the upper echelon theory, this study developed a multiple mediation model, which links entrepreneurial cognition of the top management team (TMT), knowledge search with dual business model innovation. By taking the data of 217 TMTs, the hypotheses are verified. The results show that TMT's configuration cognition, willing cognition, and ability cognition all have a positive effect on both proactive and reactive business model innovation. Knowledge search acts as a 'bridge';between TMT's entrepreneurial cognition and DBMI. Greater entrepreneurial cognition can guide exploratory and exploitative knowledge searches and promote the DBMI. The results also show the mediating effect between different entrepreneurial cognition and DBMI is not completely consistent, and a partial mediation effect exists associating configuration cognition with DBMI, but a full mediation effect is present between other cognitions and DBMI.

Proximie is an augmented reality (AR) platform that can display up to 4 native camera views, with live or semi live telementoring. It can optimise ergonomics of the surgeon at the console (2), and robotic instrument orientation. We describe the utilisation of Proximie as a step-by-step guide in a robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Author V. P. performed a transperitoneal multiport da Vinci Xi RARP with the Proximie platform: a laptop computer, multiple HD webcams, microphones and speakers. Using an HDMI cable to the Intuitive Surgical tower, output display from the console and an additional laparoscopic tower is shown. Each webcam was mounted to the side armrests of the console, directed at the surgeon's hands. An independent drop in laparoscope via an additional 5mm left upper quadrant port was utilised. Observers can visualise the AR platform's recordings on a laptop and/or smartphone. A PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) camera can capture the operating room, bedside assistant, ports and patient position. Our video demonstrates three of four camera views for posture, forearm, wrist, hand, and finger orientation, relative to the translated robotic steps. A pincer grasp of the endowrist manipulator during anastomosis allows optimal robotic wrist rotation. The second laparoscopic camera view demonstrated intracorporeal angles of robotic arm and bedside assistant's instrument position for critical steps such as nerve sparing and anastomosis (3). The console time was 100 minutes, no intraoperative complications, or delay in image transmission occurred with utilising the platform. CONSIDERATIONS: An AR platform can create deeper learning for RARP in real time or recorded sessions. Two-way verbal and visual communication with ability to annotate on screen, allows long distance mentoring. The platform's utility can be accessed in anywhere, to project surgeons beyond their immediate environment. This allows for democratisation of access to high volume institutions and their evolution of techniques (4), to assist patients globally. Potential developments are artificial intelligence (AI) networks analysing repository of such recorded data, to identify intraoperative hand motion and robotic instrument tracking. AR is a pertinent building block to enhance robotic training, skill dissemination, precision medicine (5) and surgery overall.","output":"Step-by-step optimisation of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy using augmented reality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic respiratory illness spreading from person-to-person caused by a novel coronavirus and poses a serious public health risk.

The model equations are solved numerically using fourth and fifth order RungeCKutta methods. RESULTS: We found an [Formula: see text] of 2.03, implying that the pandemic will persist in the human population in the absence of strong control measures.

Amongst the neuronal CaV2 channel family, CaV2.2 is of particular importance due to its general role for signal transmission from the periphery to the central nervous system, but also due to its significance for pain perception. Thus, CaV2.2 is an ideal target candidate to search for pharmacological inhibitors but also for novel modulatory interactors. In this review we summarize the last years findings of our intense screenings and characterization of the six CaV2.2 interaction partners, tetraspanin-13 (TSPAN-13), reticulon 1 (RTN1), member 1 of solute carrier family 38 (SLC38), prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS), transmembrane protein 223 (TMEM223) and transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif 3 (Grina/TMBIM3) containing protein. Each protein shows a unique way of channel modulation as shown by extensive electrophysiological studies.

These are aspirational goals that together support a decent quality of life. Crossing monetary, poverty thresholds may enable such goals. Most estimates of where the monetary threshold lies derive the estimates circularly from monetary costs of living. The link to quality of living is thereby made by fiat, untested empirically in everyday human experience. We already know we can measure income independently of middle class quality of life, and probe for relationships between the two. Why not for poverty too? A quantity of money where quality of life changed would mark a genuine threshold required for example to escape from poverty traps. Using this approach, studies in quality of workClife, using multiple indicators, have identified at least three thresholds where quality of life ticked markedly upwards, including inter-threshold ranges where gradients went from zero to positive.

Telehealth is not being used ubiquitously at present. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to identify the barriers that prevent ubiquitous use of telehealth and the ways in which telehealth improves health outcomes and quality of life indicators for older adults. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Kruse protocol and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Reviewers queried the following four research databases: Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, and Embase (Science Direct). Reviewers analyzed 57 articles, performed a narrative analysis to identify themes, and identified barriers and reports of health outcomes and quality of life indicators found in the literature. RESULTS: Reviewers analyzed 57 studies across the following five interventions of telehealth: eHealth, mobile health (mHealth), telemonitoring, telecare (phone), and telehealth video calls, with a Cohen  of 0.75. Reviewers identified 14 themes for barriers. The most common of which were technical literacy (25/144 occurrences, 17%), lack of desire (19/144 occurrences, 13%), and cost (11/144 occurrences, 8%). Reviewers identified 13 medical outcomes associated with telehealth interventions. The most common of which were decrease in psychological stress (21/118 occurrences, 18%), increase in autonomy (18/118 occurrences, 15%), and increase in cognitive ability (11/118 occurrences, 9%). Some articles did not report medical outcomes (18/57, 32%) and some did not report barriers (19/57, 33%). CONCLUSIONS: The literature suggests that the elimination of barriers could increase the prevalence of telehealth use by older adults. By increasing use of telehealth, proximity to care is no longer an issue for access, and thereby care can reach populations with chronic conditions and mobility restrictions. Future research should be conducted on methods for personalizing telehealth in older adults before implementation.

Therefore, the aim of the current review is to highlight the potential of two endogenous gasotransmitters - hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO) - and their crosstalk in AKI treatment. Both H2S and NO are endogenous signalling molecules involved in several physiological and pathophysiological processes, such as the ones taking place in the renal system. Overall, these molecules act by decreasing inflammation, controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations, activating/inactivating pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as promoting vasodilation and decreasing apoptosis, hypertrophy and autophagy. Since these gasotransmitters are found in gaseous state at environmental conditions, they can be directly applied by inhalation, or in combination with H2S and NO donors, which are compounds capable of releasing these molecules at biological conditions, thus enabling higher stability and slow release of NO and H2S. Moreover, the combination between these donor compounds and nanomaterials has the potential to enable targeted treatments, reduce side effects and increase the potential of H2S and NO. Finally, it is essential highlighting challenges to, and perspectives in, pharmacological applications of H2S and NO to treat AKI, mainly in combination with nanoparticulated delivery platforms.","output":"H2S- and NO-releasing gasotransmitter platform: A crosstalk signaling pathway in the treatment of acute kidney injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe respiratory failure patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) sometimes do not receive post intensive care syndrome prevention bundles.

On day 6, he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Considering the risk of nosocomial infection, as per the hospital policy, early rehabilitation could not be initiated for COVID-19 patients at that the time and family visits were not allowed. Thereafter, his respiratory condition gradually improved; he was discharged on day 19. Then, when the ICU nurse called to assess his medical condition, the patient complained insomnia after ICU discharge. Therefore, we called him for an outpatient visit 28 days after discharge and scored his mental health status.

Among them, collaborative filtering (CF) approaches have shown leading accuracy performance compared to content-based filtering (CBF) methods. Their success is due to an effective exploitation of similarities/correlations encoded in user interaction patterns, which is computed by considering common items users rated in the past. However, their strength is also their weakness. Indeed, a malicious agent can alter recommendations by adding fake user profiles into the platform thereby altering the actual similarity values in an engineered way. The spread of well-curated information available in knowledge graphs ([Formula: see text]) has opened the door to several new possibilities in compromising the security of a recommender system. In fact, [Formula: see text] are a wealthy source of information that can dramatically increase the attackers (and the defenders) knowledge of the underlying system. In this paper, we introduce SAShA, a new attack strategy that leverages semantic features extracted from a knowledge graph in order to strengthen the efficacy of the attack to standard CF models. We performed an extensive experimental evaluation in order to investigate whether SAShA is more effective than baseline attacks against CF models by taking into account the impact of various semantic features. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show the usefulness of our strategy in favor of attackers capacity in attacking CF models.","output":"SAShA: Semantic-Aware Shilling Attacks on Recommender Systems Exploiting Knowledge Graphs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stimulation of the vagus nerve, a parasympathetic nerve that controls the neuro-digestive, vascular, and immune systems, induces pain relief, particularly in clinical conditions such as headache and rheumatoid arthritis. Transmission through vagal afferents towards the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST), the central relay nucleus of the vagus nerve, has been proposed as the main physiological mechanism that reduces pain intensity after vagal stimulation. Chronic pain symptoms of fibromyalgia patients might benefit from stimulation of the vagus nerve via normalization of altered autonomic and immune systems causing their respective symptoms. However, multi-session non-invasive vagal stimulation effects on fibromyalgia have not been evaluated in randomized clinical trials. We propose a parallel group, sham-controlled, randomized study to modulate the sympatheticCvagal balance and pain intensity in fibromyalgia patients by application of non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) over the vagal auricular and cervical branches. We will recruit 136 fibromyalgia patients with chronic moderate to high pain intensity. The primary outcome measure will be pain intensity, and secondary measures will be fatigue, health-related quality of life, sleep disorders, and depression. Heart rate variability and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels will be obtained as secondary physiological measures. We hypothesize that multiple tVNS sessions (five per week, for 4 weeks) will reduce pain intensity and improve quality of life as a result of normalization of the vagal control of nociception and immuneCautonomic functions. Since both vagal branches project to the NST, we do not predict significantly different results between the two stimulation protocols.","output":"Non-Invasive Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation for the Treatment of Fibromyalgia Symptoms: A Study Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection caused pneumonia. we retrospectively analyzed the virus presence in the pharyngeal swab, blood, and the anal swab detected by real-time PCR in the clinical lab.

The samples were tested by specific real-time RT-PCRs targeting SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and RSVs. Results: Of these NPSs, 31% tested positive for influenza viruses, 10% for SARS-CoV-2, and 7% for RSV. No coinfections were detected. Influenza viruses and RSVs circulated throughout the surveillance period until the end of February (week 9-2020), when they suddenly ceased to circulate seven weeks earlier than during the previous five influenza seasons. After the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in our ILI outpatients at the beginning of March (week 10-2020), SARS-CoV-2 remained the only virus identified throughout the surveillance period. Patients  65 years had a 3.2-fold greater risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, while school-age children (5C14 years) and children < 5 years proved to be the age groups most at risk of contracting influenza viruses and RSV, respectively. Our experience demonstrates that laboratory-based ILI surveillance networks are essential for identifying SARS-CoV-2 cases that would otherwise remain undetected, in order to stop their spread within our communities.","output":"When the COVID-19 Pandemic Surges during Influenza Season: Lessons Learnt from the Sentinel Laboratory-Based Surveillance of Influenza-Like Illness in Lombardy during the 2019C2020 Season"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aims to detect the opportunities and problems when teaching with cases since the COVID-19 pivot to online. Design/methodology/approach From a qualitative phenomenological approach, both authors reflect on the pivot to online case method teaching in their master's level courses in Colombia and the Dominican Republic. Findings The reflection allowed the authors to validate that the questions before and during the debate and the voting are resources equally valuable for discussing cases in the traditional classroom and online. However, the authors observe a pivot to teaching with cases online from the COVID-19 pandemic in aspects such as teamwork requiring more time in online class due to internet problems or students' slowing down. The instructor's viewing of teamwork is intermittent and causes feeling out of control. Working with cameras on or off generates different results in the students, in the teaching-learning process and in the results, which require the instructor's good judgement decisions. The online discussion planning and organisation demand flexibility and empathy by the instructor, to promote a more significant student-student interaction, which, in the experience, is limited in the virtual environment. Finally, working with cases online generates and requires additional skills in the instructors to those of the traditional classroom. Originality/value The study's originality consists of identifying the main divergences between face-to-face and online teaching with the case method, from the COVID-19 pivot to online. The study's value is to warn instructors of problems that may arise in online teaching with the case method, for which recommendations are made.","output":"Teaching with the case method: opportunities and problems since the COVID-19 pivot to online"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To analyze the application of a lung ultrasound (LUS)-based diagnostic approach to patients suspected of COVID-19, combining the LUS likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia with patient's symptoms and clinical history. METHODS: This is an international multicenter observational study in 20 US and European hospitals. Patients suspected of COVID-19 were tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test and had an LUS examination. We identified three clinical phenotypes based on pre-existing chronic diseases (mixed phenotype), and on the presence (severe phenotype) or absence (mild phenotype) of signs and/or symptoms of respiratory failure at presentation. We defined the LUS likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia according to four different patterns: high (HighLUS), intermediate (IntLUS), alternative (AltLUS), and low (LowLUS) probability. The combination of patterns and phenotypes with RT-PCR results was described and analyzed. RESULTS: We studied 1462 patients, classified in mild (n = 400), severe (n = 727), and mixed (n = 335) phenotypes. HighLUS and IntLUS showed an overall sensitivity of 90.2% (95% CI 88.23-91.97%) in identifying patients with positive RT-PCR, with higher values in the mixed (94.7%) and severe phenotype (97.1%), and even higher in those patients with objective respiratory failure (99.3%). The HighLUS showed a specificity of 88.8% (CI 85.55-91.65%) that was higher in the mild phenotype (94.4%; CI 90.0-97.0%). At multivariate analysis, the HighLUS was a strong independent predictor of RT-PCR positivity (odds ratio 4.2, confidence interval 2.6-6.7, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Combining LUS patterns of probability with clinical phenotypes at presentation can rapidly identify those patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia at bedside. This approach could support and expedite patients' management during a pandemic surge.","output":"Lung ultrasound for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia: an international multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Category A and B biothreat agents are deemed to be of great concern by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and include the bacteria Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia mallei, and Brucella species.

We aimed to evaluate the mid-term associations of the long-COVID symptoms and affective factors in a cohort of non-hospitalized patients. Method: A total of 166 patients were enrolled in this study, including 119 sedentary/non-athlete and 47 athlete subjects at the Post-COVID Outpatient Clinic of Semmelweis University. Clinical data regarding acute and long-term symptoms were obtained and detailed laboratory testing was carried out. Demographic data and psychological tests were collected. Results: We found a positive association between the level of depressive symptoms and anxiety and long-COVID symptom count, while life satisfaction and social support correlated negatively with the long-COVID symptom count. Higher haemoglobin levels and lower LDL-cholesterol were also shown to be moderating factors. A regression model showed that symptoms during acute infection, depression, age, and life satisfaction are predictors of the long-COVID symptom count. The presence of pre-existing affective or anxiety problems was also associated with higher reported long-COVID symptom count. Furthermore, we found significant association between pre-existing mental health problems and the investigated psychological constructs. Conclusion: It appears that long COVID-19 is associated with acute symptoms and mental factors. Depression and anxiety have been shown to have a negative effect on symptom perception, and also contribute to a higher number of symptoms in a non-hospitalized sample. Our study suggests bi-directional interconnection between clinical and psychological factors.","output":"The associations of long-COVID symptoms, clinical characteristics and affective psychological constructs in a non-hospitalized cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, it is crucial to know the drivers of vaccination intention and, thereby, vaccination. As the determinants of vaccination differ across vaccines, target groups and contexts, we investigate COVID-19 vaccination intention using data from university students from three countries, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal. We investigate the psychological drivers of vaccination intention using the 5C model as mediator. This model includes five antecedents of vaccination: Confidence, Complacency, Constraints, Calculation and Collective Responsibility. First, we show that the majority of students have a positive propensity toward getting vaccinated against COVID-19, though only 41% of students are completely acceptant. Second, using the 5C model, we show that Confidence ( = 0.33, SE = 03, p < .001) and Collective Responsibility ( = 0.35, SE = 04, p < .001) are most strongly related to students COVID-19 vaccination intention. Using mediation analyses, we show that the perceived risk and effectiveness of the vaccine as well as trust in the government and health authorities indirectly relate to vaccination intention through Confidence. The perceived risk of COVID-19 for ones social circle and altruism, the need to belong and psychopathy traits indirectly relate to vaccination intention through Collective Responsibility.

Cells do not rely exclusively on DNA-based evolution to generate new functionality but often utilize membrane encapsulation or formation of membraneless organelles to separate distinct molecular processes that execute complex operations. Applying this principle and the concept of two-dimensional phase separation, we develop film-like synthetic organelles that support protein translation on the surfaces of various cellular membranes. These sub-resolution synthetic films provide a path to make functionally distinct enzymes within the same cell. We use these film-like organelles to equip eukaryotic cells with dual orthogonal expanded genetic codes that enable the specific reprogramming of distinct translational machineries with single-residue precision. The ability to spatially tune the output of translation within tens of nanometers is not only important for synthetic biology but has implications for understanding the function of membrane-associated protein condensation in cells.","output":"Dual film-like organelles enable spatial separation of orthogonal eukaryotic translation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater-based epidemiology is a topic of significant interest over the last year due to the application of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to track incidence rates of COVID-19 in communities. Although SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been applied in more than 50 countries to date, the application of this surveillance has been largely focused on relatively affluent urban and peri-urban communities. As such, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the implementation of reliable wastewater surveillance in small and rural communities for the purpose of tracking rates of incidence of COVID-19 and other pathogens or biomarkers. This study examines the correlations between SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal from wastewater samples harvested from the access port at a lagoon (waste-stabilization pond), a wastewater pumping station and the regional COVID-19 rate of incidence (measured as percent test positivity) in a small, rural community in Ontario, Canada. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targeting the N1 and N2 genes of SARS-CoV-2 of lagoon samples demonstrate that 80% of 24-hr composite samples collected across a period of 5.5 weeks were below the limit of quantification (5 gene copies/microliter). However, 100% of the 24-hr composite samples collected on the same days from the upstream pumping station were capable of not only yielding strong viral signal but once normalized for PMMoV, also predicted the increase in viral signal approximately 10-14 days prior to an increase in community's COVID-19 reported test percent positivity. RNA concentration and integrity of samples harvested from the lagoon was both lower and more variable than from RNA harvested from the upstream pumping station that were collected on the same date, indicating a higher overall stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and hence a stronger viral signal that correlates to community incidence of COVID-19. In sewered small and rural communities operating wastewater lagoons, WBE samples should therefore be harvested from pumping stations or the sewershed as opposed to lagoons.","output":"COVID-19 monitoring in rural communities: First comparison of lagoon and pumping station samples for wastewater-based epidemiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: To evaluate the safety of Bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination in infants born to mothers receiving anti-TNF therapy for inflammatory bowel disease.

Methods: Multivariate analysis of original survey data from a representative sample of Americans. Results: Democrats, liberals, and those with a strong cooperative internationalist foreign policy orientation are more likely to trust the WHO's competence and integrity in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic while Republicans, conservatives, and nationalists are less likely. Even though trust in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has the largest impact on preventive health behaviors, trust in the competence of the WHO is also an important factor.

Western blots (WB) were performed to determine phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p70 S6 kinase (S6K1), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), as well light chain 3 (LC3) expression. RESULTS: Rapamycin inhibited the growth of KHE primary cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell cycle progression was arrested in the G0/G1 phase and apoptosis was induced. WB results showed that LC3-II/I expression was significantly elevated in KHE primary cells treated with rapamycin, while the level of p-mTOR, p-S6K1, and p-4E-BP1 expression was reduced. LC3 fluorescent spots were increased in the rapamycin treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Rapamycin inhibited KHE primary cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and autophagy, and blocked the mTOR signaling pathway.","output":"Rapamycin induces autophagy and apoptosis in Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma primary cells in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has seen government enforced restrictions on movement, with stay-at-home orders in place for a second and third time in many nations. Such restrictions have altered physical activity (PA) habits. This study aimed to evaluate longitudinal trends in PA in a self-selected UK-based sample and the key predictors of these trends. MethodsFrom 23 April 2020 to 30 January 2021, an online survey collected detailed measures of PA engagement in a sample of 1,947 UK-based adults. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) were fitted to explore trends in PA engagement over time, and how sociodemographic, health, lifestyle and contextual factors impacted participants attainment of Word Health Organisation (WHO) recommended levels of PA (constituting muscle strengthening activity (MSA), and moderate or vigorous PA (MVPA)). ResultsAttainment of WHO recommended levels of total PA showed a decline. While one in five achieved the recommended levels of total PA in the first UK lockdown in April-June 2020 (19.5%, 95%, CI 17.8-21.3%) and a similar proportion in June-July 2020 (17.7%, 95%CI 16.1-19.5%), this reduced significantly during the period of eased restrictions in August-September 2020 (15.2%, 95%CI 13.7-16.9%) and the second UK lockdown in November 2020-January 2021 (14.1%, 95%CI 12.6-15.9%). The same trends were observed for MSA and MVPA individually. Better quality of life, higher socioeconomic position and higher pre-COVID-19 PA levels were associated with meeting WHO recommended PA levels, while having overweight or obesity, a limiting chronic health condition, or being in strict isolation showed the inverse associations. Time-specific associations with MSA or MVPA were observed for gender, age, ethnicity, and other health behaviours. ConclusionAmong a self-selected sample of UK-based adults, there were reductions in PA levels throughout the first UK lockdown without reversal during the ensuing period. Based on observed associations of reduced PA with socioeconomic and health-related indices, such changes may point towards deepening health inequities during the pandemic.","output":"Longitudinal changes and key determinants of meeting WHO recommended levels of physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in a UK-based sample: Findings from the HEBECO Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has had a devastating impact on lives and livelihoods, but also unlocked a unique opportunity for change C a catalyst for a better future It has forced new ways of working to protect individual health as well as maintain continuity and productivity to protect livelihoods C the largest work from home, work apart experiment ever It is a once\\\\in\\\\a\\\\generation opportunity to transform the future of how we live and work Transforming the future will require a reinvention of how, where and when we work C a new COVID\\\\19 safe workplace model, as well as a new workplace contract between employer and employee Employers must ensure trust, flexibility and choice, as well as the highest quality digital experience, and most importantly a COVID\\\\19 safe workplace Employees must accept autonomy with responsibility, each accountable for their own performance and productivity Success will require balance, a shared vision and great leadership [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Asia Pacific Journal of Human Resources is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Workplace strategy: a new workplace model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malaysias real estate industry is undergoing its digital transformation as COVID-19 takes effect. Both forms of physical property transactions have been digitalised, which prompted many opportunities for the sector. In response, the real estate industry acts as an enterprise that provides more streamlined offerings to buyers than ever before. Much of the digital technology has offered new opportunities to realty business to target specific market segments such as millennials who have a unique characteristic compared to other generations. However, few studies have investigated this area concerning the millennials. Thus, this study examines the intention to use the digital real estate platform among millennials in Malaysia by utilising the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model as the guiding principle. Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach was employed to test the hypotheses. The effectiveness factor strongly influenced millennials intention to use the digital real estate platform because they believed that by using the technology, the real estate platform would be free of effort and enabled them to save time when making important decisions whether to purchase or rent any of the real estate product or services. Digital technology also allows millennials to search at their pace and convenience, learning a great deal about the property and related issues before they begin any actual negotiations. The findings highlight several factors that substantially affect millennial consumers intention to use the real estate platform.

Although neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in treating avian influenza, especially if given within 48 h of infection, it is harder to prevent the resultant hypercytokinaemia from developing if the patient does not seek timely medical assistance. Steroids have been used for many decades in a wide variety of inflammatory conditions in which hypercytokinaemia plays a role, such as sepsis and viral infections, including severe acquired respiratory syndromes and avian influenza. However, to date, the results have been mixed. Part of the reason for the discrepancies might be the lack of understanding that low doses are required to prevent mortality in cases of adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency, as defined in the sepsis/shock literature, is a plasma cortisol rise of at least 9 microg dl(-1) following a 250 microg dose of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), or reaching a plasma cortisol concentration of >25 microg dl(-1) following a 1-2 microg dose of ACTH. In addition, in the case of hypercytokinaemia induced by potent viruses, such as H5N1, systemic inflammation-induced, acquired glucocorticoid resistance is likely to be present. Adrenal insufficiency can be overcome, however, with prolonged (7-10 or more days) supraphysiological steroid treatment at a sufficiently high dose to address the excess activation of NF-kappaB, but low enough to avoid immune suppression. This is a much lower dose than has been typically used to treat avian influenza patients. Although steroids cannot be used as a monotherapy in the treatment of avian influenza, there might be a potential role for their use as an adjunct treatment to antiviral therapy if appropriate dosages can be determined. In this paper, likely mechanisms of adrenal insufficiency are discussed, drawing from a broad background of literature sources.","output":"A rationale for using steroids in the treatment of severe cases of H5N1 avian influenza."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic infectious disease that causes morbidity and mortality. As a result of high mortality rate among the severe COVID-19 patients, the early detection of the disease stage and early effective interventions are very important in reducing mortality. Hence, it is important to differentiate severe and non-severe cases from each other. To date, there are no proven diagnostic or prognostic parameters that can be used in this manner. Due to the expensive and not easily accessible tests that are performed for COVID-19, researchers are investigating some parameters that can be easily used. In some recent studies, hematological parameters have been evaluated to see if they can be used as predictive parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the current study, almost all hematological parameters were used, including the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio, monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to platelet ratio, plateletcrit, and D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio (DFR), neutrophil/lymphocyte/platelet scoring system, and systemic immune-inflammation index. A total of 750 patients, who were admitted to Ankara City Hospital due to COVID-19, were evaluated in this study. The patients were classified into 2 groups according to their diagnosis (confirmed or probable) and into 2 groups according to the stage of the disease (non-severe or severe). RESULTS The values of the combinations of inflammatory markers and other hematological parameters in all of the patients with severe COVID-19 were calculated, and the predicted values of these parameters were compared. According to results of the study, nearly all of the hematological parameters could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers for subsequent analysis, because the area under the curve (AUC) was higher than 0.50, especially for the DFR and NLR, which had the highest AUC among the parameters. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that, the parameters those enhanced from complete blood count, which is a simple laboratory test, can help to identify and classify COVID-19 patients into non-severe to severe groups.","output":"Which hematological markers have predictive value as early indicators of severe COVID-19 cases in the emergency department?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary discussed the psychological issues related to bereavement in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To protect and maintain the competitive advantage afforded to the Australian goat industry by the absence of many diseases endemic elsewhere, it is important to identify the vulnerability of producers to livestock disease incursions. This study developed a framework of producer vulnerability built from the beliefs and practices of producers that may impact on their likelihood of exposure and response capacity to an emergency animal disease (EAD), using foot and mouth disease as a model. A cross-sectional questionnaire gathered information on producer/enterprise demographics, animal health management and biosecurity practices, with 107 participating in the study. The biosecurity measures that were most commonly implemented by producers were always using animal movement documentation for purchased stock (74.7 %) and isolating new stock (73.1 %). However, moderate to low uptake of biosecurity protocols related to visitors to the property were reported. Response capacity variables such as checking animals daily (72.0 %) and record keeping (91.7 %) were reported by the majority of respondents, with 40.7 % reporting yearly veterinary inspection of their animals. Using the vulnerability framework, a Bayesian Network model was developed and populated by the survey data, and the relationships between variables were investigated. Six vulnerability profiles were developed, with three levels of exposure (high, moderate, low) and two levels of response capacity (high, low), as described by producer demographics and practices. The most sensitive exposure variables on producer vulnerability included implementation of visitor biosecurity and control of feral animals. Results from this study can inform risk based perspectives and decisions around biosecurity and surveillance resource allocation within the goat industry. The results also highlight opportunities for improving Australia's preparedness for a future EAD incursion by considering producer behaviour and beliefs by applying a vulnerability framework.","output":"The goat industry in Australia: Using Bayesian network analysis to understand vulnerability to a foot and mouth disease outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has quickly spread across the world and pose serious threat to public health because it can infect people very easily. The major clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection include fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue, and diarrhea. The 2019-nCoV belongs to the betacoronavirus family, and gene sequencing results demonstrate that it is a single-stranded RNA virus, closely related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). It has been observed that the virus invades human body mainly through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors similar to SARS-CoV and the main protease (Mpro) acts as a critical protease for digesting the polyprotein into functional polypeptides during the replication and transcription process of 2019-nCoV.

It has been proven that COVID-19 can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients. Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management. More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department. (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of COVID-19 to patients and doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard.

This is further complicated by inadequate test performance of many widely used serological assays. We therefore aimed to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a region with low COVID-19 burden, especially focusing on neutralizing antibodies that presumably constitute a major component of acquired immunity. Methods We invited all individuals who were enrolled in the Rhineland Study, an ongoing community-based prospective cohort study in people aged 30 years and above in the city of Bonn, Germany (N=5427). Between April 24th and June 30th, 2020, 4771 (88%) of these individuals participated in the serosurvey. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were measured using an ELISA assay, and all positive or borderline results were subsequently examined through both a recombinant immunofluorescent assay and a plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT). Findings Seroprevalence was 0.97% (95% CI: 0.72-1.30) by ELISA and 0.36% (95% CI: 0.21-0.61) by PRNT, and did not vary with either age or sex. All PRNT+ individuals reported having experienced at least one symptom (odds ratio (OR) of PRNT+ for each additional symptom: 1.12 (95% CI: 1.04-1.21)). Apart from living in a household with a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed or suspected person, a recent history of reduced taste or smell, fever, chills/hot flashes, pain while breathing, pain in arms/legs, as well as muscle pain and weakness were significantly associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies in those with mild to moderate infection (ORs 3.44 to 9.97, all p<0.018). Interpretation Our findings indicate a relatively low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Bonn, Germany (until June 30th, 2020), with neutralizing antibodies detectable in only one third of those with a positive immunoassay result, implying that almost the entire population in this region remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Seroprevalence and correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies: Results from a population-based study in Bonn, Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a topic modelling and data visualization methodology to examine gender-based disparities in news articles by topic. Existing research in topic modelling is largely focused on the text mining of closed corpora, i.e., those that include a fixed collection of composite texts. We showcase a methodology to discover topics via Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which can reliably produce human-interpretable topics over an open news corpus that continually grows with time. Our system generates topics, or distributions of keywords, for news articles on a monthly basis, to consistently detect key events and trends aligned with events in the real world. Findings from 2 years worth of news articles in mainstream English-language Canadian media indicate that certain topics feature either women or men more prominently and exhibit different types of language. Perhaps unsurprisingly, topics such as lifestyle, entertainment, and healthcare tend to be prominent in articles that quote more women than men. Topics such as sports, politics, and business are characteristic of articles that quote more men than women. The data shows a self-reinforcing gendered division of duties and representation in society. Quoting female sources more frequently in a caregiving role and quoting male sources more frequently in political and business roles enshrines womens status as caregivers and mens status as leaders and breadwinners. Our results can help journalists and policy makers better understand the unequal gender representation of those quoted in the news and facilitate news organizations efforts to achieve gender parity in their sources.

This might be explained in part by human exposure to high levels of fine particulate matter (PM) in the air of northern Italy, thus exacerbating the mortality. Since trees mitigate air pollution by intercepting PM onto plant surfaces and bolster the human immune system by emitting bioactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs), we hypothesize a protective role of evergreen forested areas in southern Italy. We compared the mortality rate due to COVID-19, the death number, the positivity rate and the forest coverage per capita in various Italian regions. Hectares of forest per capita and prevalence of deciduous versus evergreen forestal species were also estimated. In silico docking studies of potentially protective compounds found in Laurus nobilis L., a typical Mediterranean plant, were performed to search for potential antivirals. We found that the pandemic's severity was generally lower in southern regions, especially those with more than 0.3 hectares of forest per capita. The lowest mortality rates were found in southern Italy, mainly in regions like Molise (0.007%) and Basilicata (0.005%) where the forest per capita ratio is higher than 0.5 Ha/person. Our findings suggest that evergreen Mediterranean forests and shrubland plants could have protected the southern population by emission of immuno-modulating VOCs and provision of dietary sources of bioactive compounds.

All three cases of VRL occurred in patients with pre-treated primary central nervous system lymphoma and the central nervous system was not involved at the time of VRL diagnosis. They were treated with zanubrutinib, a bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, at 160 mg twice daily orally. Rapid improvement of visual acuity and tumor control was achieved in all involved eyes of these 3 patients. Complete remission was confirmed by fundus photograph and optical coherence tomography, and the level of interleukin-10, a well-recognized biomarker for vitreoretinal lymphoma, decreased to normal in all patients. Zanubrutinib was well tolerated in all three patients, and only one adverse event of grade 3 hypertension occurred, which resolved after adjusting antihypertensive drugs. As of March 2021, these three patients have been treated with zanubrutinib for 9 months, 7 months, and 6 months, respectively, and all remained in complete remission. In conclusion, targeting bruton tyrosine kinase with zanubrutinib in vitreoretinal lymphoma is feasible and our findings can be a foundation for a paradigm shift in treatment options for this rare disease. A prospective phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib in patients with vitreoretinal lymphoma is ongoing to validate our findings (ChiCTR2000037921).","output":"Targeting Bruton Tyrosine Kinase With Zanubrutinib for Treatment of Vitreoretinal Lymphoma: Report of 3 Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is threatening the world with the symptoms of seasonal influenza. This study was conducted to investigate the patient characteristics and clinical value of blood markers to assess the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: : 187 patients, diagnosed with COVID-19 (non-severe and severe cases) and admitted to hospital between January 27th and March 8th of 2020, were enrolled in the present study. Results: : A higher proportion of clinical symptoms, including cough, expectoration, myalgia and fatigue were observed in non-severe group. Significant increased level of WBC count, neutrophils, CRP, IL-6 and IL-8 were noted in severe group. The level of neutrophils, CRP, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly increased, while platelet was remarkely decreased in the severe group. The risk model based on lymphocyte, IL-6, IL-8, CRP and platelet had the highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). The baseline of IL-6, IL-8 and CRP was positively correlated with other parameters except lymphocyte, hemoglobin and platelet. While the baseline of platelet was negatively correlated with other parameters except lymphocyte and hemoglobin. Additionally, there was no connection between severity of COVID-19 and cultures of blood, sputum and catheter secretion. Conclusions: : The present study suggested that IL-6, IL-8, CRP and platelet played a critical role in deterioration of COVID-19 with potential value for monitoring the severity of COVID-19.","output":"Clinical Value of Blood Markers to Assess the Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines have been developed at warp speed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Although they are considered the best approach for preventing mortality, when assessing the safety of these vaccines, pregnant women have not been included in clinical trials. Thus, vaccine safety for this demographic, as well as for the developing fetus and neonate, remains to be determined. A global effort has been underway to encourage pregnant women to get vaccinated despite the uncertain risk posed to them and their offspring. Given this, post-hoc data collection, potentially for years, will be required to determine the outcomes of COVID-19 and vaccination on the next generation. Most COVID-19 vaccine reactions include injection site erythema, pain, swelling, fatigue, headache, fever and lymphadenopathy, which may be sufficient to affect fetal/neonatal development. In this review, we have explored components of the first-generation viral vector and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that are believed to contribute to adverse reactions and which may negatively impact fetal and neonatal development.

The agents that were investigated can be divided into symptomatic (alleviating the features of the condition) and disease modifying (attempting to address the underlying biology of PD) treatments, ST and DMT respectively, with further categorisation possible based on mechanism of action and class of therapy. OBJECTIVE: Our goal in this report was to provide an overview of the pharmacological therapies Cboth ST and DMT - in clinical trials for PD during 2020C2021, with the aim of creating greater awareness and involvement in the clinical trial process. We also hope to stimulate collaboration amongst commercial and academic researchers as well as between the research and patient communities. METHODS: We conducted a review of clinical trials of drug therapies for PD using trial data obtained from the ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organisation (WHO) registries, and performed a breakdown analysis of studies that were active as of February 18th 2021. We also assessed active drug development projects that had completed one clinical phase but were yet to start the next. RESULTS: We identified 142 trials on ClinicalTrials.gov and 14 studies on the WHO registries that met our analysis criteria. Of these 156 trials, 91 were ST and 65 were DMT, Of the 145 trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov in our 2020 analysis, 45 fell off the list and 42 were added. Despite this change, the balance of ST to DMT; the distribution across phases; the profile of therapeutic categories; and the proportion of repurposed therapies (33.5%); all remained very similar. There are only two DMTs in phase 3, and we identified 33 in-between-phase projects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, investment and effort in clinical trials for PD appears to remain strong. There has been little change in the profile of the clinical trial landscape even though, over the past year, there has been considerable change to the content of the list.","output":"Parkinsons Disease Drug Therapies in the Clinical Trial Pipeline: 2021 Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cancer patients are vulnerable population that are exposed to different risks and harms during COVID-19 pandemic Our study goal is to evaluate the behavioral response of cancer patients to the pandemic in countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated questionnaire administered via SurveyMonkey? to cancer patients in 13 centers in 6 countries in the MENA region: namely, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco The tool included 45 questions inquiring about patients demographics and behavioral practices during the crisis Results: 1,012 patients were enrolled in the study between April 21 and May 15, 2020 Median age was 50 years (14-92), 67% were females, 39% had a college degree, and 75% were married Most common reported cancer was breast cancer (40%) followed by gastrointestinal malignancies (15%) Only 3% know someone who has COVID-19 infection Patients were worried about contracting the infection strongly (33%) or mildly (48%) Reporting strict adherence to precautions included avoiding the following actions: hand shaking (83%%), hugging and kissing (91%), social gathering (98%), meeting friends (91%), and visiting markets (80%) On the other hand, they were doing the following: repeated hand washing (77%), keeping distance from others (67%), using masks in public areas (77%), hand sanitizer (69%) and soap (81%) Some of the patients reported adopting healthier diet (35%), using dietary supplement (18%), reciting Quran (61%) or supplications (75%) About 23% of them will choose not to show up for scheduled medical appointment and 43% had appointment cancellation per request from medical team (31%) or patients themselves (12%) However, treatment session cancellation occurred per request from medical team in (11%) or patients in (4%) Interestingly, 84% of participants prefer virtual appointments over regular visits Conclusions: Majority of cancer patients in the study are adopting adequate precautions to prevent exposure to infection Further studies are required to evaluate the patients emotional well-being and other harms resulted from the pandemic to prevent detrimental effect on patients outcome Editorial acknowledgement: On behalf of the International Research Network on COVID-19 Impact on Cancer Care (IRN-CICC) Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors Funding: Has not received any funding Disclosure: A R Jazieh: Research grant/Funding (self): MSD All other authors have declared no conflicts of interest","output":"Behavioral practices of cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic: A Middle East and North Africa Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Decannulation from venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) at the earliest and safest possible time may improve outcomes and reduce cost. Yet, there are no prospective studies comparing weaning strategies for liberation from ECMO. RESEARCH QUESTION Is a protocolized daily assessment of readiness to liberate from VV-ECMO safe and feasible? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective, single-arm, safety and feasibility study of a protocol for daily assessment of readiness to liberate from VV-ECMO among consecutive adult patients receiving VV-ECMO across four intensive care units at a single center between June 20, 2020 and November 24, 2020. The ECMO-free protocol included three-phases: 1) the safety screen, 2) non-ECMO fraction of inspired oxygen titration, and 3) the ECMO-free trial. Enrollment, interventions, and data collection were performed prospectively by trained study staff. RESULTS Twenty-six patients received the ECMO-free protocol on 385 patient-days. The safety screen was passed during a total of 59 ECMO-free daily assessments (15.3%) among 20 patients. Every passed safety screen proceeded to an ECMO-free trial. There were 28 (47.5%) passed ECMO-free trials among 16 patients (61.5%). There were no missed safety screens, protocol deviations, or adverse events. Of the 16 patients who passed an ECMO-free trial, 14 (87.5%) were decannulated. Among decannulated patients, 12 (85.7%) were decannulated on the same day as a passed ECMO-free trial, 6 (42.9%) were decannulated on the first day that they passed an ECMO-free trial, and 6 (42.9%) passed an ECMO-free trial at least twice consecutively before decannulation. The median time from first passed ECMO-free trial to decannulation was 2 days (IQR, 0 to 3 days). INTERPRETATIONS The ECMO-free protocol is feasible and may identify patients for decannulation earlier than gradual approaches to weaning.","output":"Safety and Feasibility of a Protocolized Daily Assessment of Readiness for Liberation from Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To verify the hypothesis that in most patients bowel segmental resection to treat endometriosis can be safely performed without creation of a stoma and to discuss the limitations of this statement.

METHOD OF STUDY This observational cohort study included 1418 pregnancies of 1014 patients with a history of 2 or more pregnancy losses, who were euthyroid or had hypothyroidism, and had at least one subsequent pregnancy outcome. Some patients with SCH, as defined as a TSH >2.5mIU/L, were treated with levothyroxine and these comprised the levothyroxine group. The prevalence of SCH, subsequent live birth rates per patient and per pregnancy were compared among patients with SCH treated with and without levothyroxine and patients with euthyroid. RESULTS The prevalence of SCH was 14.4 %. Subsequent live birth rates were 75.0 % for the levothyroxine group, 68.6 % for the untreated SCH group and 70.1 % for the euthyroid group. After excluding miscarriages with abnormal karyotypes, live birth rates were 89.2 %, 90.0 % and 91.1 %. The adjusted odds ratio (95%CI) was 0.95 (0.23-3.83) after controlling covariables when comparing SCH patients with and without treatment.

The proposed model finds the minimum required reduction in transmission rates to maintain the burden on the healthcare system below the maximum capacity. RESULTS: We find that such a policy renders a sharp increase in the control strength during the early stages of the epidemic, followed by a steady increase in the subsequent ten weeks as the epidemic approaches its peak, and finally the control strength is gradually decreased as the population moves towards herd immunity. We have also shown how such a model can provide an efficient adaptive intervention policy at different stages of the epidemic without having access to the entire history of its progression in the population.

Digital health interventions (DHIs) raise distinct challenges for economic evaluations compared with drugs and medical devices, not least due to their interacting, evolving features. The implications of the distinctive nature of DHIs for the methodological choices underpinning their economic evaluation is not well understood. This paper provides an in-depth discussion of distinct features of DHIs and how they might impact the design, measurement, analysis and reporting of cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside both randomised and non-randomised studies. These include aspects related to choice of comparator, costs and benefits assessment, study perspective and type of economic analysis. We argue that typical methodological standpoints, such as taking a health service perspective, focusing on health-related benefits and adopting cost-utility analyses, as typically adopted in the economic evaluation of non-digital technologies (pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices), are unlikely to be appropriate for DHIs. We illustrate how these methodological aspects can be appropriately addressed in an evaluation of a digitally supported, remote rehabilitation programme for patients with Long Covid in England.

Two primers that amplify a 383-base pair product between nucleotide positions 703 and 1086 relative to the start codon for the S1 gene of the Massachusetts 41 virus were designed and used to amplify the Beaudette, Massachusetts 41, Florida 18288, Connecticut, Iowa 97, Arkansas DPI, CA/NE95/99, DE/072/ 92, and GA/0470/98 strains of IBV. The primers were specific and did not amplify New Castle disease virus, Mycoplasma spp., or infectious laryngotracheitis virus. For RRT-PCR by FRET, an anchor probe conjugated to fluorescein and a detection probe conjugated to a red fluorophore were designed to anneal to a hypervariable region within the 383-base pair product. The level of sensitivity was 1 x 10(4) RNA molecules used as starting template. After amplification, a melting curve analysis was conducted to specifically identify IBV types. Because of sequence differences in the annealing position of the detection probe, the Arkansas, Connecticut, Beaudette, and Massachusetts 41 strains could be differentiated. No fluorescence was observed for the DE/072/ 92 and GA/0470/98 viruses with the anchor and detection probes. When the Beaudette strain was examined, two melting peaks were observed at 44 C and 51 C, indicating a quasispecies in that laboratory strain of IBV. Routine typing of vaccine strains of IBV was possible with this technology, but high standard deviations associated with the melting curve analysis of the FRET probes described herein made it difficult to use this test reliably for routine typing of IBV field isolates.","output":"Detection of infectious bronchitis virus by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and identification of a quasispecies in the Beaudette strain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This communication discusses the current challenges of oral mucositis (OM) management during the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak and reflects about an extraoral photobiomodulation protocol as an optimal alternative for preventing and treating OM in advanced cancer patients while minimizing the risk of infection by avoiding intraoral manipulation.","output":"Impact of pandemic COVID-19 outbreak on oral mucositis preventive and treatment protocols: new perspectives for extraoral photobiomodulation therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, universities adopted online teaching as the primary teaching and learning method. Most of the online teaching, however, has been limited to the broadcasting of asynchronous lectures and sharing of teaching materials. OBJECTIVES: To explore undergraduate nursing students' self-regulated learning experiences, satisfaction, and attitudes toward older persons in a gerontological nursing course using online self-regulated enquiry-based learning (EBL) during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A mixed-methods design was adopted. SETTING: A university in Hong Kong providing pre-registration nursing programmes. PARTICIPANTS: 155 students studying in the fourth year in a five-year Bachelor of Nursing programme participated in the quantitative study in which 18 joined the focus groups (4 groups with group size of 4C5). METHODS: Five video-based scenarios along with two interactive online workshops, a mind-map development exercise, gamified assessments, reading materials, group discussions, and presentations were adopted in a gerontological nursing course offered in 2019C2020 to enhance the students' learning, driven by a process of enquiry. Attitudes toward older people were measured at baseline and one week after the course (post-test). Information on self-regulated learning experiences, satisfaction, and confidence were collected at post-test only. Paired t-tests and descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. Focus groups were conducted through semi-structured interviews and transcribed verbatim for inductive content analysis. RESULTS: A significant improvement was demonstrated in the students' attitude toward older people. The students appreciated the opportunities provided by the online EBL to apply key concepts of gerontology in the teaching and learning activities and to enhance their critical thinking skills. Three major themes were revealed from the focus group: Perception of the teaching pedagogy, Improvement of cognitive skills, and Positive and negative aspects of the learning experience. CONCLUSIONS: The online self-regulated EBL improved the students' online learning experience in a gerontological nursing course during the pandemic and improved their attitudes toward older people.","output":"Exploring nursing students' learning experiences and attitudes toward older persons in a gerontological nursing course using self-regulated online enquiry-based learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory disease that has been spreading across the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a public health emergency. The treatment of COVID-19 has been hampered due to the lack of effective therapeutic efforts. Main Protease (M(pro)) is a key enzyme in the viral replication cycle and its non-specificity to human protease makes it a potential drug target. Cyperus rotundus Linn, which belongs to the Cyperaceae family, is a traditional herbal medicine that has been widely studied for its antiviral properties. In this study, a computational approach was used to screen natural compounds from C. rotundus Linn using BIOVIA Discovery Suite and novel potential molecules against M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted. Molecular docking was performed using LibDock protocol and selected ligands were further subjected to docking analysis by CDOCKER. The docking scores of the selected ligands were compared with standard antiretroviral drugs such as lopinavir and ritonavir to assess their binding potentials. Interaction pharmacophore analysis was then performed for the compounds exhibiting good binding scores to evaluate their proteinCligand interactions. The selected proteinCligand complexes were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation for 50 ns. Results of binding free energy analysis revealed that two compounds-amyrin and stigmasta-5,22-dien-3-olexhibited the best binding interactions and stability. Finally, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) studies were performed to understand the pharmacokinetic properties and safety profile of the compounds.

The challenges of these practices include maintaining sensitivity of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), achieving upper-pole fullness, and preserving an adequate blood supply for patients with massive breast ptosis. OBJECTIVES The authors describe their experience with power-assisted liposuction mammaplasty (PALM), a novel technique for breast reduction. METHODS One hundred fifty consecutive women (300 breasts) who underwent PALM were evaluated in a prospective study. Minimizing skin undermining and glandular resection ensured maximal blood supply to the breast. A lateral pedicle was created to preserve NAC sensitivity. The transposed gland was contained within a large pocket made in the upper-inner quadrant. Glandular suspension sutures from the dermis to the chest wall stabilized the breast and recreated the inframammary fold. RESULTS The mean distance from the nipple to the sternal notch was 36 cm, the mean NAC elevation was 16 cm, the mean lipoaspirate volume per breast was 650 cc, and the mean glandular resection mass per breast was 240 g. Complications included wound infection (6 of 300 breasts, 2%), wound dehiscence (3 breasts, 1%), and seroma (9 breasts, 3%). Partial areolar necrosis occurred in 2 of 150 patients (1.3%), and 9 patients (6%) underwent revisional surgery.

Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low. This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract. However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection. Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.","output":"Role of the Eye in Transmitting Human Coronavirus: What We Know and What We Do Not Know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background As of mid-2021, Australias only nationwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic occurred in the first 6 months of the pandemic. Subsequently, there has been limited transmission in most states and territories. Understanding community spread during the first wave was hampered by initial limitations on testing and surveillance. To characterize the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody seroprevalence generated during this time, we undertook Australias largest national SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey. Methods Between June 19 and August 6, 2020, residual specimens were sampled from people undergoing general pathology testing (all ages), women attending antenatal screening (20C39 years), and blood donors (20C69 years) based on the Australian populations age and geographic distributions. Specimens were tested by Wantai total SARS-CoV-2-antibody assay. Seroprevalence estimates adjusted for test performance were produced. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive specimens were characterized with microneutralization assays. Results Of 11 317 specimens (5132 general pathology;2972 antenatal;3213 blood-donors), 71 were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Seroprevalence estimates were 0.47% (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.04%C0.89%), 0.25% (CrI, 0.03%C0.54%), and 0.23% (CrI, 0.04%C0.54%), respectively. No seropositive specimens had neutralizing antibodies. Conclusions Australias seroprevalence was extremely low (<0.5%) after the only national COVID-19 wave thus far. These data and the subsequent limited community transmission highlight the populations naivety to SARS-CoV-2 and the urgency of increasing vaccine-derived protection. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was very low (<0.5%) in Australia following the first epidemic wave in March-April 2020, demonstrating the success of control measures implemented at the time. Results also emphasize the crucial role of vaccination, as the vast majority of the Australian population had no infection-derived protection against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Seroprevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-Specific Antibodies in Australia After the First Epidemic Wave in 2020: A National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Highly infectious diseases can spread rapidly across borders through travel or trade, and international coordination is essential to a prompt and efficient response by public health laboratories.

In particular, RNA viruses deserve special concern given their documented impact on conservation biology, veterinary medicine and public health, with an unprecedented ability to promote an evolutionary hostCpathogen arms race from the ultimate infection and immunity perspective. However, besides the requisite molecular/gross anatomical and physiological bases for infectious diseases to transmit from one host to another, both viral pathogens and their reservoirs/vectors exploit a complex anthropological, cultural, historical, psychological and social suite that specifically defines the phylodynamics within Homo sapiens, unlike any other species. Some of these variables include the ecological benefits of living in groups, decisions on hunting and foraging behaviours and dietary preferences, myths and religious doctrines, health economics, travel destinations, population planning, political decisions on agricultural product bans and many others, in a homo-sociome memetic complex. Taken to an extreme, such complexities elucidate the underpinnings of explanations as to why certain viral zoonoses reside in neglected people, places and things, whereas others are chosen selectively and prioritized for active mitigation. Canine-transmitted rabies serves as one prime example of how a neglected viral zoonosis may transition to greater attention on the basis of renewed advocacy, social media, local champions and vested international community engagement. In contrast, certain bat-associated and arboviral diseases suffer from basic ignorance and perpetuated misunderstanding of fundamental reservoir and vector ecology tenets, translated into failed control policies that only exacerbate the underlying environmental conditions of concern.

Design: Modelling study. Setting: England and India. Participants: 1,375,548 respondents aged 18 to 99 to the District Level Household Survey-4 and Annual Health Survey in India. Additional information on health condition prevalence on individuals aged 18 to 99 was obtained from the Health Survey for England and the Global Burden of Diseases, Risk Factors, and Injuries Studies (GBD). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportional increase in age-specific mortality in each country due to the prevalence of each COVID-19 mortality risk factor (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic heart disease, respiratory illness, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer, among others). The combined change in overall mortality and the share of deaths under 60 from the combination of risk factors was estimated in each country. Results: Relative to England, Indians have higher rates of diabetes (10.6% vs. 8.5%), chronic respiratory disease (4.8% vs. 2.5%), and kidney disease (9.7% vs. 5.6%), and lower rates of obesity (4.4% vs. 27.9%), chronic heart disease (4.4% vs. 5.9%), and cancer (0.3% vs. 2.8%).

Design/methodology/approach: The sample for this research included Chinese hotel guests before and after COVID-19, with 247 responses obtained before its outbreak and a further 601 responses gathered after. Several hypotheses were developed and tested in a pseudo-experimental design. Findings: The results showed that COVID-19 increased hotel guest acceptance of robots. After COVID-19, the perceived importance of the usefulness, social influence, attitude and value of robots increased, while the perceived importance of the ease of use and anthropomorphism of robots decreased.

To ensure that body donors are ethically acquired and suitable for anatomy education, Anatomical Donation Programs (ADPs) are tasked with the responsibility of acquiring body donors for basic and clinical science curricula. Considering the personal and institutional impact of SARS-CoV-2, a national survey was conducted to examine the current effect of the pandemic on ADP protocols, body donation, and the sustainability of ADPs in the United States (U.S.). Eighty-nine U.S. ADPs were identified and contacted for optional participation in a survey to assess the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on their programs. Survey data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools. Thirty-six ADPs (40.5% response rate) from the nine U.S. Divisions are represented in the survey results. Data were collected on ADP descriptions and demographics, SARS-CoV-2 impact on ADPs and protocols, and body donation and ADP sustainability. Almost all ADPs reported that the pandemic has affected their ADP operations in some way; however, the sustainability for the majority of ADPs appears likely and donor availability remains stable due to a proportional decrease in body donations and body donor requests. As the long-term impact on ADPs has yet to be determined, the authors plan to reevaluate the lasting impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on body donation, ADP sustainability, and anatomical science education throughout the year 2021.","output":"The state of anatomical donation programs amidst the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent evidence suggests differential patterns of social behavior following an inflammatory challenge, such that increases in inflammation may not uniformly lead to social withdrawal. Indeed, increases in inflammation have been associated with enhanced self-reported motivation to approach a specific close other, and greater neural sensitivity to positive social cues. However, no known studies have examined the association between inflammation in response to an inflammatory challenge and social behavior in humans, nor has past research examined specifically how approach and withdrawal behavior may differ based on whether the target is a close other or stranger. To address this, 31 participants (ages 18-24) received the influenza vaccine to elicit a low-grade inflammatory response. The morning before and approximately 24 h after the vaccine, participants provided a blood sample and completed a computer task assessing automatic (implicit) approach and withdrawal behavior toward a social support figure and strangers. Greater increases in the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to the vaccine were associated with an increase in accuracy in avoiding strangers and a decrease in accuracy in approaching them. Increases in IL-6 were also associated with a decrease in reaction time to approach a support figure, but only when controlling for baseline IL-6 levels. There were no associations between change in IL-6 and changes in self-reported motivation to engage in social behavior with either close others, or strangers. Together, these findings reveal that increases in inflammation following the influenza vaccine are associated with automatic social behavior, especially behavior suggesting avoidance of unfamiliar social targets and ease in approaching a support figure. These data add to the growing literature suggesting that the association between inflammation and social behavior includes both social withdrawal and social approach, depending on the specific target.","output":"Inflammatory reactivity to the influenza vaccine is associated with changes in automatic social behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract I examine investors' within ESG investment preferences during the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating the return spillover effects across the three different corporate bonds and equities-based investment strategies Investors prefer making investments in ESG leaders in the investment-grade corporate bond market over ESG leaders in the equity and high yield corporate bond markets during times of uncertainty It suggests that capital flows away from high yield corporate bond and equity markets to the investment-grade corporate bond market Investors find refuge in firms with relatively higher ESG ratings and creditworthiness in the fixed income market over the equity market during crisis periods","output":"COVID-19 and ESG preferences: Corporate bonds versus equities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A search engines ability to retrieve desirable datasets is important for data sharing and reuse.

As an example, this allows us to identify, based on high similarity to only eukaryote proteins, poxvirus proteins that may have been obtained by horizontal transfer from their hosts. Although this method alone does not definitively prove horizontal gene transfer, it allows us to provide an assessment of the possibility of horizontal gene transfer for every poxvirus protein. Potential candidates can then be individually studied in more detail during subsequent investigation. Results of our analysis demonstrate that in general, proteins encoded by members of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae exhibit greater similarity to eukaryote proteins than to proteins of other virus families. In addition, our results reiterate the important role played by host gene capture in poxvirus evolution; highlight the functions of many genes poxviruses share with their hosts; and illustrate which host-like genes are present uniquely in poxviruses and which are also present in other virus families.","output":"Poxvirus protein evolution: Family-wide assessment of possible horizontal gene transfer events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) effectively detects the SARS-COV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 Nevertheless, some critical gaps remain in the identification and monitoring of asymptomatic people. METHODS: This retrospective study included 733 asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 subjects, who were submitted to the RT-qPCR test. The objective was to assess the efficacy of an expanded triage of subjects undergoing the RT-qPCR test for SARS-COV-2 to identify the largest possible number of COVID-19 cases in a hospital setting in Ecuador. SARS-CoV-2 Firstly, the sensitivity and specificity as well as the predictive values of an expanded triage method were calculated. In addition, the Kappa coefficient was also determined to assess the concordance between laboratory test results and the expanded triage. RESULTS: Of a total of 733 sputum samples; 229 were RT-qPCR-positive (31.2%) and mortality rate reached 1.2%. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 86.0% (95% confidence interval: 81.0-90.0%) and 37.0% (95% confidence interval: 32.0-41.0%) respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 52.0% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.73. An association between the positivity of the test and its performance before 10 days was found. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical sensitivity for COVID-19 detection was within acceptable standards, but the specificity still fell below the values of reference. The lack of symptoms did not always mean to have a negative SARS-COV-2 RT-qPCR test. The expanded triage identified a still unnoticed percentage of asymptomatic subjects showing positive results for the SARS-COV-2 RT-qPCR test. The study also revealed a significant relationship between the number of RT-qPCR-positive cases and the performance of the molecular diagnosis within the first 10 days of COVID-19 in the symptomatic group.","output":"Comparison between RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 and expanded triage in sputum of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects in Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), emerging in Wuhan, China and developing into a pandemic with rapidly emerging cardiovascular manifestations [...].","output":"Endotheliitis and Endothelial Dysfunction in Patients with COVID-19: Its Role in Thrombosis and Adverse Outcomes ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic situation has led to an extraordinary increase in remote working activities all over the world.

RESULTS: Six preterm infants were admitted to Tongji Hospital between January 23 and March 19, 2020. Gestational age ranged from 28+5 to 36+3 weeks. One late preterm infant was delivered early due to maternal dyspnea from COVID-19. Five infants were delivered by Caesarean section. None had perinatal asphyxia. Two infants required respiratory support due to respiratory distress syndrome and apnea of prematurity. All infants did not develop severe complications of prematurity and are negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSION: With an expedited and adequate delivery protocol, less invasive treatment principle, and active infection precautious, we found a limited impact of COVID-19 mothers on preterm delivery and neonatal short-term outcomes.

We trained age-stratified generalized linear models (GLMs) with component-wise gradient boosting to predict the probability of death based on what we know from the patients before they contracted the virus. Despite only relying on previously documented demographics and comorbidities, our models demonstrated similar performance to other prognostic models that require an assortment of symptoms, laboratory values, and images at the time of diagnosis or during the course of the illness. In general, we found age as the most important predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients. A history of pneumonia, which is rarely asked in typical epidemiology studies, was one of the most important risk factors for predicting COVID-19 mortality. A history of diabetes with complications and cancer (breast and prostate) were notable risk factors for patients between the ages of 45 and 65 years. In patients aged 65C85 years, diseases that affect the pulmonary system, including interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and a smoking history, were important for predicting mortality.

Objective: To determine if cell phone location data are associated with the rate of change in new COVID-19 cases by county across the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study incorporated publicly available county-level daily COVID-19 case data from January 22, 2020, to May 11, 2020, and county-level daily cell phone location data made publicly available by Google. It examined the daily cases of COVID-19 per capita and daily estimates of cell phone activity compared with the baseline (where baseline was defined as the median value for that day of the week from a 5-week period between January 3 and February 6, 2020). All days and counties with available data after the initiation of stay-at-home orders for each state were included. Exposures: The primary exposure was cell phone activity compared with baseline for each day and each county in different categories of place. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the percentage change in COVID-19 cases 5 days from the exposure date. Results: Between 949 and 2740 US counties and between 22a?124 and 83a?745 daily observations were studied depending on the availability of cell phone data for that county and day. Marked changes in cell phone activity occurred around the time stay-at-home orders were issued by various states. Counties with higher per-capita cases (per 100a?000 population) showed greater reductions in cell phone activity at the workplace (?, -0.002; 95% CI, -0.003 to -0.001; P < 0.001), areas classified as retail (?, -0.008; 95% CI, -0.011 to -0.005; P < 0.001) and grocery stores (?, -0.006; 95% CI, -0.007 to -0.004; P < 0.001), and transit stations (?, -0.003, 95% CI, -0.005 to -0.002; P < 0.001), and greater increase in activity at the place of residence (?, 0.002; 95% CI, 0.001-0.002; P < 0.001). Adjusting for county-level and state-level characteristics, counties with the greatest decline in workplace activity, transit stations, and retail activity and the greatest increases in time spent at residential places had lower percentage growth in cases at 5, 10, and 15 days. For example, counties in the lowest quartile of retail activity had a 45.5% lower growth in cases at 15 days compared with the highest quartile (SD, 37.4%-53.5%; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings support the hypothesis that greater reductions in cell phone activity in the workplace and retail locations, and greater increases in activity at the residence, are associated with lesser growth in COVID-19 cases.

We adopted the Berger HIV Stigma Scale to measure stigma; the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Form to measure quality of life; and the Mental Health Inventory-38 to measure mental health. The chi-square and binary logistic regression tests were used to find the correlation between the variables. RESULTS: The multivariate analysis revealed that medium stigma was more likely related to quality of life and mental health than low stigma. Females were less likely to experience stigma related to mental health than men, and respondents who worked as laborers and entrepreneurs were less likely to experience stigma related to mental health than those who worked as civil workers/army personnel/teachers/lecturers. COVID-19 survivors experienced medium stigma in society and lower quality of life and mental health status.

Currently, the role of cellular TRIM22 in PRRSV infection remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of TRIM22 on PRRSV replication in vitro and explored the underlying mechanism. Ectopic expression of TRIM22 impaired the viral replication, while TRIM22-RNAi favored the replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells. Additionally, we observed that TRIM22 deletion SPRY domain or Nuclear localization signal (NLS) losses the ability to inhibit PRRSV replication. Finally, Co-IP analysis identified that TRIM22 interacts with PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein through the SPRY domain, while the NLS2 motif of N protein is involved in interaction with TRIM22. Although the concentration of PRRSV N protein was not altered in the presence of TRIM22, the abundance of N proteins from simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) diminished considerably with increasing TRIM22 expression. Together, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for TRIM22 and extend the antiviral effects of TRIM22 to arteriviruses.","output":"Nuclear localization signal in TRIM22 is essential for inhibition of type 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus replication in MARC-145 cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant inherent extra-articular varus angulation is associated with abnormal postoperative hipCkneeCankle (HKA) angle. At present, HKA is manually measured by orthopedic surgeons and it increases the doctors workload. To automatically determine HKA, a deep learning-based automated method for measuring HKA on the unilateral lower limb X-rays was developed and validated. This study retrospectively selected 398 double lower limbs X-rays during 2018 and 2020 from Jilin University Second Hospital. The images (n = 398) were cropped into unilateral lower limb images (n = 796). The deep neural network was used to segment the head of hip, the knee, and the ankle in the same image, respectively. Then, the mean square error of distance between each internal point of each organ and the organs boundary was calculated. The point with the minimum mean square error was set as the central point of the organ. HKA was determined using the coordinates of three organs central points according to the law of cosines. In a quantitative analysis, HKA was measured manually by three orthopedic surgeons with a high consistency (176.90   12.18, 176.95   12.23, 176.87   12.25) as evidenced by the Kandalls W of 0.999 (p < 0.001). Of note, the average measured HKA by them (176.90   12.22) served as the ground truth. The automatically measured HKA by the proposed method (176.41   12.08) was close to the ground truth, showing no significant difference. In addition, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between them is 0.999 (p < 0.001). The average of difference between prediction and ground truth is 0.49.

In the era of diabesity and due to its central role for metabolic and endocrine processes, adipose tissue (specifically white adipose tissue; WAT) has become a target of high interest for therapeutic strategies. To gain insights in cellular and molecular mechanisms of adipose (patho-)physiology, researchers traditionally relied on animal models since in vitro studies on human WAT are challenging due to the large size, buoyancy, and fragility of mature white adipocytes. Leveraging the Organ-on-Chip technology, we introduce a next-generation microphysiological in vitro model of human WAT based on a tailored microfluidic platform featuring vasculature-like perfusion. The platform integrates a 3D tissue comprising all major WAT-associated cellular components in an autologous manner, including not only mature adipocytes but also organotypic endothelial barriers and stromovascular cells featuring tissue-resident innate immune cells, specifically adipose tissue macrophages. This microphysiological tissue model recapitulates pivotal WAT functions, such as energy storage and mobilization as well as endocrine and immunomodulatory activities. The combination of all individual cell types with extra cellular matrix-like hydrogels in a precisely controllable bottom-up approach enables the generation of a multitude of replicates from the same donors circumventing issues of inter-donor variability and paving the way for personalized medicine. Moreover, it allows to adjust the models degree of complexity to fit a specific purpose via a flexible mix- and-match approach with different cell component modules. This novel WAT-on-chip system constitutes a human-based, autologous and immunocompetent in vitro model of adipose tissue that recapitulates almost full tissue heterogeneity. In the future, the new WAT-on-chip model can become a powerful tool for human-relevant research in the field of metabolism and its associated diseases as well as for compound testing and personalized- and precision medicine applications.","output":"Autologous human immunocompetent white adipose tissue-on-chip"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interactions of the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib with solute carriers (SLCs) remain incompletely characterized. The present study was therefore designed to investigate this issue. The interactions of ruxolitinib with SLCs were analyzed using transporter-overexpressing HEK293 cells. Substrate accumulation was detected by spectrofluorimetry, LC-MS/MS spectrometry or scintillation counting. Ruxolitinib was found to potently inhibit the activities of OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K (IC50 < 10 M). It blocked OAT1, OAT4, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1 and OCT3, but in a weaker manner (IC50 > 10 M), whereas OCT1 was not impacted. No time-dependent inhibition was highlighted. When applying the US FDA criteria for transporters-related drug-drug interaction risk, OCT2 and MATE2-K, unlike MATE1 andOAT3, were predicted to be in vivo inhibited by ruxolitinib. Cellular uptake studies additionally indicated that ruxolitinib is a substrate for MATE1 and MATE2-K, but not for OAT3 and OCT2. Ruxolitinib in vitro blocked activities of most of SLC transporters. Only OCT2 and MATE-2K may be however clinically inhibited by the JAK inhibitor, with the caution for OCT2 that in vitro inhibition data were generated with a FDA-non recommended fluorescent substrate.

Little is known about laboratory prognostic markers in COVID-19 patients. The aim of our study was to describe the basic clotting parameters in COVID-19 patients and their prognostic role in different clinical forms of the disease. Material and Methods: We enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department. A cohort of 67 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory illness was used as a control group. For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined. The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS. The clotting factors values were compared between the groups. Results: At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480C747) vs. 455 (352.5C588.5) mg/dL; p = 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels >400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%; p = 0.0054) compared to the control group.

We have conducted this study to identify the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in cancer patients with COVID-19 and have explored the relationship of various clinical factors to mortality in our patient cohort. Methods: All active cancer cases presented to the hospital from 8th June to 24 August 2020, and developed symptoms/ radiological features suspicious of COVID-19 were tested by Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and/or cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test from a combination of naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2.

Results: Of the total 3101 cancer patients admitted to the hospital, 1088 patients were tested and 186 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The CFR in the cohort was 27/186 (14.5%). Univariate analysis showed that the risk of death was significantly associated with the presence of comorbidities [OR: 2.68; (95%CI: 1.13-6.32); P=0.02], multiple comorbidities [OR: 3.01; (95%CI: 1.02-9.07); P=0.046 for multiple vs. single], and the severity of COVID-19 presentation [OR: 27.48; (95%CI: 5.34-141.49); P=0.0001 for severe vs. not severe].

Previous research has considered the impact of international travel restrictions on COVID-19 dynamics, but in response to the pandemic, policies that restrict travel within countries have also been implemented, and the impact of these restrictions is less well studied. On May 4th, 2020, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) implemented travel restrictions such that non-residents were required to have exemptions to enter the province. METHODS: We fit a stochastic epidemic model to data describing the number of active COVID-19 cases in NL from March 14th - May 4th. We then predicted possible outbreaks over the 9 weeks subsequent to May 4th, with and without the travel restrictions, and for physical distancing scenarios ranging from a 40% to 70% reduction in the daily contact rate relative to pre-pandemic levels. RESULTS: We find that the mean number of clinical COVID-19 cases would have been 12.4 times higher without the travel restrictions. Furthermore, without the travel restrictions there is a substantial risk of very large outbreaks. INTERPRETATION: Using epidemic modelling, we show how the NL COVID-19 outbreak could have unfolded had the travel restrictions not been implemented. Both physical distancing and travel restrictions affect the local dynamics of the epidemic. Our modelling shows that the travel restrictions are a plausible reason why there were so few reported COVID-19 cases in NL in the 9 weeks after May 4th.","output":"Modelling the impact of travel restrictions on COVID-19 cases in Newfoundland and Labrador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency medicine residency programs around the country develop didactic conferences to prepare residents for board exams and independent practice.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were obtained from patients in whom symptoms and orthostatic testing were consistent with a POTS diagnosis. Individuals with <4 months symptom duration, evident ongoing inflammatory disease, suspected volume depletion, or declined consent were excluded. All patients had typical POTS symptoms; some, however, had additional nonorthostatic complaints not usually associated with POTS. The latter patients underwent additional testing for known MCA biochemical mediators including prostaglandins, histamine, methylhistamine, and plasma tryptase. The study comprised 69 patients who met POTS diagnostic criteria. In 44 patients (44/69, 64%) additional nonorthostatic symptoms included migraine, allergic complaints, skin rash, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Of these 44 patients, 29 (66%) exhibited at least 1 laboratory abnormality suggesting MCA disorder, and 11/29 patients had 2 or more such abnormalities. Elevated prostaglandins (n=16) or plasma histamine markers (n=23) were the most frequent findings.

The questionnaire comprised three sections: demographic and professional data, the impact noticed by the physicians and the strategies they adopted to tackle this impact. RESULTS: We analysed 225 responses. Specialists represented 71.6% of the respondents. The majority (94.2%) of the private practices were located in urban areas. Almost all respondents have noticed a change in the demand for medical services, mainly a decrease (96.4%). There was an increase in urgent consultations (30.7%) and consultations for acute motives (39.1%). Respondents also reported less (69.3%) or no (23.1%) regular follow-up visits for patients with chronic diseases. Decreased incomes concerned 97.3% of the practices. Practitioners reacted by working less hours (87.6%), delaying some procedures (78.2%) and applying recommended safety measures (100%). Telemedicine was used in an informal way to facilitate the communication with patients. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: During this pandemic, private practices were challenged to contribute to the continuity of healthcare services while ensuring the safety of the staff and the patients. Several strategies were adopted to cope with the new situation and to survive its many challenges.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activity of private medical practices in Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many drugs are being administered to tackle coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situations without establishing clinical effectiveness or tailoring safety.

We hypothesized that 2 weeks treatment with triheptanoin could improve oxidative metabolism during exercise by bypassing the blocked pyruvate generation in PFKD. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Three genetically verified patients completed two treatment periods of 14 days each with triheptanoin (0.3-1a?ga?a?kg-1a?a?day-1) or placebo liquid. Primary outcomes were heart rate, fatty acid and total oxidation measured via stable isotope and indirect calorimetry methodology during submaximal exercise. Triheptanoin did not improve the primary outcome heart rate during submaximal exercise compared to placebo. Palmitate oxidation was increased during submaximal exercise in one patient but did not increase in the two other patients during triheptanoin treatment. Palmitate production and palmitate utilization increased during exercise and increased to a greater extent with triheptanoin treatment in all three patients.

Using flow cytometry, migration assays, flow chambers and RNA microarrays, we investigated the effects of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and P(2)Y(12) receptor blockers on blood monocytes, THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 monocytes after differentiation to macrophages. P(2)Y(12) -expressing platelets can form aggregates with monocytes in circulating blood. Mediated by platelets, ADP results in activation of the integrin receptor Mac-1 on blood monocytes, as detected by the conformation-specific single-chain antibody MAN-1. Via the same association with platelets, THP-1 monocyte adhesion to the endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) is induced by ADP. P(2)Y(12) receptor blockers prevent these ADP effects on monocytes. Interestingly, in contrast to THP-1 monocytes, THP-1 monocytes, after differentiation to macrophages, directly expressed the P(2)Y(12) receptor and consequently ADP was found to be a potent chemoattractant. Again, P(2)Y(12) receptor blockers antagonised this effect. Accordingly, stimulation of THP-1 macrophages with ADP caused a substantial change in gene expression pattern and upregulation of several genes associated with inflammation and atherogenesis.

Faced with COVID-19, we took the opportunity to digitalise CGA documentation to preserve these benefits for patients whilst facing greater acuity, staffing and time pressures. An electronic solution was adopted to reduce paper-usage in COVID-receiving areas. Prior to COVID-19, CGA was recorded within case-notes, presenting challenges when patients were readmitted out-of-hours as these were stored off-site and not accessible out-of-hours. METHOD: Trakcare is the patient-management system in many Scottish hospitals. The Electronic Patient Record (EPR) was used to record pro-forma against admissions which were accessible and updatable for any patient 24C7-365. Patients meeting the Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) Frailty criteria were considered frailty-positive, with an e-alert added- reappearing on any re-admission. Providing no HIS-exclusion criteria, an electronic-CGA (e-CGA) was recorded or updated. The pro-forma designed contained information not immediately available to clerking practitioners. This evolved following discussion amongst the FIT to include information such as escalation-status, medication-arrangements and baseline cognition. RESULTS: Over 13 weeks, 116 EPRs were reviewed. During weeks 1C3 (n = 8, 12, 7 respectively), e-CGA completion averaged 31%. Following FIT collaboration, this rose to 82% (n = 9) by week 12. Qualitative feedback from the MDT indicated that FIT, downstream wards and night-staff felt that having access to previous escalation-plans made immediate-management easier to determine, and discussions with families more productive for patients. CONCLUSIONS: Development of the FVRH e-CGA is ongoing, with an electronic frailty-screening tool being implemented to improve frailty-identification on admission to ensure correct streaming of patients to the FIT. We have demonstrated a cost-neutral method for improving access to CGA for patients using existing IT systems whilst protecting staff time, preserving patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"94 The Comprehensive Frailty Assessment At Forth Valley Royal Hospital (FVRH) Digitalised: For COVID-19 and Beyond!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heparin has been found to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.

Experiments corroborated the simulation results by showing that heparin inhibits the cleavage of spike by furin by binding to the basic S1/S2 site.

The major mutation detected to date in the SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope spike protein, which is responsible for virus attachment to the host and is also the main target for host antibodies, is a mutation of an aspartate (D) at position 614 found frequently in Chinese strains to a glycine (G). We sought to infer health impact of this mutation. RESULT: Increased case fatality rate correlated strongly with the proportion of viruses bearing G614 on a country by country basis. The amino acid at position 614 occurs at an internal protein interface of the viral spike, and the presence of G at this position was calculated to destabilise a specific conformation of the viral spike, within which the key host receptor binding site is more accessible. CONCLUSION: These results imply that G614 is a more pathogenic strain of SARS-CoV-2, which may influence vaccine design. The prevalence of this form of the virus should also be included in epidemiologic models predicting the COVID-19 health burden and fatality over time in specific regions.

However, blind advancement may result in misplacement of left-sided DLTs into the right bronchus. Therefore, incidence, risk factors, and blind repositioning techniques for right bronchial misplacement of left-sided DLTs were investigated. METHODS This was an observational cohort study performed on the data depository consecutively collected from patients who underwent intubation of left-sided DLTs for 2 years. Patients' clinical and anatomical characteristics were analyzed to investigate risk factors for DLT misplacements with logistic regression analysis. Moreover, when DLTs were misplaced into the right bronchus, the bronchial tube was withdrawn into the trachea and blindly readvanced without rotation, or with 90 or 180 counterclockwise rotation while the patient's head was turned right. RESULTS DLTs were inadvertently advanced into the right bronchus in 48 of 1135 (4.2 %) patients. DLT misplacements occurred more frequently in females, in patients of short stature or with narrow trachea and bronchi, and when small-sized DLTs were used. All of these factors were significantly inter-correlated each other (P < 0.001). In 40 of the 48 (83.3 %) patients, blind repositioning was successful. CONCLUSIONS Smaller left-sided DLTs were more frequently misplaced into the right mainstem bronchus than larger DLTs.

PTX3 was recently described as one of the most reliable serological predictors of clinical deterioration and short-term mortality. The present study was designed to evaluate a correlation between serological biomarkers of inflammation and lung injury measured by QCT. MethodsThis retrospective monocentric study analysed a cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted because of respiratory failure, or significant radiological involvement on chest CT scan. All patients, males and non-pregnant females older than 18 years, underwent chest CT scan and laboratory testing at admission. Exclusion criteria were defined by concurrent acute pathological processes and ongoing specific treatments which could interfere with immune activity. The cohort was stratified based on severity in mild and severe forms. Compromised lung at QCT was then correlated to serological biomarkers representative of SARS-CoV-2. We further developed a multivariable logistic model to predict CT data and clinical deterioration based on a specific molecular signature. Internal cross-validation led to evaluate discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the tool that was provided by a score to simplify its application. Findings592 patients were recruited between March 19th and December 1st, 2020. Applying exclusion criteria which consider confounders, the cohort resulted in 366 individuals characterized by 177 mild and 189 severe forms. In our predictive model, blood levels of PTX3, CRP and LDH were found to correlate with QCT values in mild COVID-19 disease. A signature of these three biomarkers had a high predictive accuracy in detecting compromised lungs as assessed by QCT. The score was elaborated and resulted representative of lung CT damage leading to clinical deterioration and oxygen need in mild disease. InterpretationThe LDH, PTX3, CRP blood signature can serve as a strong correlate of compromised lung in COVID-19, possibly integrating cellular damage, systemic inflammation, myeloid and endothelial cell activation. FundingThis work was supported by a philanthropic donation by Dolce & Gabbana fashion house (to A.M., C.G.) and by a grant from Italian Ministry of Health for COVID-19 (to A.M. and C.G.). Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSBesides nasopharyngeal swab and serological test, chest CT scan represents one of the most useful tools to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, QCT has been demonstrated to foresee oxygen need as well as deterioration of health status. Several clinical and serological parameters have been studied alone or combined in scores to be applied as prognostic tools of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; however, no one has yet reached the everyday practice. Recently, our group has investigated the expression and clinical significance of PTX3 in COVID-19 demonstrating the correlation with short-term mortality independently of confounders. The result was confirmed by other studies in different settings increasing evidence of PTX3 as a strong biomarker of severity; noteworthy, a recent report analysed proteomic data with a machine learning approach identifying age with PTX3 or SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia as the best binary signatures associated to 28-days mortality. Added value of this studyThe present study was designed to investigate associations between markers of damage and the CT extension of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in order to provide a biological footprint of radiological results in paucisymptomatic patients. QCT data were considered in a binary form identifying a threshold relevant for clinical deterioration, as already proved by literature. Our findings demonstrate a significant correlation with three peripheral blood proteins (PTX3, LDH and CRP) which result representative of COVID-19 severity. The study presents a predictive model of radiological lung involvement which performs with a high level of accuracy (cvAUC of 0{middle dot}794{+/-}0{middle dot}107; CI 95%: 0{middle dot}74-0{middle dot}87) and a simple score was provided to simplify the interpretation of the three biomarkers. Besides additional finding on PTX3 role in SARS-CoV2 pathology, its prognostic value was confirmed by data on clinical deterioration; indeed, paucisymptomatic subjects showed a 11{middle dot}9% deaths. The model offers the possibility to quickly assess patients resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 and estimate people at risk of deterioration despite normal clinical and blood gases analysis, with potential to identify those who need better clinical monitoring and interventions. Implications of all the available evidencePredicting the extension, severity, and clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients its pivotal to allocate enough resources in emergency and to avoid health system burden. Despite the urgent clinical need of biomarkers, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia still lacks something able to provide an easy measure of its severity. Some multiparametric scores have been proposed for severe COVID-19 and rely on deep assessment of patients status (clinical, serological, and radiological data). Our model represents an unprecedented effort to provide a tool which could predict CT pneumonia extension, oxygen requirement and clinical deterioration in mild COVID-19.

Regulations provide additional protections for children participating in human subject research and limit the amount of risk to which children may be exposed without benefit (21 CFR 50, subpart D, Additional Safeguards for Children in Clinical Investigations). The objective of this paper is to describe the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experience with placebo-controlled trials conducted as part of pediatric drug development programs including compliance with 21 CFR 50, subpart D. METHODS Pediatric drug development programs conducted under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) or the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) between 2012 and 2018 were reviewed. Trials that utilized a placebo control were identified and trial characteristics and risk mitigation strategies were extracted from publicly available sources. RESULTS During this time frame, a total of 266 products were studied under pediatric product development initiatives. Of those, 67 products (25%) were studied in 96 individual placebo-controlled trials in pediatric patients. The majority of these studies included approaches to minimize risk to children in the placebo arm, including 49 trials that utilized placebo as an add-on to known effective therapy for the disease and 48 trials that included rescue therapy in the study protocol. CONCLUSIONS When designed and conducted appropriately, placebo-controlled trials meet requirements under current US federal regulations for the protection of children in research.","output":"Ethical Considerations for Pediatric Placebo-Controlled Trials: FDA Outcomes and Perspectives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: As students return to colleges and universities in the fall of 2020, it is important to understand their perception of risk and their desire for in person versus online learning, which may differ between undergraduate and graduate students. Methods: We anonymously surveyed 212 undergraduate and 134 graduate students in the College of Public Health, and 94 graduate students in the College of Education in late June, 2020. We asked them Likert style questions regarding their comfort returning to campus and their preferred learning strategies once back. We compared Strongly agree/Agree with Neutral/Disagree/Strongly disagree using a chi-square test. Results: Graduate students were significantly less likely to look forward to being on campus (38.3% doctoral vs 40.6% master's vs 77.7% undergraduate, p < 0.001), more likely to perceive themselves as high risk (43.3% doctoral vs 40.0% masters vs 17.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001), and were more likely to prefer all classwork online (66.7% doctoral vs 44.6% masters vs 20.8% undergraduate, p < 0.001). Graduate students were also less likely to prefer to be in the classroom as much as possible in the fall (59.2% doctoral vs 67.7% masters vs 74.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001). Most were not concerned about their ability to conduct research. Students generally supported wearing of facemasks indoors. Conclusions: There are important differences in perception of risk and desire for online versus in-person learning between undergraduate and graduate students.

Indeed given major confounding factors (age and co-morbidities), true drivers of this condition have remained elusive. Here, we employ an unprecedented multi-omics analysis, combined with artificial intelligence, in a young patient cohort where major co-morbidities have been excluded at the onset. Here, we established a three-tier cohort of individuals younger than 50 years without major comorbidities. These included 47 critical (in the ICU under mechanical ventilation) and 25 non-critical (in a noncritical care ward) COVID-19 patients as well as 22 healthy individuals. The analyses included whole-genome sequencing, whole-blood RNA sequencing, plasma and blood mononuclear cells proteomics, cytokine profiling and high-throughput immunophenotyping. An ensemble of machine learning, deep learning, quantum annealing and structural causal modeling led to key findings. Critical patients were characterized by exacerbated inflammation, perturbed lymphoid/myeloid compartments, coagulation and viral cell biology. Within a unique gene signature that differentiated critical from noncritical patients, several driver genes promoted severe COVID-19 among which the upregulated metalloprotease ADAM9 was key. This gene signature was replicated in an independent cohort of 81 critical and 73 recovered COVID-19 patients, as were ADAM9 transcripts, soluble form and proteolytic activity. Ex vivo ADAM9 inhibition affected SARS-CoV-2 uptake and replication in human lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, within a young, otherwise healthy, COVID-19 cohort, we provide the landscape of biological perturbations in vivo where a unique gene signature differentiated critical from non-critical patients. The key driver, ADAM9, interfered with SARS-CoV-2 biology.

Further preclinical studies indicated that the effects of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are probably superior to that of MSCs. At present, MSC-EVs have attracted much attention in treating fibrosis of lung, liver, kidney, skin, and heart.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of deepening levels of sedation induced by propofol and how they compare to natural sleep. METHODS Fifty consecutive neurologically normal patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy while sedated with propofol were included. Topographic EEG spectral maps and the bispectral index (BIS) values were obtained at four time points: wakefulness, mild sedation, deep sedation and recovery. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. RESULTS Propofol induced increased delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and gamma (25-40 Hz) power throughout sedation. In addition, there was decreased alpha power (9-11.5 Hz) in the occipital area and increased global beta (12-25 Hz)/gamma (25-40 Hz) power during mild sedation. Deep sedation was associated with increased theta (4-7 Hz)/alpha (9-11.5 Hz)/beta (12-25 Hz) power, which was maximal frontally. CONCLUSION There are distinct changes associated with deepening levels of propofol induced sedation that distinguish it from natural sleep. This suggests that different mechanisms are involved in them and warrants further investigations to clarify the nature of these changes.","output":"Changes in topographic electroencephalogram during deepening levels of propofol sedation based on alertness/sedation scale under bispectral index guidance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the increasing demand for glass fibre-reinforced epoxy resin composites (GFRC), huge amounts of GFRC waste are produced annually in different sizes and shapes, which may affect its thermal and chemical decomposition using pyrolysis technology. In this context, this research aims to study the effect of mechanical pre-treatment on the pyrolysis behaviour of GFRC and its pyrolysis kinetic. The experiments were started with the fabrication of GFRC panels using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer method followed by crushing the prepared panels using ball milling, thus preparing the milled GFRC with uniform shape and size. The elemental, proximate, and morphology properties of the panels and milled GFRC were studied. The thermal and chemical decomposition of the milled GFRC was studied using thermogravimetric coupled with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) at different heating rates. Meanwhile, the volatile products were examined using TG coupled with gas chromatographyCmass spectrometry (GC-MS). The TG-FTIR and TG-GC-MS experiments were performed separately. Linear (KissingerCAkahiraCSunose (KAS), FlynnCWallCOzawa (FWO), and Friedman) and nonlinear (Vyazovkin and Cai) isoconversional methods were used to determine the pyrolysis kinetic of the milled GFRC based on thermogravimetry and differential thermal gravimetry (TG/DTG). In addition, the TG/DTG data of the milled GFRC were fitting using the distributed activation energy model and the independent parallel reactions kinetic model. The TG results showed that GFRC can decompose in three stages, and the main decomposition is located in the range 256C500 C.

As such, proper symptom identification, including gastrointestinal manifestations, and relationship to health outcomes remains key. We aimed to assess the prevalence and impact of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with COVID-19 in a large quaternary referral center in South America. METHODS: This was a single-center cohort study in a COVID-19 specific hospital in S?o Paulo, Brazil. Consecutive adult patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included. Baseline patient history, presenting symptoms, laboratory results, and clinically relevant outcomes were recorded. Regression analyses were performed to determine significant predictors of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 and hospitalization outcomes. RESULTS: Four-hundred patients with COVID-19 were included. Of these, 33.25% of patients reported &#8805;1 gastrointestinal symptom. Diarrhea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom (17.25%). Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms had higher rates of concomitant constitutional symptoms, notably fatigue and myalgia (p<0.05). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also more prevalent among patients on chronic immunosuppressants, ACE/ARB medications, and patient with chronic kidney disease (p<0.05). Laboratory results, length of hospitalization, ICU admission, ICU length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and in-hospital mortality did not differ based upon gastrointestinal symptoms (p>0.05).

METHODS: From January 30, 2020 to March 23, 2020, we conducted a non-randomised controlled trial, in which all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were assigned to three groups non-randomly and given supportive treatments: Group A, Lopinavir-Ritonavir; Group B, Huashi Baidu Formula (a Chinese medicineformula made by the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences to treat COVID-19, which is now in the clinical trial period) and Lopinavir-Ritonavir; and Group C, Huashi Baidu Formula. The use of antibiotics, antiviruses, and corticosteroids was permitted in Group A and B. Traditional Chinese medicine injections were permitted in Group C. The primary outcomes were clinical remission time (interval from admission to the first time the patient tested negatively for novel coronavirus or an obvious improvement was observed from chest CT) and clinical remission rate (number of patients whose clinical time was within 16 days/total number of patients). RESULTS: A total of 60 adult patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at sites in Wuhan, China, and the sample size of each group was 20. In Groups A, B and C, the clinical remission rates were 95.0%%(19/20), 100.0%%(20/20) and 100.0%%(20/20), respectively. Compared with Groups A and B, the clinical remission time of Group C was significantly shorter (5.9 days vs. 10.8 days, p < 0.05; 5.9 days vs. 9.7 days, p < 0.05).

Inspired by the graduation ceremony, a novel manufacturing mode-Graduation Manufacturing System (GMS) with ticket-based reconfigurable structures, is designed for organizing production operations with simplicity and resilience for the layout of FPAI. The IIoT and digital twin-enabled GiMS is developed for transforming real-time visibility in operations to support the reconfiguration of the manufacturing system. A synchronization-oriented reconfiguration mechanism is proposed to achieve the synchronous interaction among changing customer demand, island configuration, and production activities allocation rapidly and cost-effectively.

Musculoskeletal shoulder pain is challenging to manage and while research evidence suggests that exercise should be a cornerstone of shoulder pain rehabilitation, the exact type and dosage of exercise is unclear. Adherence is a barrier to successful outcomes with exercise-based management of musculoskeletal pain, especially for those with co-morbidities, high pain levels and reported boredom associated with competing prescribed exercise. Virtual reality (VR) may offer an effective platform for rehabilitation of musculoskeletal shoulder pain. Virtual Reality has been shown to be effective for management of acute and chronic pain conditions, for delivering education around various health conditions, and for supporting rehabilitation of neurological conditions. Therefore, it is possible that VR may have a role in the delivery of exercise and education for individuals with musculoskeletal shoulder pain. VR intervention design should involve several steps and begin with establishing early acceptability from users as to the suitability of the technology in clinical practice as well as potential barriers and facilitators to using the technology successfully. This study will therefore aim to explore physiotherapists beliefs and perspectives of immersive VR as a platform for assessment and rehabilitation in patients with musculoskeletal shoulder pain. Further, this study will inform the development of a VR intervention for use in the rehabilitation of musculoskeletal shoulder pain. A series of online focus groups will be conducted with physiotherapists in Ireland using a qualitative descriptive approach to data analysis.

We calculate key measures, including the number of reported cases and deaths, and the probability of elimination within a specified time frame. By comparing these measures under alternative timings of interventions, we show that changing the timing of AL4 (the strictest level of restrictions) has a far greater impact than the timing of border measures. Delaying AL4 restrictions results in considerably worse outcomes. Implementing border measures alone, without AL4 restrictions, is insufficient to control the outbreak.

The UPR signaling network encompasses three core elements, i.e., PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1). Activation of these three branch pathways of the UPR leads to the translation arrest and degradation of misfolded proteins, the expression of ER molecular chaperones, and the expansion of the ER membrane to decrease the load of proteins and increase the protein-folding capacity in the ER. Recently, the essential roles of the UPR have been implicated in a number of mammalian diseases, particularly viral diseases.

Brain-related complications affect people with HIV and COVID-19 alike. Moreover, since HIV patients are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, their neurological problems can be exacerbated by COVID-19. The use of dietary supplements together with available treatment options has been shown to reduce the severity of infections. However, these treatments are not chemically compatible with the bodys bloodCbrain barrier defense mechanism. Therefore, a viable delivery method is needed to deliver drugs and nutraceuticals to the brain in HIV and COVID-19 comorbid patients. ABSTRACT: People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are at an increased risk of severe and critical COVID-19 infection. There is a steady increase in neurological complications associated with COVID-19 infection, exacerbating HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in PLWHA. Nutraceuticals, such as phytochemicals from medicinal plants and dietary supplements, have been used as adjunct therapies for many disease conditions, including viral infections. Appropriate use of these adjunct therapies with antiviral proprieties may be beneficial in treating and/or prophylaxis of neurological complications associated with these co-infections. However, most of these nutraceuticals have poor bioavailability and cannot cross the bloodCbrain barrier (BBB). To overcome this challenge, extracellular vesicles (EVs), biological nanovesicles, can be used. Due to their intrinsic features of biocompatibility, stability, and their ability to cross BBB, as well as inherent homing capabilities, EVs hold immense promise for therapeutic drug delivery to the brain. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the potential role of different nutraceuticals in reducing HIV- and COVID-19-associated neurological complications and the use of EVs as nutraceutical/drug delivery vehicles to treat HIV, COVID-19, and other brain disorders.","output":"Nutraceuticals in HIV and COVID-19-Related Neurological Complications: Opportunity to Use Extracellular Vesicles as Drug Delivery Modality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Medicines optimisation is important for the management of Parkinson's disease (PD). As many patients with PD have other long-term conditions, treatment is complex and risk of adverse events for these patients is high. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of pharmacists and impact of pharmacy interventions for PD patients. METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Chinese databases Sinomed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure to identify studies reporting pharmacist interventions and pharmacy services for PD patients using a predefined search strategy. The search period was from inception to March 2019. We also manually searched the reference list of included studies and ClinicalTrials.gov. We conducted meta-analyses to synthesize the evidence quantitatively. RESULTS: A total of 1607 studies were identified by applying the search criteria. After screening, 19 cross-sectional and case-controlled studies with 1458 PD patients from 9 countries were included. Pharmacist interventions for PD patients most commonly related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (13 studies), adherence assessment (12 studies), medication review (12 studies), identification of drug interactions (11 studies), monitoring response to medication therapy (11 studies), identification of inappropriate medication (11 studies), and patient education (10 studies). Most pharmacy services were provided in outpatient settings (13 studies). Reported impact measures included adherence (8 studies), quality of life (7 studies), and identification of drug-related problems (6 studies) such as ADRs (393 times out of 1760 times, 22.33%, 6 studies), inappropriate drug choice (349 times, 19.83%, 6 studies), inappropriate dosage (335 times, 19.03%, 6 studies), inappropriate drug use (257 times, 14.60%, 3 studies) and drug-drug interactions (146 times, 8.3%, 4 studies).

There are potential risks such as infection and, thus, it is usually carried out during labor in rare cases. Recent advances in electronics and technologies have enabled fECG monitoring from the early stages of pregnancy through fECG extraction from the combined fetal/maternal ECG (f/mECG) signal recorded non-invasively in the abdominal area of the mother. However, cumbersome algorithms that require the reference maternal ECG as well as heavy feature crafting makes out-of-clinics fECG monitoring in daily life not yet feasible. To address these challenges, we proposed a pure end-to-end deep learning model to detect fetal QRS complexes (i.e., the main spikes observed on a fetal ECG waveform). Additionally, the model has the residual network (ResNet) architecture that adopts the novel 1-D octave convolution (OctConv) for learning multiple temporal frequency features, which in turn reduce memory and computational cost. Importantly, the model is capable of highlighting the contribution of regions that are more prominent for the detection. To evaluate our approach, data from the PhysioNet 2013 Challenge with labeled QRS complex annotations were used in the original form, and the data were then modified with Gaussian and motion noise, mimicking real-world scenarios. The model can achieve a F(1) score of 91.1% while being able to save more than 50% computing cost with less than 2% performance degradation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.","output":"An Efficient and Robust Deep Learning Method with 1-D Octave Convolution to Extract Fetal Electrocardiogram"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been well-documented to have a variable impact on individual communities and health care systems.

Methods: A multi-stage stratified random sampling was adopted in 2018 in Shandong Province to conduct a questionnaire survey among the sample residents, in which 982 hypertension patients were included in the study. Pearson chi-square test and logistic regression model were employed using SPSS 24.0 to explore the association between FDCSs and blood pressure measurement awareness. Results: 76.8% of hypertension patients would measure blood pressure regularly. The blood pressure measurement awareness of the signing group was significantly higher than that of the non-signing group when controlling other variables (P < 0.001, OR = 2.075, 95% CI 1.391-3.095).

Rapid and optimized vaccine allocation is critical during this time. With 95% efficacy reported for two of the vaccines, near-term public health needs require that distribution is prioritized to the elderly, health-care workers, teachers, essential workers, and individuals with co-morbidities putting them at risk of severe clinical progression. Here, we evaluate various age-based vaccine distributions using a validated mathematical model based on current epidemic trends in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. We allow for varying waning efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity, as this has not yet been measured. We account for the fact that known COVID-positive cases may not be included in the first round of vaccination. And, we account for current age-specific immune patterns in both states. We find that allocating a substantial proportion (> 75%) of vaccine supply to individuals over the age of 70 is optimal in terms of reducing total cumulative deaths through mid-2021. As we do not explicitly model other high mortality groups, this result on vaccine allocation applies to all groups at high risk of mortality if infected. Our analysis confirms that for an easily transmissible respiratory virus, allocating a large majority of vaccinations to groups with the highest mortality risk is optimal. Our analysis assumes that health systems during winter 2020C2021 have equal staffing and capacity to previous phases of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic; we do not consider the effects of understaffed hospitals or unvaccinated medical staff. Vaccinating only seronegative individuals avoids redundancy in vaccine use on individuals that may already be immune, and will result in 1% to 2% reductions in cumulative hospitalizations and deaths by mid-2021. Assuming high vaccination coverage (> 28%) and no major relaxations in distancing, masking, gathering size, or hygiene guidelines between now and spring 2021, our model predicts that a combination of vaccination and population immunity will lead to low or near-zero transmission levels by the second quarter of 2021.","output":"Optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation using real-time seroprevalence estimates in Rhode Island and Massachusetts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients with cancer show worse outcomes compared with patients without cancer. The humoral immune response (HIR) of patients with cancer against SARS-CoV-2 is not well characterized. To better understand it, we conducted a serological study of hospitalized patients with cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a unicentric, retrospective study enrolling adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to a central hospital from March 15 to June 17, 2020, whose serum samples were quantified for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain or spike protein IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies. The aims of the study were to assess the HIR to SARS-CoV-2; correlate it with different cancer types, stages, and treatments; clarify the interplay between the HIR and clinical outcomes of patients with cancer; and compare the HIR of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with and without cancer. RESULTS: We included 72 SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects (19 with cancer, 53 controls). About 90% of controls revealed a robust serological response. Among patients with cancer, a strong response was verified in 57.9%, with 42.1% showing a persistently weak response. Treatment with chemotherapy within 14 days before positivity was the only factor statistically shown to be associated with persistently weak serological responses among patients with cancer. No significant differences in outcomes were observed between patients with strong and weak responses. All IgG, IgM, IgA, and total Ig antibody titers were significantly lower in patients with cancer compared with those without. CONCLUSION: A significant portion of patients with cancer develop a proper HIR. Recent chemotherapy treatment may be associated with weak serological responses among patients with cancer. Patients with cancer have a weaker SARS-CoV-2 antibody response compared with those without cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These results place the spotlight on patients with cancer, particularly those actively treated with chemotherapy. These patients may potentially be more vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, so it is important to provide oncologists further theoretical support (with concrete examples and respective mechanistic correlations) for the decision of starting, maintaining, or stopping antineoplastic treatments (particularly chemotherapy) not only on noninfected but also on infected patients with cancer in accordance with cancer type, stage and prognosis, treatment agents, treatment setting, and SARS-CoV-2 infection risks.","output":"Humoral Immune Response of SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients with Cancer: Influencing Factors and Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory disease due to infectious disease is one of the most common presentations in rats but the cause is in many cases multifactorial.

However, it is not easy to get students to notice the importance of ethical behavior in courses that traditionally focus on the communication of technical knowledge and facts. We set out to create an academic space in which pharmacology students have the opportunity to reflect on ethical dilemmas as professionals and citizens. Methods This innovation was implemented during 2020 in a pharmacology course that is offered to second-year medical students. The course included an interaction space (initially in the classroom and then virtual, following the confinements brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic). Groups of students worked on a dilemma in pharmacological sciences. The challenges could be historical situations (such as the thalidomide tragedy) or current news about the use of medicines in the national or global context (conflicts of interest in health personnel, medication administration errors, drug adulteration, research misconduct, etc). The activity was divided into the following stages: 1. Students participated in a role-play, creating a video news show, in which they covered a dilemma. Each report included the arguments and points of view of different stakeholders (health personnel, scientists, the pharmaceutical industry, patients, government officials, and ethics experts). 2. Each team, acting as teachers, uploaded their videos, assigned a complementary reading, and designed an integration activity to promote and assess mastery of the key concepts in their peers. 3. The effectiveness of the activities was evaluated by their peers and the instructor Finally, a survey was applied to evaluate the perception of learning and the usefulness of the innovation. Twenty-five learning outcomes, including examples of student, professional, and citizen behaviors and reflections on several ethical principles, were assessed. Results In 24 of the 25 outcomes, more than 88% of the students reported that the activities helped them improve their attitude, knowledge, and ideas about an ethical principle or behavior. In 1 of the 25 items, only 67% of the students improved their learning perception (adoption of sustainable consumption habits). Evaluation of the effectiveness of each stage of the activities resulted in an average score of 89%. Conclusions In summary, a role-playing strategy in which students address an ethical dilemma in a reporting/news format can be easily incorporated into a pharmacology course. This strategy appears to be an effective mechanism for promoting student engagement and strengthening professional and ethical behavior competencies in pharmacology students.","output":"Breaking news!

Urban Diabetes has arisen as a novel nosological entity in Medicine. Urbanization leads to the accrual of a number of factors increasing the vulnerability to diabetes mellitus and related diseases. Herein we report clinical-epidemiological data of the Milano Metropolitan Area in the contest of the Cities Changing Diabetes Program. Since the epidemiological picture was taken in January 2020, on the edge of COVID-19 outbreak in the Milano Metropolitan Area, a perspective addressing potential interactions between diabetes and obesity prevalence and COVID-19 outbreak, morbidity and mortality will be presented. To counteract lock-down isolation and, in general, social distancing a pilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility and efficacy of tele-monitoring via Flash Glucose control in a cohort of diabetic patients in ASST North Milano. METHODS: Data presented derive from 1. ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics of Italy), 2. Milano ATS web site (Health Agency of Metropolitan Milano Area), which entails five ASST (Health Agencies in the Territories). A pilot study was conducted in 65 screened diabetic patients (only 40 were enrolled in the study of those 36 were affected by type 2 diabetes and 4 were affected by type 1 diabetes) of ASST North Milano utilizing Flash Glucose Monitoring for 3 months (mean age 65 years, HbA1c 7,9%. Patients were subdivided in 3 groups using glycemic Variability Coefficient (VC): a. High risk, VC > 36, n. 8 patients; Intermediate risk 20 < VC < 36, n. 26 patients; Low risk VC < 20, n. 4 patients. The control group was constituted by 26 diabetic patients non utilizing Flash Glucose monitoring. RESULTS: In a total population of 3.227.264 (23% is over 65 y) there is an overall prevalence of 5.65% with a significant difference between Downtown ASST (5.31%) and peripheral ASST (ASST North Milano, 6.8%). Obesity and overweight account for a prevalence of 7.8% and 27.7%, respectively, in Milano Metropolitan Area. We found a linear relationship (R = 0.36) between prevalence of diabetes and aging index. Similarly, correlations between diabetes prevalence and both older people depending index and structural dependence index (R = 0.75 and R = 0.93, respectively), were found. A positive correlation (R = 0.46) with percent of unoccupied people and diabetes prevalence was also found. A reverse relationship between diabetes prevalence and University level instruction rate was finally identified (R = ? 0.82). Our preliminary study demonstrated a reduction of Glycated Hemoglobin (p = 0.047) at 3 months follow-up during the lock-down period, indicating Flash Glucose Monitoring and remote control as a potential methodology for diabetes management during COVID-19 lock-down. HYPOTHESIS AND DISCUSSION: The increase in diabetes and obesity prevalence in Milano Metropolitan Area, which took place over 30 years, is related to several environmental factors. We hypothesize that some of those factors may have also determined the high incidence and virulence of COVID-19 in the Milano area. Health Agencies of Milano Metropolitan Area are presently taking care of diabetic patients facing the new challenge of maintaining sustainable diabetes care costs in light of an increase in urban population and of the new life-style. The COVID-19 pandemic will modify the management of diabetic and obese patients permanently, via the implementation of approaches that entail telemedicine technology. The pilot study conducted during the lock-down period indicates an improvement of glucose control utilizing a remote glucose control system in the Milano Metropolitan Area, suggesting a wider utilization of similar methodologies during the present second wave lock-down.","output":"Telemedicine and urban diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic in Milano, Italy during lock-down: epidemiological and sociodemographic picture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared a public health emergency of international concern, causing excessive anxiety among health care workers. Additionally, publication bias and low-quality publications have become widespread, which can result in the dissemination of unreliable information. A meta-analysis was performed for this study with the following two aims: (1) to examine the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers and determine whether it has increased owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to investigate whether there has been an increase in publication bias. METHODS: All relevant studies published between 2015 and 2020 were searched in electronic databases (namely Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, PsyArXiv, and medRxiv). The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I(2) statistic. The effect size (prevalence rate of anxiety) and 95% CI for each study were also calculated. We used moderator analysis to test for the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care workers anxiety levels and to detect publication bias in COVID-19 studies. We assessed publication bias using funnel plots and Eggers regression. RESULTS: A total of 122 studies with 118,025 participants met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-eight articles (75,066 participants) were related to COVID-19, 13 articles (9,222 participants) were unrelated to COVID-19 (i.e., articles related to other outbreaks, which were excluded), and 21 preprints (33,737 participants) were related to COVID-19. The pooled meta-analysis prevalence was 33.6% (95% CI [30.5?36.8]; 95% PI [6.5?76.3]). Moderator analysis revealed no significant differences between articles related to COVID-19 and those unrelated to COVID-19 (p = 0.824). Moreover, no significant differences were found between articles and preprints related to COVID-19 (p = 0.843). Significant heterogeneity was observed in each subgroup. An Eggers test revealed publication bias in both articles and preprints related to COVID-19 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Determining whether the anxiety state of health care workers is altered by the COVID-19 pandemic is currently difficult. However, there is evidence that their anxiety levels may always be high, which suggests that more attention should be paid to their mental health.

Delta has rapidly outcompeted all other variants and, as of June 20th, represents 70% of all SARS-CoV-2 viruses sequenced in Utah. If we attribute the entire change in VE to the Delta variant, the estimated vaccine effectiveness against Delta would be 82% (95% CI: 78%, 85%).

To support decisions by the UK Government on potential scale-up of mass population testing, we have at their request evaluated the diagnostic performance of a significant number of point-of-care rapid SARS-CoV-2 LFDs. Methods: 132 LFDs were initially reviewed by a Department of Health and Social Care team, part of the UK government, from which 64 were selected for further evaluation. Standardised laboratory evaluations, and for those that met the published criteria, field testing in the Falcon-C19 research study and UK pilots were performed (UK COVID-19 testing centres, hospital, schools, armed forces). Results: 4/64 LFDs so far have desirable performance characteristics from independent laboratory studies and early preliminary field evaluations (Orient Gene, Deepblue and Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test), of which one underwent extended clinical assessment in field studies (Innova). 8951 Innova LFD tests were performed with a kit failure rate of 5.6% (502/8951, 95% CI: 5.1-6.1), false positive rate of 0.32% (22/6954, 95% CI: 0.20-0.48) and a viral antigen detection/sensitivity (using RNA RT-PCR as a proxy for the presence of antigen) of 78.8% when performed by laboratory scientists (156/198, 95% CI 72.4-84.3). Sensitivity was significantly lower when testing was undertaken by non-experts with limited initial training Interpretation: Several LFDs have promising performance characteristics for mass population testing and can be used to identify infectious positive individuals. The Innova LFD shows good viral antigen detection/sensitivity with excellent specificity, although kit failure rates and the impact of training are potential issues. These results support the expanded evaluation of LFDs, and assessment of greater access to testing on COVID-19 transmission. Funding: Department of Health and Social Care. University of Oxford.

Methods: : This retrospective cohort study included all patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized between 20 February 2020 and 20 April 2020 at a designated COVID-19 hospital, located in Tehran province, Iran. General characteristics, medical history, and clinical symptoms were recorded by trained physicians. Blood parameters including complete blood count, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and vitamin D were tested. Results: : This study included 290 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (the mean age (SD): 61.6 (16.9), 56.6% males), of whom 142 had vitamin D concentrations less than 20 ng/ml, defined as vitamin D deficiency. COVID-19 patients with vitamin D deficiency were more likely to die (Crude OR (95% CI): 2.30 (1.25-4.26)), require ICU care (2.06 (1.22-3.46)) and invasive mechanical ventilation (2.03 (1.04-3.93)) based on univariate logistic regression results. However, after adjusting for potentials confounders such as gender and age, the association between vitamin D and need to invasive mechanical ventilation lost its significance.

We developed a mathematical model that characterizes infections by state and incorporates inflows and outflows of interstate travelers. Modeling reveals that curbing interstate travel when the disease is already widespread will make little difference. Meanwhile, increased testing capacity (facilitating early identification of infected people and quick isolation) and strict social-distancing and self-quarantine rules are effective in abating the outbreak. The modeling has also produced state-specific information. For example, for New York and Michigan, isolation of persons exposed to the virus needs to be imposed within 2 days to prevent a broad outbreak, whereas for other states this period can be 3.6 days.

Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models, specifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these superpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model that leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial information in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with relational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is learned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a \`hybrid' loss. We evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four popular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Moreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks: COVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint Identification.

Anecdotal evidence has described atypical presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older adults; however, the frequency of and outcomes associated with delirium in older ED patients with COVID-19 infection have not been well described. OBJECTIVE: To determine how frequently older adults with COVID-19 present to the ED with delirium and their associated hospital outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was conducted at 7 sites in the US. Participants included consecutive older adults with COVID-19 presenting to the ED on or after March 13, 2020. EXPOSURE: COVID-19 was diagnosed by positive nasal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (99% of cases) or classic radiological findings (1% of cases). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was delirium as identified from the medical record according to a validated record review approach. RESULTS: A total of 817 older patients with COVID-19 were included, of whom 386 (47%) were male, 493 (62%) were White, 215 (27%) were Black, and 54 (7%) were Hispanic or Latinx. The mean (SD) age of patients was 77.7 (8.2) years. Of included patients, 226 (28%) had delirium at presentation, and delirium was the sixth most common of all presenting symptoms and signs. Among the patients with delirium, 37 (16%) had delirium as a primary symptom and 84 (37%) had no typical COVID-19 symptoms or signs, such as fever or shortness of breath. Factors associated with delirium were age older than 75 years (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.95), living in a nursing home or assisted living (aRR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.98-1.55), prior use of psychoactive medication (aRR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.11-1.81), vision impairment (aRR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.54-2.54), hearing impairment (aRR, 1.10; 95% CI 0.78-1.55), stroke (aRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.15-1.88), and Parkinson disease (aRR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.30-2.58).

This is a descriptive analysis of TB evaluations and diagnosis during 2019 (pre COVID-19 period) and 2020 (COVID-19 period) at the largest safety net hospital in Los Angeles County (LAC+USC Medical Center). METHODS: The medical records of patients diagnosed with pulmonary TB from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 were identified through laboratory and electronic medical records. We included all patients with  1 sputum positive result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) culture and reviewed their Xpert MTB/RIF MTB PCR. RESULTS: Table 1 shows summary of results. During the COVID-19 period, the number of patients evaluated for pulmonary TB decreased by 64% compared to the previous year (Figure 1). The proportion of patients with culture-confirmed TB disease however, was nearly identical (P=0.913) (Table 1). Sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear positivity increased 52% to 64% during COVID-19 (P=0.324) and disease severity as measured by chest radiograph, was significantly higher during the COVID-19 period (P = 0.031) (Figure 2).

In this work, we have analyzed a possible antiviral function of IFITMs against a double stranded DNA virus, the African swine fever virus (ASFV). Infection with cell-adapted ASFV isolate Ba71V is IFN sensitive and it induces IFITMs expression. Interestingly, high levels of IFITMs caused a collapse of the endosomal pathway to the perinuclear area. Given that ASFV entry is strongly dependent on endocytosis, we investigated whether IFITM expression could impair viral infection. Expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 reduced virus infectivity in Vero cells, with IFITM2 and IFITM3 having an impact on viral entry/uncoating. The role of IFITM2 in the inhibition of ASFV in Vero cells could be related to impaired endocytosis-mediated viral entry and alterations in the cholesterol efflux, suggesting that IFITM2 is acting at the late endosome, preventing the decapsidation stage of ASFV.","output":"Antiviral Role of IFITM Proteins in African Swine Fever Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An observational study was conducted in Ukraine to determine the independent mortality risks among adult inpatients with COVID-19.

We investigated the number of consultations since the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of telephonic consultation as opposed to in-person consultations through visits to counselees homes. RESULTS: Counselors have been continued offering supports to their counselees even under the COVID-19 restrictions, in fact, fifty percent of counselors have increased the consultations. Although some counselors had a sense of unease or concern about telephonic consultation due to the inability to see their non-verbal expressions, there were some advantages of telephonic consultation, in that the counselors were able to have longer sessions and listen more attentively to severe issues.

Considering the unprecedented deployment of governmental power via public health interventions based on social regulation to protect the population during the crisishow can we understand so much death and suffering among the most vulnerable?","output":"Biopower under a state of exception: stories of dying and grieving alone during COVID-19 emergency measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A case study design was used to understand Manitobas response to accessing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in the first wave of the global coronavirus pandemic.

METHODS: Case numbers from calendar weeks 1 through 22 of the two consecutive years 2019 and 2020 were obtained from 29 university hospitals and 7 non-university hospitals in Germany. Information was also obtained on the patients' age, sex, and urgency, along with the type of case (outpatient/inpatient), admitting ward, and a small number of tracer diagnoses (I21, myocardial infarction; J44, COPD; and I61, I63, I64, G45, stroke /TIA), as well as on the number of COVID-19 cases and of tests performed for SARS-CoV-2, as a measure of the number of cases in which COVID-19 was suspected or at least included in the differential diagnoses. RESULTS: A total of 1 022 007 emergency room consultations were analyzed, of which 546 940 took place in 2019 and 475 067 in 2020. The number of consultations with a positive test for the COVID-19 pathogen was 3122. The total number of emergency room consultations in the observation period was 13% lower in 2020 than in 2019, with a maximum drop by 38% coinciding with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (calendar week 14; 572 cases). After the initiation of interpersonal contact restrictions in 2020, there was a marked drop in COVID-19 case numbers, by a mean of -240 cases per week per emergency room (95% confidence interval [-284; -128]). There was a rise in case numbers thereafter, by a mean of 17 patients per week [14; 19], and the number of cases of myocardial infarction returned fully to the level seen in 2019. CONCLUSION: In Germany, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in medical emergencies of all kinds presenting to the nation's emergency departments. A recovery effect began to be seen as early as calendar week 15, but the levels seen in 2019 were not yet reached overall by calendar week 22; only the prevalence of myocardial infarction had renormalized by then.

The pandemic of SARS Cov-19 (COVID-19) has affected millions of individuals and resulted in 3 percent mortality worldwide. Kidney allograft recipients are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity in COVID-19, due to their immunosuppressed and cardiovascular conditions. Methods. This study evaluated the outcome of renal allograft recipients with COVID-19 in a single referral center. Seven thousands, seven hundred and forty one patients with COVID-19 admitted in Firoozgar Hospital from March 2019 to September 2021. Among them 59 were kidney allograft recipients with the age range of 18-76. We reported our outcome as the mortality during hospital stay. Acute kidney injury and severity score were defined based on KDIGO and WHO classification, respectively. Our Therapeutic management included low dose CNI and antimetabolites withdrawal. The selection of steroid dose was related to severity score. Critical and severe patients received methylprednisolone pulse for three consecutive days. Results. Fifty nine renal allograft recipients were included in this study, 38 (64.5%) were male and 21(35.6%) were female. The most frequent comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (52.5%) and hypertension (30%). The mortality rate was 22% (13 out of 59). Forty six (78%) patients were discharged from the hospital with good condition. According to defined WHO classification severity score, 15 (25.4%) had mild, 14 (23.7%) moderate, 17 (28.8%) severe, and 13 (22%) were in a critical situation on admission. Acute kidney injury developed in 13.6% of patients. Univariate analysis showed that Severity score, age, transplant duration, CRP and lymph/neutrophil ratio, LDH, and need for intubation were the major predictive risk factors of mortality (P < 0.05). Conclusion. The mortality rate in hospitalized kidney allograft recipients was 1.5 to 3 fold higher than general population. Those with acute kidney injury need long term follow up for the detection of permanent sequel. As the COVID-19 infection in renal allograft recipients considerably increases the risk of morbidity and mortality, these patients should be monitored closely to prevent poor outcomes.","output":"COVID-19 outcome in kidney allograft recipients, a report of a referral center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We developed a feline model of lentiviral cross-species transmission using a puma lentivirus (PLV or FIV(Pco)) which infects domestic cats but does not cause disease. Infection with PLV protects cats from CD4+ T-cell decline caused by subsequent infection with virulent feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Previous studies implicate innate immune and/or cellular restriction mechanisms for FIV disease attenuation in PLV-infected cats. In this study, we evaluated viral infection and cytokine mRNA transcription in 12 different tissue reservoirs approximately five months post infection. We quantitated tissue proviral load, viral mRNA load and relative transcription of IL-10, IL-12p40 and IFN from tissues of cats exposed to FIV, PLV or both viruses and analyzed these parameters using a multivariate statistical approach. The distribution and intensity of FIV infection and IFN transcription differed between single and co-infected cats, characterized by higher FIV proviral loads and IFN expression in co-infected cat tissues. Variability in FIV mRNA load and IFN was significantly more constrained in co-infected versus singly infected cat tissues. Single-infected:co-infected ratios of FIV mRNA load compared to FIV proviral load indicated that active viral transcription was apparently inhibited during co-infection. These results indicate that previous PLV infection increases activation of tissue innate immunity and constrains the ability of FIV to productively infect tissue reservoirs of infection for months, independent of FIV proviral load, supporting a model in which innate immunity and/or modulation of target cell susceptibility play a key role in PLV-induced protection from FIV disease.","output":"Prior Virus Exposure Alters the Long-Term Landscape of Viral Replication during Feline Lentiviral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The response to the COVID-19 pandemic potentially reduced the clinical experience and academic education of dental trainees through reduced supervised clinical sessions. Graduating dental students, future employers, and regulators may be concerned over the level of clinical experience of graduates trained within the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to try and document the evidence for, and significance of, this impact. METHODS From dental student data in the 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 cohorts attending The University of Sydney, Australia, the number of dental extractions and adjunct oral surgery procedures, as well as final end-of-year examination results, were recorded. Results were compared to determine if differences in experience and final academic achievement existed between these cohorts. RESULTS The smallest student cohort, 2017, demonstrated greater clinical experience than the 2018, 2019 and 2020 cohorts. The 2020 COVID-19 affected cohort demonstrated no statistically significant reduction in clinical experience in all measured clinical procedures when compared with the 2018 and 2019 cohorts. The decrease in city teaching hospital clinical experience was compensated by an increase in rural placements. The 2020 cohort achieved the lowest academic results, and this was statistically significant. CONCLUSION The oral surgery clinical experience of the 2020 dental cohort at The University of Sydney was comparable to prior cohorts. Rural clinics were able to compensate for COVID-19 interruptions to clinical training.

As reflected by patient-reported outcomes (PROs), the psychosocial impact of cancer screening is not yet clear. Our aim is to evaluate the impact of cancer screening through PRO assessment. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and reference lists of articles from January 2000 to August 2020 for relevant publications assessing the psychosocial impact of cancer screening before and within 1 year after screening in the general asymptomatic population, including following receipt of results. Studies focused on diagnostic evaluation or involving patients previously diagnosed with cancer were excluded. RESULTS: In total, 31 studies (12 randomized controlled trials; 19 observational studies) were included, reflecting PRO assessments associated with lung, breast, colorectal, anal, ovarian, cervical, and prostate cancer screening procedures. The most commonly assessed construct was symptoms of anxiety, using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Cancer-specific distress and worry were also assessed using a broad range of measures. Overall, individuals tolerated screening procedures well with no major psychosocial effects. Of note, increases in symptoms of anxiety and levels of distress and worry were generally found prior to communication of screening results and following communication of indeterminate or positive results that required further testing. These negative psychosocial effects were, however, not long-lasting and returned to baseline relatively soon after screening. Furthermore, individuals with higher cancer risk, such as current smokers and those with a family history of cancer, tended to have higher levels of anxiety and distress throughout the screening process, including following negative or indeterminate results. CONCLUSIONS: The psychosocial impact of cancer screening is relatively low overall and short-lived, even following false-positive test results. Individuals with a higher risk of cancer tend to experience more symptoms of anxiety and distress during the screening process; thus, more attention to this group is recommended.

This study combined biofilm assays and molecular techniques to demonstrate that N. europaea makes very little biofilm on its own, and relies on the activity of associated heterotrophic bacteria to establish a biofilm. However, N. europaea has a vital role in the proliferation of mixed-species communities under carbon-limited conditions, such as in drinking water distribution systems, through the provision of organic carbon via ammonia oxidation. Results show that the addition of nitrification inhibitors to mixed-species nitrifying cultures under carbon-limited conditions disrupted biofilm formation and caused the dispersal of pre-formed biofilms. This dispersal effect was not observed when an organic carbon source, glucose, was included in the medium. Interestingly, inhibition of nitrification activity of these mixed-species biofilms in the presence of added glucose resulted in increased total biofilm formation compared to controls without the addition of nitrification inhibitors, or with only glucose added. This suggests that active AOB partially suppress or limit the overall growth of the heterotrophic bacteria. The experimental model developed here provides evidence that ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) are involved in both the formation and maintenance of multi-species biofilm communities. The results demonstrate that the activity of the AOB not only support the growth and biofilm formation of heterotrophic bacteria by providing organic carbon, but also restrict and limit total biomass in mixed community systems.","output":"Biofilm formation inhibition and dispersal of multi-species communities containing ammonia-oxidising bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of variants of concern (VOC), which may compromise the efficacy of the currently administered vaccines.

For all the examined individuals, comparable levels of reactivity to both forms of spike protein were determined. In addition, a dominant Th1 response was observed, manifested mainly by IFNg-secreting cells and only limited numbers of IL-10- and IL-4-secreting cells.

It is generally recognized that social isolation is associated with physical inactivity; however, is social isolation a direct determinant of decreased physical activity? What is the main finding and its importance? We conducted a within-subjects experiment with the aid of a body-implantable actimeter. Our results clearly demonstrated that social isolation decreased home-cage activity in mice. This might have resulted from increased immobility and decreased vigorous activity, suggesting that avoiding social isolation is important to preventing physical inactivity. ABSTRACT An inactive lifestyle can negatively affect physiological and mental health. Social isolation is associated with physical inactivity; however, it remains uncertain whether social isolation is a direct determinant of decreased physical activity. Hence, we assessed whether social isolation decreases home-cage activity using a within-subjects design and examined the effects of social isolation on hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. This study used a body-implantable actimeter called nanotag?, which enabled us to measure home-cage activity despite housing the mice in groups. We first examined the influence of the intraperitoneal implantation of nanotag? on home-cage activity. Although nanotag? implantation decreased home-cage activity temporarily, 7 days post-implantation, it recovered to the same level as that of control (non-implanted) mice, suggesting that implantation of nanotag? does not have a negative influence on home-cage activity if mice undergo a 1-week recovery period after implantation. In the main experiment, after the 1-week baseline measurement performed while in group housing, the mice were placed in a group or in isolation. Home-cage activity was measured for an additional 4 weeks. Home-cage activity in isolated mice during the dark period decreased by 26% from pre-intervention to the last week of intervention. Furthermore, the reduction in the number of 5-minute epochs during which the activity count exceeded 301 (an index of vigorous activity) was significantly larger for isolated mice. Contrary to expectations, social isolation did not impair hippocampal neurogenesis. Our results demonstrate that social isolation is a direct determinant of decreased physical activity, possibly because of reduced vigorous physical activity. This article is protected by copyright.

The Enhance Access to Kidney Transplantation and Living Kidney Donation (EnAKT LKD) pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial is testing whether a multi-component quality improvement intervention, provided in chronic kidney disease (CKD) programs (vs. usual care), can help patients with CKD with no recorded contraindications to kidney transplant complete more steps toward receiving a transplant (primary outcome of the trial). The EnAKT LKD intervention has 4 components: (1) quality Improvement teams and administrative support, (2) improved transplant education for patients and healthcare providers, (3) access to support and (4) program-level performance monitoring. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a process evaluation of the EnAKT LKD quality improvement intervention to determine if the components were delivered, received, and enacted as designed (fidelity), and if the intervention addressed intended barriers (mechanisms of change). DESIGN: A mixed-methods process evaluation informed by new practice implementation and theories of behavior change. SETTING: Chronic kidney disease programs in Ontario, Canada, began receiving the EnAKT LKD intervention on November 1, 2017 and will continue to receive it until December 31, 2021. The process evaluation (interviews and surveys) will occur alongside the trial, between December 2020 to May 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare providers (eg, dialysis nurses, nephrologists, members of the multi-care kidney clinic team) at Ontarios 27 CKD programs. METHODS: We will survey and interview healthcare providers at each CKD program, and complete an intervention implementation checklist. Quantitative data from the surveys and the intervention implementation checklist will assess fidelity to the intervention, while quantitative and qualitative data from surveys and interviews will provide insight into the mechanisms of change. LIMITATIONS: The long trial period may result in poor participant recall.

Despite the prevalence of HaH in Western countries, studies in Asia are limited and the perception of HaH remains underexplored in Asian context. Understanding the perceptions of stakeholders is vital before implementing HaH in any new settings. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore the perceptions of referring physicians, care providers, patients, and caregivers on HaH programs in a multiracial country such as in Singapore. METHODS This study used a descriptive qualitative design. Participants from 2 tertiary hospitals in Singapore, including 13 referring physicians, 10 care providers, 15 patients, and 3 caregivers, were interviewed between June 2020 and September 2020.

The medicinal quality of herbal plants varies with the locations of cultivation, the parts of the herb collected, the season of the herb collected, and the herb processing method. Polysaccharides are major components of the herb plants and their biosynthesis is partly controlled by the genes but mostly influenced by the availability of the nutrition and determined by the various environmental factors. In recent decades, polysaccharides isolated from different kinds of Chinese herbs have received much attention due to their important biological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, radiation protecting, antiviral, hypolipidemic, and immunomodulatory activities. Interestingly, different batches of the same herb can obtain different polysaccharide fractions with subtle differences in molecular weight, monosaccharide compositions, glycosidic linkages, and biological functions. Even with these variations, a large number of bioactive polysaccharides from different kinds of traditional Chinese herbs have been purified, characterized, and reported. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the latest polysaccharide extraction methods and the strategies used for monosaccharide compositional analysis plus polysaccharide structural characterization. Most importantly, the reported chemical characteristics and biological activities of the polysaccharides from the famous traditional Chinese herbs including Astragalus membranaceus, Ginseng, Lycium barbarum, Angelica sinensis, Cordyceps sinensis, and Ophiopogon japonicus will be reviewed and discussed.

Re-configuring a hospital clinical rotation using virtual care platforms allowed students to re-engage in the clinical environment and actively participate in patient care. Methods During the height of the pandemic, we implemented a 4-week virtual team member (VTM) inpatient medicine elective for medical students in their second year and above to participate in acute patient care during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tasks included providing daily updates to patients and family members along and care coordination. Faculty experts in infectious disease, mental health, ethics, and patient safety incorporated weekly didactic video talks throughout the elective. Student feedback was obtained anonymously through pre-, mid-, and post-elective questionnaires. Results A total of 26 students enrolled in the two 4-week blocks, with 85% in the 2nd year. Survey response rates for the pre, mid, and post-rotation questionnaires were 96%, 77%, 58% respectively.

Methods: Consecutive patients treated at the rheumatology institute who received their first SARS-CoV-2 (Pfizer) vaccine were recruited to the study, at their routine visit. The patients were invited for serology test 4-6 weeks after receiving the second dose of vaccine. IgG Antibodies (Ab) against SARS COV2 virus were detected using the SARS-Cov-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott) assay Results: One hundred fifty-six consecutive patients (76% females) treated at a single rheumatology center (mean age (range) 59.1 (21-83) years), mean (range) disease duration 10.8 (1-55) years), were recruited to the study. Thirty-five percents of patients received conventional synthetic (cs)DMARDs only, 64% biological/targeted synthetic (b/ts) DMARDs, 34% received combined treatment with csDMARDs and b/tsDMARDs and 32% corticosteroids (mean dose(range) 5.8mg(2.5-20mg) prednisone).

Treatment of COVID-19 to prevent complications remains a priority. OBJECTIVE: Our investigation sought to determine whether combination of spironolactone and sitagliptin could reduce mortality for inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This single-blind, 4-arm, prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted at Shiraz and Bushehr University of Medical Sciences hospitals between December 2020 and April 2021. We randomized hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia into 4 groups: control, combination therapy, sitagliptin add-on, or spironolactone add-on. The primary outcome was the clinical improvement of the patients in the hospital as measured on an 8-point numerical scale. The secondary outcomes included intubation, ICU admission, end organ damages, CT findings, and paraclinical information. RESULTS: A total of 263 admitted patients were randomly assigned to control group (87 patients), combination group (60 patients), sitagliptin group (66 patients), and spironolactone group (50 patients). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, except for higher age in control group. The intervention groups, especially combination therapy, had better clinical outcomes (clinical score on fifth day of admission: 3.11  2.45 for controls, 1.33  0.50 for combination, 1.68  1.02 for sitagliptin, and 1.64  0.81 for spironolactone; P = 0.004).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of this new abdominal rectopexy surgical technique in men. METHODS This was a retrospective multicenter study. Adult male patients who were operated on for external rectal prolapse using ventral rectopexy in five tertiary hospitals in Finland between 2006 and 2014 were included in the study. Patient demographics, detailed operative, postoperative and short-term follow-up data were collected from patient registers in participating hospitals. A questionnaire and informed consent form was sent to all patients. The questionnaire included scores for anal incontinence, obstructed defecation syndrome, urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction. The main outcome measure was the incidence of recurrent rectal prolapse. Surgical morbidity, the need for surgical repair due to recurrent symptoms and functional outcomes were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS A total of 52 adult male patients with symptoms caused by external rectal prolapse underwent ventral rectopexy. The questionnaire response rate was 64.4 %. Baseline clinical characteristics and perioperative results were similar in the responder and non-responder groups. A total of 9 (17.3 %) patients faced complications. There were two (3.8 %) serious surgical complications during the 30-day period after surgery that necessitated reoperation. None of the complications were mesh related. Recurrence of the prolapse was noticed in nine patients (17 %), and postoperative mucosal anal prolapse symptoms persisted in 11 patients (21 %). As a result, the reoperation rate was high. Altogether, 17 patients (33 %) underwent reoperation during the follow-up period due to postoperative complications or recurrent rectal or mucosal prolapse. According to the postoperative questionnaire data, patients under 40 had good functional results in terms of anal continence, defecation, urinary functions and sexual activity. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy is a safe surgical procedure in male patients with external prolapse. However, a high overall reoperation rate was noticed due to recurrent rectal and residual mucosal prolapse.

As the 10th most populated country in the world, Mexico is on a major threat by COVID-19 due to the limitations of intensive care capacities, and a total of about 1.5 hospital beds for every 1000 citizens. In this paper, we projected different scenarios to evaluate sharp or gradual quarantine lifting strategies, however, even in the hypothetical scenario that Mexico would continue with full confinement, hospitals would be reaching the maximum capacity of hospital bed occupancy. Mexican government is planning to relax the strict social distancing regulations on 1 June 2020, however, epidemic rebound risks are latent. Our results suggest that lifting social confinement needs to be gradually sparse while maintaining a decentralized region strategy among the Mexican states. To substantially lower the number of infections, predictions highlight that the elderly should remain in social confinement (approximately 11.3% of the population); the confined working class (roughly 27% of the population) must gradually return in at least four parts in consecutive months; and to the last the return of students to schools (about 21.7%). As the epidemic progresses, de-confinement strategies need to be continuously re-adjusting with the new pandemic data. Assuming the most optimistic scenario by our predictions, the smallest number of new COVID-19 cases, Mexico would require at least a 3 fold increase in hospital capacities dedicated for COVID-19.

METHODS: A retrospective and single-centre study enrolled 98 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 patients. Clinical data, electrocardiogram and CT features were collected and analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. RESULTS: There were 46 males and 52 females, with a median age of 44 years, categorised into three groups, including mild, moderate and severe/critical Covid-19. The rate of abnormal electrocardiograms in severe/critical group (79%) was significantly higher than that in the mild group (17%) (P = .027), which (r = 0.392, P = .005) positively related to the severity of Covid-19 (OR: 5.71, 95% CI: 0.45-3.04, P = .008).

Breastfeeding is unique in its impact on the mother and the baby, their bonding and future health implications impacting the society. Breastmilk is produced specific for the infant by the biological mother. It changes in composition with lactation stage, and leads to optimal growth of the baby including establishing circadian rhythms, getting protective antibodies and establishing a healthy gut microbiome. Multiple hormones influence the composition of the milk. Lactation is maintained by removal of the milk. Blood-milk barrier allows for the specific composition of milk by transporting different sized molecules through different mechanisms. It is safe to assume that most medications will be found in some amount in human milk, however, the impact of that is usually not enough to justify stopping breastfeeding. When mothers milk is not available, formula or donor milk can be considered.

OBJECTIVES It was our aim to compare the frequency of 8 relevant viruses in 109 hospitalized LRTI patients and 144 healthy controls. METHODS Virus infection was determined by seroconversion and ELISA for anti-virus antibodies in repeated serum samples. Bacterial infection was diagnosed in respiratory specimens, blood cultures and urine. RESULTS The LRTI patient cohort consisted of 49 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, 30 patients with acute bronchitis and 30 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with acute exacerbation. Viral infection was detected in 89 (82%) LRTI patients compared with 32 (22%) in healthy controls (relative risk 3.42, 95% confidence interval 2.48-4.72; p < 0.0001). The most frequent viral pathogens were: influenza B (23%), adenovirus (16%) and parainfluenza virus 3 (12%). Importantly, infections with more than 1 virus were detected in 63% (n = 57) of LRTI patients with viral infection, which represents 52% of all LRTI patients. No multiple virus infection was detected in the healthy controls. Patients with community-acquired pneumonia were more often infected with adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus as compared with the other LRTI patients (p = 0.046 and 0.0009, respectively).

This paper focuses on the history of dairy farming in the Tokachi region; more specifically one farm and the shift over a generation to a rotary parlour milking system. It addresses the linkages this mode of production has cultivated amongst humans, dairy cows and industrialized space. The parlour system at Great Hopes Farm allows five workers (aided by three more stall staff) to milk over 1000 cows, fifty at a time, three times a day. The impetus behind moving to parlour technology is that it increases productivity through mechanically enhanced observation and control. However this recent mechanical separation of human and cow during the milking process has led to affectively shared interspecies and inter-human alienation. The technology of the parlour system sets daily rhythms for bovine and human alike, and separates both from a process formerly dependent upon, specialized knowledge, affective empathy, and embodied knowledge.

The purpose of the most studies was to study the effect of COVID-19 on the visual organ indicate that the most common ophthalmological manifestation of this disease is conjunctivitis, which occurs in 3C10 % of cases. Our observations showed that patients with COVID-19, when applying for an appointment with an ophthalmologist after 1C3 months, make complaints about the feeling of dryness, discomfort in the eyes, itching and redness of the eyelids. These complains arose immediately after the illness and persisted during the above terms. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that any inflammatory process occurring on the eye surface disrupts the process of lacrimation and leads to the emergence of dry eye syndrome. It is necessary to pay close attention to complaints from the visual organ not only in patients with COVID-19 in the early stages of the disease, but also in the coming months after stopping the acute pathological process. As studies have shown, coronavirus can involve the posterior segment of the eye in the pathological process, since this virus has a retinotropic effect. This hypothesis can be confirmed by the reports of several authors who studied with optical coherence tomography (OCT) the state of the retina 11C33 days after the onset of symptoms in patients with COVID-19. OCT data indicate the presence of hyperreflexive zones at the level of the ganglion cell layer and the plexiform layer, the severity of these zones being greater in the papillomacular bundle region.

METHODS We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model from a United Kingdom NHS perspective, informed by published analyses of patient-level data. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of THA and TKA in adults with hip or knee osteoarthritis compared with having no arthroplasty surgery during the ten-year time horizon. RESULTS THA and TKA cost < 7,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained at all preoperative scores below the absolute referral thresholds calculated previously (40 for OHS and 41 for OKS). Furthermore, THA cost < 20,000/QALY for patients with OHS of  45, while TKA was cost-effective for patients with OKS of  43, since the small improvements in quality of life outweighed the cost of surgery and any subsequent revisions. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that there is little uncertainty around the conclusions. CONCLUSION If society is willing to pay 20,000 per QALY gained, THA and TKA are cost-effective for nearly all patients who currently undergo surgery, including all patients at and above our calculated absolute referral thresholds.

Inflammation is central to the aetiology of both conditions where variations in immune responses have the potential to mitigate or aggravate disease course. Identifying at risk groups based on immuno-inflammatory signatures is valuable in directing personalised care and developing potential targets for precision therapy. Methods: This study characterised immunophenotypic variation associated with COVID-19 severity in type 2 diabetes. Broad-spectrum immunophenotyping quantified 15 leukocyte populations in peripheral circulation from a cohort of 45 hospitalised COVID-19 patients with and without type 2 diabetes. Results: Morphological anomalies in the monocyte pool, monocytopenia specific to quiescent monocytes, and a decreased frequency of cytotoxic lymphocytes were associated with severe COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes requiring intensive care. An aggravated inflammatory gene expression profile, reminiscent of the type-1 interferon pathway, underlaid the immunophenotype associated with severe disease in T2D. Conclusion: Shifts in T-cell and monocyte dynamics underpin a maladaptive response to SARS-CoV-2. These alterations may impact type-1 interferon signalling which is the likely source of the hyperinflammation that increases voracity of COVID-19. These findings allow the identification of type 2 diabetic patients at risk of severe disease as well as providing evidence that the type-1 interferon pathway may be an actionable therapeutic target for future studies.","output":"Monocyte class switch and hyperinflammation characterise severe COVID-19 in type 2 diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe outbreaks of infectious disease occur throughout the world with some reaching the level of international pandemic: Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the most recent to do so In this paper, a mechanism is set out using Zipfs law to establish the accuracy of international reporting of COVID-19 cases via a determination of whether an individual countrys COVID-19 reporting follows a power-law for confirmed, recovered, and death cases of COVID-19 The probability of Zipfs law (P-values) for COVID-19 confirmed cases show that Uzbekistan has the highest P-value of 0 940, followed by Belize (0 929), and Qatar (0 897) For COVID-19 recovered cases, Iraq had the highest P-value of 0 901, followed by New Zealand (0 888), and Austria (0 884) Furthermore, for COVID-19 death cases, Bosnia and Herzegovina had the highest P-value of 0 874, followed by Lithuania (0 843), and Morocco (0 825) China, where the COVID-19 pandemic began, is a significant outlier in recording P-values lower than 0 1 for the confirmed, recovered, and death cases This raises important questions, not only for China, but also any country whose data exhibits P-values below this threshold The main application of this work is to serve as an early warning for World HealthOrganization (WHO) and other health regulatory bodies to perform more investigations in countries where COVID-19 datasets deviate significantly from Zipfs law To this end, this paper provide a tool for illustrating Zipfs law P-values on a global map in order to convey the geographic distribution of reporting anomalies ? 2021, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications All Rights Reserved","output":"Data-Forensic Determination of the Accuracy of International COVID-19 Reporting: Using Zipfs Law for Pandemic Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has created global challenges that only an effective vaccine, apparently, can lead the citizens of the world back to a sense of normalcy. While safe vaccines were developed, tested and approved at an extraordinary pace, concerns were raised regarding the public's response in accepting the vaccine on the population level. Israel was among the first countries to roll out a massive national campaign for COVID-19 vaccination, positioning Israel as the global lead in vaccine uptake. Priority for vaccination was given to high-risk groups: older and middle-age adults, healthcare workers, senior home residents and caregivers, people with chronic conditions, followed by teachers and soldiers. Contributing to the success of the operation thus far has been a systems approach beyond nationwide accessibility: building public trust through an integrated and familiar health system, a familiar technology (vaccine), transparency regarding vaccine safety information, culturally appropriate messages in digital and offline media, acknowledging diverse health literacy needs, and active participation and role-modeling by political/religious opinion leaders. Vaccine resistance and hesitancy may be encountered as the campaign progresses, and younger groups targeted. Future considerations include perceived benefits offered to people with vaccination and the role of health/digital literacy in preparedness policies.

It can affect multiple body systems and functions. However, the relationship between COVID-19 and male sexual activity did not yet get much consideration. Herein, we report the impact of COVID-19 on sexual function in 3 men who recovered from the disease. Compared with their condition before catching the infection, the men showed, in different degrees, a decline in all aspects of sexual function as assessed by the international index of erectile function. They started to develop premature ejaculation or exacerbate an already existing condition according to the premature ejaculation diagnostic tool scoring. Beck's depression inventory revealed deterioration of the men's moods up to severe depression. The sex-related hormones (testosterone-total and free, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and estradiol) of these men were within normal levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report documenting deleterious changes in mood and several aspects of sexual functioning in males after recovery from the COVID-19 using validated measurement tools. Follow-up and psychological support of the recovered men may help mend their moods and consequently upgrade their sexual functioning.

We identify key steps in this journey and important questions we faced. We explain the decisions we made and discuss the consequences of those decisions, highlighting what worked well and what might have gone better. The CATS Project is creating and validating two concept inventories---conceptual tests of understanding---that can be used to measure the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI) is for students who have recently completed any first course in cybersecurity; the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA) is for students who have recently completed an undergraduate major or track in cybersecurity. Each assessment tool comprises 25 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) of various difficulties that target the same five core concepts, but the CCA assumes greater technical background. Key steps include defining project scope, identifying the core concepts, uncovering student misconceptions, creating scenarios, drafting question stems, developing distractor answer choices, generating educational materials, performing expert reviews, recruiting student subjects, organizing workshops, building community acceptance, forming a team and nurturing collaboration, adopting tools, and obtaining and using funding. Creating effective MCQs is difficult and time-consuming, and cybersecurity presents special challenges. Because cybersecurity issues are often subtle, where the adversarial model and details matter greatly, it is challenging to construct MCQs for which there is exactly one best but non-obvious answer. We hope that our experiences and lessons learned may help others create more effective concept inventories and assessments in STEM.","output":"Experiences and Lessons Learned Creating and Validating Concept Inventories for Cybersecurity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus coronavirus 2 (SARS?COV?2) Many aspects of its pathology and pathogenesis are not well understood Material and Methods: We describe a series of spontaneous air leak cases we found in our coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) positive 1086?patient cohort Results: Two out of six patients eventually required mechanical ventilation and succumbed to COVID?19 We presume that acute lung injury leading to SARS?CoV?2 with associated acute respiratory distress syndrome predisposes patients to this complication Conclusion: This series is presented to highlight the emerging association of COVID?19 with spontaneous air leaks leading to pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and subsequent subcutaneous emphysema even in patients who have never received invasive mechanical ventilation and this may be more likely with the institution of high flow nasal cannula [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Saudi Journal of Anaesthesia is the property of Wolters Kluwer India Pvt Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in patients with COVID?19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. T cells play a key role in the adaptive antiviral immune response by killing infected cells and facilitating the selection of virus-specific antibodies. However, neither the dynamics and cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response nor the diversity of resulting immune memory is well understood. In this study, we use longitudinal high-throughput T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to track changes in the T-cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19. In both donors, we identified CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell clones with transient clonal expansion after infection. We describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones and show preferential occurrence of these motifs in publicly available large dataset of repertoires from COVID-19 patients. We show that in both donors, the majority of infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes. Certain T-cell clones were detected in the memory fraction at the pre-infection time point, suggesting participation of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Longitudinal high-throughput TCR repertoire profiling reveals the dynamics of T-cell memory formation after mild COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA vaccines offer protection against COVID-19.

METHODS: The study population consisted of 18 patients with parasellar tumor. All patients underwent surgery via the EEA in SCOT?. During all procedures, various types of intraoperative information, including electrophysiological monitoring, anatomical orientation with navigation system, intraoperative MRI, and endoscopic images of the operative field, were collected and stored by OPeLiNK?. Furthermore, the intraoperative information was shared with the surgical strategy desk, where a senior neurosurgeon can direct and manage the surgical procedure in real-time.

However, the field of healthcare management has yet to consider the promise of the humanities for illuminating its particular domain.

While preliminary in presentation, these areas are intended to facilitate wider consideration of the humanities in healthcare management and to encourage interdisciplinary dialogue. The paper also identifies actionable approaches that might be derived from such a dialogue, including substantiating critical healthcare management scholarship, collaborating with humanities educators to design novel curricula, proposing alternatives to unduly circumscribed performance targets and competency assessments, creating case studies of formative experiences of practicing healthcare managers, and advancing guidelines for better managing anxiety and its concomitant stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue in healthcare organizations.

Multilinear regression analysis was used in determining the factors affecting oncology nurses information regarding COVID-19. RESULTS: According to the data delivered from 185 oncology nurses, 57.7% of the participants had an undergraduate degree, 74.1% were working in adult oncology units, and 52.4% of them were working as clinical nurses, 48.1% of the nurses received education for COVID-19 (51.9% did not receive) and 70.3% followed and read the COVID-19 Guidelines published by the Ministry of Health (29.7% did not follow guidelines). Using multiple regression analysis, a model based on the relationship between the variables was created. In the model, the descriptive characteristics of the oncology nurses and their experiences of COVID-19 were found to explain 29.1% of their knowledge level for COVID-19. Nurses education level, the presence of a relative diagnosed with COVID-19, and following the COVID-19 guidelines were found to statistically significantly affect the knowledge levels of COVID-19.

SETTING: A total of 130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Centers (CLC), analogous to nursing homes. INTERVENTION: Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: The primary measure is the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among CLC residents. In a pooled analysis of weekly testing and vaccine data, the proportion of positive tests was compared for the unvaccinated, first dose, and second dose. For each CLC, we identified the week in which 50% of CLC residents were vaccinated (index week). The analysis aligned the index week for CLCs and examined the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests at the CLC level before and after. As a reference, we plotted the proportion of positive tests in nursing homes in the same county as the CLC using publicly reported data. RESULTS: Within the pooled VA CLCs, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was delivered to 50% of CLC residents within 1 week of availability and second dose within 5 weeks. Relative to the index week, the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in the vaccinated relative to unvaccinated was significantly lower in Week 4 (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.68). Throughout the study period, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in community nursing homes was higher compared to VA CLC and also declined after vaccine availability. CONCLUSION: The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests significantly declined in VA CLCs 4 weeks after vaccine delivery and continued to decline in vaccinated and unvaccinated residents. The results describe the importance of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and vaccination in VA nursing home residents.","output":"Proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests and vaccination in Veterans Affairs Community Living Centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To present various types of vaccines and viral infections which can induce cross-reactive immunity against COVID-19. In addition, this article discusses the role of herd immunity and convalescent serum therapy in preventing and controlling SARS CoV-2. The study also determined the claims and counterclaims about their protective and therapeutic effects. Method: Non-systematic review was done using different articles done on cross- reactive immunity against COVID- 19 through vaccinations, previous infections, herd immunity and the therapeutic effects of convalescence serum. The search was done on the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct, WHO, Euro-surveillance, CDC databases. Results: Many observational correlational studies reported that BCG decreases the incidence and mortality from COVID-19. Furthermore, homology between the COVID-19 virus and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) viruses was discovered. Few studies suggested the presence of crossimmunity between MMR vaccine and SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, few studies suggested protective effects of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) against SARS-CoV-2;since both viruses are positive-single-strand RNA (+ssRNA). Diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) vaccines, particularly those that include inactivated whole pertussis vaccine, might induce B and T cell cross-reactive immunity against SARS- CoV-2. Other vaccines against Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, and Meningococcal meningitis vaccines are suggested also to induce some immunity against Covid-19. It is hypothesized that infections with other Coronaviruses may cause protection against SARS-CoV-2. However, the studies done on these suggestions were mostly observational that can carry a high chance of inherent biases. There are also claims and counterclaims about the effect of herd immunity and convalescence serum on the prevention and control of Covid-19. So, appropriately designed RCTs are needed to prove or disprove their protective and therapeutic effects. Conclusions: There are claims and counterclaims about the protective effects of different vaccines, previous infections, and herd immunity and regarding the therapeutic effects of convalescence serum. Comparing with other vaccines, BCG was suggested to have the highest cross-reactive epitopes against SARS-Cov-2 virus. MMR, OPV, DPT, Influenza, Pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines are suggested to protect against Covid-19. Previous infection with other Corona viruses, herd immunity and convalescence serum may play roles in the prevention and control of Covid-19. Many large clinical trials are undergoing nowadays and their results are needed to prove or disprove the cross-immunity related to SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of convalescence serum.","output":"COVID-19: Cross Reactive Immunity, Herd Immunity, and Convalescent Serum Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesTo provide data on the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines in people living with HIV (PWH), MVC-COV1901, a recombinant protein vaccine containing S-2P protein adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminium hydroxide, was assessed.

Although numerous studies have utilized wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, the methods used were developed and/or standardized for other pathogens. This study evaluates multiple methods for concentration and recovery of SARS-CoV-2 and seeded human coronavirus OC43 from municipal primary wastewater and/or sludge from the Greater Seattle Area (MarchCJuly 2020). Methods evaluated include the bag-mediated filtration system (BMFS), with and without Vertrel? extraction, skimmed milk flocculation, with and without Vertrel? extraction, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, ultrafiltration, and sludge extraction. Total RNA was extracted from wastewater concentrates and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 with RT-qPCR. Skimmed milk flocculation without Vertrel? extraction performed consistently over time and between treatment plants in Seattle-area wastewater with the lowest average OC43 C(q) value and smallest variability (24.3; 95% CI: 23.8C24.9), most frequent SARS-CoV-2 detection (48.8% of sampling events), and highest average OC43 percent recovery (9.1%; 95% CI: 6.2C11.9%). Skimmed milk flocculation is also beneficial because it is feasible in low-resource settings. While the BMFS had the highest average volume assayed of 11.9 mL (95% CI: 10.7C13.1 mL), the average OC43 percent recovery was low (0.7%; 95% CI: 0.4C1.0%). Ultrafiltration and PEG precipitation had low average OC43 percent recoveries of 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5C1.6%) and 3.2% (95% CI: 1.3C5.1%), respectively. The slopes and efficiency for the SARS-CoV-2 standard curves were not consistent over time, confirming the need to include a standard curve each run rather than using a single curve for multiple plates.

The effect of cholesterol-lowering diets on inflammatory biomarkers is less well known. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a dietary combination (portfolio) of cholesterol-lowering foods vs a statin in reducing C-reactive protein (CRP) as a biomarker of inflammation linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk. METHODS: In all, 34 hyperlipidemic subjects completed three 1-month treatments as outpatients in random order: a very low-saturated fat diet (control); the same diet with 20 mg lovastatin (statin); and a diet high in plant sterols (1.0 g/1000 kcal), soy protein (21.4 g/1000 kcal), viscous fibers (9.8 g/1000 kcal), and almonds (14 g/1000 kcal) (portfolio). Fasting blood samples were obtained at weeks 0, 2, and 4. RESULTS: Using the complete data, no treatment reduced serum CRP. However, when subjects with CRP levels above the 75th percentile for previously reported studies (>3.5 mg/l) were excluded, CRP was reduced similarly on both statin, ?16.36.7% (n=23, P=0.013) and dietary portfolio, ?23.86.9% (n=25, P=0.001) but not the control, 15.313.6% (n=28, P=0.907). The percentage CRP change from baseline on the portfolio treatment (n=25) was greater than the control (n=28, P=0.004) but similar to statin treatment (n=23, P=0.349). Both statin and portfolio treatments were similar in reducing CRP and numerically more effective than control but only the change in portfolio was significant after the Bonferroni adjustment.

This in vitro production appeared relatively specific for MS versus healthy controls, but was likely to be enhanced or activated by infectious triggers such as Herpesviruses (e.g. HSV, EBV). Independent molecular analysis of retroviral RNA associated with RVP revealed two different genetic families of endogenous retroviral elements (HERV): MSRV/HERV-W and RGH/HERV-H. Interestingly, these sequences were detected by mutually exclusive primers in RT - PCR amplifications. Surprisingly, these two HERV families both contain an ancestral proviral copy inserted in chromosome 7q21-22 region at about 1 kb of distance of each other. Another HERV-W proviral sequence is located within a T-cell alpha-delta receptor (TCR) gene in chromosome 14q11.2 region. Interestingly, these two regions correspond to genetic loci previously identified as potentially associated with 'multigenic' susceptibility to MS and TCR alpha chain genetic determinants have been reported to be statistically associated with MS. A plausible role for infectious agents triggering a co-activation of the chromosome 7q HERV tandem (replicative retrovirus and/or other virus and/or intracellular bacteria) and, eventually, other HERV copies, is discussed. The role of particular HERV polymorphism and the production of pathogenic molecules (gliotoxin and superantigen) possibly associated with retroviral expression are also evoked. An integrative concept of pathogenic 'chain-reaction' in MS involving several step-specific pathogenic 'agents' and 'products' somewhat interacting with particular genetic elements would federate most partial data obtained on MS, including retroviral expression.","output":"Particle-associated retroviral RNA and tandem RGH/HERV-W copies on human chromosome 7q: possible components of a 'chain-reaction' triggered by infectious agents in multiple sclerosis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis is an extensive life-threatening illness that occurs due to an abnormal host response which extends through the initial storm of inflammation and oxidative stress and terminates at the late stage of immunosuppression.

To explore patient and clinician opinions and perceptions of the clinical utility of the Rheumatoid Arthritis Foot Disease Activity Index (RADAI-F5), eight RA patients and eight clinicians routinely involved in the management of RA patients participated in one semi-structured remote video-based interview. They provided their perspectives on the barriers and facilitators to clinical implementation of the RADAI-F5.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic CSF leak repair in an actively infected field. METHODS Retrospective chart review of patients with sinonasal CSF leaks that were endoscopically repaired during an acute infection. RESULTS Nine patients were identified. Etiologies of CSF leak were iatrogenic after endoscopic sinus surgery (n = 5, 55.6%) or revision craniopharyngioma resection (n = 1, 11.1%), spontaneous (n = 1, 11.1%), anterior skull base meningocele with CSF leak (n = 1, 11.1%), and posttraumatic (n = 1, 11.1%). The locations of the leaks were ethmoid in five patients, frontoethmoid in three patients, and sphenoid in three patients. Seven patients had acute sinusitis (77.8%) and two patients had meningitis (22.2%) at the time of closure. Two patients (22.2%) had failure of previous CSF leak closure. All leaks were repaired in a multilayered fashion with multiple graft types, including septal or conchal cartilage, temporalis fascia, fascia lata, fat, Medpor, and tissue sealant. Three patients additionally had mucosal flaps or grafts. The patients were treated with an average of 11.1 days (range, 6-14 days) of antibiotics. The average hospital stay was 4.1 days (range, 2-7 days), and the mean follow-up time was 8.7 months (range, 2.9-19.3 months).

In addition to causing serious respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and lung failure, there have been conflicting reports about the presence of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in the semen of patients who were previously diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 and possible implications for the male reproductive tract. OBJECTIVE: The goal for the present study was to review the current status of the literature concerning COVID\\\\19 and male reproduction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic literature search was done by using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Relevant papers, concerning SARS\\\\COV\\\\2 and COVID\\\\19 and male reproduction, published between January 2020 and December 2020 were selected, analyzed and eventually included in the present literature review. RESULTS: SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 may infect any cell type expressing angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), including reproductive cells. Besides the presence of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 receptor, the expression of host proteases, such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), is needed to cleave the viral S protein, allowing permanent fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Here, we aimed to review the current status of the literature concerning COVID\\\\19 and male reproduction. The lack of co\\\\expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the testis suggests that sperm cells may not be at increased risk of viral entry and spread. However, the presence of orchitis in COVID\\\\19\\\\confirmed patients and compromised sex\\\\related hormonal balance among these patients intrigues reproductive medicine. DISCUSSION: SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 may use alternate receptors to enter certain cell types, or the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may not be detected in healthy individuals.

We aimed to explore the value of BACH1 in predicting the overall survival (OS) of early-stage (stages I-II) lung adenocarcinoma. Patients and Methods. Lung adenocarcinoma cases were screened from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to obtain the biological mechanisms of BACH1. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify the difference of biological pathways between high- and low-BACH1 groups. Univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis had been used to screen prognostic factors, which were used to establish the BACH1 expression-based prognostic model in the TCGA dataset. The C-index and time-dependent AUC curve were used to evaluate predictive power of the model. External validation of prognostic value was performed in two independent datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Decision analysis curve was finally used to evaluate clinical usefulness of the BACH1-based model beyond pathologic stage alone. RESULTS: BACH1 was an independent prognostic factor for lung adenocarcinoma. High-expression BACH1 cases had worse OS. BACH1-based prognostic model showed an ideal C-index and t-AUC and validated by two GEO datasets, independently.

This creates batches of arrivals to the underlying queueing system. In this paper, we study the staffing problem for the batch arrival queue. We show that batches place a significant stress on services, and thus require a high amount of resources and preparation. In fact, we find that there is no economy of scale as the number of customers in each batch increases, creating a stark contrast with the square root safety staffing rules enjoyed by systems with solitary arrivals of customers. Furthermore, when customers arrive both quickly and in batches, an economy of scale can exist, but it is weaker than what is typically expected. Methodologically, these staffing results follow from novel large batch and hybrid large-batch-and-large-rate limits of the general multi-server queueing model. In the pure large batch limit, we establish the first formal connection between multi-server queues and storage processes, another family of stochastic processes. By consequence, we show that the limit of the batch scaled queue length process is not asymptotically normal, and that, in fact, the fluid and diffusion-type limits coincide. This is what drives our staffing analysis of the batch arrival queue, and what implies that the (safety) staffing of this system must be directly proportional to the batch size just to achieve a non-degenerate probability of customers waiting.","output":"How to Staff when Customers Arrive in Batches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For years, violence against doctors and healthcare workers has been a growing social issue in China. In a recent series of studies, we provided evidence for a motivated scapegoating account of this violence. Specifically, individuals who feel that the course of their (or their family member's) illness is a threat to their sense of control are more likely to express motivation to aggress against healthcare providers. Drawing on existential theory, we propose that blaming and aggressing against a single individual represents a culturally afforded scapegoating mechanism in China. However, in an era of healthcare crisis (i.e., the global COVID-19 pandemic), it is essential to understand cultural variation in scapegoating in the context of healthcare. We therefore undertook two cross-cultural studies examining how people in the United States and China use different scapegoating responses to re-assert a sense of control during medical uncertainty. One study was conducted prior to the pandemic and allowed us to make an initial validating and exploratory investigation of the constructs of interest. The second study, conducted during the pandemic, was confirmatory and investigated mediation path models. Across the two studies, consistent evidence emerged that, both in response to COVID-related and non-COVID-related illness scenarios, Chinese (relative to U.S.) individuals are more likely to respond by aggressing against an individual doctor, while U.S. (relative to Chinese) individuals are more likely to respond by scapegoating the medical industry/system.

Although centers use strict selection criteria, there is a risk of recurrence, reaching up to 20% which are mostly observed within two years following the procedure.

This poor prognosis is due to the systemic course of the recurrence even its presentation is local initially. RESULTS The clinical management and treatment algorithm of recurrence is challenging and there is no guideline regarding the situation. Staging of the disease and multi-disciplinary approach are important. The decision for choice of treatment is given depending on the localization and spread of the recurrence. Adjusting and switching the immunosuppressive therapy should be the first attempt. When the recurrence is limited or confined to resectable regions, surgery should be the choice of treatment. Multiple recurrence sites such as adrenal glands, lung, lymph nodes are not contraindication for curative surgery. Resection of the graft for intrahepatic recurrence is the most beneficial procedure for survival. If resection is not possible due to advanced hepatic disease, loco-regional therapies such as TACE, RF, microwave ablation should be considered.

Household transmission is thought to contribute significantly to subsequent transmission through the broader community. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless surveillance methods are of particular importance. METHODS: From November 2019 to April 2020, 303 households in the Seattle area were remotely monitored in a prospective longitudinal study for symptoms of respiratory viral illness. Enrolled participants reported weekly symptoms and submitted respiratory samples by mail in the event of an acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for fourteen viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, using RT-PCR. Participants completed all study procedures at home without physical contact with research staff. RESULTS: In total, 1171 unique participants in 303 households were monitored for ARI. Of participating households, 128 (42%) included a child aged <5 years and 202 (67%) included a child aged 5-12 years. Of the 678 swabs collected during the surveillance period, 237 (35%) tested positive for one or more non-influenza respiratory viruses. Rhinovirus, common human coronaviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common. Four cases of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in three households.

Emerging evidence indicates a role for miRNAs in AAA pathogenesis, therefore we aimed to identify miRNAs that differently expressed in exosomes from AAA patients and explore the underlying mechanisms of how miR-106a plays its role in this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from plasma of AAA patients, as well as from the tissue-conditioned culture medium. The exosomal expression profiles of several miRNAs including miR-106a were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. To determine the potential role of miR-106a in the pathogenesis of AAA, miR-106a was overexpressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and then cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by performing CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Afterwards, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to assess the expression levels of some proteins involved in the modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Furthermore, the target gene of miR-106a was predicted and verified through Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: MiR-106a was up-regulated in exosomes from plasma of those patients with AAA as compared with healthy peers. Likely, increased level of miR-106a was observed in exosomes released from AAA tissue in comparison to those from adjacent normal tissues. Enhanced expression of miR-106a in VSMCs suppressed cell viability but promoted cellular apoptosis, whereas inhibition of miR-106a in VSMCs resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to the control group. In addition, the protein levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-12) secreted from VSMCs were significantly up-regulated, while their inhibitor TIMP-2 was down-regulated due to miR-106a overexpression. Finally, TIMP-2 was validated subsequently as the direct target of miR-106a through Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, our results suggest that increased expression of miR-106a promotes VSMC cell apoptosis and down-regulates TIMP-2 through directly targeting its 3'-UTR, which in turn restores MMP production and ultimately accelerates ECM degradation. Therefore miR-106a is proposed to play a crucial role in AAA development and this will provide an update on the understanding of the clinical value of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.","output":"Up-regulation of exosomal miR-106a may play a significant role in abdominal aortic aneurysm by inducing vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and targeting TIMP-2, an inhibitor of metallopeptidases that suppresses extracellular matrix degradation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable deaths and is susceptible to social influence. Yet, we know little about the characteristics of primary care social networks and how they influence tobacco use. OBJECTIVE: To determine what primary care patient social network characteristics are associated with individual smoking behavior. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Two primary care practices in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PA), USA. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 53 primary care patients and 155 of their nominated social ties. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: We examined the association between social network characteristics (degree, communicated weighted social ties, and presence of social reinforcement) and tobacco use history (never smoker, successful quitter, or current smoker). Other covariates included age, race/ethnicity, sex, education, income, and employment status, self-efficacy, depression status, provider-patient relationship. RESULTS: Of those enrolled in our study (n = 208), 101 identified as never smokers, 59 as successfully quitters, and 48 as current smokers. Social reinforcements from connected alter pairs that never-smoked (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.34) was significantly associated with a participant being a never smoker. Participants with stronger ties with successful quitters were significantly more likely to identify as successfully quitting (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.69) and conversely had a negative association with stronger ties to unsuccessful quitters (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.80) or current smokers who had not tried to quit in the last year (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.98). Social reinforcement from connected pairs of alters that were unsuccessful quitters was significantly associated with the participant being a current smoker (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.45). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that smoking behaviors do not occur in isolation, nor because of 1 or 2 prominent social network members. Rather, our findings suggest that both strong ties and social reinforcement from clusters of similarly-behaving persons influence smoking behavior.

Although there are numerous potential mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated AKI, our current knowledge of kidney pathologic findings in COVID-19 is limited. METHODS: We examined the postmortem kidneys from 42 patients who died of COVID-19. We reviewed light microscopy findings in all autopsies and performed immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and in situ hybridization studies for SARS-CoV-2 on a subset of samples. RESULTS: The cohort had a median age of 71.5 years (range, 38-97 years); 69% were men, 57% were Hispanic, and 73% had a history of hypertension. Among patients with available data, AKI developed in 31 of 33 patients (94%), including 6 with AKI stage 1, 9 with stage 2, and 16 with stage 3. The predominant finding correlating with AKI was acute tubular injury. However, the degree of acute tubular injury was often less severe than predicted for the degree of AKI, suggesting a role for hemodynamic factors, such as aggressive fluid management. Background changes of hypertensive arterionephrosclerosis and diabetic glomerulosclerosis were frequent but typically mild. We identified focal kidney fibrin thrombi in 6 of 42 (14%) autopsies. A single Black patient had collapsing FSGS. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were largely unrevealing, and in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2 showed no definitive positivity.

The study assessed the impact of cattle pasturing/riparian zone protection on: pathogen (bacterial, viral, parasite) occurrence, concentrations of fecal indicators, and quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA) of the risk of Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection in humans. Methodologies were developed to compute QMRA mean risks on the basis of water samples exhibiting potentially human infectious Cryptosporidium and E. coli based on genotyping Crytosporidium, and E. coli O157:H7 presence/absence information paired with enumerated E. coli. All Giardia spp. were considered infectious. No significant pasturing treatment effects were observed among pathogens, with the exception of Campylobacter spp. and E. coli O157:H7. Campylobacter spp. prevalence significantly decreased downstream through pasture treatments and E. coli O157:H7 was observed in a few instances in the middle of the unrestricted pasture. Densities of total coliform, fecal coliform, and E. coli reduced significantly downstream in the restricted pasture system, but not in the unrestricted system.

Seasonal and stream flow variables (and their interactions) were relatively more important than pasture treatments for initially stratifying pathogen occurrence and higher fecal indicator bacteria densities. Significant positive associations among fecal indicator bacteria and Campylobacter spp. detection were observed. For QMRA, adjusting for the proportion of Cryptosporidium spp. detected that are infectious for humans reduces downstream risk estimates by roughly one order of magnitude.

Functional analyses have revealed a decrease in the total activation of transgenic thymocytes by anti-CD3 epsilon antibody. By specific intracellular staining of T cells in such mice we have found CD4 colocalizing with a Golgi-specific marker.

a unique challenge Psychiatric patients participate in therapy groups and eat meals together on milieus It is difficult to enforce mask use or self-isolation practices in the setting of psychosis or mania Additionally, neuropsychiatric disorders such as new onset psychosis, delirium, and affective disorders have all been documented following a SARS-CoV2 infection A surveillance study from the UK found that primary psychiatric diagnoses were most common in younger patients and encephalopathy was more common in older adults following a SARS-CoV2 infection A multicenter cohort study looking specifically at older adults found that 226 (28%) of 817 geriatric patients with COVID-19 had delirium at ED presentation Delirium was the sixth most common of all presenting symptoms of COVID-19 Of patients with delirium, 16% had delirium as a primary presenting complaint and 37% had no fever or shortness of breath Our psychiatric hospital has a geriatric psychiatry service, which has generated further challenges during the pandemic The hospital requires COVID-19 testing prior to admission, but false negatives are possible We continue to adapt our procedures to best serve this vulnerable population as we learn more about COVID-19 and atypical presentations We provide a case report of a geriatric psychiatry patient who presented with delirium secondary to COVID-19 and the subsequent consideration in our admission process Methods A case report of a patient who was admitted to the geriatric psychiatry inpatient service and was found to have delirium as a presenting COVID-19 symptom A review of neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 will be presented Results Ms A is an 80-year-old woman with history of major depressive disorder, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hypertension She was originally admitted to the inpatient psychiatry from the ED for suicidal ideation and worsening depression but was found to be inattentive and disoriented She had multiple falls in the several days leading up to admission, but no respiratory symptoms or fever The geriatric psychiatry service determined she was delirious and started medical work up for etiology Her rapid COVID-19 test at an outside facility was negative Her medical work up was remarkable for a leukocytosis of 11 109 per liter, and an acute kidney injury (AKI) with BUN 20 mg/dL and Creatinine 1 31 mg/dL increased acutely from baseline of 0 9 Urinalysis was negative for infection She was transferred to the emergency room for encephalopathy and declining oral intake There, she tested positive for COVID-19 by PCR and was admitted to medicine for delirium of likely multiple etiologies including COVID-19 Her EEG showed generalized slowing and her head CT was negative for hemorrhage or infarction The consult liaison psychiatry service continued to follow Mrs A during her three-week hospitalization, during which she required Olanzapine 2 5 mg as needed for agitation related to her hyperactive delirium Her AKI resolved with intravenous fluids and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents She was discharged into the care of family on psychiatric medications fluoxetine 40 mg and mirtazapine 45 mg after her delirium gradually resolved with supportive care including physical and occupational therapy Conclusions The diverse clinical presentation, often multifactorial etiology and the waxing and waning course of delirium makes it difficult to diagnose in an emergency room setting even for experienced physicians Delirium can present with depressive, cognitive, and psychotic symptoms It is not uncommon for delirious geriatric patients to be admitted to our inpatient unit for agitation, psychosis or depression, as was the case with Ms A Delirium can be a presenting symptom of COVID-19 Given this and our unique circumstances on a psychiatric milieu, we need to take greater consideration when assessing for delirium and other possible neuropsychiatric symptoms of SARS-CoV2 infection prior to admission Grossman et al developed a modified confusion assessment method for the emergency department (mCAM-ED) that requires 3 to 5 minutes to complete the whole instrument However, despite having this and other tools, formal assessment tools for delirium are rarely used in the ED It is important that geriatric patients are triaged to the appropriate level of care so proper medical treatment can be initiated without delay, as prolonged encephalopathy can lead to permanent decline in cognitive function, worse outcomes, and increased

The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) in COVID-19 patients. METHODOLOGY: Data for acute invasive rhinosinusitis was obtained from the Otorhinolaryngology departments at our tertiary hospital at the period from January 2017 to December 2020. Then the risk factors of comorbid diseases and fungal types between post-COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups regarding the incidence of AIFRS are compared. RESULTS: Consequently, the incidence of AIFRS showed a more significant difference (P < 0.05) in post-COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 especially in immunocompromised patients, diabetic, renal, and liver dysfunction patients as well as patients with risk factors of AIFRS. The most common organisms affecting patients with AIFRS are Rhizopus oryzae, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Absidia mucor.

However, this technology may fail during large-scale implementation. As a result, business models can be used to facilitate commercialization of telehealth products and services. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to review different types of business models or frameworks and their components used in the telehealth industry. METHODS: This was a systematic review conducted in 2020. The databases used for searching related articles included Ovid, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Emerald, and ProQuest. Google Scholar was also searched. These databases and Google Scholar were searched until the end of January 2020 and duplicate references were removed. Finally, articles meeting the inclusion criteria were selected and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist was used for appraising the strengths and limitations of each study. Data were extracted using a data extraction form, and the results were synthesized narratively. RESULTS: Initially, 4998 articles were found and after screening, 23 were selected to be included in the study. The results showed that new telehealth business models were presented in 13 studies, and the applications of the existing business models were reported in 10 studies. These studies were related to different types of services, namely, telemonitoring (4 studies), telemedicine (3 studies), mobile health (3 studies), telerehabilitation (3 studies), telehealth (2 studies), assisted living technologies (2 studies), sensor-based systems (2 studies), and mobile teledermoscopy, teleradiology, telecardiology, and teletreatment (1 study related to each area).

The objective of this study was to develop a time-dependent dynamic simulation model to forecast the COVID-19 autumn-winter outbreak in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, and to assess the effect of social distancing on epidemic spread. The model used was the \\"Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered\\" framework which incorporated appropriate compartments relevant to interventions such as quarantine, isolation and treatment. In a low-intervention scenario including only 2-week isolation for international travelers and their contacts, the model estimated a maximum peak of nearly 90 000 symptomatic cases for early May. For an intervention scenario with mandatory quarantine during a 5-month period, the curve of cases flattened and receded as the proportion of quarantined individuals increased. The maximum peak was expected to appear between May 8 and Jul 8 depending on the quarantine strategy, and the average number of infectious symptomatic cases were 46 840, 30 494, 23 164, 16 179, and 13 196 when 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the population remained in a 5-month-term continuous quarantine, respectively. Only mandatory quarantine was able to delay the maximum peak of infection and significantly reduce the total number of infected individuals and deaths at a 150-day term. The interruption of the quarantine before 120 days of its beginning could generate an even more serious outbreak 30 days later, and surpass the scarce medical resources available for the intensive care of critically-ill patients.","output":"Forecasting the effect of social distancing on COVID-19 autumn-winter outbreak in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: After roadway crashes occur, the quick emergency response is essential for minimizing tolls and economic losses. Many studies have analyzed the post-crash emergency medical services response time, but few ones have explored the post-crash police response time. However, the presence of police is the precondition for other agencies to perform their duties safely and smoothly. METHOD: With Pennsylvania crash data from 2008 to 2017, this study gives an assessment of the post-crash police response time in Pennsylvania. RESULTS: First, we demonstrate that police response time is highly correlated to crash consequences: the longer police response time is positively associated with more fatalities at both individual level and county level. Then, for fatal crashes, a negative binomial model with the police agency-level random effects is built to identify the significant factors influencing the police response time. The results indicate that day of week, illumination, weather, area, roadway type, and roadway location could significantly affect the police response time. Police respond much slower to fatal crashes occurring in rural areas, mid-blocks, turnpikes, adverse weather, on weekends, and at nighttime without streetlights. Police response time shows a decreasing trend since 2016 and varies a lot by police agencies. It is found that many police agencies affiliated to the Pennsylvania State Police, which oversees statewide law enforcement on all interstate and state highways, respond slower than other police agencies.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify all published studies comparing influenza vaccination with placebo from the database inception to November 11, 2018. These included studies reporting the associations of influenza vaccination with the risk of aforementioned adverse outcomes. RESULTS: The pooled adjusted relative risks among influenza-vaccinated people relative to unvaccinated people for the outcomes of interest were 0.74 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.70-0.78) for cardiovascular diseases (63 studies), 0.82 (95 % CI = 0.75-0.91) for respiratory diseases (29 studies), and 0.57 (95 % CI = 0.51-0.63) for all-cause mortality (43 studies).

Results: 756 heart failure (HF) patients underwent an EMB procedure to determine the underlying cause of unexplained HF. Low levels of HHV6 DNA, detectable by nested PCR only, were found in 10.4% of the cases (n = 79) of which 62% (n = 49) showed myocardial inflammation. The spontaneous course of patients with EMB-proven HHV6 DNA-associated lymphocytic myocarditis (n = 26) showed significant improvements in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and clinical symptoms, respectively, in 15/26 (60%) patients, 3C12 months after disease onset. EMB mRNA expression of components of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and protein analysis of cardiac remodeling markers, analyzed by real-time PCR and MALDI mass spectrometry, respectively, did not differ between HHV6-positive and -negative patients. In another cohort of patients with ongoing symptoms related to lymphocytic myocarditis associated with cardiac levels of HHV6-DNA copy numbers <500 copies/g cardiac DNA, quantified by real-time PCR, the efficacy and safety of steroid-based immunosuppression for six months was investigated. Steroid-based immunosuppression improved the LVEF (5%) in 8/10 patients and reduced cardiac inflammation in 7/10 patients, without an increase in cardiac HHV6 DNA levels in follow-up EMBs.

Since there are no specific drugs or vaccines, the available tools against COVID-19 are preventive, such as the use of personal protective equipment, social distancing, lockdowns, and mass testing. Such measures are hindered in Brazil due to a restrict budget, low educational level of the population, and misleading attitudes from the federal authorities. Predictions for COVID-19 are of pivotal importance to subsidize and mobilize health authorities' efforts in applying the necessary preventive strategies. The Weibull distribution was used to model the forecast prediction of COVID-19, in four scenarios, based on the curve of daily new deaths as a function of time. The date in which the number of daily new deaths will fall below the rate of 3 deaths per million - the average level in which some countries start to relax the stay-at-home measures - was estimated. If the daily new deaths curve was bending today (i.e., about 1250 deaths per day), the predicted date would be on July 5. Forecast predictions allowed the estimation of overall death toll at the end of the outbreak. Our results suggest that each additional day that lasts to bend the daily new deaths curve may correspond to additional 1685 deaths at the end of COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil (R2 = 0.9890).

The objective of this study was to estimate the number of all-cause excess deaths associated with COVID-19 in Florida and Ohio overall and by sex, age, and race. METHODS We calculated the number of weekly and cumulative excess deaths among adults aged 20 from March 15 through December 5, 2020, in Florida and Ohio as the observed number of deaths less the expected number of deaths, adjusted for population, secular trends, and seasonality. We based our estimates on death certificate data from the previous 10 years. RESULTS The results were based on ratios of observed-to-expected deaths. The ratios were 1.17 (95% prediction interval, 1.14-1.21) in Florida and 1.15 (95% prediction interval, 1.11-1.19) in Ohio. Although the largest number of excess deaths occurred in the oldest age groups, in both states the ratios of observed-to-expected deaths were highest among adults aged 20-49 (1.21; 95% prediction interval, 1.11-1.32). The ratio of observed-to-expected deaths for the Black population was especially elevated in Florida. CONCLUSIONS Although excess deaths were largely concentrated among older cohorts, the high ratios of observed-to-expected deaths among younger age groups indicate widespread effects of COVID-19. The high levels of observed-to-expected deaths among Black adults may reflect in part disparities in infection rates, preexisting conditions, and access to care. The finding of high excess deaths among Black adults deserves further attention.","output":"Excess Mortality Associated With COVID-19 by Demographic Group: Evidence From Florida and Ohio."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, due to its accelerated spread has brought in the need to use assistive tools for faster diagnosis in addition to typical lab swab testing. Chest X-Rays for COVID cases tend to show changes in the lungs such as ground glass opacities and peripheral consolidations which can be detected by deep neural networks. However, traditional convolutional networks use point estimate for predictions, lacking in capture of uncertainty, which makes them less reliable for adoption. There have been several works so far in predicting COVID positive cases with chest X-Rays. However, not much has been explored on quantifying the uncertainty of these predictions, interpreting uncertainty, and decomposing this to model or data uncertainty. To address these needs, we develop a visualization framework to address interpretability of uncertainty and its components, with uncertainty in predictions computed with a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network. This framework aims to understand the contribution of individual features in the Chest-X-Ray images to predictive uncertainty. Providing this as an assistive tool can help the radiologist understand why the model came up with a prediction and whether the regions of interest captured by the model for the specific prediction are of significance in diagnosis. We demonstrate the usefulness of the tool in chest x-ray interpretation through several test cases from a benchmark dataset.","output":"Interpreting Uncertainty in Model Predictions For COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present article we introduce an epidemiological model for the investigation of the spread of epidemics caused by viruses.

In response, most countries in the world implemented lockdowns, restricting their population's movements, work, education, gatherings, and general activities in attempt to \\"flatten the curve\\" of COVID-19 cases. The public health goal of lockdowns was to save the population from COVID-19 cases and deaths, and to prevent overwhelming health care systems with COVID-19 patients. In this narrative review I explain why I changed my mind about supporting lockdowns. The initial modeling predictions induced fear and crowd-effects (i.e., groupthink). Over time, important information emerged relevant to the modeling, including the lower infection fatality rate (median 0.23%), clarification of high-risk groups (specifically, those 70 years of age and older), lower herd immunity thresholds (likely 20-40% population immunity), and the difficult exit strategies. In addition, information emerged on significant collateral damage due to the response to the pandemic, adversely affecting many millions of people with poverty, food insecurity, loneliness, unemployment, school closures, and interrupted healthcare. Raw numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths were difficult to interpret, and may be tempered by information placing the number of COVID-19 deaths in proper context and perspective relative to background rates. Considering this information, a cost-benefit analysis of the response to COVID-19 finds that lockdowns are far more harmful to public health (at least 5-10 times so in terms of wellbeing years) than COVID-19 can be.

The primary outcome, proximal leg deep-vein thrombosis, was diagnosed on compression ultrasonography performed within 2 days after admission, twice weekly, and as clinically indicated. Additional testing for venous thromboembolism was performed as clinically indicated. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of proximal leg deep-vein thrombosis, which occurred in 96 of 1873 patients (5.1%) receiving dalteparin versus 109 of 1873 patients (5.8%) receiving unfractionated heparin (hazard ratio in the dalteparin group, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.23; P=0.57).

We defined contact tracing effectiveness as the proportion of contacts of a positive case that was successfully traced and vaccination rate as the proportion of daily doses administered per population in Malaysia. Sensitivity analyses on the untraced and infectious populations were conducted. The study presented in silico findings on multiple scenarios by varying the contact tracing effectiveness and daily vaccination rates. Results At a vaccination rate of 1.4%, a contact tracing with the effectiveness of 70% could delay the peak of untraced asymptomatic cases by 17 days and reduced the highest number of daily cases by 70% compared with 30% contact tracing effectiveness. A similar trend was observed for symptomatic cases when a similar experiment setting was used. We also performed sensitivity analyses by using different combinations of contact tracing effectiveness and vaccination rates.

The results showed that from 6 hypotheses, there are 5 accepted hypotheses;they are;perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived interactivity have positive and significant effects on the intention to use mobile learning. The mediating variable (satisfaction) is successful to strengthen the influence between perceived ease of use and intention;and perceived usefulness and intention. However, satisfaction is rejected to mediate perceived interactivity and intention to use. Stakeholders should improve students' satisfaction in their learning activities. The limitation of this study was the research results cannot be easely generalized in other contexts. In the future, other researchers can add other factors to examine better technology acceptance.","output":"Understanding Students' Intention to Use Mobile Learning at Universitas Negeri Semarang: An Alternative Learning from Home During Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In August 2009, a group from the AABB (Stramer et al., Transfusion 2009;99:1SC29S, Emerging Infectious Disease Agents and their Potential Threat to Transfusion Safety; http://www.aabb.org/resources/bct/eid/Pages/default.aspx) published a Supplement to Transfusion that reviewed emerging infectious disease (EID) agents that pose a real or theoretical threat to transfusion safety, but for which an existing effective intervention is lacking. The necessary attributes for transfusion transmission were outlined including: presence of the agent in blood during the donor's asymptomatic phase, the agent's survival/persistence in blood during processing/storage, and lastly that the agent must be recognized as responsible for a clinically apparent outcome in at least a proportion of recipients who become infected. Without these attributes, agents are not considered as a transfusion-transmission threat and were excluded. Sixty-eight such agents were identified with enough evidence/likelihood of transfusion transmission (e.g., blood phase) and potential for clinical disease to warrant further consideration. In the Supplement, Fact Sheets (FS) were published providing information on: agent classification; disease agent's importance; clinical syndromes/diseases caused; transmission modes (including vectors/reservoirs); likelihood of transfusion transmission, and if proven to be transfusion-transmitted, information on known cases; the feasibility/predicted success of interventions for donor screening (questioning) and tests available for diagnostics/ adapted for donor screening; and finally, the efficacy, if known, of inactivation methods for plasma-derived products. The Supplement included a separate section on pathogen reduction using published data. Agents were prioritized relative to their scientific/epidemiologic threat and their perceived threat to the community including concerns expressed by the regulators of blood. Agents given the highest priority due to a known transfusion-transmission threat and severe/fatal disease in recipients were the vCJD prion, dengue viruses and the obligate red-cell parasite that causes babesiosis (B. microti and related Babesia). Although the focus of the Supplement was towards the United States and Canada, many of the agents (and the process) are applicable worldwide. NEXT STEPS: Since the publication of the Supplement, six new FSs (yellow fever viruses-including vaccine breakthrough infections, miscellaneous arboviruses, XMRV, human parvoviruses/bocaviruses other than B19, and most recently the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) were added and 14 existing FSs updated (Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Erhlichia, chronic wasting disease-CWD, human prions other than vCJD, vCJD, Coxiella burnetii-the agent of Q fever, dengue viruses, HAV, HEV, Japanese encephalitis-JE complex, tick-borne encephalitis viruses-TBEV, and human parvovirus B19). Also, tables were released outlining pathogen reduction clinical trials/results (published) and availability/commercial routine use of such technologies by country. Of necessity, the list of EID agents is not, and can never be, complete due to the nature of emergence. We recognized that a system of assessing the risk/threat of EIDs for their potential impact on blood safety and availability must include processes for monitoring, identifying, evaluating, estimating severity, assessing risk and developing interventions. Thus, a toolkit containing the necessary tools from EID monitoring (horizon scanning) to validation/effectiveness evaluations of interventions is being developed. The goal is, to develop a systematic approach to risk assessment and intervention development for the impact of emerging infectious upon blood safety intended to educate and provide advise about risks/interventions in a timely/accurate fashion. CONCLUSIONS: The process and final product (toolkit) including methods to monitor EID agent emergence, identification/recognition of a transfusion-transmission threat, methods for quantitative risk assessments, and the appropriate management of such threats should be considered for implementation by all blood systems.","output":"Current perspectives in transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases: emerging and re-emerging infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease is the leading cause of pediatric acquired cardiac disease in many industrialized countries. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of Kawasaki disease in acute stages in Taiwan, by linking the diagnosis code to medication and comparing the differences in epidemiological features with those of previous reports that used the diagnosis code alone. METHODS: We searched the National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2010. For the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) set, all inpatients with a main diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (ICD-9, 446.1) were retrieved. For the ICD-9 + intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) set, Kawasaki disease in acute stages was defined as the disease stages requiring IVIG. The epidemiologic features were calculated and compared by both methods. RESULTS: The incidence rates for children under 5 years ranged from 21.5 to 68.5 per 100,000 person-years (average 49.1) for the ICD-9 + IVIG set and from 48.5 to 82.8 per 100,000 person-years (average 74.9) for the ICD-9 set. Significant discrepancy in peak season estimation occurred in summer. The 5-year recurrence rate was 1.1% for the ICD-9 + IVIG set and 4.5% for the ICD-9 set. The coronary complication rates were around 7.24% (ICD-9 + IVIG) and 6.48% (ICD-9). CONCLUSION: Discrepancies occurred when different case definitions were used in claims data analysis. Previous reports might have overestimated the incidence, recurrence rate, and complication rate in older children. The new method might slightly underestimate them. The true incidence might lie in between.","output":"Epidemiologic features of Kawasaki disease in acute stages in Taiwan, 1997C2010: Effect of different case definitions in claims data analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the associations of perceived social capital and income change since the outbreak with probable depression and preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of 3011 Hong Kong Chinese aged &#8805; 15 years (mean = 44, 55% females) between February 25 and April 29 2020. Respondents reported social capital (perceived interpersonal trust, social harmony, and sense of belonging), income change since the outbreak (loss vs. gain/no change), depressive symptoms, preventive behaviors, and demographics. Controlling for sociodemographics, lack of perceived interpersonal trust was associated with probable depression and avoiding contact with people with respiratory symptoms. Lack of perceived sense of belonging was associated with probable depression and decreased odds of adopting preventive behaviors. Lack of perceived social harmony was associated with probable depression and increased odds of used face masks among respondents with income loss only. Our results suggest that social capital is related to lower risk of depression and to higher chance of used face masks particularly among those experiencing income loss related to COVID-19. Prevention of mental health problems and promotion of effective preventive behaviors could be implemented by focusing on support for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.","output":"Social Capital, Income Loss, and Psychobehavioral Responses amid COVID-19: A Population-Based Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A regimen directly observed treatment-short course is recommended by the World Health Organization as a strategy for controlling tuberculosis (TB).

Studies revealed that epigenetic modifications impact the pathogenesis of some COVID-19 cases, which can be used as therapeutic targets. Objectives: This review articulated the role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis and management of COVID-19. Methods: Relevant articles published between January 2000 and November 2020 were retrieved from reputable academic databases, including PubMed, SpringerLink, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Results: Epigenetic modifications in the COVID-19s pathogen, called the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and hosts cells may influence susceptibility or resistance to the disease. Notably, abnormal Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) methylation and histone modification involving immune regulatory genes and molecules, such as cytokines and interferon-regulated genes may compromise immune function and enhance the hosts susceptibility and disease severity. The hypomethylation of SARS-CoV-2s receptor, called the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), causing its overexpression, can also enhance SARS-CoV-2s infectivity. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can hijack the hosts MicroRNA (miRNA) using its miRNA and compromise the immune function, increasing its infectivity. Fortunately, epigenetic changes are reversible;thus, a therapy that targets the epigenetic changes in the affected case may reverse COVID-19. Conclusion: Modifications in the SARS-CoV-2 or host epigenome promote the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19. Epigenetic changes are reversible, so healthcare providers are advised to formulate therapeutic procedures that target the causal mechanisms in the affected individual.","output":"Involvement of Epigenetics in the Pathogenesis, Testing and Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transition of courses from in-person to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic could have potentially affected overall student performance in lecture-based courses. The objective of this case study was to determine the impact of course format, as well as the effects of student sex, time of year at which the course was taken, and the institution it was taken at on student performance in an undergraduate animal science course. The course used for this study was taught at two institutions (University of Florida; UF and University of Nevada, Reno; UNR) over 7 yr (2014C2017 at UNR and 2018C2021 at UF). Students performance (n = 911) was evaluated using both quizzes and exams from 2014 through the spring semester 2020 and only exams were used for summer and fall semesters of 2020 and the spring and summer semesters of 2021. The final score (out of 100%) for each student was used to evaluate students performance. In addition, students were classified as high-performing students, if they scored 95% and low-performing students, if they scored 70%. The variables evaluated were the effects of semester (spring, summer, or fall), institution (UF or UNR), sex (male or female), number of teaching assistants (TAs; 0C13), and course format (online or in-person). The course was taught in-person at UNR and in-person and online at UF. The spring semester of 2020 was taught in-person until March but was switched to online approximately 9 wk after the semester started and was considered an online semester for this analysis. As the course was only taught online at UF, the variable course format was assessed using UF records only. Data were analyzed using both linear models and logistic regressions. The probability that students were high performing was not affected by sex or institution. Interestingly, both fall semester and the online format had a positive, desirable effect on the probability that students were high performing. The probability that students were low performing was not affected by sex. However, if a student performed poorly in the class, they were more likely to have taken the course at UNR, or at UF with many TAs. Thus, students performance was impacted by changing the course format, as well as institution, the number of TAs, and the semester in which the course was taken.","output":"The effects of course format, sex, semester, and institution on student performance in an undergraduate animal science course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the growing popularity meal kits are undergoing in today's grocery sales market, and also with respect to barriers presented for restaurant dining due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it is essential to obtain more knowledge surrounding those product and service attributes pertaining to consumers and meal kits.

Seventy-two Wistar rats were subjected to excoriation of approximately 2.0 cm(2) on the back by dermabrasion. According to the treatment, 3 groups were established: saline, chlorhexidine digluconate and 0.2% hyaluronic acid for 14 days. Animals were photographed on the 2(nd), 7(th), 10(th) and 14(th) postinjury days, and the index of healing of the abrasions was calculated. Biochemically, myeloperoxidase measurements of skin biopsies in addition to histological studies to assess the crust and epidermal layers were performed. The group treated with hyaluronic acid showed better re-epithelialization from the other groups (p < 0.05) on the 7(th) and 10(th) days.

With several months of backlogs in appointments, there has not only been a reduction in primary samples being taken for human papilloma virus (HPV) testing but there have also been fewer women referred to colposcopy for investigation and treatment of precancerous or cancerous changes as a result. Encouraging uptake for cervical screening was always a priority before the pandemic, but it is even more important now, considering that the fears and barriers to screening that women may have are now exacerbated by COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This article explores the impact of the pandemic on the uptake of cervical screening within NHS Ayrshire & Arran and evaluates potential strategies to improve uptake now and in future such as self-sampling and telemedicine. METHODS: This article presents evidence-based literature and local health board data relating to cervical screening during the pandemic. RESULTS: Human papilloma virus self-sampling carried out by the woman in her home has been shown to improve uptake, especially in non-attenders, whilst maintaining a high sensitivity and, crucially, reducing the need for face-to-face contact.

The COVID-19 pandemic may cause physicians to suffer these effects even to a greater extent. Our objective was to describe the frequency of stress, burnout syndrome, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic, and analyze the associations with different independent outcome measures. METHODS Observational, cross-sectional study conducted 2 months after the lockdown was established in Argentina. Clinical specialists, surgeons, emergency physicians, and those with no direct contact with patients were surveyed using a sociodemographic questionnaire and 3 self-administered inventories: Health Professions Stress Inventory, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS The prevalence of stress was 93.7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 90.33-96.2), burnout syndrome 73.5 % (95 % CI: 68.2-78.4), anxiety 44 % (95 % CI: 38.4-49.8), and depression 21.9 % (95 % CI: 17.3-26.9). No association was observed between the frequency and medical specialty. The frequency of burnout syndrome, anxiety, and depression was significantly higher among residents and physicians working in the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS Residents and emergency physicians working 24-hour shifts showed significantly higher percentages of burnout syndrome, anxiety, and depression compared to staff and head physicians.

Objective: To evaluate the incidence of asymptomatic COVID-19, document the frequency of in-school transmission, and confirm feasibility of widespread asymptomatic screening in schools. Design: Prospective observational study Setting: Single mid-sized suburban school district including 10 schools and a central office. Participants: District staff and students Interventions: Asymptomatic screening PCR for SARS-CoV-2 Measurements: Concurrent with a hybrid model and layered mitigation, weekly pooled testing of staff and secondary students was offered using saliva samples collected at home. Identification of >1 case in a school prompted investigation for possible in-school transmission. Staff and families were surveyed about satisfaction with the screening program. Results: From weeks 1-18, rates of incident COVID-19 in the surrounding community rose steadily. Weekly staff and student screening identified 0-7 asymptomatic cases/week. In week 7, 5 cases were identified among staff who shared an office setting. Enhancements to mitigation strategies were undertaken. The proportion of survey respondents self-reporting comfort with in-person learning before versus after implementation of screening increased. Limitations: Because screening testing was not mandatory, the results from the participating population might not represent the entire school community. Conclusions: In this school district with layered mitigation measures, in-school transmission was rare. The program identified a cluster with in-school staff-to-staff transmission and spurred enhancement of safety strategies.

IBD is a global disease with heavy economic burden. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease which spread rapidly and becomes a pandemic. This pandemic situation affects the management of IBD. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 as the etiology of COVID-19 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) as its receptor. ACE2 is found to be abundant in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the small intestine and colon. This causes the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 and interacts with gastrointestinal diseases including IBD. The diagnosis of IBD in patients with COVID-19 is similar with general population with precautions regarding endoscopic procedure. IBD does not increase the risk for contracting COVID-19 nor worsen the outcome of COVID-19. The first step in managing patients with IBD during pandemic is by implicating strict health protocol. There is still a controversy regarding surgery for IBD during pandemic. Medications for IBD are safe during pandemic except systemic corticosteroids. IBD patients without COVID-19 should continue their medications until the goal of disease remission is achieved. If asymptomatic COVID-19 is present, corticosteroid dose should be lowered, tapered, and stopped if available. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) administration should be postponed for 2 weeks. If COVID-19 manifestations exist, systemic corticosteroid, thiopurine, methotrexate, and anti-TNF should be discontinued. Supporting treatment for COVID-19 can be administered safely.

Elective surgeries were suspended for 8 weeks in Kentucky. Our objective was to determine if telehealth (TH) visits could be sustained as an alternative to in-person visits. METHODS: Deidentified data on TH usage, in-person clinic visits, and inpatient and neurosurgical case volumes from March 2, 2020 to June 26, 2020 were obtained for retrospective analysis. RESULTS: TH use increased soon after the case suspension started and then decreased to little usage. The number of in-person visits were significantly lower during elective case suspension compared with when cases were resumed. Twenty-five percent of all visits during the suspension were conducted using TH. Thirty-nine percent of TH-visit patients were new patients, 11% were preoperative, 10% were postoperative, and 39% were other existing patients. Forty-eight percent of TH visits resulted in a later in-person clinic visit. After the suspension, in-person visits rebounded to 98% of the prepandemic numbers and TH visits were low. CONCLUSIONS: TH visits were challenging due to the need for in-person physical examinations in neurosurgery. TH temporarily accommodated patient needs during the pandemic but could not totally replace in-person visits and was not sustained after 3.5 months of use. Video TH visits worked well for nonurgent issues, such as minor visual examinations.

Very similar effects characterise the relatively less developed but deeply integrated Central and Eastern European periphery, although to a lesser extent. Obviously, the Covid-19 pandemic has induced numerous temporary business decisions, mainly plant closures. Layoffs occurred as well but these were not prevalent. Then, the second wave of the pandemic in early 2021 brought about the global shortage of semiconductor chips, which substantially affected the sector in Europe. Implications & Recommendations: The longer lasting impact of the short-term pandemic-related European automotive business decisions is yet to be explored. Nevertheless, the global shortage of semiconductor chips is already showing signs of influencing the industry over a longer time scale, in Europe as well. Forward-looking, future-oriented, and brave responses to the pandemic can well be the keys for businesses to successfully overcome the negative effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Contribution & Value Added: Our sample of more than 700 items and a four-year-long timespan is in itself a unique collection of business decisions in the European automotive sector. In addition, by processing the inputs through coding, our sample becomes a treasury of potential information. In this article, we conduct an exploration along the events to which the decisions can be related, and along the decision types. We also look at the involvement of Central and Eastern Europe. Obviously, our ongoing primary research was ready to be extended to the firm level analysis of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, immediately upon its outburst.","output":"Covid-19 and transformational megatrends in the European automotive industry: Evidence from business decisions with a Central and Eastern European focus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term home confinement during the ongoing COVID-19 can have negative mental and physical health consequences, which in turn can reduce productivity among those working remotely.

Consistently, neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitors alleviated the neuropathic pain. Previous studies demonstrated that aripiprazole is capable of modulating NO synthesis and also has been reported its modulatory effect on NF-kB activity. METHODS: Aripiprazole was administered daily to the male Wistar rats at the same time with establishing neuropathic model by I.P. injection of vincristine every 2 days, over 2 weeks. Efficacy of aripiprazole in suppressing the development of neuropathy was evaluated by assessing changes in body weight, mechanical threshold, withdrawal latency, sciatic nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), and compound motor action potential (CMAP) characteristics. Expression of nNOS and NF-kB activation were evaluated by western blotting RESULTS: Rats receiving aripiprazole during neuropathy establishment period demonstrated a normal weight gain pattern, a significantly higher mechanical withdrawal threshold, and SNCV compared to vincristine-treated group. Furthermore, the amplitude and area of CMAP were significantly higher in aripiprazole group. Western blotting demonstrated a significantly reduced expression of nNOS and NF-kB activation in dorsal root ganglia of aripiprazole co-treated rats.

Its biosynthesis is severely reduced in mouse models of Huntington's disease. One possible mechanism is a diminished nuclear translocation of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and, consequently, reduced activation of SREBP-controlled genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Here we evaluated the efficacy of a gene therapy based on the unilateral intra-striatal injection of a recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/5 (AAV2/5) targeting astrocytes specifically and carrying the transcriptionally active N-terminal fragment of human SREBP2. Robust hSREBP2 expression in striatal glial cells in R6/2 Huntington's disease mice activated the transcription of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes, restored synaptic transmission, reversed Drd2 transcript levels decline, cleared mutant Huntingtin aggregates and attenuated behavioral deficits. We conclude that glial SREBP2 participates in Huntington's disease brain pathogenesis in vivo and that AAV-based delivery of SREBP2 to astrocytes counteracts key features of the disease.","output":"SREBP2 gene therapy targeting striatal astrocytes ameliorates Huntington's disease phenotypes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of international concern.

Much has been developed on its potential to include groups marginalized by capitalism in new development schemes, but to date there has been no work regarding immigrants? participation specifically. This research aims to fill this gap. Purpose The article investigates the importance of the partnership between institutions in the host country and immigrants to their insertion in the Solidarity Economy Fairs in Florianpolis. It questions to what extent it has furthered income generation, the formation of social identity, and the construction of community ties. Methods and approach The approach is anchored in intervention?research, proposing a socio-analytical intervention (Aguiar & Rocha, 2007). To pursue qualitative research, an online form was distributed to participants at the Immigrant Fair. The form comprised semi-structured interviews, with the possibility of giving free answers. Findings The data analysis reveals the nuances of the life trajectory of recent immigrants in Brazil: people, mostly of Latin American origin, over 30 years of age, seeking economic insertion in another country. For them, the Solidarity Economy has offered a possibility for social and economic insertion in Brazil. The opportunity for marginalized populations to engage with the Solidarity Economy offers an effective tool against systemic competition. The Fair operates as an alternative to the insertion into the capitalist market for outsider groups, enabling new ways to conduct economic life within the capitalist economy. Policy implications Our findings suggest that the Fair has provided immigrants both the means to obtain a weekly (although unstable) financial income and their social integration?it requires interaction with other immigrants, state agents, tourists, and the local community. The social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardized both outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted this secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from long-term care providers in Japan and estimated the probability of client cancellations and service contraction for institutional and home care services adjusted for the service type, area, size, infection occurrence, and staff employment impacts. We then estimated the rate of change in user numbers and revenue related to reduced usage. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of home care providers experienced client cancellations and 42.1% experienced service contraction, both of which were more prevalent in home care than in institutional care (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=11.09 and 1.60). Home-visit (AOR=0.70) and short-term stay (AOR=0.38) services were less likely to experience client cancellations compared with adult day services. Service contraction was less likely in home-visit services (AOR=0.60) but were more likely in short-stay services (AOR=1.49) compared to adult day services. The estimated reductions in user numbers and revenue related to service contraction for adult day services were 9.1% and 7.1%, respectively. Home-visiting services decreased by an estimated 3.4% owing to service contraction.

Lymphopenia is commonly associated with bacteraemia and poor outcome in intensive care unit patients. The objective of this retrospective study was to assess the prevalence of community-acquired infection in a cohort of unselected patients admitted to the ED with undifferentiated symptoms and severe lymphopenia. METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center study conducted over a 1 year-period before the COVID-19 pandemic. Consecutive adult patients admitted to the ED with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 0.5 G/L) were studied. Patients with hematological or oncological diseases, HIV infection, hepato-cellular deficiency, immunosuppression, or patients over 85 years old were excluded. Diagnoses of infection were validated by an independent adjudication committee. The association between various parameters and infection was assessed using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 953 patients admitted to the ED with severe lymphopenia, 245 were studied (148 men; mean age: 63  19 years). Infection was confirmed in 159 patients (65%) (bacterial: 60%, viral: 30%, other: 10%). Only 61 patients (25%) were referred to the ED for a suspected infection. In the univariate analysis, SIRS criteria (OR: 5.39; 95%CI: 3.04C9.70; p < 0.001) and temperature  38.3 C (OR: 10.95; 95%CI: 5.39C22.26; p < 0.001) were strongly associate with infection. In the multivariate analysis, only SIRS criteria (OR: 2.4; 95%CI: 1.48C3.9; p < 0.01) and fever (OR: 3.35; 95%CI: 1.26C8.93; p = 0.016) were independently associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of underlying infection is high in patients admitted to the ED with lymphopenia, irrespective of the reason for admission. Whether lymphopenia could constitute a valuable marker of underlying infection in this clinical setting remains to be confirmed prospectively in larger cohorts.

We hypothesize lung ultrasound can adequately monitor COVID-19 pneumonia in critically ill patients. METHODS: Adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit of two academic hospitals who underwent a 12-zone lung ultrasound and a chest CT examination were included. Baseline characteristics, and outcomes including composite endpoint death or ICU stay > 30 days were recorded. Lung ultrasound and CT images were quantified as a lung ultrasound score involvement index (LUSI) and CT severity involvement index (CTSI). Primary outcome was the correlation, agreement, and concordance between LUSI and CTSI. Secondary outcome was the association of LUSI and CTSI with the composite endpoints. RESULTS: We included 55 ultrasound examinations in 34 patients, which were 88% were male, with a mean age of 63 years and mean P/F ratio of 151. The correlation between LUSI and CTSI was strong (r = 0.795), with an overall 15% bias, and limits of agreement ranging ? 40 to 9.7.

These drugs showed positive results in preliminary scientific research for treatment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Since the studies with CQ and HCQ are initial with small patient populations, it is not yet known whether there are adverse effects from the use of CQ and HCQ for patients infected with the coronavirus. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ used against viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN This is a narrative review of the traditional prescriptions of CQ and HCQ efficacy and adverse effects as well as their employment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SETTING In vitro and clinical studies comparing the antiviral efficacy and adverse effect profile of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19 in adult patients were evaluated. METHODS A systemic search of reviews, including in vitro and clinical trial studies in English focusing on CQ and HCQ effects and adverse effects against COVID-19 in the adult patient population from PubMed was performed. It included studies reporting chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine effects and adverse effects against COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 42 articles published between 2004 and April 2020 were reviewed for therapeutic use of CQ and HCQ. Both these drugs showed a significant in vitro potential against coronavirus. Many studies for clinical use of CQ and HCQ showed that patients presented adverse reactions on high doses. LIMITATIONS Clinical studies have some methodology shortcomings, such as lack of information about the treatment and small number of experimental patients, leading to a misinterpretation of the data. Besides, there are few clinical studies with a limited sample size. Moreover, most of them did not present control groups, and some patients had died during these protocols. DISCUSSION Despite both CQ and HCQ in vitro antiviral evidence, clinically, both drugs, either alone or combined with other medications, may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, leading to cardiac arrest and sudden death. Besides, a lot of uncertainty still remains, such as starting administration period, dose prescribed, length of treatment, patients' condition, concomitant drug use, among others. CONCLUSION From the studies reviewed, it is not possible to state the precise efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ use in the treatment of COVID-19 at any time in the course of the disease.

Semiquantitative scoring is a way of transforming qualitative tissue data into numerical data that allow more robust group comparisons. Semiquantitative scoring has broad uses in preclinical and clinical studies for evaluation of tissue lesions. Reproducibility can be improved by constraining bias through appropriate experimental design, randomization of tissues, effective use of multidisciplinary collaborations, and valid masking procedures. Scoring can be applied to tissue lesions (eg, size, distribution, characteristics) and also to tissues through evaluation of staining distribution and intensity. Semiquantitative scores should be validated to demonstrate relevance to biological data and to demonstrate observer reproducibility. Statistical analysis should make use of appropriate tests to give robust confidence in the results and interpretations.

However, no studies to date have examined the utility and safety of telehealth for oncology patients undergoing systemic treatments. Concerns of the adequacy of virtual patient assessments for oncology patients include the risk and high acuity of illness and complications while on treatment. METHODS We assessed metrics related to clinical efficiency and treatment safety after propensity matching of newly referred patients starting systemic therapy where care was in large part replaced by telehealth between March and May 2020, and 206 newly referred patients from a similar time period in 2019 where all encounters were in-person visits. RESULTS Patient-initiated telephone encounters that capture care or effort outside of visits, time to staging imaging, and time to therapy initiation were not significantly different between cohorts. Similarly, 3 month all-cause or cancer-specific emergency department presentations and hospitalizations, and treatment delays were not significantly different between cohorts. There were substantial savings in travel time with virtual care, with an average of 211.4 minutes saved per patient over a 3-month interval. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that replacement of in-person care with virtual care in oncology does not lead to worse efficiency or outcomes.

Telehealth and telemedicine services, especially, fulfilled their promise by allowing patients to receive advice and care at a distance, making it safer for all concerned. Over the preceding years, professional societies, governments, and scholars examined ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) related to telemedicine and telehealth. Primary concerns evident from reviewing this literature have been quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. OBJECTIVES: To identify and summarize ethical, legal, and social issues related to information technology in healthcare, as exemplified by telehealth and telemedicine. To expand on prior analyses and address gaps illuminated by the COVID-19 experience. To propose future research directions. METHODS: Literature was identified through searches, forward and backward citation chaining, and the author's knowledge of scholars and works in the area. EU and professional organizations' guidelines, and nineteen scholarly papers were examined and categories created to identify ethical, legal, and social issues they addressed. A synthesis matrix was developed to categorize issues addressed by each source. RESULTS: A synthesis matrix was developed and issues categorized as: quality of care, consent and autonomy, access to care and technology, legal and regulatory, clinician responsibilities, patient responsibilities, changed relationships, commercialization, policy, information needs, and evaluation, with subcategories that fleshed out each category. The literature primarily addressed quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. Other identified considerations were little discussed. These and newer concerns include: usability, tailoring services to each patient, curriculum and training, implementation, commercialization, and licensing and liability. The need for interoperability, data availability, cybersecurity, and informatics infrastructure also is more apparent. These issues are applicable to other information technologies in healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and organizations need updated guidelines for ethical use of telemedicine and telehealth care, and decision- and policy-makers need evidence to inform decisions. The variety of newly implemented telemedicine services is an on-going natural experiment presenting an unparalleled opportunity to develop an evidence-based way forward. The paper recommends evaluation using an applied ethics, context-sensitive approach that explores interactions among multiple factors and considerations. It suggests evaluation questions to investigate ethical, social, and legal issues through multi-method, sociotechnical, interpretive and ethnographic, and interactionist evaluation approaches.

According to Timothy's law, \\"if a patient is suffering from a Biologically Based Mental Illness, or is a Child with Serious Emotional Disturbances, the Inpatient mental health benefit will be the same as for any other illness\\". An assessment of its impact on inpatient mental health care is lacking. We provide a rigorous study of this policy interventions effect over the first year of its implementation. METHODS: We used a quasi-experimental design to combine the difference-in-difference method and propensity score weighting. Data are from inpatient records in NY and California (CA) (as a control) between January 2006 to December 2006 (the pre-enactment year in NY) and January to December 2007 (the enactment year) for non-Medicare/Medicaid patients hospitalized in both years with specific illnesses covered by Timothy's Law. Change in length of stay from 2006 to 2007 was measured for each patient, and the differences observed in NY and California were compared to each other (Difference-in-Difference), with differences in the characteristics of patients in NY and California addressed through Propensity Score Weighting (PSW). RESULTS: Before Timothy's Law was enacted (2006), length of stay (LOS) in NY was 16.3 days on average, and length of stay per hospitalization (LOSPH) was 11.72 days on average for the 1237 patients under study in 2006. In 2007, LOS increased by 4.91 days in NY (95% CI (2.89, 7.01)) compared with similar patients in California, and LOSPH by 3.25 days (95% CI (1.96, 4.57)).

METHODS: This was a single-center health service evaluation. We began testing for COVID-19 on 3 March and introduced a modified COVID Stroke Thrombectomy Pathway on 18 March. We analyzed the clinical, procedural and outcome data for 61 consecutive stroke thrombectomy patients between 1 January and 30 April. We compared the data for January and February (pre-COVID, n = 33) versus March and April (during COVID, n = 28). RESULTS: Patient demographics were similar between the 2 groups (mean age 71  12.8 years, 39% female). During the COVID-19 pandemic, (a) total stroke admissions fell by 17% but the thrombectomy rate was maintained at 20% of ischemic strokes; (b) successful recanalization rate was maintained at 81% (c) early neurological outcomes (neurological improvement following thrombectomy and inpatient mortality) were not significantly different; (d) use of general anesthesia fell significantly from 85 to 32% as intended; and (e) time intervals from onset to arrival, groin puncture, and recanalization were not significantly different, whereas internal delays for external referrals significantly improved for door-to-groin puncture (48 [interquartile range (IQR) 39C57] vs. 33 [IQR 27C44] minutes, p = 0.013) and door-to-recanalization (82.5 [IQR 61C110] vs. 60 [IQR 55C70] minutes, p = 0.018).

Most of the literature developed in this context has focused the demand side. Therefore, the investigation intended to fill this gap, considering the perspective of the supply side, taking into account a vision of sustainable development. To meet this gap, the main objective is to contribute to the characterization of Outdoor Tourism (OT) in the North of Portugal, and understand the potential of OT in the perspective of supply., thirty-eight tourist entertainment companies (TEC) were interviewed to assess supply and perceived customers' motivations. Of the seven Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes (NUTS), the Northern region was considered to be an area with enormous potential for Nature-related tourist). For the supply side, seasonality and climate were identified as important factors supporting environment preservation. Radical experiences, adventure and getting out of the routine were identified as motivating demand factors, as well as the contact with Nature and the landscape. We have also observed that if we consider the stimulation of the local economy by OT, there is still a lot to do. The evidence pointed to some social imbalance, namely related to employability. Employees were hired according to the evolution of demand, which favours unemployment and social instability. Also, the tourists/costumers are the main channels of communication of the activities;the word-ofmouth (WOM) of costumers' experiences, personally or through online social media, takes on a prominent role. In this sense, tourists' online reviews, testimonies and word-of-mouth can be optimized through social networks and digital marketing. Finally, to evaluate the region's potential for the OT, the interviewees suggested integrating the players involved with the OT into a single network, supporting the activities and promoting the region.","output":"Supply-side Perspectives on Outdoor Tourism in the North of Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was firstly reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and soon after, the number of cases increased rapidly worldwide. As of May 2, 2020, more than 3,000,000 confirmed cases have been reported world. In Macao, there were 45 confirmed COVID-19 cases until May 2, 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we summarized the radiological features of these cases and analyzed relationship between the clinical characteristics and radiological findings. We retrospectively analyzed the imaging manifestations of the 45 cases with COVID-19 in Macao, focusing on identifying and characterizing the most common radiological findings of COVID-19. We retrospectively analyze the relationship between the clinical features and radiological finding of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: This study showed that chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 were multiple ground-glass densities in both lungs. It is dominated by bilateral peripheral subpleural distribution, which may be accompanied by consolidation, interlobular septa thickening, and adjacent pleura thickening. As the disease progresses, it can manifest as consolidation of the lungs in CT scan. We also found the age, smoking and hypertension may be risk factor for predicting the severity of COVID-19 in radiology. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 should be diagnosed based on the clinical feature, nCoV PCR test and radiological manifestation. The main manifestation of COVID-19 is peripheral ground glass opacity. Age, smoking and hypertension may be used to predict the severity of COVID-19.

It is critical to be aware of and timely recognize neurological and neuroradiological manifestations affecting patients with COVID-19, to minimize morbidity and mortality of affected patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to our Level 1 trauma and stroke center during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in New York from March 1st to May 30, 2020, with a positive test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented mainly with neurological findings and had acute radiological brain changes on Computed Tomography (CT) scan. Patients with known chronic neurological disease processes were excluded from the study. We obtained and reviewed demographics, complete blood count, metabolic panel, D-dimer, inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), imaging, and patient's hospital course. We reviewed the current literature on neuroimaging, pathophysiology, and their clinical correlations on COVID-19. This case series study was approved by our institutional review board. Result: A total of 16 patients were selected for our case series. The most common neuroimaging features on CT, were territorial to multifocal ischemic infarcts, followed by a combination of ischemia and acute white matter encephalopathic changes, followed by temporal lobe predominant focal or more generalized encephalopathy with both confluent and non-confluent patterns, isolated cortical or more extensive intracranial hemorrhages and some combination of ischemia or hemorrhage and white matter changes. All our patients had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), most of them had elevated inflammatory markers, and D dimer. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection is a multi-organ disease, which can manifest as rapidly progressive neurological disease beyond the more common pulmonary presentation. Early recognition of various neurological findings and neuroimaging patterns in these patients will enable timely diagnosis and rapid treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Our retrospective study is limited due to small non-representative sample size, strict selection criteria likely underestimating the true extent of neurological manifestations of COVID-19, mono-modality imaging technique limited to predominantly CT scans and lack of CSF analysis in all except one patient. Multi-institutional, multi-modality, largescale studies are needed with radio-pathological correlation to better understand the complete spectrum of neurologic presentations in COVID-19 patients and study the causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and CNS disease process.","output":"Spectrum of Neurologic & Neuroimaging manifestation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantification of the bone healing processes by X-ray-based methods becomes inaccurate in the presence of radiopaque synthetic materials.

The lack of unified guidelines on what constitutes elective surgery left plastic surgeons without a clear framework to guide their practices. More urgently, the ambiguity in defining elective surgery leaves plastic surgeons without clear guidance as states begin to phase in these procedures. Methods: Recommendations issued by state governing bodies as of April 28, 2020, were reviewed. National society and federal guidelines pertaining to postponement and resumption of elective surgeries affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak were also reviewed. Recommendations based on the above are collated for plastic surgeons. Results: Thirty-six states and the District of Columbia provide recommendations regarding elective surgery. Cosmetic surgery is considered an elective surgery and should be postponed; this may be among the first elective surgeries to safely resume. Societal guidelines provide disease-specific recommendations for cancer-related surgery and breast reconstruction. Trauma, other cancer-related reconstruction, and hand surgeries are considered nonelective if postponement threatens life or limb or if a patient is highly symptomatic. Postponement and resumption of oncology, trauma, and hand surgery cases depend on disease stage and complexity of reconstruction. Pediatric craniofacial surgery presents unique challenges due to the time-sensitive nature of the interventions. Conclusions: Guidance on elective surgery is vague for plastic surgeons.

However, the psychological behaviors associated with this hesitancy are still not completely understood. This study assessed the psychological antecedents associated with COVID-19 vaccination in the Arab population. METHODOLOGY: The validated Arabic version of the 5C questionnaire was distributed online across various social media platforms in Arabic-speaking countries. The questionnaire had three sections, namely, socio-demographics, COVID-19 related infection and vaccination, and the 5C scale of vaccine psychological antecedents of confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility. RESULTS: In total, 4,474 participants with a mean age of 32.48  10.76 from 13 Arab countries made up the final sample, 40.8% of whom were male. Around 26.7% of the participants were found to be confident about the COVID-19 vaccination, 10.7% indicated complacency, 96.5% indicated they had no constraints, 48.8% had a preference for calculation and 40.4% indicated they had collective responsibility. The 5C antecedents varied across the studied countries with the confidence and collective responsibility being the highest in the United Arab Emirates (59.0% and 58.0%, respectively), complacency and constraints in Morocco (21.0% and 7.0%, respectively) and calculation in Sudan (60.0%). The regression analyses revealed that sex, age, educational degrees, being a health care professional, history of COVID-19 infection and having a relative infected or died from COVID-19 significantly predicted the 5C psychological antecedents by different degrees.

Prior to the introduction of ERAS Pathway, 28 of our patients who had DIEP between November 2018 and May 2019 had an mean LoS of 7.1 days (median 6 days, range 5-21 days); whereas 27 patients who experienced the ERAS Pathway between May and December 2019 had an mean LoS of 4.8 days (median 5 days, range 3-7 days). The cost of inpatient stay in a normal ward at our hospital is approximately 232 per patient per day.

Here, we develop novel MRI-based approaches to monitor virus-specific CD8+ T cells and their relationship to cerebrovascular pathology in the living brain.

Using T2*-weighted high-resolution MRI, we identified small cerebral microbleeds as the earliest form of pathology associated with viral entry into the brain. Mechanistically, these microbleeds occurred in the absence of peripheral immune cells and were associated with infection of vascular endothelial cells. We monitored the adaptive response to this infection by developing methods to iron label and track individual virus specific CD8+ T cells by MRI. Transferred antiviral T cells were detected in the brain within a day of infection and were able to reduce cerebral microbleeds.

It is a heterogeneous disorder that affects patients with dominant nociceptive, neuropathic, and central sensitization pain. An important pathophysiology of low back pain involves pain sensitization. Various nonoperative interventions are available for treatment, but there is inconclusive evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions for pain sensitization, leading to arbitrary nonoperative treatments for low back pain. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness and safety of nonoperative treatment for pain sensitization in patients with low back pain. The primary outcomes will be static quantitative sensory testing, dynamic quantitative sensory testing, and pain algometry. The secondary outcome will be adverse events. We will search the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Cochrane Library databases. Two independent authors will screen the titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract data, assess the risk of bias, and evaluate the quality of evidence. We will qualitatively and quantitatively synthesize the results using a random effects model for meta-analysis. DISCUSSION This systematic review aims to provide evidence regarding which treatment, if any, provides the greatest benefit for pain sensitization and safety among patients with low back pain. Evidence synthesized from this systematic review will inform clinical practice and further research. Since there is still a small amount of research, additional studies might need to be conducted in the future.

The resulting reduction in demand for imaging services had an abrupt and substantial impact on private radiology practices, which are heavily dependent on examination volumes for practice revenues. The goal of this article is to describe the specific experiences of radiologists working in various types of private radiology practices during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, the authors describe factors determining the impact of the pandemic on private practices, the challenges these practices have faced, the cost levers leaders adjusted, and the government subsidies sought. In addition, the authors describe adjustments practices are making to their mid- and long-term strategic plans to pivot for long-term success while managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Private practices have crafted tiered strategies to respond to the impact of the pandemic by pulling various cost levers to adjust service availability, staffing, compensation, benefits, time off, and expense reductions. In addition, they have sought additional revenues, within the boundaries of their practice, to mitigate ongoing financial losses. The longer-term impact of the pandemic will alter existing practices, making some of them more likely than others to succeed in the years ahead.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with admission to intensive care units (ICUs) and mortality in patients with COVID-19 from 4 clinics in Colombia. METHODS: This was a follow-up study of a cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March and August 2020. Sociodemographic, clinical (Charlson comorbidity index and NEWS 2 score) and pharmacological variables were identified. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with the risk of admission to the ICU and death (p<0.05). RESULTS: A total of 780 patients were analyzed, with a median age of 57.0 years; 61.2% were male. On admission, 54.9% were classified as severely ill, 65.3% were diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 32.4% were admitted to the ICU, and 26.0% died. The factors associated with a greater likelihood of ICU admission were severe pneumonia (OR: 9.86; 95%CI:5.99C16.23), each 1-point increase in the NEWS 2 score (OR:1.09; 95%CI:1.002C1.19), history of ischemic heart disease (OR:3.24; 95%CI:1.16C9.00), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR:2.07; 95%CI:1.09C3.90). The risk of dying increased in those older than 65 years (OR:3.08; 95%CI:1.66C5.71), in patients with acute renal failure (OR:6.96; 95%CI:4.41C11.78), admitted to the ICU (OR:6.31; 95%CI:3.63C10.95), and for each 1-point increase in the Charlson comorbidity index (OR:1.16; 95%CI:1.002C1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Factors related to increasing the probability of requiring ICU care or dying in patients with COVID-19 were identified, facilitating the development of anticipatory intervention measures that favor comprehensive care and improve patient prognosis.","output":"Factors associated with admission to the intensive care unit and mortality in patients with COVID-19, Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past few months, health systems worldwide have been put to the test with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from two stroke registries of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with IVT. We assessed the baseline magnetic resonance (MR) visible cSVD markers and total cSVD score (ranging from 0 to 4) between patients with and without ICH after IVT. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of total cSVD score with the risk of ICH after IVT, adjusted for cofounders selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We additionally performed an E-value analysis to fully explain away a specific exposure-outcome association. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to quantify the predictive potential of the total cSVD score for any ICH after IVT. RESULTS: Among 271 eligible patients, 55 (20.3%) patients experienced any ICH, 16 (5.9%) patients experienced a symptomatic ICH (sICH), and 5 (1.85%) patients had remote intracranial parenchymal hemorrhage (rPH). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of any ICH increased with increasing cSVD score [per unit increase, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.03, 95% CI 1.22C3.41, P = 0.007]. Sensitivity analyses using E-value revealed that it would need moderately robust unobserved confounding to render the exposure-outcome (cSVD-any ICH) association null. ROC analysis showed that compared with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score alone, a combination of cSVD and NIHSS score had a larger area under the curve for any ICH (0.811, 95% CI 0.756C0.866 vs. 0.784, 95% CI 0.723C0.846, P = 0.0004).

These genetic changes can accumulate in the descendants as a result of natural selection. Using phylogeny and genome comparisons, evolutionary paths can be somehow retraced, with recent events being much easier to detect than older ones. For this reason, multiple tools are available to study the evolutionary events within genomes of single species, such as gene composition alterations, or subtler mutations such as SNPs. However, these tools are generally designed to compare similar genomes and require advanced skills in bioinformatics. We present CAPRIB, a unique tool developed in Java that allows to determine the amino acid changes, at the genus level, that correlate with phenotypic differences between two groups of organisms. RESULTS: CAPRIB has a user-friendly graphical interface and uses databases in SQL, making it easy to compare several genomes without the need for programming or thorough knowledge in bioinformatics. This intuitive software narrows down a list of amino acid changes that are concomitant with a given phenotypic divergence at the genus scale. Each permutation found by our software is associated with two already described statistical values that indicate its potential impact on the protein's function, helping the user decide which promising candidates to further investigate. We show that CAPRIB is able to detect already known mutations and uncovers many more, and that this tool can be used to question molecular phylogeny. Finally, we exemplify the utility of CAPRIB by pinpointing amino acid changes that coincided with the emergence of slow-growing mycobacteria from their fast-growing counterparts. The software is freely available at https://github.com/BactSymEvol/Caprib . CONCLUSIONS: CAPRIB is a new bioinformatics software aiming to make genus-scale comparisons accessible to all. With its intuitive graphical interface, this tool identifies key amino acid changes concomitant with a phenotypic divergence.

This control system adjusted material flow and build speed to mitigate three types of defects: low layer times, underfill, and overfill. Several test objects were constructed. The control system was found to adjust build parameters to handle low layer times of approximately 15 seconds and height deviations from -100% underfill (the absence of a layer) to 50% overfill.

Respondents report widespread concern across all areas of remote socialization, including a lower ability to learn about firm expectations and a lower ability to form the coworker bonds necessary to work in teams and develop organizational commitment. Responses from auditors (compared to tax professionals) suggest that remote socialization is particularly challenging within the auditing profession, with new auditors less able to develop appropriate client communication skills and appropriate client relationships. Auditors also fear that future audit quality could be compromised by newcomers who will lack the skills to be good seniors (due to the shortcomings of their remote socialization).

Design/methodology/approach The study uses a wavelet coherence framework on four major ESG stock indices from global and emerging stock markets, and two proxies of COVID-19 fear over the period from 5 February 2020 to 18 March 2021. Findings The results of the study show a positive co-movement of the global COVID-19 fear index (GFI) with ESG stock indices on the frequency band of 32 to 64 days, which confirms hedging and safe-haven properties of ESG stocks using the health fear proxy of COVID-19. However, the relationship between all indices and GFI is mixed and inconclusive on a frequency of 0-8 days. Further, the findings do not support the safe-haven characteristics of ESG indices using the market fear proxy (IDEMV index) of COVID-19. The robustness analysis using the CBOE VIX as a proxy of market fear supports that ESG indices do not possess safe-haven properties. The results of the study conclude that the safe-haven properties of ESG indices during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is contingent upon the proxy of COVID-19 fear.

Here, we tested whether the alarmin interleukin 33 (IL-33), which is secreted following inflammation or cell damage, could activate human MAIT cells. We found that MAIT cells stimulated with IL-33 produced high levels of IFN, TNF and Granzyme B (GrzB). The action of IL-33 required IL-12 but was independent of T cell receptor (TCR) cross-linking. MAIT cells expressed the IL-33 receptor ST2 (suppression of tumorigenicity 2) and upregulated Tbet (T-box expressed in T cells) in response to IL-12 or IL-33. Electronically sorted MAIT cells also upregulated the expression of CCL3 (Chemokine C-C motif ligand 3), CD40L (CD40 Ligand), CSF-1 (Colony Stimulating Factor 1), LTA (Lymphotoxin-alpha) and IL-2RA (IL-2 receptor alpha chain) mRNAs in response to IL-33 plus IL-12.

With this view, a study was conducted to develop comprehensive and replicable model for health promotion in schools. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework recognized by the World Health Organization as an implementational framework was used in an implementation study in a school of urban Jodhpur to assess the challenges and gaps associated with health promotion interventions in the school. Baseline regarding knowledge application and practices was gathered using interviews with school staff, parents, and group interaction with students. Knowledge synthesis was done by a thorough search of available literature and the gathered baseline. Resource mapping was carried out using checklists developed from knowledge synthesis. Tailor-made tools were constructed for knowledge implementation for each component of the action cycle. Knowledge of facts related to health behaviors among students was evaluated using pre- and postquestionnaires and practical application of knowledge was assessed using a checklist of 28 indicators on a 5-point Likert scale. Values of tests were gathered and compared with test values 3 and 6 months after the implementation of tailored interventions using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Increase in correct answers by students (42% to 96%) and average response for indicators on the Likert scale (3.23-4.86) was seen on repeated interventions over 6 months. Tobacco consumption by school staff reduced by 20% and an increase in willingness among teachers was observed on follow-up interviews.

This caused huge disruption to care provision and family carers were relied upon to assume this care at home. Many family carers, including those in employment, found themselves navigating additional care responsibilities without 'usual levels' of support from family, friends, work, school, day care services, homecare and community services. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family carers, their employment and care-giving responsibilities, through the lens of the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory (Hobfoll, 1989). Adopting a qualitative research approach, 16 family carers (14 females, 2 males) who were in employment prior to the onset of or during the pandemic, participated in an in-depth, semi-structured telephone or online video interview between June and September 2020. Interviews lasted between 45 and 100 min, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis of the interview data identified four main themes: colliding worlds; navigating unchartered waters alone; opportunity despite adversity and the relentless unknowing. Findings indicate that the onset of the pandemic resulted in the sudden loss of valued resources, which disrupted routines and caused care and work life domains to become intrinsically intertwined. Consistent with the main principles of the COR theory, adapting and transitioning to different ways of working and caring with depleted resources and supports, generated considerable stress for family carers and impacted their well-being. The implications for employers, healthcare providers, policy makers and other key stakeholders are considered, to enable family carers to successfully reconcile work with care and protect their well-being, as the pandemic continues to unfold and in the event of future societal crises.","output":"Colliding worlds: Family carers' experiences of balancing work and care in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 11, 2020, the novel Corona virus disease (COVID-19), was described as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Globally, the COVID-19 has not only affected the public health socially but also has rigorously affected economically. Substantial declines in income, increase in unemployment, and distractions in the transportation, amenities, and industrial sectors are amongst the major concerns of the pandemic disease extenuation. Furthermore, the governments of most of the countries underestimated the menaces of COVID-19 spread and were typically responsive for the calamities in their respective countries. As outbreak of this pandemic is not likely to wane in the nearby future, preventive actions are prerequisite to prevent infection spread, save people lives and also to save the economic affluence. In this review, based on the present knowledge and available literature, we have demonstrated the various aspects of pre-and post-COVID-19 effects over the social and economic phases worldwide. Moreover, the evidence based data have been summarized regarding threats, social influences, scientific upgrades, moral dynamics, stress and adapting in the pre- and post- COVID-19 situations.","output":"Global Impacts of Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Pandemic: Focus on Socio-Economic Consequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) status of patients with initial sudden olfactory anosmia (ISOA) through nasopharyngeal swabs for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and to explore their olfactory dysfunctions with psychophysical olfactory evaluation. METHODS A total of 78 ISOA patients were recruited from April 6, 2020, to April 10, 2020, through a public call of University of Mons (Mons, Belgium). Patients benefited from nasopharyngeal swabs and fulfilled the patient-reported outcome questionnaire. Among them, 46 patients performed psychophysical olfactory evaluation using olfactory identification testing. Based on the duration of the ISOA, 2 groups of patients were compared: patients with olfactory dysfunction duration 12 days (group 1) and those with duration >12 days (group 2). RESULTS In group 1, 42 patients (87.5%) had a positive viral load determined by RT-PCR and 6 patients (12.5%) were negative. In group 2, 7 patients (23%) had a positive viral load and 23 patients (77%) were negative. The psychophysical olfactory evaluation reported that anosmia and hyposmia occurred in 24 (52%) and 11 (24%) patients, respectively. Eleven patients were normosmic. The viral load was significantly higher in patients of group 1 compared with those of group 2.

As the first wave of infection curves flattened and the outbreak appeared controlled, most countries started to reopen their economies albeit using diverse strategies. This paper introduces a novel daily database of sectoral reopening measures in Europe during the first-wave and documents that country plans differed significantly in terms of timing, pace, and sequencing of sectoral reopening measures. We then show that reopenings led to a recovery in mobility-a proxy for economic activity-but at the cost of somewhat higher infections. However, the experience with reopening reveals some original dimensions of this trade-off. First, the increase in COVID-19 infections after reopening appears less severe in fatality rates. Second, a given reopening step is associated with a worse reinfection outcome in countries that started reopening earlier on the infection curve or that opened all sectors at a fast pace in a relatively short time. Finally, while opening measures tend to have an amplification effect on subsequent cases when a large fraction of the economy is already open, this effect appears heterogenous across sectors.","output":"Exiting from Lockdowns: Early Evidence from Reopenings in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness threatens public mental wellbeing during COVID-19.

This recommended two-meters distance is mainly based on short-distance contagion, when infected drops are expelled during a speech, coughing, or sneezing and directly hit another person. The dangerous form of airway contamination caused by droplets that remain suspended in the air for several hours has been almost ignored. However, the theoretical calculations performed in this work, recent experiments, and the accumulated knowledge in this and other epidemics indicate that, because of the airborne transmission, there is no safe distance to the coronavirus, either indoors or in open places. Recent investigations have confirmed not only the presence of the coronavirus in droplets suspended in the air but that these viruses remain active for several hours. Furthermore, significant indirect evidence of this means of transmission is the great difference in contagion between Brazilian regions in the current outbreak. While the Amazonian states have a contamination rate greater than 20%, in the southern states of the country this rate is less than 1%, despite high temperatures in the Northern region. Notwithstanding the social and economic differences between these regions, it seems that the extremely high humidity of the forest air prolongs the survival of the viruses in the drops in the external environment. Our theoretical calculations explain empirical observations from recent epidemiological studies and strengthen the need to use, not only a mask but also protective glasses throughout the population in the same way that they are mandatory for health professionals. Besides, our calculations show how air conditioning and heating systems can increase contagion. Finally, we suggest measures that could reduce the spread of the pandemic.","output":"Not even the air of empty spaces is coronavirus free (Two meters is not a safe distance)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Clot density (Hounsfield units, HU) and perviousness (post-contrast increase in the HU of clot) are thought to be associated with clot composition. We evaluate whether these imaging characteristics were associated with angiographic outcomes of aspiration and stent retriever thrombectomy in COMPASS: a trial of aspiration thrombectomy versus stent retriever thrombectomy as first-line approach for large vessel occlusion. METHODS Clot density and perviousness were measured by two independent operators who were blind to all the final angiographic and clinical outcomes. The association of clot density and perviousness with the Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale after first pass was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS Among all patients enrolled in COMPASS, 165 were eligible for the post-hoc analysis (81 patients in the aspiration first and 84 in the stent retriever first groups). Overall mean perviousness of clot was significantly higher in patient with mTICI 2b-3 after first pass (28.622.9 vs 20.319.2, p=0.017). Mean perviousness among patients who achieved TICI 2c/3 versus TICI 2b versus TICI 0-2a in the aspiration first group varied significantly (32.626.1, 35.324.4, and 17.713.1, p=0.013). The association of perviousness with first pass success was not significant in the stent retriever group. Using multivariate analysis, high perviousness (defined as cut-off >27.6) was an independent predictor of TICI 2b-3 (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.10 to 13.19; p=0.034).

METHODS: An anonymized web-based questionnaire was used to assess demographics, CL history, and activity, CL wear habits and perceived risk of infection due to CL wear during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 737 participants with an average age of 27.4 (9.3) years completed the online questionnaire. The vast majority of respondents were soft CL wearers and reported at least two years of CL wear. Patients concerns about the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to CL wear (40.6% of participants) were significantly related ((2)(1) = 11.195, p < 0.05) to CL discontinuation (46% of participants) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This fact joins the significant changes in the frequency of CL wear during the COVID-19 pandemic ((2)(4) = 31.982, p < 0.05), with a tendency to increase occasional CL wear from 29.1% to 61.8%. Interestingly, the majority of respondent (87.9%) indicated that no professional had offered them information related to CL wear and COVID-19, and that they had not sought it on their own (82.2%). CONCLUSION: There is a relationship between the perceived risk of infection and CL dropout during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a tendency to change the CL frequency of wear, with an increase in occasional CL wear. During the ongoing pandemic, eye care practitioners should reinforce CL patient education to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and CL-related complications requiring clinical care.","output":"Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on contact lens wear in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Pharmacists at airport pharmacies could offer essential health services for air travelers. Consequently, this study aimed to explore the type of professional services, the types of medicines at airport pharmacies and the pharmacists experiences and views regarding their practices. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with pharmacists practicing in airport pharmacies from June 2020 to December 2020. A validated Google form-based interview questionnaire was developed, and the electronic link was sent to the participants. Recruitment of participants was continued until data saturation was achieved. In total, 15 pharmacists working at different airport pharmacies in different countries were included. Thematic analysis was used in the data analysis. RESULTS: The study identified six major themes including type of professional services and medicines at airport pharmacies, pharmacists experiences, challenges at the airport pharmacy, suggestions to improve airport pharmacy services, pandemics and the role of pharmacists, and business aspect of the airport pharmacies. The study showed that several professional services provided at airport pharmacies, including the provision of medicines, health products, general health services, travel health services, and counseling. Moreover, 46.7% of the participants reported having a dedicated travel health service. In addition, most of the participants described their experience at airport pharmacies as good and exciting as they met different people from different countries. The most common challenges that pharmacists face at airport pharmacies include language barriers, requests for different medicine brands by travelers, and financial issues. The participants indicated that there is a need for promotion of pharmacists role in providing health care services at airport pharmacies.

To reduce transmission, a 'lockdown' was introduced in Ireland between March-May 2020. The aim of this study is to capture the experiences of Consultant Psychiatrists during lockdown and their perception of it's impact on Mental Health Services. METHODS: A questionnaire designed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists was adapted and circulated to Consultant members of the College of Psychiatrists following the easing of restrictions. The questionnaire assessed the perceived impact on referral rates, mental health act provision, availability of Information Technology (IT), consultant well-being and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Thematic analysis was employed to analyse free-text sections. RESULTS: Response rate was 32% (N=197/623). Consultants reported an initial decrease/significant decrease in referrals in the first month of lockdown (68%, N=95/140) followed by an increase/significant increase in the second month for both new (83%, N=100/137) and previously attending patients (65%, N=88/136).

Methods and Results We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library through January 2020 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies assessing the effects of influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Estimates were reported as random effects risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. Analyses were stratified by study design into randomized controlled trials and observational studies. A total of 16 studies (n=237 058), including 4 randomized controlled trials (n=1667) and 12 observational studies (n=235 391), were identified. Participants' mean age was 69.27.01 years, 36.6% were women, 65.1% had hypertension, 31.1% had diabetes mellitus, and 23.4% were smokers. At a median follow-up duration of 19.5 months, influenza vaccine was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.93 [P=0.01]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.84 [P<0.001]), and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94 [P<0.001]) compared with control. The use of the influenza vaccine was not associated with a statistically significant reduction of myocardial infarction (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.49-1.09 [P=0.12]) compared with control.

Since SUD patients represent a population at a higher risk for complications from COVID-19, an alternative strategy to support COVID-19 testing was urgently needed. We designed and deployed a telehealth-based solution in which patients could use mobile devices to connect with trained collection professionals to perform observed urine collections, often referred to a UA (urinalysis). The solution was designed with patient-centered best practices for telehealth, stigma prevention, trauma-informed, empathy and compassion, and to remove barriers to access to care.

METHODS: the project targeted kindergartens and primary schools and included three components: the design and delivery of innovative health education interventions to i) students and ii) teachers, and iii) the provision of sanitation products in schools. Here we describe the intervention, report on the project penetration and evaluate its impact. First, a survey was conducted on a convenience sample of 1,005 teachers to evaluate the project at the national level, then a retrospective analysis was conducted in the Lombardy region comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence rate in schools participating to the project with regional burden data. RESULTS: Over 8,000 Italian schools joined the project, for a total of 32,000 teachers and 1.1 million students. Survey respondents rated the educational interventions and the provision of sanitation products as excellent (66.6% and 82.5%, respectively) and reported the project to have greatly impacted on students health behaviors.

Due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic activities it is beneficial to human health and is often used as a functional food ingredient; however, it has poor water solubility and low in vivo bioavailability. Therefore, the efficacy of NRG can be improved by enhancing its water solubility to increase gastrointestinal absorption. Conventional methods for the formulation of NRG are very complex and use toxic organic solvents, making them impractical for the production of functional foods. The objective of this study was to develop a safe and effective NRG-based functional food material. Previously, we established a technology to prepare amorphous solid dispersions (SDs) from functional food ingredients with poor water solubility and used hot-melt extrusion technology that is comparatively simple and does not involve the use of organic solvents. In this study, we prepared NRG SD and evaluated them both physicochemically and biochemically. NRG SD had superior water solubility and gastrointestinal absorption relative to native NRG and showed higher analgesic efficacy in rats than crystalline NRG. NRG SD was administered to mice in a mixed diet for 28 days, and organ weights and hematological/clinical biochemical parameters were assessed. NRG SD did not demonstrate severe adverse effects. The results suggest that NRG SD is a safe and highly efficacious formulation that can be used as a functional food material in the future.","output":"Physicochemical and Biochemical Evaluation of Amorphous Solid Dispersion of Naringenin Prepared Using Hot-Melt Extrusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kaempferol, a flavonoid compound, has various biological functions, such as anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities. Acute liver failure (ALF) is a lethal clinical syndrome that occurs due to severe damage of the liver function. In the present study, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of kaempferol in ALF were evaluated. An ALF mouse model was established using D-galactosamine (D-GalN; 700 mg/kg)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 g/kg). A total of 2 h before the administration of D-GalN/LPS, mice were pretreated with different doses of kaempferol (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg), and 6 h after injection of D-GalN/LPS, mice were euthanized. The survival rate, liver function and levels of inflammatory cytokines were assessed. The results demonstrated that kaempferol pretreatment protected hepatocytes from ALF induced by D-GalN/LPS via regulation of the autophagy pathway, both in vivo and in vitro. Pretreatment with a high dose of kaempferol significantly decreased the survival rates and increased severe liver damage; however, pretreatment with a low dose of kaempferol had the opposite effect. Furthermore, pretreatment with a high dose of kaempferol enhanced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines [TNF-, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-1, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-2, CXCL-10] and markers of the MAPK signaling pathway [phosphorylated (p)-JNK, p-ERK, p-p38], whereas pretreatment with a low dose of kaempferol had the opposite effect. Pretreatment with a high dose of kaempferol decreased autophagy, whereas pretreatment with a low dose of kaempferol increased autophagy in vivo and in vitro. It was also shown that pretreatment with 3-methyadenine or autophagy related 7 small interfering RNA, to inhibit autophagy, partially abrogated the hepatoprotective effects of pretreatment with 5 mg/kg kaempferol in the ALF mouse model. These results demonstrate that the effects of different doses of kaempferol on D-GalN/LPS-induced ALF varies based on the dose, and that kaempferol exerted its effects via regulation of the autophagy pathway.","output":"Distinct effects of different doses of kaempferol on D-GalN/LPS-induced ALF depend on the autophagy pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The remnants of quilombos, individuals of African descent, have faced several barriers throughout its history, either due to prejudice imposed by society, or the non-fulfillment of their rights guaranteed in the 1988 Constitution, such as access to health services.

This study was aimed to assess the clinical preference of DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag chemiluminescence immunoassay. METHODS: An upper respiratory specimen was collected in a series of patients referred to the Laboratory Medicine service of Pederzoli Hospital (Peschiera del Garda, Verona, Italy) for screening or diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nasopharyngeal samples were assayed with DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag test and Altona Diagnostics RealStar(?) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit. RESULTS: The final study population consisted of 421 patients (median age, 48 years; 227 women), 301 (71.5%) with positive result of molecular testing, and 126 (29.9%) with cycle threshold (Ct) values of both E and S genes <29.5, thus reflecting higher infectivity.

Their jobs can be highly stressful and feature unusual working hours and multiple shift patterns. When considering the policing environment of 2021, many roles that were previously the domain of warranted officers are now being carried out by nonwarranted police staff equivalents. These police staff roles are relatively new to policing but put staff under some of the same stresses as police officers. A UK police force requested help to investigate technologies that could be used to improve health and well-being and research how these technologies could be used to measure and track health behavior change. OBJECTIVE: Historical research studies need to be appraised in light of this new policing environment, and new research also needs to include this shift in dynamics when considering aspects of policing, including their health and well-being. This study explores police officer and staff attitudes toward and their use of existing health-related technology, highlights existing practices, and gathers views about how technology could be used more effectively. METHODS: A web-based survey was completed by police officers and staff (N=213) during the initial period of the UK lockdown in 2020. The survey was designed to find the solutions that participants used outside of those supplied by their employer, identify issues or problems, and find what they would like a hypothetical app to focus on. Additional requirements data were captured through client meetings, including discussions concerning previously attempted solutions and those currently in place. Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify the key themes. RESULTS: Attitudes toward and uses of existing health-related technology were captured, and existing practices were highlighted. Participants identified a need for an app to consider that a user was on shiftan important point, as many issues and problems with elements of their health and well-being involved shift work. Data also highlighted that a multifunctional tool would be more beneficial to participants than focusing on just 1 element. The key features and four domains were identified for app coverage. The prioritized order of importance of the four domains was activity, food and diet, sleep, and fluid intake. CONCLUSIONS: For police officers and staff, research data suggest that there is a previously unidentified requirement for a mobile app that could provide an easily accessible platform for them to use, regardless of the current location; one that could provide guidelines on diet, lifestyle habits, and health behavior to help the user make informed decisions to assist in personalized behavior change.

Pregnant women with severe COVID-19 present increased rates of preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks), cesarean delivery and neonatal admissions to the intensive care unit. Comorbidity such as diabetes (pregestational or gestational) or obesity further increased maternal and fetal complications. It is known that diabetic or obese patients with COVID-19 present an unfavorable course and a worse prognosis, with a direct association between worse outcome and suboptimal glycol-metabolic control or body mass index (BMI) levels. Critical COVID-19 infection prevention is important for both mother and fetus. Vaccination during pregnancy is a common practice. Vaccines against COVID-19 are distributed across the world with some population considered to have a priority. Since pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials very little information are available on safety and efficacy of COVD-19 vaccines during pregnancy. However, it is well known the concept of passive immunization of the newborn obtained with transplacental passage of protective antibodies into the fetal/neonatal circulation after maternal infection or vaccination. Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 vaccine-induced IgG pass to the neonates through breastmilk. Therefore, maternal vaccination can protect mother, fetus and baby.

Exploring legislatures across 159 countries, we find no relation between the severity of Covid-19 and limitations on legislatures operation, thus suggesting that legislatures are at risk of being shut down or limited due to policy overreaction and that a health risk may serve as an excuse for silencing them. However, we find that legislatures in democratic countries are relatively immune to this risk, while those in frail democracies are more exposed. In partially free countries, the use of technology can mitigate this risk. We also find that the coalitional features of the government may lead to legislatures closing.

Temporary changes to the diagnostic testing for GDM have been recommended for the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to identify what proportion of women with GDM would be missed by the COVID-19 GDM screening criteria. Secondly an analysis of the relationship between HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and pregnancy outcomes will be completed. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all GDM patients at an Australian secondary hospital between January 2019 and February 2020. The proportion of women with GDM who would have been missed using the COVID-19 guidelines was assessed. Patients were divided into groups according to how their GDM was managed during the pregnancy: Diet, Metformin (MF), Insulin and MF + Insulin groups. Differences between the groups were compared using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc analysis was completed using the Bonferroni test. Logistic regression was employed to further compare the differences between the groups. RESULTS: The study group comprised 237 patients. Sixty patients (25.3%) would not have had GDM detected in their pregnancy using the COVID-19 guidelines. FBG was the most significant predictor for intervention with medication for GDM (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: HbA1c and FBG are poor screening tests for GDM. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the OGTT should be given clinical priority in high risk patients.

Many studies have shown machine learning models to be effective at detecting lung nodules from chest X-ray images. However, these techniques have yet to be embraced by the medical community due to several practical, ethical, and regulatory constraints stemming from the black-box nature of deep learning models. Additionally, most lung nodules visible on chest X-ray are benign; therefore, the narrow task of computer vision-based lung nodule detection cannot be equated to automated lung cancer detection. Addressing both concerns, this study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning and decision tree-based computer vision model which presents lung cancer malignancy predictions as interpretable decision trees. The deep learning component of this process is trained using a large publicly available dataset on pathological biomarkers associated with lung cancer. These models are then used to inference biomarker scores for chest X-ray images from two, independent data sets for which malignancy metadata is available. We mine multi-variate predictive models by fitting shallow decision trees to the malignancy stratified datasets and interrogate a range of metrics to determine the best model. Our best decision tree model achieves sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 80.0% respectively with a positive predictive value of 92.9%. Decision trees mined using this method may be considered as a starting point for refinement into clinically useful multi-variate lung cancer malignancy models for implementation as a workflow augmentation tool to improve the efficiency of human radiologists.","output":"Deep Mining Generation of Lung Cancer Malignancy Models from Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fe2O3-TiO2-clay heterostructures have been prepared using an organo-bentonite as support, which organophilic character favored the fixation of TiO2.

AIM The objective of this study was to systematically review the published literature to determine an optimal threshold of HCW HHC rate associated with the lowest incidence rate of HAIs. METHODS This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched online databases using a comprehensive search criterion for randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled studies, investigating the impact of HCW's HHC rate on HAI rates in patients of all ages, within healthcare facilities in high income countries. FINDINGS Of the 8,093 articles citations and abstracts screened, 35 articles were included in the review. Most studies reported overall HAIs per 1000 patient-days and device-associated HAIs per 1000 device-days. Most studies reported HHC rates between 60%-70%. Lower incidence HAI rates seemed to be achieved with HHC rates of approximately 60%. Studies included were not originally designed to assess the impact of HHC on HAI rates but risk of bias was assessed as per our predetermined exposure and outcome criterion. 11 (31%) of studies were deemed at low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS Although HHC is part of HCW's code of conduct, very high HHC rates were difficult to reach. In observational studies, HHC and HAI followed a negative relationship up to about 60%. Due to flaws in study design, causality could not be inferred; only general trends could be discussed.

The E64d-associated inhibition of RNA synthesis likely results from E64d-specific inhibition of processing of the gene 1 polyprotein, resulting in inactive proteinase or replicase proteins. These results indicate that processing of the MHV-A59 gene 1-encoded polyprotein is required throughout infection to sustain RNA synthesis and virus replication.","output":"Coronavirus Protein Processing and RNA Synthesis Is Inhibited by the Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor E64d"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic digital contact tracing has been proposed as a tool to support the health authorities in their quest to determine who has been in close and sustained contact with a person infected by the coronavirus. In April 2020 Google and Apple released the Google Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework, as a decentralised and more privacy friendly platform for contact tracing. The GAEN framework implements exposure notification mostly at the operating system layer, instead of fully at the app(lication) layer. In this paper we study the consequences of this approach. We argue that this creates a dormant functionality for mass surveillance at the operating system layer. We show how it does not technically prevent the health authorities from implementing a purely centralised form of contact tracing (even though that is the stated aim). We highlight that GAEN allows Google and Apple to dictate how contact tracing is (or rather isn't) implemented in practice by health authorities, and how it introduces the risk of function creep.","output":"A Critique of the Google Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Baxter has developed a new recombinant factor IX (rFIX) drug product (BAX326) for treating patients with hemophilia B, or congenital FIX deficiency. An extensive preclinical program evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of BAX326 in different species. The efficacy of BAX326 was tested in three mouse models of primary pharmacodynamics: tail-tip bleeding, carotid occlusion, and thrombelastography. The pharmacokinetics was evaluated after a single intravenous bolus injection in mice, rats, and macaques. Toxicity was assessed in rats and macaques, safety pharmacology in rabbits and macaques, and immunogenicity in mice. BAX326 was shown to be efficacious in all three primary pharmacodynamic studies (P  0.0076). Hemostatic efficacy was dose related and similar for the three lots tested. Pharmacokinetic results showed that rFIX activity and rFIX antigen concentrations declined in a bi-phasic manner, similar to a previously licensed rFIX product. BAX326 was well tolerated in rabbits and macaques at all dose levels; no thrombogenic events and no adverse clinical, respiratory, or cardiovascular effects occurred. BAX326 was also shown to have a similar immunogenicity profile to the comparator rFIX product in mice. These results demonstrate that BAX326 has a favorable preclinical safety and efficacy profile, predictive of a comparable effect to that of the previously licensed rFIX in humans.

In the present report, a singular cohort of long-lived (19-month-old survivors) heterozygous and homozygous male 3xTg-AD mice were studied to determine whether their AD-genotype load can modulate the brain and peripheral pathological burden, behavioral phenotypes, and neuro-immunoendocrine status, compared to age-matched non-transgenic controls. The results indicated increased amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels in a genetic-load-dependent manner but convergent synaptophysin and choline acetyltransferase brain levels. Cognitive impairment and HPA-axis hyperactivation were salient traits in both 3xTg-AD survivor groups. In contrast, genetic load elicited different anxiety-like profiles, with hypoactive homozygous, while heterozygous resembled controls in some traits and risk assessment. Complex neuro-immunoendocrine crosstalk was also observed. Bodyweight loss and splenic, renal, and hepatic histopathological injury scores provided evidence of the systemic features of AD, despite similar peripheral organs oxidative stress.

Data from 19,729 pediatric T1D patients from the Diabetes Prospective Follow-up (DPV) registry were available. Datasets from four time-periods between January 1st and June 30th, 2020 were compared to data from the whole year 2019 in the same patient; differences were adjusted for seasonality, increasing age, and longer diabetes duration. HbA1c values from laboratory measurements and estimates derived from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were aggregated into a combined glucose indicator (CGI), expressed in analogy to HbA1c. Based on regression models adjusted for differences of sex, age, diabetes duration, and migratory background between the four time-periods, CGI values in 2020 were slightly higher than in 2019, e.g. by 0.044% [0.042-0.046] (median [95% CI]) in the second lockdown month, time-period 3.

A limitation of these reports, however, is the absence of contemporaneous control groups, particularly given the high baseline mortality in this population. Using electronic health records data on resident deaths, hospital transfer, vaccination, and daily census from Genesis Healthcare, a large NH provider spanning 24 U.S. states, we compared 7-day mortality and hospitalization rates for vaccinated versus unvaccinated NH residents. Between December 18, 2020 and December 31, 2020, 7006 residents across 118 NHs were vaccinated with the first dose. Mortality and hospital transfer rates within 7 days of vaccination were compared to rates for: (1) unvaccinated residents in the same facility within 7 days of the vaccine clinic (n=4414), and (2) residents in 166 yet-to-be-vaccinated facilities between December 25, 2020 and January 1, 2021 (n=17,076). We excluded residents with a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test within 20 days prior to their 7-day observation window. Mortality rates per 100,000 residents were lower among vaccinated (587, 95%CI: 431, 798) versus unvaccinated residents within the same facilities (984, 95%CI: 705, 1382), and compared to residents in not-yet-vaccinated facilities (912, 95%CI: 770-1080), with overlapping 95% CIs.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to prospectively assess airflow limitation and airway inflammation in children 4 to 6 years old with episodic virus-induced wheeze. METHODS: Ninety-three children 4 to 6 years old with a history of mild, virus-induced episodes of wheeze who were able to perform acceptable fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) maneuvers and spirometry (with forced expiratory time 0.5 seconds) were followed prospectively. Lung function and Feno values were measured every 6 weeks (baseline) within the first 48 hours of an acute wheezing episode (day 0) and 10 and 30 days later. Symptom scores and peak flow measurement were recorded daily. RESULTS: Forty-three children experienced a wheezing episode. At day 0, Feno values were significantly increased, whereas forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (FEV(0.5)) significantly decreased compared with baseline (16 ppb [interquartile range {IQR}, 13-20 ppb] vs 9 ppb IQR, 7-11 ppb] and 0.84 L [IQR, 0.75-0.99 L] vs 0.99 L [IQR, 0.9-1.07 L], respectively; both P < .001). Airflow limitation at day 0 was reversible after bronchodilation. FEV(0.5) and Feno values were significantly associated with each other and with lower and upper respiratory tract symptoms when assessed longitudinally but not cross-sectionally at all time points independently of atopy. Feno and FEV(0.5) values returned to baseline levels within 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Mild episodes of wheeze in preschoolers are characterized by enhanced airway inflammation, reversible airflow limitation, and asthma-related symptoms. Feno values increase significantly during the first 48 hours and return to personal baseline within 10 days from the initiation of the episode. Longitudinal follow-up suggests that symptoms, inflammation, and lung function correlate well in this phenotype of asthma.","output":"Assessment of airflow limitation, airway inflammation, and symptoms during virus-induced wheezing episodes in 4- to 6-year-old children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND One in six people with cancer will develop depression at some point in their care. Untreated depression affects quality of life, cancer care satisfaction and healthcare expenditure. Treatments for this vulnerable heterogenous population should be evidence based and specific. A common sentiment is that psychiatric research does not reflect the prevalence of patients with cancer and comorbid depression and is biased towards certain cancers, but this has not been empirically shown. STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of studies on psychological and pharmacological treatments for depression in people with cancer was conducted. Of 4621 papers identified from a search of PubMed and PsycINFO up to 27 June 2020, 84 met inclusion criteria (eg, adults with cancer; depression diagnosis; treatment study) and comprised 6048 participants with depression with cancer. FINDINGS Cancer types are not proportionally represented in depression research in accordance with their incidence. Breast cancer is over-represented (relative frequency in research 49.3%, but 11.7% of global cancer). Cancers of the head and neck and bone and soft tissue were close to parity. All other cancers are under-represented. Representativeness varied 40-fold across different cancers. CONCLUSIONS The evidence base for depression treatments is dominated by a single cancer. Given heterogeneity in cancer populations (eg, stage of illness; psychological impact; cancer treatments), it is possible that depression treatments may not have the same benefits and harms across all cancers, impeding the ability to offer people with different cancers the best depression treatment.

Based on a behaviour change model of Capability, Opportunity and Motivation (COM-B), the programme provided PPE support, advice and education to ward staff. AIM: Evaluation of the PPE Helper Programme. METHODS: Clinical and non-clinical ward staff completed a questionnaire informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework and COM-B. The questionnaire was available in paper and electronic versions. Quantitative responses were analysed using descriptive and non-parametric statistics, free-text responses were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Over a six-week period, PPE helpers made 268 ward visits. Overall, 261 questionnaires were available for analysis. Across the Trust, 68% of respondents reported having had contact with a PPE helper. Staff who had encountered a PPE helper responded significantly more positively to a range of statements about using PPE than those who had not. Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff were significantly more anxious in relation to the adequacy of PPE. Non-clinical and redeployed staff (e.g. domestic staff) were most positive about the impact of PPE helpers.

Viruses and bacteria have written or decisively contributed to terrible episodes of history, such as the Black Death in 14th century Europe, the annihilation of pre-Columbian American civilizations, and pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu or the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, it is clear that we could not live in a world without these tiny beings. Endogenous retroviruses have been key to our evolution and for the regulation of gene expression, and the gut microbiota helps us digest compounds that we could not otherwise process. In addition, we have used microorganisms to preserve or prepare food for millennia and more recently to obtain drugs such as antibiotics or to develop recombinant DNA technologies. Due to the enormous importance of microorganisms for our survival, they have significantly influenced the population genetics of different human groups. This paper will review the role of microorganisms as villains who have been responsible for tremendous mortality throughout history but also as friends who help us survive and evolve.","output":"Microorganisms as Shapers of Human Civilization, from Pandemics to Even Our Genomes: Villains or Friends?

Design Secondary analysis of surveillance data from the National COVID-19 positive pregnant women surveillance, Sri Lanka. Data of all pregnant women whose maternal and neonatal outcomes were reported in National Surveillance from 1st March 2020 to 31st October 2021 were included in the study. Associated factors for maternal and neonatal outcomes, namely POA at delivery, mode of delivery, birthweight, immediate place of newborn care, congenital abnormalities, and condition of neonate at completion of one month were calculated using univariate and multivariate Odds ratios. Results Maternal COVID-19 infection reported preterm birth rate of 11.9%, LSCS rate of 54.5%, low birthweight rate16.5% and 8.3% of the newborns requiring intensive care. Neonatal mortality rate was 9 per 1000 live births. Pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity increased the risk of preterm delivery compared to pregnant women with normal BMI by 46.7% (AOR=1.467, CI=1.111-1.938, P=0.007). In contrast, the risk of preterm delivery reduced by 82.4% (AOR=0.176, CI=0.097-0.317, p<0.001) and presence of any type of congenital abnormalities in newborns by 72.4% among the COVID-19 positive women who required only inward treatment in comparison to women with severe COVID-19 infection requiring intensive care (AOR=0.276, CI=0.112-0.683, p=0.005). Conclusion Increased severity of maternal COVID-19 infection and pre-pregnancy overweight/ obesity were associated with many adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Therefore, close observation and aggressive management of COVID-19 among the pregnant women should be considered to reduce the risk of progressing to severe illness.","output":"Neonatal and Maternal Outcome of COVID-19 positive women in Sri Lanka: Secondary Analysis using National COVID-19 Positive Pregnant Women Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We present a case of a woman who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 admitted to ICU with cardiogenic shock related to severe myocarditis A cathetermounted ventricular assist device (Impella?

We aimed to quantify the number and temporal trends of out-of-state introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Washington. METHODS: We conducted a molecular epidemiologic analysis of 11,422 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID sampled between December 2019 and September 2020. We used maximum parsimony ancestral state reconstruction methods on time-calibrated phylogenies to enumerate introductions/exports, their likely geographic source (US, non-US, and between eastern and western Washington), and estimated date of introduction. To incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty into our estimates, we conducted 5,000 replicate analyses by generating 25 random time-stratified samples of non-Washington reference sequences, 20 random polytomy resolutions, and 10 random resolutions of the reconstructed ancestral state. FINDINGS: We estimated a minimum 287 introductions (range 244-320) into Washington and 204 exported lineages (range 188-227) of SARS-CoV-2 out of Washington. Introductions began in mid-January and peaked on March 29, 2020. Lineages with the Spike D614G variant accounted for the majority (88%) of introductions. Overall, 61% (range 55-65%) of introductions into Washington likely originated from a source elsewhere within the US, while the remaining 39% (range 35-45%) likely originated from outside of the US. Intra-state transmission accounted for 65% and 28% of introductions into eastern and western Washington, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Washington was continually seeded by a large number of introductions. Our findings highlight the importance of genomic surveillance to monitor for emerging variants due to high levels of inter- and intra-state transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

The increased risks for human health include not just the dangers posed by the virus itself, but also the upheaval to the broader health care and societal landscapes, which has threatened access to critical sexual and reproductive health services. In this viewpoint, we describe how the pandemic has already posed challenges to reproductive autonomy in both the United States and globally, and then offer insights on how it may do so in the future. We conclude with a call not only to resist a rollback of access to reproductive health care during this pandemic, but to center a broad conception of reproductive autonomy in sexual and reproductive health research, policies and programs moving forward.","output":"Reproductive Autonomy Is Nonnegotiable, Even in the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of propolis from a semi-arid region of Morocco were investigated.

METHODS: 27 pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included. CT examination and molecular assay tests were performed from all participants. A standard checklist was utilized to extract information, and two radiologists separately reviewed the CT images. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 4.7  4.16 (mean  SD) years. Seventeen patients were female, and ten were male. The most common imaging finding was ground-glass opacities followed by consolidations. Seven patients had a single area of involvement, five patients had multiple areas of involvement, and four patients had diffuse involvement. The sensitivity of CT imaging in diagnosing infections was 66.67%. Also, some uncommon imaging findings were seen, such as a tree-in-bud and lung collapse. CONCLUSION: CT imaging shows less involvement in pediatric compared to adult patients, due to pediatric patients having a milder form of the disease. CT imaging also has a lower sensitivity in detecting abnormal lungs compared to adult patients.

To support malignant features associated with cancer development and therapy resistance, the cancer cells adapt their metabolic rate and pathways. As an example, aerobic glycolysis, where the cells use glycolysis in the presence of oxygen, is frequently seen. Here we show that targeting aerobic glycolysis represents a promising strategy in cancer therapeutics. ABSTRACT: Increased glycolytic activity is a hallmark of cancer initiation and progression and is often observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex acts as a gatekeeper between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and activation of PDH is known to inhibit glycolytic activity. As part of a standard therapeutic regimen, patients with NSCLC harboring oncogenic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs). Independent of good initial response, development of resistance to this therapy is inevitable. In the presented work, we propose that inhibition of glycolysis will add to the therapeutic effects and possibly prevent development of resistance against both EGFR TKIs and ionizing radiation in NSCLC. Analysis of transcriptome data from two independent NSCLC patient cohorts identified increased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1) as well as upregulated expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism in tumors compared to normal tissue. We established in vitro models of development of resistance to EGFR TKIs to study metabolism and determine if targeting PDHK would prevent development of resistance to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC cells. The PDHK1 inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) in combination with EGFR TKIs and/or ionizing radiation was shown to increase the therapeutic effect in our NSCLC cell models. This mechanism was associated with redirected metabolism towards pyruvate oxidation and reduced lactate production, both in EGFR TKI sensitive and resistant NSCLC cells. Using DCA, the intracellular pool of pyruvate available for lactic fermentation becomes limited. Consequently, pyruvate is redirected to the mitochondria, and reinforces mitochondrial activity. Addition of DCA to cell culture deacidifies the extracellular microenvironment as less lactate is produced and excreted. In our study, we find that this redirection of metabolism adds to the therapeutic effect of EGFR TKI and ionizing radiation in NSCLC.","output":"Blocking Aerobic Glycolysis by Targeting Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase in Combination with EGFR TKI and Ionizing Radiation Increases Therapeutic Effect in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Analysis of the resources for overcoming difficulties by students in connection with the new life experience in the first weeks of self-isolation and distance learning in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic Background The study is focused on identifying the current psychological state, the characteristics of the perception of the world, as well as the strategies and resources of the individual to overcome negative aspects in connection with changes in everyday life Study design The study was built in the format of a socio-psychological survey to study the lifestyle and psychological state of students in self-isolation Research was conducted in the middle of April 2020 Participants 56 people, residents of Russia (8% of men, 92% of women) from 20-23 years old university students of the 2nd (77%) and 5th (23%) courses of psychological specialties (a=21 12, Me=21, SD=1 37) Measurements The research is based on quantitative and qualitative methodology We used the method of content analysis for written discourses about the lifestyle in connection with self-isolation and the SAN method, which allows one to draw conclusions about the degree of psycho-emotional state Results Lifestyle changes were recorded by 93% of respondents The most transformed spheres are activity (educational) and social The spatio-temporal characteristics of life are of great importance Assessments of negative and positive changes show parity Minor manifestations of anxiety and negative emotional states were revealed The average and medium-high level of psychoemotional state was recorded Conclusions Resources for overcoming difficulties are represented by strategies: 1) \\"I\\": comprehension, self-organization, maintaining physical fitness, self-development;2) \\"Others\\": help, emotional support for loved ones and strangers;3) \\"Living space\\": working with the space of the house for arrangement under his \\"I\\", expanding its multifunctionality, maintaining cleanliness ? 2021 Moscow State University of Psychology and Education All rights reserved","output":"Life experience and resources for overcoming the difficulties of social isolation in the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic among students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As people, animals and materials are transported across increasingly large distances in a globalized world, threats to our biosecurity and food security are rising. Aotearoa New Zealand is an island nation with many endemic species, a strong local agricultural industry, and a need to protect these from pest threats, as well as the economy from fraudulent commodities. Mitigation of such threats is much more effective if their origins and pathways for entry are understood. We propose that this may be addressed in Aotearoa using strontium isotope analysis of both pests and products. Bioavailable radiogenic isotopes of strontium are ubiquitous markers of provenance that are increasingly used to trace the origin of animals and plants as well as products, but currently a baseline map across Aotearoa is lacking, preventing use of this technique. Here, we have improved an existing methodology to develop a regional bioavailable strontium isoscape using the best available geospatial datasets for Aotearoa. The isoscape explains 53% of the variation (R(2) = 0.53 and RMSE = 0.00098) across the region, for which the primary drivers are the underlying geology, soil pH, and aerosol deposition (dust and sea salt). We tested the potential of this model to determine the origin of cow milk produced across Aotearoa. Predictions for cow milk (n = 33) highlighted all potential origin locations that share similar (87)Sr/(86)Sr values, with the closest predictions averaging 7.05 km away from their true place of origin. These results demonstrate that this bioavailable strontium isoscape is effective for tracing locally produced agricultural products in Aotearoa. Accordingly, it could be used to certify the origin of Aotearoas products, while also helping to determine if new pest detections were of locally breeding populations or not, or to raise awareness of imported illegal agricultural products.","output":"A bioavailable strontium ((87)Sr/(86)Sr) isoscape for Aotearoa New Zealand: Implications for food forensics and biosecurity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to analyze the effects of Covid-19 on the floating population of Seoul, based on population influx/outflux data from January-June, 2019 and January-June, 2020.

Built on the unwanted and flood-prone lands adjacent to the Tar River, Princeville has flooded multiple times throughout its history, including after Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Because of the towns historical significance, residents and town officials alike have been reluctant to accept offers for widespread buyouts from the government. Despite having limited financial resources and political clout, the town has developed a unique approach to managed retreat while rebuilding from Matthewone that emphasizes the importance of historical sites while also recognizing the need to relocate residents out of harms way from future floods. This manuscript uses a historical and narrative approach to examine how Princevilles unique history, and the relationship between the town and the Tar River, play important roles in the towns decisions regarding retreat and redevelopment in the aftermath of major flooding events.

While focused on the present day, this case study is historically informed, using oral histories and archival documents.","output":"Finding voices in the floods of Freedom Hill: innovating solutions in Princeville, North Carolina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Hospital Authority (HA) is a statutory body managing all the public hospitals and institutes in Hong Kong (HK). In recent decades, Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HKHA) has been making efforts to improve the healthcare services, but there still exist some problems like unfair resource allocation and poor management, as reported by the Hong Kong medical legislative committee. One critical consequence of these problems is low healthcare efficiency of hospitals, leading to low satisfaction among patients. Moreover, HKHA also suffers from the conflict between limited resource and growing demand. An effective evaluation of HA is important for resource planning and healthcare decision making. In this paper, we propose a two-phase method to evaluate HA efficiency for reducing healthcare expenditure and improving healthcare service. Specifically, in Phase I, we measure the HKHA efficiency changes from 2000 to 2013 by applying a novel DEA-Malmquist index with undesirable factors. In Phase II, we further explore the impact of some exogenous factors (e.g., population density) on HKHA efficiency by Tobit regression model. Empirical results show that there are significant differences between the efficiencies of different hospitals and clusters. In particular, it is found that the public hospital serving in a richer district has a relatively lower efficiency. To a certain extent, this reflects the socioeconomic reality in HK that people with better economic condition prefers receiving higher quality service from the private hospitals.","output":"Hong Kong Hospital Authority resource efficiency evaluation: Via a novel DEA-Malmquist model and Tobit regression model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among others, expression levels of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD\\\\L1) have been explored as biomarkers of the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy.

As expected, corticosteroids and inhibitors of Janus kinases were among the top PD\\\\L1 downregulators. In addition, we identified that PD\\\\L1 expression is induced by antiestrogenic compounds. Transcriptomic analyses indicate that chronic estrogen receptor alpha (ER) inhibition triggers a broad immunosuppressive program in ER\\\\positive breast cancer cells, which is subsequent to their growth arrest and involves the activation of multiple immune checkpoints together with the silencing of the antigen\\\\presenting machinery.

Since EMG system parameters, such as the feature extraction methods and the number of channels, have been known to affect system performances, it is important to investigate these effects on the performance of the sEMG-based biometric system to determine optimal system parameters. In this study, three robust feature extraction methods, Time-domain (TD) feature, Frequency Division Technique (FDT), and Autoregressive (AR) feature, and their combinations were investigated while the number of channels varying from one to eight. For these system parameters, the performance of sixteen static wrist and hand gestures was systematically investigated in two authentication modes: verification and identification. The results from 24 participants showed that the TD features significantly (p<0.05) and consistently outperformed FDT and AR features for all channel numbers. The results also showed that the performance of a four-channel setup was not significantly different from those with higher number of channels. The average equal error rate (EER) for a four-channel sEMG verification system was 4% for TD features, 5.3% for FDT features, and 10% for AR features. For an identification system, the average Rank-1 error (R1E) for a four-channel configuration was 3% for TD features, 12.4% for FDT features, and 36.3% for AR features. The electrode position on the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) muscle had a critical contribution to the authentication performance. Thus, the combination of the TD feature set and a four-channel sEMG system with one of the electrodes positioned on the FCU are recommended for optimal authentication performance.","output":"Performance Optimization of Surface Electromyography (sEMG) based Biometric Sensing System for both Verification and Identification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction:Antisynthetase syndrome (ASSD) is a rare auto-immune condition that can present as interstitial lung disease (ILD) and progress into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

Our previous study showed that EVs rich in HAX1 are associated with in metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the mechanism by which HAX1 of EVs promotes metastasis and angiogenesis is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that EVs rich in HAX1 promote angiogenesis phenotype by activating the FAK pathway in endothelial cells (ECs) by increasing expression level of ITGB6. The expression level of HAX1 is markedly correlated with microvessel density (MVDs) in NPC and head and neck cancers based on an analysis of IHC. In addition to a series of in vitro cellular analyses, in vivo models revealed that HAX1 was correlated with migration and blood vessel formation of ECs, and metastasis of NPC. Using ribosome profiling, we found that HAX1 regulates the FAK pathway to influence microvessel formation and promote NPC metastasis by enhancing the translation efficiency of ITGB6. Our findings demonstrate that HAX1 can be used as an important biomarker for NPC metastasis, providing a novel basis for antiangiogenesis therapy in clinical settings.","output":"Extracellular vesicles rich in HAX1 promote angiogenesis by modulating ITGB6 translation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endophytes are reservoirs of new and effective bioactive compounds that generally belong to the classes such as terpenoids and steroids, fatty acid-derived substances and polyketides, alkaloids, nonribosomal polypeptides, and enzyme cofactors.

However, evidence on vertical transmission and natural passive immunity among the newborns exposed to COVID-19 is scanty and varies. This poses a challenge on preventive interventions for the newborns. We conducted a systematic review to first, determine the likelihood of vertical transmission among COVID-19 exposed infants and second, determine whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were generated among COVID-19 vertically exposed but negative infants. This review registered in PROSPERO searched evidence from PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar, among others. About 517 studies were pooled, where 33 articles (5.8%) met the inclusion criteria such as infection prevention and control measures at birth. A total of 205 infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers were studied. Overall, 6.3% (13/205; 95% CI: 3.0%-9.7%) of the infants tested positive for COVID-19 virus at birth. Of 33 eligible studies, six studies (18.8%) reported about immunoglobulin G/M (IgG/IgM) against SARS-CoV-2.

However, the extent and nature of changes in health care utilization during the pandemic may differ by care setting. Knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization is important to health care organizations and policy makers. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate changes in in-person health care utilization and telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to assess the difference in changes in health care utilization between the pandemic year 2020 and the prepandemic year 2019. METHODS: We retrospectively assembled a cohort consisting of members of a large integrated health care organization, who were enrolled between January 6 and November 2, 2019 (prepandemic year), and between January 5 and October 31, 2020 (pandemic year). The rates of visits were calculated weekly for four settings: inpatient, emergency department (ED), outpatient, and telehealth. Using Poisson models, we assessed the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization during the early days of the pandemic and conducted difference-in-deference (DID) analyses to measure the changes in health care utilization, adjusting for the trend of health care utilization in the prepandemic year. RESULTS: In the early days of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient utilization (by 30.2%, 37.0%, and 80.9%, respectively). By contrast, there was a 4-fold increase in telehealth visits between weeks 8 (February 23) and 12 (March 22) in 2020. DID analyses revealed that after adjusting for prepandemic secular trends, the reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient visit rates in the early days of the pandemic were 1.6, 8.9, and 367.2 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001), respectively, while the increase in telehealth visits was 272.9 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001). Further analyses suggested that the increase in telehealth visits offset the reduction in outpatient visits by week 26 (June 28, 2020). CONCLUSIONS: In-person health care utilization decreased drastically during the early period of the pandemic, but there was a corresponding increase in telehealth visits during the same period.

METHODS Seventy two women with uncomplicated term pregnancies were randomized to spinal (n=37) or general anesthesia (n=35) groups. The blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and pulse rate of the patients were recorded during the procedure. Maternal blood samples of ischemia modified albumin (IMA) were taken 10 min from the start of the procedure. The fetal cord blood samples of IMA were taken immediately after birth. RESULTS Maternal (0.99  0.19 vs. 0.80  0.27) and fetal (1.00  0.21 vs. 0.70  0.26) IMA levels were significantly higher in the general anesthesia group.

Monitoring progress towards these goals requires timely and reliable information on deaths by age, sex and cause. To estimate baseline measures for UNSDGs, this study aimed to use several different data sources to estimate subnational measures of premature adult mortality (between 30 and 70 years) for India in 2017. METHODS: Age-specific population and mortality data were accessed for India and its 21 larger states from the Civil Registration System and Sample Registration System for 2017, and the most recent National Family and Health Survey. Similar data on population and deaths were also procured from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 and the National Burden of Disease Estimates Study for 2017. Life table methods were used to estimate life expectancy and age-specific mortality at national and state level from each source. An additional set of life tables were estimated using an international two-parameter model life table system. Three indicators of premature adult mortality were derived by sex for each location and from each data source, for comparative analysis RESULTS: Marked variations in mortality estimates from different sources were noted for each state. Assuming the highest mortality level from all sources as the potentially true value, premature adult mortality was estimated to cause a national total of 2.6 million male and 1.8 million female deaths in 2017, with Bihar, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal accounting for half of these deaths. There was marked heterogeneity in risk of premature adult mortality, ranging from 351 per 1000 in Kerala to 558 per 1000 in Chhattisgarh among men, and from 198 per 1000 in Himachal Pradesh to 409 per 1000 in Assam among women. CONCLUSIONS: Available data and estimates for mortality measurement in India are riddled with uncertainty.

Results A total of 24% (n = 25) of SOTRs reported that they will schedule COVID-19 vaccination after the study call, 46% reported that they will consider vaccination in the future, and 30% said they will not consider vaccination. Older age and White race were associated with lower willingness to schedule the vaccine, whereas Black race and longer time from transplant were associated with higher willingness. Common vaccine concerns included lack of long-term data, inconsistent messaging from providers, scheduling inconvenience, and insufficient resources. Follow-up approximately one month after the initial outreach found 52% (n = 13) of liver transplant recipients (LTRs) and 10% (n = 3) of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) subsequently received COVID-19 vaccines for a vaccination rate of 29% among respondents. Conclusion Transplant center-based vaccine outreach efforts can decrease misinformation and increase vaccination uptake;however, vaccine-related mistrust remains high.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Positive cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a single military base (March 23, 2020 and February 16, 2021) were included. An epidemiological investigation conducted via phone included questions regarding symptoms, exposure history, smoking status, list of contacts, and recently visited places. Symptoms surveyed included fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, loss of smell or taste, gastrointestinal symptoms (GI), headache, chest pain, and constitutional symptoms. Cases were divided before B.1.1.7 first reported case in Israel (December 23, 2020) (period 1) and after its identification (period 2). Symptom distribution and the risk of a contact to be infected were compared between the periods, using a chi-square test, and a negative binominal regression model, respectively. RESULTS: Of 293 confirmed cases, 89 were reported in the first period and 204 in the second. 56.0% were men with a median age of 19.5 years (interquartile range 18.6-20.5). GI symptoms, loss of taste or smell, headache, fever, and chills were more prevalent in the first period (P < .001, P = .026, P = .034, P = .001, and P < .001, respectively), while fatigue was more common in the second period (P = .008). The risk of a contact to be infected was three times higher in the second period (relative risk = 3.562 [2.414-5.258]). CONCLUSION: An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in young healthy adults, during a period with high national-wide B.1.1.7 variant prevalence, is characterized by decreased prevalence of fever, loss of taste or smell and GI symptoms, increased reports of fatigue, and more infected contacts for each index case.","output":"B.1.1.7 Variant Outbreak in an Air Force Military BaseReal-World Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In March 2020, the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (ASOPRS) advised the suspension of all non-emergent oculofacial patient care, imparting unprecedented interruptions in fellowship training. METHODS: ASOPRS fellows and program directors were asked to complete an anonymous survey regarding their perceived impact of the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: Forty ASOPRS fellows (70.2%) participated, including 20 first-year and 20 second-year trainees, from all country regions. During the social distancing restrictions, 100% of fellows continued to participate in surgical procedures, including orbital biopsy (77.5%), abscess drainage (55.0%), fracture repair (45.6%), eyelid lesion excision (70.0%) and temporal artery biopsy (57.5%). ASOPRS fellows evaluated patients, including in emergency room (84.6%) and inpatient hospital (76.9%) settings, wearing surgical (85.0%) or N-95 (40.0%) masks, gloves (80.0%) and eye protection (62.5%). Most ASOPRS fellows (87.5%) participated in virtual interinstitutional education sessions and indicated a desire to continue this curriculum. Fellows also used available time for research (85.0%), independent study (77.5%), personal health (70.0%) and social interaction (60.0%). ASOPRS fellows reported COVID-19 restrictions to have a mild (72.5%) to moderate (27.5%) impact on their overall training, and most (75.0%) felt their surgical confidence to decline.

METHODS: A search was conducted in the PubMed and PubMed Central databases using the terms \\"mental health,\\" \\"psychiatric disorders,\\" \\"COVID-19\\", \\"coronavirus,\\" \\"Asia,\\" \\"Africa,\\" \\"Lower Middle-income countries.\\" All articles published in the English language until 3(rd) July 2020 were included. RESULT: A total of 133 papers were found in lower-middle-income countries of Africa (n = 11) and Asia (n = 122), which discussed various aspects of mental health in the context of COVID-19. Most of the studies are cross-sectional studies that addressed mental morbidities, psychological reactions, stress, coping among the general population, and focused groups (healthcare workers, students, elderly, patients). Researchers attempted to develop and validate tools that measure certain psychological constructs (fear, anxiety) concerning COVID-19. Online surveys were the primary modality of researching this COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 related mental health research is scarce in lower-middle-income countries of Africa and Asia.

How Nsp15 recognizes and cleaves RNA is not well understood and is the subject of this study. Based on the analysis of RNA products separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, Nsp15 has been reported to cleave both 5 and 3 of the uridine.1., 2. We used several RNAs, including some with nucleotide analogs, and mass spectrometry to determine that Nsp15 cleaves only 3 of the recognition uridylate, with some cleavage 3 of cytidylate. A highly conserved RNA structure in the 3 non-translated region of the SARS virus was cleaved preferentially at one of the unpaired uridylate bases, demonstrating that both RNA structure and base-pairing can affect cleavage by Nsp15. Several modified RNAs that are not cleaved by Nsp15 can bind Nsp15 as competitive inhibitors. The RNA binding affinity of Nsp15 increased with the content of uridylate in substrate RNA and the co-factor Mn(2+). The hexameric form of Nsp15 was found to bind RNA in solution. A two-dimensional crystal of Nsp15 in complex with RNA showed that at least two RNA molecules could be bound per hexamer. Furthermore, an 8.3 ? structure of Nsp15 was developed using cyroelectron microscopy, allowing us to generate a model of the Nsp15-RNA complex.","output":"RNA Recognition and Cleavage by the SARS Coronavirus Endoribonuclease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the viral agent responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronaviruses Spike proteins are responsible for their ability to interact with host membrane receptors and different proteins have been identified as SARS-CoV-2 interactors, among which Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and Basigin2/EMMPRIN/CD147 (CD147). CD147 plays an important role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections. In particular, SARS-CoV recognizes the CD147 receptor expressed on the surface of host cells by its nucleocapsid protein binding to cyclophilin A (CyPA), a ligand for CD147. However, the involvement of CD147 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still debated. Interference with both the function (blocking antibody) and the expression (knock down) of CD147 showed that this receptor partakes in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provided additional clues on the underlying mechanism: CD147 binding to CyPA does not play a role; CD147 regulates ACE2 levels and both receptors are affected by virus infection. Altogether, these findings suggest that CD147 is involved in SARS-CoV-2 tropism and represents a possible therapeutic target to challenge COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Entry: At the Crossroads of CD147 and ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has disrupted the social, economic, and health care systems in the United States and shined a spotlight on the burden of disease associated with social determinants of health (SDOH).

We present a conceptual framework to examine the differential effects of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on SDOH across demographically diverse populations, focusing on the short\\\\ and long\\\\term development of cardiovascular disease, as well as future research opportunities for cardiovascular disease prevention. The COVID\\\\19 pandemic exerted negative shifts in SDOH and cardiovascular risk factors (ie, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, dietary behavior, cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar). For example, evidence suggests that unemployment and food insecurity have increased, whereas health care access and income have decreased; changes to SDOH have resulted in increases in loneliness and processed food consumption, as well as decreases in physical activity and hypertension management. We found that policy measures enacted to mitigate economic, social, and health issues inadequately protected populations. Low\\\\income and racial and ethnic minority communities, historically underserved populations, were not only disproportionately adversely affected by the pandemic but also less likely to receive assistance, likely attributable in part to the deep structural inequities pervasive in our society.

The present study surveyed top problems experienced by adolescents and young adults (A/YAs) with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify possible reasons for symptom escalation and potential targets for intervention. We also explored perceived benefits of the pandemic for A/YAs with ADHD. METHOD: At the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (AprilCJune 2020), we administered self and parent ratings about current and pre-pandemic top problem severity and benefits of the pandemic to a sample of convenience (N = 134 A/YAs with ADHD participating in a prospective longitudinal study). RESULTS: The most common top problems reported in the sample were social isolation (parent-report: 26.7%; self-report: 41.5%), difficulties engaging in online learning (parent-report: 23.3%, self-report: 20.3%), motivation problems (parent-report: 27.9%), and boredom (self-report: 21.3%). According to parent (d = 0.98) and self-report (d = 1.33), these top problems were more severe during the pandemic than in prior months. Contrary to previous speculation, there was no evidence that pandemic-related changes mitigated ADHD severity. Multi-level models indicated that A/YAs with higher IQs experienced severer top problems exacerbations at the transition to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: For A/YAs with ADHD, several risk factors for depression and school dropout were incurred during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In order to determine the effects of multiple vaccination schedules on the immune system of racing greyhounds, three litters of greyhound pups raised in laboratory conditions were divided into two groups and subjected to either a maximum or a minimum vaccination schedule. Blood samples were collected biweekly for 6 months beginning at 2 weeks of age and analyzed to establish baseline values for the lymphatic system of greyhounds. Lymphocyte transformation, total and differential leukocyte counts, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cellular immunity. Humoral immunity was evaluated using serum neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests. Proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) was higher for the maximum vaccination groups. The frequency distribution of circulating CD4 and IgG labeled lymphocytes was higher in the minimum vaccination groups. A significant treatment by time interaction in CD4, IgG, and IgM labeled cells was observed. This interaction, however, was not significant at any point in time for CD4 and IgG labeled cells. The percentage of lymphocytes expressing surface IgM was significantly higher in the minimum vaccination groups at 10 and 14 weeks of age. No significant differences were detected in humoral immunity between the maximum and minimum groups of each litter.

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a cosmopolitan pest of stored cereal grains and other commodities globally. Infestations caused by S. oryzae makes grains unsuitable for consumption, processing, and export. Deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used in major grain storages in India as a prophylactic treatment to control this pest. However, recurrent use of this insecticide had led to genetic resistance in S. oryzae, questioning its ongoing use at the current recommended concentration. RESULTS Dose response analysis of resistant (Delta-R) and susceptible (Lab-S) strains of S. oryzae collected from grain storages across southern India, revealed that Delta-R was 134-fold more resistant than the Lab-S at LC50 . A concentration of 180 ppm over 48 h effectively discriminated 16 resistant field populations from Lab-S with per cent resistance ranging from 8.72 to 75.86%. Exposing all the resistant populations to 1000 ppm over 48 h identified twelve populations with strongly resistant individuals and confirmed the existence of two distinct resistance phenotypes, 'weak' and 'strong' in S. oryzae. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the vgsc gene in Delta-R identified a single target site mutation, T929I conferring resistance in S. oryzae. CAPS marker analysis of this allele confirmed that frequency of resistance is high (up to 0.96) supporting the results of phenotypic analysis. CONCLUSION Both phenotype and molecular marker analyses clearly demonstrated that deltamethrin at 180 and 1000 ppm can be used to discriminate weakly and strongly resistant populations in S. oryzae, respectively. Resistance diagnostics based on the mutation, T929I, supports our phenotypic data and indicates that resistance to deltamethrin in S. oryzae is prevalent in southern parts of India, stressing the need to identify a synergist or suitable alternatives.

It was first detected in the Wuhan city of China and has spread globally resulting in a substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified different aspects of this disease. There have been no published systematic reviews that combine clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic, and mortality findings. Also, the effect of gender on the outcomes of COVID-19 has not been well-defined. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to May 29, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. P &lt; 0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias. Results: Out of 1,223 studies, 34 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 5,057 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5C87.6) and cough (65.2%, CI 58.6C71.2) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5%, CI 12.7C24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9%, CI 6.0C23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0%, CI 54.3C84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0C62.4) were the most common.

It uses data from the National Expert Survey (NESCGEM). A total of 1771 national entrepreneurship experts representing 44 countries were included in the analysis. Using Laeven and Valencia (2013)s criteria, 20 countries were considered as most affected by the global economic crisis (group 1) and 24 as less affected (included in group 2) in order to test if opportunity perceptions are significantly affected in times of recovery. In terms of findings, the study confirms that institutional factor conditions strongly impact on the opportunity to create a new business regardless of how damaged the economy of countries hit by the crisis was. Among the six institutional factors studied, four are found to be statistically significant and two are partially significant. The interacting effects of systemic banking crisis and the exposure to international conditions kept the previous relationship relatively unchanged. In terms of contributions, the study first highlights the importance of the institutional view in explaining the opportunities to start-up in the aftermath of a crisis. Second, the study compares the proposed relationships between four sub-sample data sets based on trade openness and banking crisis severity. From a practical and government perspective, this study provides a useful picture of the yet limited understanding of the role that institutions and trade openness can play in entrepreneurs perceptions and thus in economic recovery dynamics.","output":"The opportunity to create a business: Systemic banking crisis, institutional factor conditions and trade openness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>This study aims to understand the eHealth literacy skills of chronic patients and to explore the relations, patterns between eHealth literacy skills and different factors such as demographics, search strategies and health information sources and to explain their effects on eHealth literacy in Turkey in Izmir in COVID-19 outbreak.Design/methodology/approach>A quantitative method was used in the study including a questionnaire.

The incidence of NEC is reduced when infants are fed human milk. However, in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), it is standard practice to freeze and/or pasteurize human milk, which deactivates bioactive components that may offer additional protective benefits. Indeed, our pilot study showed that one feed of fresh mothers own milk per day was safe, feasible, and can reduce morbidity in preterm infants. To further evaluate the benefits of fresh human milk in the NICU, a randomized controlled trial is needed. METHODS: Our prospective multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial will include infants born at < 30 weeks gestation and admitted to one of 29 tertiary NICUs in China. Infants in the intervention (fresh human milk) group (n = 1549) will receive at least two feeds of fresh human milk (i.e., within 4 h of expression) per day from the time of enrollment until 32 weeks corrected age or discharge to home. Infants in the control group (n = 1549) will receive previously frozen human milk following the current standard protocols. Following informed consent, enrolled infants will be randomly allocated to the control or fresh human milk groups. The primary outcome is the composite outcome mortality or NEC  stage 2 at 32 weeks corrected age, and the secondary outcomes are mortality, NEC  stage 2, NEC needing surgery, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), weight gain, change in weight, increase in length, increase in head circumference, time to full enteral feeds, and finally, the number and type of critical incident reports, including feeding errors. DISCUSSION: Our double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial aims to examine whether fresh human milk can improve infant outcomes. The results of this study will impact both Chinese and international medical practice and feeding policy for preterm infants. In addition, data from our study will inform changes in health policy in NICUs across China, such that mothers are encouraged to enter the NICU and express fresh milk for their infants.

Implementing and ensuring conformity to standard precautions, particularly best hand hygiene practices, is regarded as one of the most important and cheapest strategies for preventing HCAIs. However, despite consistent efforts at increasing conformity to standard hand hygiene practices at hospitals, research has repeatedly documented low conformity levels amongst staff, patients and visitors alike. AIM The behavioural sciences have documented the potential of adjusting seemingly irrelevant contextual features in order to 'nudge' people to conform to desirable behaviours such as hand hygiene compliance (HHC). In this field experiment we investigate the effect on HHC amongst visitors upon entry of a hospital by varying such features. METHODS Over 50 days, we observed the HHC of a total of 46,435 hospital visitors upon their entry to the hospital in a field experimental design covering eight variations over the salience, placement and assertion of the hand sanitiser in the foyer, including the presence of the yearly national HHC campaign and a follow up during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS Our experiment found that varying seemingly irrelevant features increased HHC from a baseline of 0.4% to 19.7% (47.6% during COVID-19). The experiment also found that the national HHC-campaign had no direct statistically significant effect on HHC. CONCLUSION Varying seemingly irrelevant contextual features provides an effective, generic, cheap and easy to scale approach to increasing HHC relative to sanitising one's hands at hospitals.","output":"Nudging hand hygiene compliance: a large-scale field experiment on hospital visitors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An accurate evaluation of computed tomography (CT) chest images is crucial in the early-stage detection of Covid-19. The accuracy of a diagnosis is determined by the imaging modality used and the images' consistency. This paper describes a gradient-based enhancement algorithm (GCE) for CT images that can increase the visibility of the infected region. Using a multi-scale dependent dark pass filter aims to increase contrast while preserving information and edge details of the infected area. Joint occurrence between the edge details and pixel intensities of the input image is calculated to construct a cumulative distribution function (CDF). To obtain the contrast improved image, the CDF is mapped to the uniform distribution. The GCE approach is tested on the CT Covid database, and performance metrics like the contrast improvement index (CII), discrete entropy (DE), and Kullback-Leibler distance (KL-Distance) are used to evaluate the results. Compared to other techniques available in the literature, the GCE approach produces the highest CII and DE values and has more uniformity. To check the suitability of the enhancement algorithm in terms of pre-processing, a pre-trained AlexNet is employed for the classification of Covid-19 images. The finding shows an improvement of 7% in classification accuracy after enhancing the Covid-19 images using the GCE technique.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: An inner city NHS Hospital Trust in London, UK. PARTICIPANTS: All adult inpatients hospitalised with COVID-19 who were referred to Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) for voice and/or swallowing assessment for 2 months from April 2020. INTERVENTIONS: SLT assessment, advice and therapy for dysphonia and dysphagia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence of delirium, neurological presentation, intubation, tracheostomy and proning history were collected, along with type of SLT provided and discharge outcomes. Therapy Outcome Measures (TOMs) were recorded for swallowing and tracheostomy pre/post SLT intervention and GRBAS for voice. RESULTS: 164 patients (104M), age 56.816.7y were included. Half (52.4%) had a tracheostomy, 78.7% had been intubated (mean 156.6days), 13.4% had new neurological impairment and 69.5% were delirious. Individualised compensatory strategies were trialled in all and direct exercises with 11%. Baseline assessments showed marked impairments in dysphagia and voice but there was significant improvement in all during the study (p<0.0001). On average patients started some oral intake 2 days after initial SLT assessment (IQR 0-8) and were eating and drinking normally on discharge but 29.3%(n=29)of those with dysphagia and 56.1% (n=37) of those with dysphonia remained impaired at hospital discharge. 70.9% tracheostomised patients were decannulated, median (IQR) time to decannulation 19 days(16-27).Across all (n=164), 37.3% completed SLT input while inpatients, 23.5% were transferred to another hospital, 17.1% had voice and 7.8% required community follow-up for dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatients with COVID-19 present with significant impairments of voice and swallowing, justifying responsive SLT. Prolonged intubations and tracheostomies were the norm and a minority had new neurological presentations. Patients typically improved with assessment that enabled treatment with individualised compensatory strategies.

Various factors may explain this phenomenon: social factors (changes in human behavior, duration and type of leisure activities and increased tourism in European high-risk areas), ecological factors (e.g., effects of climate change on the tick population and reservoir animals), and technological factors (improved diagnostics, increased medical awareness). Furthermore, the real burden of TBE is not completely known, as the performance of surveillance systems is suboptimal and cases of disease are under-reported in several areas. Given the potentially severe clinical course of the disease, the absence of any antiviral therapy, and the impossibility of interrupting the transmission of the virus in nature, vaccination is the mainstay of prevention and control. TBE vaccines are effective (protective effect of approximately 95% after completion of the basic vaccinationthree doses) and well tolerated. However, their uptake in endemic areas is suboptimal. In the main endemic countries where vaccination is included in the national/regional immunization program (with reimbursed vaccination programs), this decision was driven by a cost-effectiveness assessment (CEA), which is a helpful tool in the decision-making process. All CEA studies conducted have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of TBE vaccination. Unfortunately, CEA is still lacking in many endemic countries, including Italy. In the future, it will be necessary to fill this gap in order to introduce an effective vaccination strategy in endemic areas.

Much research has been undertaken to test, sequence, and analyze genetic risk factors for ADRDs in Caucasian populations, but comparatively little has been done with racial/ethnic minority populations. We conducted a scoping review to examine the nature and extent of the research that has been published about the genetic factors of ADRDs among racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. Design: Using an established scoping review methodological framework, we searched electronic databases for articles describing peer-reviewed empirical studies or Genome-Wide Association Studies that had been published 2005-2018 and focused on ADRD-related genes or genetic factors among underrepresented racial/ethnic minority population in the U.S. Results: Sixty-six articles met the inclusion criteria for full text review. Well-established ADRD genetic risk factors for Caucasian populations including APOE, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 have not been studied to the same degree in minority U.S. populations. Compared to the amount of research that has been conducted with Caucasian populations in the U.S., racial/ethnic minority communities are underrepresented. Conclusion: Given the projected growth of the aging population and incidence of ADRDs, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities, increased focus on this important segment of the population is warranted.

Going beyond a traditional needs assessment by providing projections of local palliative and end-of-life care needs in all conditions over 20 years, the study will support locality commissioning and development of appropriate health care services. STUDY DESIGN: Population-based needs assessment involving secondary analysis of routinely available regional mortality and population data for Central Lancashire (2017). Palliative care need was estimated using three different recognised methods. METHODS: These estimates were combined with routinely available population and mortality projections and observed trends in palliative care need to provide projections up to 2040. RESULTS: Palliative care need in 2017 in Chorley & South Ribble and Greater Preston is estimated to be between 75% (1292) and 97% (1670), and 74.9% (1337) and 95.7% (1710) of all deaths, respectively.

A shift in the age distribution of mortality was observed, with the greatest mortality rates now among younger individuals. In 2003, mortality rates reached maximums at 5.5 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95% credible interval: 4.0C7.6) for males around age 44 and 2.2 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 1.5C3.2) for females around age 51. As of 2020, rates have reached maximums at 67.2 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 55.3C81.5) for males around age 35 and 16.8 deaths per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 12.8C22.0) for females around age 37. Our models estimate that opioid-related mortality among the younger population will continue to grow, and that current conditions could lead to male mortality rates that are more than quadruple those of pre-pandemic estimations. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis may inform a refocusing of public health strategy for reducing rising rates of opioid-related mortality, including effectively reaching both older and younger males, as well as young females, with health and social supports such as treatment and harm reduction measures.","output":"Identifying the changing age distribution of opioid-related mortality with high-frequency data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analysis of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant viruses is a classic method allowing researchers to identify genetic loci involved in viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we report genetic analysis of a ts strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), tsNC11, focusing on the role of mutations in the macrodomain (MAC) and the papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a component of the viral replication complex. Using MHV reverse genetics, we generated a series of mutant viruses to define the contributions of macrodomain- and PLP2-specific mutations to the ts phenotype. Viral replication kinetics and efficiency-of-plating analysis performed at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures revealed that changes in the macrodomain alone were both necessary and sufficient for the ts phenotype. Interestingly, mutations in the PLP2 domain were not responsible for the temperature sensitivity but did reduce the frequency of reversion of macrodomain mutants. Coimmunoprecipitation studies are consistent with an interaction between the macrodomain and PLP2. Expression studies of the macrodomain-PLP2 portion of nsp3 indicate that the ts mutations enhance proteasome-mediated degradation of the protein. Furthermore, we found that during virus infection, the replicase proteins containing the MAC and PLP2 mutations were more rapidly degraded at the nonpermissive temperature than were the wild-type proteins. Importantly, we show that the macrodomain and PLP2 mutant viruses trigger production of type I interferon in vitro and are attenuated in mice, further highlighting the importance of the macrodomain-PLP2 interplay in viral pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emerging human and veterinary pathogens with pandemic potential. Despite the established and predicted threat these viruses pose to human health, there are currently no approved countermeasures to control infections with these viruses in humans. Viral macrodomains, enzymes that remove posttranslational ADP-ribosylation of proteins, and viral multifunctional papain-like proteases, enzymes that cleave polyproteins and remove polyubiquitin chains via deubiquitinating activity, are two important virulence factors. Here, we reveal an unanticipated interplay between the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain that is important for replication and antagonizing the host innate immune response. Targeting the interaction of these enzymes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to treat CoV disease.","output":"Analysis of Coronavirus Temperature-Sensitive Mutants Reveals an Interplay between the Macrodomain and Papain-Like Protease Impacting Replication and Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Risk exposure of motorcyclist could be overwhelming when riding especially without protective wears on Helmet which serves as protection to the most delicate part of the rider comes with different designs and quality in the study area, This study considered two common types of helmet used by the study population with the aim of assessing impact force on the cyclist as well as characterize the same The investigation show that JC Yoli has performance metrics of percent risk, severity index and head acceleration (&lt;1, 73, 245) which guarantee safety of the user The percent risk, severity of accident and head acceleration significantly influence the impact force which can result head injury, spinal cord injury and death of rider involve in an accident This research also suggests the use of helmet that has protective face mask that could prevent the spread of COVID 19 amongst the riders of business motorcyclist","output":"Investigation into the work related hazard from impact force on helmeted motor cyclist in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between serum meteorin-like protein levels and thiol/disulfide balance in patients with COVID-19. METHODS This is a prospective case-control study including 52 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (group 1) and 34 controls (group 2). The present study included patients aged 18 and older who were admitted to the emergency department with symptoms of COVID-19. Meteorin-like protein levels were analyzed using the YL Biont ELISA Kits protocol. Thiol/disulfide balance was studied using the spectrophotometric method. RESULTS There were 35 males and 17 females in group 1, and 20 males and 14 females in group 2. The groups were similar in terms of gender and age (p > 0.05 and p > 0.05, respectively). Meteorin-like protein was significantly lower in group 1 (p < 0.001). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of total thiol level (p > 0.05). Disulfide, disulfide/native thiol ratio, and disulfide/total thiol ratio were significantly higher in group 1 (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Native thiol was higher in group 2 (p = 0.002). Native thiol/total thiol ratio was significantly higher in group 2 (p < 0.001). Disulfide, SS/SH%, SS/TT%, and SH/TT% parameters had remarkably high sensitivity (98.1% for them all) and specificity (85.3% for disulfide and 100% for SS/SH%, SS/TT%, and SH/TT%) in differentiating patients and healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS In this study, thiol/disulfide balance, which is an indicator of oxidative stress, was disturbed in the disulfide direction and meteorin-like protein was significantly lower in patients with COVID-19.

This paper attempts to figure out this contradiction through three players, lymphopenia, glucocorticoids, and apoptosis. Although the literature does not provide a solid explanation, the level of glucocorticoids could determine the ordering between lymphopenia and apoptosis because the administration of high doses of glucocorticoids could lead to lymphopenia whereas low doses of glucocorticoids could benefit patients.

We found that the 15411-nucleotide genome of PL97-1 consisted of a 189-nucleotide 5 noncoding region (NCR), a 15071-nucleotide protein-coding region, and a 151-nucleotide 3NCR, followed by a poly (A) tail. The 5-end of PL97-1 began with 1 ATG ACG TAT AGG12. Comparison of the PL97-1 genome with the 11 fully sequenced PRRSV genomes currently available revealed sequence divergence ranging from 0.3% (the VR-2332-derived vaccine MLV RespPRRS/Repro strain) to 38% (the Dutch Lelystad strain). To better understand the genetic relationships between these different strains, phylogenetic analyses were performed on the full-length PRRSV genomes. Significantly, the phylogenetic tree based on the ORF1b or ORF7 genes most closely resembled the tree based on the full-length genomes. Thus, these single genes will be the most useful in revealing the genetic relationships between the different strains relative to their geographical distribution. Extensive phylogenetic analyses using the ORF7 sequences of 111 PRRSV isolates available revealed that PL97-1 is most closely related to the North American genotype VR-2332, a VR-2332-derived vaccine strain, and Chinese BJ-4. It is distantly related to the European genotype Lelystad. This study provides the largest full-length genome phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV that has been published to date, and supports an earlier genetic grouping of the many temporally and geographically diverse PRRSV strains currently isolated.","output":"Molecular characterization of PL97-1, the first Korean isolate of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is to identify research that has been carried out about cryptocurrency regulation contributions and the current challenges that need to be addressed in future studies.

In particular, intertypic recombination is implicated in the emergence of most pathogenic circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses, which have caused numerous outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis worldwide. Recent experimental studies that relied on recombination cellular systems mimicking natural genetic exchanges between enteroviruses provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms of enterovirus recombination and enabled to define a new model of genetic plasticity for enteroviruses. Homologous intertypic recombinant enteroviruses that were observed in nature would be the final products of a multi-step process, during which precursor nonhomologous recombinant genomes are generated through an initial inter-genomic RNA recombination event and can then evolve into a diversity of fitter homologous recombinant genomes over subsequent intra-genomic rearrangements. Moreover, these experimental studies demonstrated that the enterovirus genome could be defined as a combination of genomic modules that can be preferentially exchanged through recombination, and enabled defining the boundaries of these recombination modules. These results provided the first experimental evidence supporting the theoretical model of enterovirus modular evolution previously elaborated from phylogenetic studies of circulating enterovirus strains.

Almost 30% of lung transplant recipients experience at least one episode of acute cellular rejection (ACR) during the first year after transplant. Acute cellular rejection, lymphocytic bronchiolitis, and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) are all risk factors for the subsequent development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Acute cellular rejection and lymphocytic bronchiolitis have well-defined histopathologic diagnostic criteria and grading. The diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection after lung transplantation requires a multidisciplinary approach. Antibody-mediated rejection may cause acute allograft failure.

Both enzymatic activities appear to be essential for the viral life cycle and thus may be targeted for anti-viral therapeutics. NSP14 forms a stable complex with the SARS-CoV-2 zinc binding protein NSP10, and this interaction greatly enhances the nuclease but not the methyltransferase activity. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 in the absence of NSP10 to 1.7 [A] resolution. Comparisons of this structure with the structure of NSP14/NSP10 complexes solved to date reveal significant conformational changes that occur within the NSP14 ExoN domain upon binding of NSP10, including significant movements and helix to coil transitions that facilitate the formation of the ExoN active site and provide an explanation of the stimulation of nuclease activity by NSP10. Conformational changes are also seen in the MTase active site within a SAM/SAH interacting loop that plays a key role in viral mRNA capping.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK implemented a furlough scheme to prevent job loss. We examine how furlough was associated with participants smoking, vaping and alcohol consumption behaviours in the early stages of the pandemic. MethodsData were from 27,841 participants in eight UK adult longitudinal surveys. Participants self-reported employment status and current smoking, current vaping and drinking alcohol (>4 days/week or 5+ drinks per typical occasion) both before and during the pandemic (April-July 2020). Risk ratios were estimated within each study using modified Poisson regression, adjusting for a range of potential confounders, including pre-pandemic behaviour. Findings were synthesised using random effects meta-analysis. Sub-group analyses were used to identify whether associations differed by gender, age or education. ResultsCompared to stable employment, neither furlough, no longer being employed, nor stable unemployment were associated with smoking, vaping or drinking, following adjustment for pre-pandemic characteristics. However, some sex differences in these associations were observed, with stable unemployment associated with smoking for women (ARR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.00-1.82; I2: 47%) but not men (0.84; 95% CI: 0.67-1.05; I2: 0%).

Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of lactating healthcare workers who received the BNT162b2 vaccine and their infants. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, antibody isotypes (IgG, IgA, IgM) and intact mRNA in serum and breastmilk was evaluated at multiple time points using a surrogate neutralizing assay, ELISA, and PCR, over a 6 week period of the two-dose vaccination given 21 days apart. Results Thirty-five lactating mothers, median age 34 years (IQR 32-36), were included. All had detectable neutralizing antibodies in the serum immediately before dose 2, with significant increase in neutralizing antibody levels 7 days after this dose [median 168.4 IU/ml (IQR 100.7-288.5) compared to 2753.0 IU/ml (IQR 1627.0-4712.0), p <0.001]. Through the two vaccine doses, all mothers had detectable IgG1, IgA and IgM isotypes in their serum, with a notable increase in all three antibody isotypes after dose 2, especially IgG1 levels. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in majority of breastmilk samples a week after dose 2 [median 13.4 IU/ml (IQR 7.0-28.7)], with persistence of these antibodies up to 3 weeks after. Post the second vaccine dose, all (35/35, 100%) mothers had detectable breastmilk SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD-specific IgG1 and IgA antibody and 32/35 (88.6%) mothers with IgM.

It has become a global pandemic and its frequent mutations may pose new challenges for vaccine design. During viral infection, the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds the human host cell receptor ACE2, enabling the virus to enter the host cell. Both the Spike and ACE2 are densely glycosylated, and it is unclear how distinctive glycan types may modulate the interaction of RBD and ACE2. Detailed understanding of these determinants is key for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To this end, we perform extensive all-atom simulations of the (i) RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans, (ii) RBD-ACE2 with oligomannose MAN9 glycans in ACE2, and (iii) RBD-ACE2 with complex FA2 glycans in ACE2. These simulations identify the key residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface that form contacts with higher probabilities, thus providing a quantitative evaluation that complements recent structural studies. Notably, we find that this RBD-ACE2 contact signature is not altered by the presence of different glycoforms, suggesting that RBD-ACE2 interaction is robust. Applying our simulated results, we illustrate how the recently prevalent N501Y mutation may alter specific interactions with host ACE2 that facilitate the virus-host binding. Furthermore, our simulations reveal how the glycan on Asn90 of ACE2 can play a distinct role in the binding and unbinding of RBD. Finally, an energetics analysis shows that MAN9 glycans on ACE2 decrease RBD-ACE2 affinity, while FA2 glycans lead to enhanced binding of the complex.

A particular issue is the detection of genetically diverse pathogens, i.e. human rhinoviruses (HRV) and enteroviruses (HEV) which are frequent causes of FRI. Resequencing Pathogen Microarray technology has demonstrated potential for differential diagnosis of several respiratory pathogens simultaneously, but a high confidence design method to select probes for genetically diverse viruses is lacking. RESULTS: Using HRV and HEV as test cases, we assess a general design strategy for detecting and serotyping genetically diverse viruses. A minimal number of probe sequences (26 for HRV and 13 for HEV), which were potentially capable of detecting all serotypes of HRV and HEV, were determined and implemented on the Resequencing Pathogen Microarray RPM-Flu v.30/31 (Tessarae RPM-Flu). The specificities of designed probes were validated using 34 HRV and 28 HEV strains. All strains were successfully detected and identified at least to species level. 33 HRV strains and 16 HEV strains could be further differentiated to serotype level. CONCLUSION: This study provides a fundamental evaluation of simultaneous detection and differential identification of genetically diverse RNA viruses with a minimal number of prototype sequences. The results demonstrated that the newly designed RPM-Flu v.30/31 can provide comprehensive and specific analysis of HRV and HEV samples which implicates that this design strategy will be applicable for other genetically diverse viruses.","output":"Resequencing microarray probe design for typing genetically diverse viruses: human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incentives of pharmaceutical companies to innovate and how competition affects these incentives has been topical in recent years: for the general public, as evidenced by a patent race at an unprecedented pace during the ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic;and more specifically for competition authorities, as demonstrated for example by the role innovation played in the assessment of the Bayer/Monsanto (2018), Dow/DuPont (2017), and the Novartis/GSK (2015) mergers.

Failure to identify the challenges and problems that students face in the clinical learning environment hinders their effective learning and growth. Consequently, the progress of their skills is affected. The aim of this study was to develop a challenge in the clinical education environment of medical students during the outbreak of COVID-19 questionnaire and to test its psychometric properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is part of a larger study that was conducted using a combined consecutive method in Qazvin. In the first stage, a phenomenological study was performed with van Manen's method by interviewing 12 students at Qazvin University. To extract the items of the tool in the second stage, the concept was defined. Ultimately, the psychometric properties of the questionnaire were evaluated with face validity, content validity (quantitative and qualitative), construct validity (exploratory factor analysis), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), and testCretest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient). RESULTS: The initial tool had 70 questions. After validation, 53 items remained in the final questionnaire. Four extracted dimensions were as follows: Inadequate professional competency, Inefficient clinical planning and outcomes of learning-teaching activities, and the challenges related to the stigma of medical staff. Cronbach's alpha for the whole questionnaire was 0.98 (range: 0.87C0.98). The testCretest (intraclass correlation coefficient) reliability was 0.98 (P < 0.001).

Alcohol use and misuse typically initiates during adolescence and generally continues into adulthood. Not only is alcohol the most widely abused drug by adolescents, but it is also one of the most widely abused drugs in the world. In fact, high rates of maternal drinking make developmental ethanol exposure the most preventable cause of neurological deficits in the Western world. Preclinical studies have determined that one of the most consistent effects of ethanol is its disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the severity, persistence, and reversibility of ethanols effects on hippocampal neurogenesis are dependent on developmental stage of exposure and age at assessment. Complicating the neurodevelopmental effects of ethanol is the concurrent development and maturation of neuromodulatory systems which regulate neurogenesis, particularly the cholinergic system. Cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus directly regulates hippocampal neurogenesis through muscarinic and nicotinic receptor actions and indirectly regulates neurogenesis by providing anti-inflammatory regulatory control over the hippocampal environmental milieu. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate how shifting maturational patterns of the cholinergic system and its regulation of neuroimmune signaling impact ethanols effects on adult neurogenesis. For example, perinatal ethanol exposure decreases basal forebrain cholinergic neuron populations, resulting in long-term developmental disruptions to the hippocampus that persist into adulthood. Exaggerated neuroimmune responses and disruptions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis are evident after environmental, developmental, and pharmacological challenges, suggesting that perinatal ethanol exposure induces neurogenic deficits in adulthood that can be unmasked under conditions that strain neural and immune function. Similarly, adolescent ethanol exposure persistently decreases basal forebrain cholinergic neuron populations, increases hippocampal neuroimmune gene expression, and decreases hippocampal neurogenesis in adulthood. The effects of neither perinatal nor adolescent ethanol are mitigated by abstinence whereas adult ethanol exposure-induced reductions in hippocampal neurogenesis are restored following abstinence, suggesting that ethanol-induced alterations in neurogenesis and reversibility are dependent upon the developmental period. Thus, the focus of this review is an examination of how ethanol exposure across critical developmental periods disrupts maturation of cholinergic and neuroinflammatory systems to differentially affect hippocampal neurogenesis in adulthood.","output":"Cholinergic and Neuroimmune Signaling Interact to Impact Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Alcohol Pathology Across Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 in children, or pediatric COVID-19, initially was described as an acute respiratory syndrome similar to the adult presentation but with less severe manifestations.

The impact assessment requires socioeconomic scenarios, including a long-term outlook for demographic and economic indices. In Japan, the National Institute for Environmental Studies developed the Japan Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (JPNSSPs) and presented regional population scenarios corresponding to five different storylines. However, there exists no quantitative information about changes in local economies under the population scenarios. This study examines the economic activities in Japan's 47 prefectures using statistical models and calculates changes in the major economic indices (e.g., production, capital stock, and labor population) until 2100. The economic projection is based on ten socioeconomic scenarios generated from the JPNSSP population scenarios and original productivity scenarios. The economic projection results clearly show that Japan's population aging and decline have catastrophic impacts on national and subnational economies. Even in the most optimistic scenario, assuming a massive influx of immigrants and fast productivity growth, the GDP growth rate becomes negative in the 2090s. In the most pessimistic scenario, the GDP growth rate becomes negative in 2028 and continues to decline. As a result, Japan's GDP decreases to the level of the 1970s by 2100. The improvement of productivity cannot offset the GDP shrink caused by demographic changes. Furthermore, the population aging and decline accelerate the wealth concentration in urban areas. The Theil index, calculated using the economic projection results, shows increasing trends in all the scenarios. Tokyo's presence in Japan's economy will continue to increase throughout this century. Meanwhile, Kanagawa and Saitama, which belong to the top five prefectures in terms of economic production, may lose their positions. The Tohoku region, already suffering from population decline, will face severe economic stagnation.

METHODS The experience of a surgeon with the first 50 laparoscopic hepatectomies for cancer was reviewed retrospectively. All cases begun with the intention to complete the hepatectomy laparoscopically were included in the laparoscopic group. RESULTS From November 2008 to October 2010, a total of 57 hepatectomies were performed, with 53 attempted laparoscopically. Of these 57 hepatectomies, 46 (87%) were completed laparoscopically, 4 (7%) required hand assistance, and 3 (6%) were converted to an open approach.

Scribble acts in concert with Disc-large (Dlg) and Lethal-2-giant larvae (Lgl) to form the Scribble polarity complex, and its functional dysregulation is associated with poor prognosis during viral infections. Viruses have been shown to interfere with Scribble by targeting Scribble PDZ domains to subvert the network of interactions that enable normal control of cell polarity via Scribble, as well as the localisation of the Scribble module within the cell.

A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence rate (PR), risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for both effect measures. Cochrane chi-square test statistic Q, [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] tests were used to measure the presence of heterogeneity. Publication bias and sensitivity of the included studies were also tested. RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, a total of 58 studies with 122,191 patients were analyzed. The pooled prevalence rate of mortality among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 18.88%, 95% CI (16.46C21.30), p < 0.001. Highest mortality was found in Europe [PR 26.85%, 95% CI (19.41C34.29), p < 0.001] followed by North America [PR 21.47%, 95% CI (16.27C26.68), p < 0.001] and Asia [PR 14.83%, 95% CI (12.46- 17.21), p < 0.001]. An significant association were found between mortality among COVID-19 infected patients and older age (> 65 years vs. < 65 years) [RR 3.59, 95% CI (1.87C6.90), p < 0.001], gender (male vs. female) [RR 1.63, 95% CI (1.43C1.87), p < 0.001], ICU admitted patients [RR 3.72, 95% CI (2.70C5.13), p < 0.001], obesity [RR 2.18, 95% CI (1.10C4.34), p < 0.05], hypertension [RR 2.08,95% CI (1.79C2.43) p < 0.001], diabetes [RR 1.87, 95% CI (1.23C2.84), p < 0.001], cardiovascular disease [RR 2.51, 95% CI (1.20C5.26), p < 0.05], and cancer [RR 2.31, 95% CI (1.80C2.97), p < 0.001]. In addition, significant association for high risk of mortality were also found for cerebrovascular disease, COPD, coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, chronic lung disease and chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis revealed that the mortality rate among COVID-19 patients was highest in the European region and older age, gender, ICU patients, patients with comorbidity had a high risk for case fatality. Those findings would help the health care providers to reduce the mortality rate and combat this pandemic to save lives using limited resources.

ICT based learning methods have been widely applicable to this date. The study has been conducted to investigate the level of technologies used by instructors, assessment criteria for teachers in distance learning environment, challenges faced by instructors in terms of the integration of teaching technology and lastly challenges faced by students in distance learning programs in Lebanon. In order to investigate these specific objectives, a study has been conducted where primary data has been gathered using questionnaires distributed electronically amongst a sample of 90 students and 90 teachers, using random sampling methods with an adequate ethical consent. Data gathered from questionnaires has been analyzed using descriptive statistics and frequency distribution using Ms Excel. Findings of the study suggest that students in Lebanon are facing numerous issues during their transition from conventional learning to e-learning including accessibility to Internet, Computer, Learning Resources (e.g. Books and Curriculum), Electricity (e.g. Load shedding), Seating Arrangements at Home (e.g. chair, desk, table) and noise distraction at home (e.g. dog barking, child crying). Furthermore, findings suggest that challenges faced by teachers include communicating with school management, electricity disruption, noise distraction challenge, children's participation in online classes, confusion when assessing students' performance, difficulties using ICT based technology, frequent communication with parents, attention distraction and lack of personalized attention. Findings of this study pose significant recommendations for the ministry of education and for school authorities to overcome these issues. Copyright ? 2021. Chirine Khalil NASSAR.

The viral infection in humans is initiated by binding of RBD (receptor binding domain) of spike protein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor protein. In this computational study, milk-derived peptides are screened against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of spike protein of the virus. Milk is considered as one of the most nutrient-rich liquid foods having several antibacterial and antiviral activities. Milk derived peptides including Casein and Whey derived peptides are known to have profound anti-viral and immunomodulatory activities. After extensive literature search, some peptides having anti-viral activities against different viruses, are shortlisted for this study and their three-dimensional structures are modelled for protein-peptide docking against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD. After performing protein-peptide docking and protein-protein docking using different servers such as HPEPDOCK, FIREDOCK, HADDOCK, HDOCK, it has been observed that in presence of the peptides, the interaction between spike RBD and hACE2 has been reasonably decreased, which implies that milk-derived peptides can be potential peptide-inhibitors against the RBD of the virus along with other medications. Further studies on milk-derived peptides should be performed to develop peptide drugs based on milk-derived peptides.","output":"In silico studies on milk derived peptides as potential inhibitors against SARS CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyses organizational change and new ways of working in one of our most institutionalized and professionalized contextsthe courts.

In particular, we do not know how COVID-19 has influenced the motivation and implementation of digitalized work. This article draws on a large Swedish administrative court and its attempts to digitalize its work starting in 2018. We find that several barriers first inhibited a successful transformation of work practices. These barriers were connected to the institution of the court and the institutionalized profession of judges, which worked together in preventing organizational change. However, COVID-19 radically accelerated the digital implementation of work practices and gave rise to two separate re-assessment processes. The first established new motivations for digitalized work, and the second allowed for a new perception of value in digital work. These processes effectively broke down perceived barriers and substantially facilitated a more successful digital transformation of working practices.","output":"Getting on track for digital work: Digital transformation in an administrative court before and during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) created a global pandemic that continues to this day.

Objective: To estimate the mean change in state-level COVID-19 epidemic growth before versus after the implementation of statewide social distancing measures. Design: Interrupted time-series analysis. Setting: United States. Measurements: Our primary exposure was time in relation to implementation of the first statewide social distancing measure. The pre-implementation period began 14 days prior to implementation and included up to 3 days after implementation to account for incubation. Post-implementation began 4 days after, up to and including March 30. Our primary outcome was the COVID-19 growth rate, calculated as the log of daily COVID-19 cases minus the log of daily COVID-19 cases on the prior day. Results: All states applied some form of statewide social distancing between March 10-27. The mean daily COVID-19 growth rate decreased beginning four days after implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures, by an additional 0.8% per day; 95% CI, -1.4% to -0.2%; P=0.002). This reduction corresponds to an increase in doubling time of the epidemic from 3.3 days (before) to 5.0 days (at 14 days after implementation). Limitations: Potential bias due to the aggregate nature of the ecological data, potential confounding by contemporaneous changes (e.g., increases in testing), and potential underestimation of social distancing due to spillovers across neighboring states. Conclusion: Statewide social distancing measures were associated with a decrease in U.S. COVID-19 epidemic growth. Based on the size of the epidemic at the time of implementation in each state, social distancing measures were associated with a decrease of 3,090 cases at 7 days, and 68,255 cases at 14 days, after implementation.","output":"Social distancing to slow the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic: an interrupted time-series analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Minamata Convention on Mercury (ref. 1) is a global treaty to protect human and environmental health from adverse effects of the toxic element mercury and its compounds.

This \\"cytokine storm\\" produces an excessive inflammatory and immune response, especially in the lungs, leading to acute respiratory distress (ARDS), pulmonary edema and multi-organ failure. Alleviating this inflammatory state is crucial to improve prognosis. Pro-inflammatory factors play a central role in COVID-19 severity, especially in patients with comorbidities. In these situations, an overactive, untreated immune response can be deadly, suggesting that mortality in COVID-19 cases is likely due to this virally driven hyperinflammation. Administering immunomodulators has not yielded conclusive improvements in other pathologies characterized by dysregulated inflammation such as sepsis, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS. The success of these drugs at reducing COVID-19-driven inflammation is still anecdotal and comes with serious risks. It is also imperative to screen the elderly for risk factors that predispose them to severe COVID-19. Immunosenescence and comorbidities should be taken into consideration. In this review, we summarize the latest data available about the role of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 disease severity as well as potential therapeutic approaches to ameliorate it.

For children aged 5C17 years, the risk ratio for the first week of a school session was 1.12 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93C1.34), the second week of a session was 1.39 (95% CI 1.15C1.68) and more than 2 weeks into a session was 1.43 (95% CI 1.20C1.71). Less significant increased risk ratios were also observed in young children (0C4 years) and adults (18C64 years). These results were obtained after modelling for baseline seasonal variations in disease prevalence and controlling for short-term changes in ambient temperature and relative humidity. Understanding the mechanisms of seasonality make it easier to predict outbreaks and launch timely public health interventions.","output":"School sessions are correlated with seasonal outbreaks of medically attended respiratory infections: electronic health record time series analysis, Wisconsin 2004C2011"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing antibody responses to coronaviruses mainly target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the trimeric spike.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective single-center analysis of 192 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from March to May of 2020. AKI was diagnosed using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) classification based on serum creatinine (SCr) criteria. Persistent and Transient AKI were defined according to the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) workgroup definitions. Results: In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, 55.2% developed AKI (n=106). The majority of AKI patients had persistent AKI (n=64, 60.4%).

It affected economies, stopped travel, and isolated individuals and populations around the world. Wildlife, especially bats, serve as reservoirs of coronaviruses from which the variant Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged that causes COVID-19. In this review, we describe the current knowledge on COVID-19 and the significance of wildlife hosts in its emergence. Mammalian and avian coronaviruses have diverse host ranges with distinct lineages of coronaviruses. Recombination and reassortments occur more frequently in mixed-animal markets where diverse viral genotypes intermingle. Human coronaviruses have evolved through gene gains and losses primarily in interfaces where wildlife and humans come in frequent contact. There is a gap in our understanding of bats as reservoirs of coronaviruses and there is a misconception that bats periodically transmit coronaviruses to humans. Future research should investigate bat viral diversity and loads at interfaces between humans and bats. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to evaluate viral strains circulating in mixed animal markets, where the coronaviruses circulated before becoming adapted to humans. We propose and discuss a management intervention plan for COVID-19 and raise questions on the suitability of current containment plans. We anticipate that more virulent coronaviruses could emerge unless proper measures are taken to limit interactions between diverse wildlife and humans in wild animal markets.","output":"Exploring human-animal host interactions and emergence of COVID-19: evolutionary and ecological dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laboratory diagnosis of the COVID-19 relies on RT-PCR to amplify specific fragments of SARS-CoV-2 genome.

We propose a statistical learning strategy (SLS) for identifying and spatiotemporally tracking potentially relevant Spike protein mutations. We analyzed 167,893 Spike protein sequences from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the United States (excluding 21,391 sequences from VOI/VOC strains) deposited at GISAID from 19 January 2020 to 15 March 2021. Alignment against the reference Spike protein sequence led to the identification of viral residue variants (VRVs), i.e., residues harboring a substitution compared to the reference strain. Next, generalized additive models were applied to model VRV temporal dynamics and to identify VRVs with significant and substantial dynamics (false discovery rate q-value < 0.01; maximum VRV proportion >10% on at least one day). Unsupervised learning was then applied to hierarchically organize VRVs by spatiotemporal patterns and identify VRV-haplotypes. Finally, homology modeling was performed to gain insight into the potential impact of VRVs on Spike protein structure. We identified 90 VRVs, 71 of which had not previously been observed in a VOI/VOC, and 35 of which have emerged recently and are durably present. Our analysis identified 17 VRVs ~91 days earlier than their first corresponding VOI/VOC publication. Unsupervised learning revealed eight VRV-haplotypes of four VRVs or more, suggesting two emerging strains (B1.1.222 and B.1.234). Structural modeling supported a potential functional impact of the D1118H and L452R mutations.

The initial sample consists of 8,874 COVID-19 patients ascertained from the pandemic's onset to June 12th, 2020 and was created for the analyses shown here. We gathered demographic, lifestyle, laboratory, and clinical data from patient's encounters across the healthcare system. Tobacco use history was examined as a potential risk factor for COVID-19 fatality along with age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and number of comorbidities. Of the 8,874 patients included in the cohort, 475 died from COVID-19. Of the 5,356 patients who had information on history of tobacco use, over 26% were current or former tobacco users. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the odds of COVID-19 fatality increased among those who were older (odds ratio = 1.07, 95% CI 1.06, 1.08), male (1.91, 95% CI 1.58, 2.31), and had a history of tobacco use (2.45, 95% CI 1.93, 3.11).

This study aims to develop a simple tool that can significantly help the effective prioritisation of the workload among the Medicines Optimisation Team, ensuring patient-centred care is optimised. METHODS This is an observational case series study. A basic Excel spreadsheet was designed to capture the team's daily interventions focusing on four main areas: medicines reconciliation, admission, follow-up and discharge. We named it the Medicines Optimisation Interventions Tracking Tool (MOITT). RESULTS Analysis of the data showed a good number of patients receiving interventions: 122 (92%) medicines reconciliation, 77 (58%) admission interventions, 64 (48%) follow-up interventions and 28 (21%) interventions on discharge. This quantification of work revealed factors which prevent achieving a higher percentage of interventions. The criteria to complete the spreadsheet were modified accordingly to address these factors resulting in an improvement in the design of the tool and the protocol to follow to complete it.

Around 70% of the coronavirus positive-sense single-stranded RNA encodes proteins involved in replication, and these viruses essentially take over the biosynthetic and transport mechanisms to ensure the efficient replication of their genome and trafficking of their virions. Some coronaviruses encode genes for ion-channel proteins - the envelope protein E (orf4a), orf3a and orf8 - which they successfully employ to take control of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex intermediate compartment or ERGIC. The E protein, which is one of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, assembles its transmembrane protomers into homopentameric channels with mild cationic selectivity. Orf3a forms homodimers and homotetramers. Both carry a PDZ-binding domain, lending them the versatility to interact with more than 400 target proteins in infected host cells. Orf8 is a very short 29-amino-acid single-passage transmembrane peptide that forms cation-selective channels when assembled in lipid bilayers.

METHODS: Linkage\\\\specific sialylation derivatization combined with matrix\\\\assisted laser desorption/ionization time\\\\of\\\\flight mass spectrometry detection and automated data processing was employed to analyze the plasma N\\\\glycome of two independent type\\\\1 HAE cohorts. RESULTS: HAE patients had abnormal glycan complexity, galactosylation, and 2,3\\\\ and 2,6\\\\linked sialylation compared to healthy controls (HC). The classification models based on dysregulated glycan traits could successfully discriminate between HAE and HC with area under the curves (AUCs) being greater than 0.9.

It is important to assess their effectiveness in a real-world setting. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 136,532 individuals in the Mayo Clinic health system (Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin) with PCR testing data between December 1, 2020 and April 20, 2021. We compared clinical outcomes for a vaccinated cohort of 68,266 individuals who received at least one dose of either vaccine (nBNT162b2 = 51,795; nmRNA-1273 = 16,471) and an unvaccinated control cohort of 68,266 individuals propensity-matched based on relevant demographic, clinical, and geographic features. We estimated real-world vaccine effectiveness by comparing incidence rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and COVID-19 associated hospitalization and ICU admission starting 7 days after the second vaccine dose. Findings The real-world vaccine effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection was 86.1% (95% CI: 82.4-89.1%) for BNT162b2 and 93.3% (95% CI: 85.7-97.4%) for mRNA-1273. BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were 88.8% (95% CI: 75.5-95.7%) and 86.0% (95% CI: 71.6-93.9%) effective in preventing COVID-19 associated hospitalization. Both vaccines were 100% effective (95% CIBNT162b2: 51.4-100%; 95% CImRNA-1273: 43.3-100%) in preventing COVID-19 associated ICU admission.

We estimated the absolute and proportional COVID-19 hospitalizations in US adults attributable to 4 major US cardiometabolic conditions, separately and jointly, and by race/ethnicity, age, and sex. METHODS AND RESULTS We used the best available estimates of independent associations of cardiometabolic conditions with a risk of COVID-19 hospitalization; nationally representative data on cardiometabolic conditions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015 to 2018; and US COVID-19 hospitalizations stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network database and from the COVID Tracking Project to estimate the numbers and proportions of COVID-19 hospitalizations attributable to diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, and heart failure. Inputs were combined in a comparative risk assessment framework, with probabilistic sensitivity analyses and 1000 Monte Carlo simulations to jointly incorporate stratum-specific uncertainties in data inputs. As of November 18, 2020, an estimated 906 849 COVID-19 hospitalizations occurred in US adults. Of these, an estimated 20.5% (95% uncertainty interval [UIs], 18.9-22.1) of COVID-19 hospitalizations were attributable to diabetes mellitus, 30.2% (UI, 28.2-32.3) to total obesity (body mass index &#8805;30 kg/m2), 26.2% (UI, 24.3-28.3) to hypertension, and 11.7% (UI, 9.5-14.1) to heart failure. Considered jointly, 63.5% (UI, 61.6-65.4) or 575 419 (UI, 559 072-593 412) of COVID-19 hospitalizations were attributable to these 4 conditions. Large differences were seen in proportions of cardiometabolic risk-attributable COVID-19 hospitalizations by age and race/ethnicity, with smaller differences by sex. CONCLUSIONS A substantial proportion of US COVID-19 hospitalizations appear attributable to major cardiometabolic conditions.

Because of the potentially dangerous amplification circuit between inflammation and tissue damage, NETs are becoming one of the investigated components in the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize studies on the role of NETs in determining the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The study used six databases: PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCOHost, Europe PMC, ProQuest, and Scopus. This literature search was implemented until October 31, 2021. The search terms were determined specifically for each databases, generally included the Neutrophil Extracellular Traps, COVID-19, and prognosis. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was then used to assess the risk of bias. Ten studies with a total of 810 participants were chosen based on the attainment of the prerequisite. Two were of high quality, seven were of moderate quality, and the rest were of low quality. The majority of studies compared COVID-19 to healthy control. Thrombosis was observed in three studies, while four studies recorded the need for mechanical ventilation. In COVID-19 patients, the early NETs concentration or the evolving NETs degradations can predict patient mortality. Based on their interactions with inflammatory and organ dysfunction markers, it is concluded that NETs play a significant role in navigating the severity of COVID-19 patients and thus impacting their prognosis.

These changes can lead to dysphonia, vocal fatigue, decreased volume, and altered pitch. Treatment options for these conditions are limited. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) consists of platelets, growth factors, and cytokines derived from the patient's own blood and is believed to activate tissue regeneration. The purpose of this study was to review the technical aspects of collecting PRP and injecting it into the vocal fold injection - based on our initial experience with this procedure. CASE A patient with vocal fold scar was identified and enrolled in an ongoing prospective clinical trial study of a series of 4 monthly subepithelial vocal fold PRP injections, which was temporarily halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient underwent a single injection of autologous PRP into the left vocal fold. There were no adverse events during the study period. Subjective improvement in voice was noted at 1 month after injection with subsequent return to baseline over the next 4 months. Videostroboscopy performed on postinjection day 1 and day 7 and demonstrated no concerning exam changes. Compared to the preinjection baseline, the patient-reported voice-handicap index-10 (VHI-10) and voice catastrophization index were similar at 4 months following injection (20 to 20 and 4 to 3, respectively). Independent perceptual analysis of voice showed improvement at 4 months postinjection, compared to baseline consensus auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice 60 to 44. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary report was part of a prospective trial investigating the use of PRP to treat vocal fold atrophy and scar.

(3) Cyber operations that exfiltrate data on Covid-19 vaccine research, potentially affecting the development of vaccines that could save many thousands of lives. (4) Cyber operations that destroy or manipulate such data. (5) Cyber operations against hospitals or against critical infrastructure, which directly endanger many lives. (6) Cyber operations against media outlets, which disrupt their activities and inhibit their freedom of expression. (7) Online misinformation operations for various purposes, for example to manipulate the outcome of an election or to destroy public trust in state institutions during the pandemic.

(CoV)-2 infection on pregnancy is still unclear. The presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 (ACE2), the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in human placentas indicates that this organ can be vulnerable for viral infection during pregnancy. However, for this to happen, additional molecular processes are critical to allow viral entry in cells, its replication and disease manifestation, particularly in the placenta and/or fetoCmaternal circulation. Beyond the risk of vertical transmission, COVID-19 is also proposed to deplete ACE2 protein and its biological actions in the placenta. It is postulated that such effects may impair essential processes during placentation and maternal hemodynamic adaptations in COVID-19 pregnancy, features also observed in several disorders of pregnancy. This review gathers information indicating risks and protective features related to ACE2 changes in COVID-19 pregnancies. First, we describe the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection having ACE2 as a main entry door and current evidence of viral infection in the placenta. Further, we discuss the central role of ACE2 in physiological systems such as the reninCangiotensin system (RAS) and the kallikreinCkinin system (KKS), both active during placentation and hemodynamic adaptations of pregnancy. Significant knowledge gaps are also identified and should be urgently filled to better understand the fate of ACE2 in COVID-19 pregnancies and the potential associated risks.

Although the molecular spectrum of de novo mutationsthe relative rates at which various base substitutions occurare widely recognized as informative towards understanding the evolution of a viral genome, little attention has been paid to the possibility of using molecular spectra to infer the host origins of a virus. Here, we characterize the molecular spectrum of de novo mutations for SARS-CoV-2 from transcriptomic data obtained from virus-infected cell lines, enabled by the use of sporadic junctions formed during discontinuous transcription as molecular barcodes. We find that de novo mutations are generated in a replication-independent manner, typically on the genomic strand, and highly dependent on mutagenic mechanisms specific to the host cellular environment. De novo mutations will then strongly influence the types of base substitutions accumulated during SARS-CoV-2 evolution, in an asymmetric manner favoring specific mutation types. Consequently, similarities between the mutation spectra of SARS-CoV-2 and the bat coronavirus RaTG13 which have accumulated since their divergence strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 evolved in a host cellular environment highly similar to that of bats before its zoonotic transfer into humans.

RBD + 3M-052-alum induced a significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the respiratory tract upon challenge, accompanied by reduced lung inflammation when compared with unvaccinated controls. Anti-RBD antibody responses in vaccinated animals inversely correlated with viral load in nasal secretions and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). RBD + 3M-052-alum blocked a post-SARS-CoV-2 challenge increase in CD14(+)CD16(++) intermediate blood monocytes, and fractalkine, MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic proteinC1), and TRAIL (tumor necrosis factorCrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand) in the plasma. Decreased plasma analytes and intermediate monocyte frequencies correlated with reduced nasal and BAL viral loads. Last, RBD-specific plasma cells accumulated in the draining lymph nodes and not in the bone marrow, contrary to previous findings. Together, these data show that a yeast-expressed, RBD-based vaccine + 3M-052-alum provides robust immune responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2, making it a strong and scalable vaccine candidate.","output":"A yeast-expressed RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with 3M-052-alum adjuvant promotes protective efficacy in non-human primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Locating the source of an epidemic, or patient zero (P0), can provide critical insights into the infection's transmission course and allow efficient resource allocation. Existing methods use graph-theoretic centrality measures and expensive message-passing algorithms, requiring knowledge of the underlying dynamics and its parameters. In this paper, we revisit this problem using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn P0. We establish a theoretical limit for the identification of P0 in a class of epidemic models. We evaluate our method against different epidemic models on both synthetic and a real-world contact network considering a disease with history and characteristics of COVID-19. % We observe that GNNs can identify P0 close to the theoretical bound on accuracy, without explicit input of dynamics or its parameters. In addition, GNN is over 100 times faster than classic methods for inference on arbitrary graph topologies. Our theoretical bound also shows that the epidemic is like a ticking clock, emphasizing the importance of early contact-tracing.

METHODS: From April 1st to July 31st 2020, the worst period of the pandemic in S?o Paulo, Brazil, the Institute's aortic surgical patients operated on were evaluated and those were compared with patients operated during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: In 2019, 88 surgeries were performed; most of them were elective (66 [75%]), 10 were urgent, and 12 were emergency surgeries. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we operated on only 31 patients, being 74.2% non-elective surgeries (P<0,001). There was a higher mortality for patients operated on during the pandemic surge of COVID-19 (P<0,001), but it was not specifically related to infected patients.

This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.","output":"Characterisation of the transcriptome and proteome of SARS-CoV-2 using direct RNA sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry reveals evidence for a cell passage induced in-frame deletion in the spike glycoprotein that removes the furin-like cleavage site"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Color Duplex sonography (CDS) of temporal arteries and large vessels (LV) is a recently validated diagnostic methodology for Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) CDS combined with a fast-track approach (FTA) has improved the early diagnosis of the disease Objectives: To assess FTA effects on the prevention of permanent visual loss (PVL), relapse and late complications of GCA compared to conventional practice To assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on outcomes of GCA patients assessed with FTA","output":"Fast-Track Ultrasound Clinic for the Diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis Changes the Prognosis of the Disease but Not the Risk of Future Relapse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people aged 10C34 years old. Limited research has documented extant heterogeneities in suicide across the life course and among diverse sociodemographic groups. There is also limited research on the influences of mental health utilization on suicidal trajectories across the life course. This study aims to: (1) identify racial/ethnic, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectional differences in suicidal trajectories among adolescents transitioning to adulthood; and (2) examine influences of mental health service utilization on disparities in suicidal trajectories. The study included 9421 respondents (M(age) = 14.99 [SD = 1.61]) from Waves ICIV National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1994C2008). Latent class growth analyses were used to identify trajectories of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the influences of mental health treatment and sociodemographic characteristics on suicidal trajectories. Three suicidal ideation (low-stable, high-decreasing, moderate-decreasing-increasing) and two suicide attempt (low-stable, moderate-decreasing) trajectories were identified. Compared with the low-stable trajectories, the risks of being in high-decreasing suicidal ideation trajectories were higher among females (AOR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.01C2.13) and sexual minorities (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.21C2.74). Sexual minorities (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.69C4.08) and low-SES adolescents (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.08C2.98) were more likely to be in the moderate-decreasing suicide attempt group.

It is important to develop a platform that enables searching for disability data to expose systemic discrimination and social exclusion, which increase vulnerability to inequitable social conditions. OBJECTIVE: Our project aims to create an accessible and multilingual pilot disability website that structures and integrates data about people with disabilities and provides data for national and international disability advocacy communities. The platform will be endowed with a document upload function with hybrid (automated and manual) paragraph tagging, while the querying function will involve an intelligent natural language search in the supported languages. METHODS: We have designed and implemented a virtual community platform using Wikibase, Semantic Web, machine learning, and web programming tools to enable disability communities to upload and search for disability documents. The platform data model is based on an ontology we have designed following the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The virtual community facilitates the uploading and sharing of validated information, and supports disability rights advocacy by enabling dissemination of knowledge. RESULTS: Using health informatics and artificial intelligence techniques (namely Semantic Web, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques), we were able to develop a pilot virtual community that supports disability rights advocacy by facilitating uploading, sharing, and accessing disability data. The system consists of a website on top of a Wikibase (a Semantic WebCbased datastore). The virtual community accepts 4 types of users: information producers, information consumers, validators, and administrators. The virtual community enables the uploading of documents, semiautomatic tagging of their paragraphs with meaningful keywords, and validation of the process before uploading the data to the disability Wikibase. Once uploaded, public users (information consumers) can perform a semantic search using an intelligent and multilingual search engine (QAnswer). Further enhancements of the platform are planned. CONCLUSIONS: The platform ontology is flexible and can accommodate advocacy reports and disability policy and legislation from specific jurisdictions, which can be accessed in relation to the CRPD articles. The platform ontology can be expanded to fit international contexts. The virtual community supports information upload and search. Semiautomatic tagging and intelligent multilingual semantic search using natural language are enabled using artificial intelligence techniques, namely Semantic Web, machine learning, and natural language processing.","output":"A Virtual Community for Disability Advocacy: Development of a Searchable Artificial IntelligenceCSupported Platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to Paniagua and Rayamajhee's (2021) proposal for a polycentric approach for pandemic governance, Frolov (2022) notes that their paper focuses on preventive measures, and neglects the deeper, cognitive dimension of coproduction.

We have recently found that there was an increase in nightmares during the pandemic in young adults. Since emotions have been associated with both resilience and nightmares, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of resilience and emotional changes in the increase in nightmares observed during the pandemic, in a group of young adults. METHODS: Resilience, emotions and nightmares were assessed using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10, the Differential Emotions Scale-IV and an adapted version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Measures were administered to 209 young adults (18C25 years old, 76.1% females). Hierarchical multiple regression models were computed to examine the unique contribution of changes in positive and negative emotions during the pandemic to the increase in nightmares during the pandemic. Analyses were controlled for nightmares and emotions prior to COVID-19, and for gender. The sample was separated in two groups: resilient and less resilient young adults. RESULTS: Results show that in less resilient young adults, nightmares prior to COVID-19 (=.79, p<.001) and increase in negative emotions (=.21, p=.033) significantly predicted nightmares during the pandemic and explained 67.0% of their variance. In resilient young adults, nightmares prior to COVID-19 (=.56, p<.001) and gender (=-.15, p=.04) significantly predicted nightmares during the pandemic and explained 52.0% of the variance. CONCLUSION: Our results show that increase in negative emotions during the pandemic is associated with an increase in nightmares in less resilient young adults, but not in resilient young adults. Furthermore, our results show that in resilient young adults, being a woman is associated with an increase in nightmares during the pandemic.

About 25% of our 400 AIH-outpatients from various states in Brazil are using hydrochloroquine (HCQ) for maintenance or treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants (IS). The aim is to describe the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with AIH. Methods The diagnosis of COVID was confirmed by positive PCR of nasal swab and/or by serological tests. The diagnosis and treatment of COVID was not always made in our service. Results 33 patients, 85% female, 4113yr; 88% AIH-1; 54.6% with advanced fibrosis (F3/F4); 81.8% with comorbidities (17 overweight/obesity [BMI 31.85.4], 10 arterial hypertension, 8 diabetes, 2 systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE, with renal failure], 1 celiac disease and malnutrition). The most frequent symptoms were cough (20), headache (19), anosmia and myalgia (18), diarrhea (17) and dyspnea (11). IS at infection was 14 azathioprine(AZA)+prednisone(PD), 2 AZA+PD+cyclosporine, 3 Mycophenolate+PD. HCQ was used for maintenance (6) or as a complement of IS (5). Five hospitalized patients received oxygen supplementation (1 endotracheal intubation); 1 was pregnant and 1 received methylprednisolone pulse+immunoglobulin to treat SLE immediately before COVID; 3 were under double IS and 2 HCQ. 23 received antibiotics (19 azithromycin). In 10 patients (9 with normal liver enzymes before COVID) there were IS adjustments: IS withdrawal and increase of PD dosage (6), increase PD dosage (2), IS withdrawal and HCQ prescription (1), AZA withdrawal+decrease PD dose (1). Six of the 10 patients had slight increase of liver enzymes, none liver decompensation. One patient died, with celiac disease who acquired COVID during hospitalization for lymphoma investigation. Conclusions It appears that patients under IS for AIH and COVID-19 show outcomes similar to that of non-immunosuppressed population. HCQ does not appear to have a positive impact on preventing or progressing the disease.","output":"P-106 COVID-19 PRESENTATION AND OUTCOMES IN 33 PATIENTS WITH AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we present a case of a young female patient with previously diagnosed lupus pneumonitis, now with a flare and new superimposed COVID-19 infection that was treated with intravenous steroids.

The Awake Prone Position (APP) group consisted of patients who were applied awake prone position, whereas non-APP group consisted of patients who were not applied awake prone position. PaCO(2), PaO(2), pH, SpO(2) values and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios were recorded at the beginning and 24th hour. Demographic data, comorbidities, intubation requirements, ventilator-free days, length of intensive care unit stay and short-term mortality of the patients were recorded. RESULTS: The data of total 225 patients were examined, and 48 patients who met our study criteria were included. At the 24th hour, the median SpO(2) value of the APP group was 95%, the median PaO(2) value was 82 mmHg, whereas the SpO(2) value of the non-APP group was 90% and the PaO(2) value was 66 mmHg.

Using an interdisciplinary team approach, we created a clinical team to proactively screen and outreach patients with COVID-19 to equitably offer Mab. METHODS: From December 28, 2020 - May 3, 2021, a clinical team consisting of an Infectious disease pharmacist and physician, reviewed each outpatient with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test at the Atlanta VA Healthcare System (AVAHCS) daily. The clinical team used the published Emergency Use Authorization criteria to determine eligibility. Eligible patients were prioritized using the Veterans Health Administration (VACO) Index for COVID-19 Mortality, which estimates the risk of 30-day mortality after COVID-19 infection using pre-COVID-19 health status (Figure 1). Eligible patients were contacted via telephone to confirm eligibility and obtain verbal consent. We performed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody tests when possible prior to Mab infusion, but results did not preclude Mab receipt. Telehealth follow-up occurred at 1- and 7-days post infusion. Figure 1.

Recently, an association between COVID-19 and anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease has been proposed. We report on a patient with recurrence of anti-GBM disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: The 31-year-old woman had a past medical history of anti-GBM disease, first diagnosed 11 years ago, and a first relapse 5 years ago. She was admitted with severe dyspnoea, haemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrates and acute on chronic kidney injury. A SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive with a high cycle threshold. Anti-GBM autoantibodies were undetectable. A kidney biopsy revealed necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis with linear deposits of IgG, IgM and C3 along the glomerular basement membrane, confirming a recurrence of anti-GBM disease. She was treated with steroids, plasma exchange and two doses of rituximab. Pulmonary disease resolved, but the patient remained dialysis-dependent. We propose that pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 caused exposure of alveolar basement membranes leading to the production of high avidity autoantibodies by long-lived plasma cells, resulting in severe pulmonary renal syndrome.

This study aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of concomitant administration of high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV-HD) and a mRNA-1273 vaccine booster dose in older adults. METHODS: This study is an ongoing, phase 2, multicentre, open-label, descriptive trial at six clinical research sites in the USA. We describe the interim results up to 21 days after vaccination (JulyCAugust, 2021). Community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older, who were previously vaccinated with a two-dose primary schedule of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, were eligible for inclusion. The second dose of the primary mRNA-1273 vaccination series was required to have been received at least 5 months before enrolment in the study. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using a permuted block method stratified by site and by age group (<75 years vs 75 years), to receive concomitant administration of QIV-HD and mRNA-1273 vaccine, QIV-HD alone, or mRNA-1273 vaccine alone. Randomisation lists, generated by Sanofi Pasteur biostatistics platform, were provided to study investigators for study group allocation. Unsolicited adverse events occurring immediately, solicited local and systemic reactions up to day 8, and unsolicited adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and medically attended adverse events up to day 22 were reported. Haemagglutination inhibition antibody responses to influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains and SARS CoV-2 binding antibody responses (SARS-CoV-2 pre-spike IgG ELISA) were assessed at day 1 and day 22. All analyses were descriptive. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04969276. FINDINGS: Between July 16 and Aug 31, 2021, 306 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned, of whom 296 received at least one vaccine dose (100 in the coadministration group, 92 in the QIV-HD, and 104 in the mRNA-1273 group). Reactogenicity profiles were similar between the coadministration and mRNA-1273 groups, with lower reactogenicity rates in the QIV-HD group (frequency of solicited injection site reactions 860% [95% CI 776C921], 913% [842C960], and 618% [509C719]; frequency of solicited systemic reactions 800%, [708C873], 837% [751C902], and 494% [387C602], respectively). Up to day 22, unsolicited adverse events were reported for 170% (95% CI 102C258) of participants in the coadministration group and 144% (83C227) of participants in the mRNA-1273 group, and tended to be reported at a slightly lower rate (109% [53C191]) in participants in the QIV-HD group. Seven participants each reported one medically attended adverse event (three in the coadministration group, one in the QIV-HD group, and three in the mRNA-1273 group). There were no serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, or deaths. Haemagglutination inhibition antibody geometric mean titres increased from day 1 to day 22 to similar levels in the coadministration and QIV-HD groups, for each influenza strain (A/H1N1: 363 [95% CI 276C476] vs 366 [272C491]; A/H3N2: 286 [233C352] vs 315 [257C386]; B/Yamagata: 429 [350C525] vs 471 [378C588]; B/Victoria: 377 [325C438] vs 390 [327C465] for the coadministration and QIV-HD groups, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody geometric mean concentrations also increased to similar levels in the coadministration and mRNA-1273 groups at day 22 (7634 [95% CI 6445C9042] and 7904 [6883C9077], respectively). INTERPRETATION: No safety concerns or immune interference were observed for concomitant administration of QIV-HD with mRNA-1273 booster in adults aged 65 years and older, supporting co-administration recommendations.

The secondary objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone 20 mg versus dexamethasone 6 mg. The exploratory objective of this study is to assess long-term consequences on mortality and quality of life at 180 and 360 days. TRIAL DESIGN: REMED is a prospective, phase II, open-label, randomised controlled trial testing superiority of dexamethasone 20 mg vs 6 mg. The trial aims to be pragmatic, i.e. designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in conditions that are close to real-life routine clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: The study is multi-centre and will be conducted in the intensive care units (ICUs) of ten university hospitals in the Czech Republic. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects will be eligible for the trial if they meet all of the following criteria: 1. Adult (18 years of age) at time of enrolment; 2. Present COVID-19 (infection confirmed by RT-PCR or antigen testing); 3. Intubation/mechanical ventilation or ongoing high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy; 4. Moderate or severe ARDS according to Berlin criteria: ? Moderate C PaO(2)/FiO(2) 100C200 mmHg; ? Severe C PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 100 mmHg; 5. Admission to ICU in the last 24 hours. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects will not be eligible for the trial if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Known allergy/hypersensitivity to dexamethasone or excipients of the investigational medicinal product (e.g. parabens, benzyl alcohol); 2. Fulfilled criteria for ARDS for 14 days at enrolment; 3. Pregnancy or breastfeeding; 4. Unwillingness to comply with contraception measurements from enrolment until at least 1 week after the last dose of dexamethasone (sexual abstinence is considered an adequate contraception method); 5. End-of-life decision or patient is expected to die within next 24 hours; 6. Decision not to intubate or ceilings of care in place; 7. Immunosuppression and/or immunosuppressive drugs in medical history: a) Systemic immunosuppressive drugs or chemotherapy in the past 30 days; b) Systemic corticosteroid use before hospitalization; c) Any dose of dexamethasone during the present hospital stay for COVID-19 for 5 days before enrolment; d) Systemic corticosteroids during present hospital stay for conditions other than COVID-19 (e.g. septic shock); 8. Current haematological or generalized solid malignancy; 9. Any contraindication for corticosteroid administration, e.g. ? intractable hyperglycaemia; ? active gastrointestinal bleeding; ? adrenal gland disorders; ? presence of superinfection diagnosed with locally established clinical and laboratory criteria without adequate antimicrobial treatment; 10. Cardiac arrest before ICU admission; 11. Participation in another interventional trial in the last 30 days. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Dexamethasone solution for injection/infusion is the investigational medicinal product as well as the comparator. The trial will assess two doses, 20 mg (investigational) vs 6 mg (comparator). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously once daily on day 1C5, followed by dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously once daily on day 6C10. Patients in the control group will receive dexamethasone 6 mg day 1C10. All authorized medicinal products containing dexamethasone in the form of solution for i.v. injection/infusion can be used. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary endpoint: Number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days after randomisation, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. SECONDARY ENDPOINTS: a) Mortality from any cause at 60 days after randomisation; b) Dynamics of inflammatory marker (C-Reactive Protein, CRP) change from Day 1 to Day 14; c) WHO Clinical Progression Scale at Day 14; d) Adverse events related to corticosteroids (new infections, new thrombotic complications) until Day 28 or hospital discharge; e) Independence at 90 days after randomisation assessed by Barthel Index. The long-term outcomes of this study are to assess long-term consequences on mortality and quality of life at 180 and 360 days through telephone structured interviews using the Barthel Index. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation will be carried out within the electronic case report form (eCRF) by the stratified permuted block randomisation method. Allocation sequences will be prepared by a statistician independent of the study team. Allocation to the treatment arm of an individual patient will not be available to the investigators before completion of the whole randomisation process. The following stratification factors will be applied: ? Age <65 and  65; ? Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI) <3 and 3; ? CRP <150 mg/L and 150 mg/L ? Trial centre. Patients will be randomised in a 1 : 1 ratio into one of the two treatment arms. Randomisation through the eCRF will be available 24 hours every day. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial in which the participants and the study staff will be aware of the allocated intervention. Blinded pre-planned statistical analysis will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size is calculated to detect the difference of 3 VFDs at 28 days (primary efficacy endpoint) between the two treatment arms with a two-sided type I error of 0.05 and power of 80%. Based on data from a multi-centre randomised controlled trial in COVID-19 ARDS patients in Brazil and a multi-centre observational study from French and Belgian ICUs regarding moderate to severe ARDS related to COVID-19, investigators assumed a standard deviation of VFD at 28 days as 9. Using these assumptions, a total of 142 patients per treatment arm would be needed. After adjustment for a drop-out rate, 150 per treatment arm (300 patients per study) will be enrolled. TRIAL STATUS: This is protocol version 1.1, 15.01.2021. The trial is due to start on 2 February 2021 and recruitment is expected to be completed by December 2021.

Nearly the entire human physiological system can get disrupted by the virulence of SARS-CoV-2, which exemplifies the significance of discovering a potential drug target. Similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) unequivocally expressed on all vital human organs, particularly on nasal/oral respiratory tract, gastrointestinal organs, innate immune cells, heart, brain and urogenital cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Activation of T2Rs by bitter agonists restores vital functions to these organs via activation of large conductance, Ca2+-dependent potassium (K+) channels (BKca), and inducible nitric oxide synthase. T2R activation in the gustatory system can act as the first defence mechanism, primarily preventing or mitigating SARS-CoV-2 entry to the respiratory tract. Moreover, T2R activation is crucial for the improved vasodilation accompanied by the attenuation of systemic inflammation; hyper-innate immune responses; gastrointestinal disorders; defective neurological functions; acute kidney injury; and impotency witnessed in severe SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Most recently, a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies has been shown to be highly effective in protecting non\\\\human primates from Ebola virus infection. In this review, we will discuss what is known about the nature of the virus, phylogenetic classification, genomic organization and replication, disease transmission, and viral entry and highlight the current approaches and efforts, in the development of therapeutics, to control the outbreak.

It is becoming an increasingly urgent problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where a large fraction of women is diagnosed with advanced-stage disease and have no access to treatment or basic palliative care. About 5-10% of all breast cancers can be attributed to hereditary genetic components and up to 25% of familial cases are due to mutations in BRCA1/2 genes. Since their discovery in 1994 and 1995, as few as 18 mutations have been identified in BRCA genes in the Tunisian population. The aim of this study is to identify additional BRCA mutations, to estimate their contribution to the hereditary breast and ovarian cancers in Tunisia and to investigate the clinicopathological signatures associated with BRCA mutations. METHODS: A total of 354 patients diagnosed with breast and ovarian cancers, including 5 male breast cancer cases, have been investigated for BRCA1/2 mutations using traditional and/or next generation sequencing technologies. Clinicopathological signatures associated with BRCA mutations have also been investigated. RESULTS: In the current study, 16 distinct mutations were detected: 10 in BRCA1 and 6 in BRCA2, of which 11 are described for the first time in Tunisia including 3 variations that have not been reported previously in public databases namely BRCA1_c.915T>A; BRCA2_c.-227-?_7805+? and BRCA2_c.249delG. Early age at onset, family history of ovarian cancer and high tumor grade were significantly associated with BRCA status. BRCA1 carriers were more likely to be triple negative breast cancer compared to BRCA2 carriers. A relatively high frequency of contralateral breast cancer and ovarian cancer occurrence was observed among BRCA carriers and was more frequent in patients carrying BRCA1 mutations. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights into breast and ovarian cancer genetic landscape in the under-represented North African populations. The prevalence assessment of novel and recurrent BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations will enhance the use of personalized treatment and precise screening strategies by both affected and unaffected North African cancer cases.","output":"Identification of Eleven Novel BRCA Mutations in Tunisia: Impact on the Clinical Management of BRCA Related Cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: There is a growing need for specialty pharmacy leaders within integrated delivery networks (IDNs). Traditional training for students and residents has not met the demand for pharmacy leaders in this space. This article describes the partnership between UW Health (UWH) and the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy (UWSOP) in developing a specialty pharmacy elective course at UWSOP and in creating a postgraduate residency training program at UWH. Future directions for the partnership are discussed. SUMMARY: Members of the leaderships of UWH and UWSOP met to discuss expanding coursework related to specialty pharmacy business fundamentals at UWSOP. This meeting led to the development of a 2-credit elective course beginning in spring 2017. The course focused on marketplace economics, channel strategies, and specialty pharmacy practice development. Additionally, UWH identified the need to provide postgraduate training to meet the increasing demand across IDNs for specialty pharmacy leaders. The residency program was initiated in 2013 and received accreditation in 2016. The residency provides experience in specialty pharmacy leadership, managed care, finance, the revenue cycle, accreditation, and the supply chain. Future partnership opportunities include creation of a longitudinal student pharmacist track and joint project coordination between UWSOP students and UWH residents. CONCLUSION: This partnership has provided a pathway for students to gain expertise in specialty pharmacy business fundamentals as well as postgraduate training opportunities for future specialty pharmacy leaders. IDN and school of pharmacy partnerships can expand educational opportunities for future specialty pharmacy leaders and help fulfill the market gap in specialty pharmacy leaders.","output":"A framework for graduate and postgraduate specialty pharmacy training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the whole world Its impact on the education sector cannot be considered small This study aims to explore the roles and effects of Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) in assisting pedagogy, abolishing technophobia among undergraduates, to overcome the pandemic and to prevent the near-total closure of education The study conducted among undergraduate students The smart learning practices ofMiddle East countries and TEL effectiveness of using Google meet, online communication, Blogging, PDF reports and presentation, free teaching and learning applications in enhancing behaviour intention of learning also enclosed in the article as innovative solutions The effectiveness, challenges and recommendations of the e-learning system studied The results revealed that the features of TEL spur and encourage the behaviour intention to use e-learning and technologies The results show how the adoption of TEL helped to overcome the global lockdown of educational institutions which might have affected the students future ? 2021 International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies All Rights Reserved","output":"Impact of Technologies During COVID-19 Pandemic for Improving Behavior Intention to Use E-learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is increasing evidence of gastrointestinal (GI) infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

However imposing total lockdown may not be the feasible solution because it is not only counter-productive but also causes the destructive impact on day-to-day working, economy and convenience of people. Moreover total lockdown is at the cost of public freedom may cause people agitation. Therefore determining the micro-level, manageable quarantine zones for affected Corona positive patients and further focus to only on the identified zones can be the resolution. For this purpose the scope of the containment zones must be determined with unbiased, precise and agile manner to enforce the controls on these zones to prevent the spread of this contagious disease. The updated and accurate information about such hot-spot zones can be useful for government to effectively implement the measures by concentrating the efforts on the zones and for other citizens to alert such hot-spot zones. However the task of identifying and circumventing the precise affected zones is not easy because of the constantly changing status of the patients. As soon as number of patients are getting recovered (the cycle time is around 14 days), these quarantine zones need to be revised and reconfigured accordingly, which is in addition to constantly accumulation of the data of new patients. The size and locations of such zones (affected by Corona positive patients) is dynamic in nature, therefore it becomes impossible to frequently reconfigure it manually. Implementing the models such as K-means from Data Science is proposed to help the situation because the zones determined by Data Science models are reliable (fact-based and latest), economic (not much additional infrastructure required), easy to understand (clusters are well defined and visible), flexible (can be parameterized / configured), and unbiased (because there is no preconception while defining zones/ clusters).","output":"?Defining Covid 19 containment zones using K-means dynamically"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of December 2019, China notified the World Health Organization about a viral pneumonia epidemic soon to be named Covid-19, of which the infectious agent, SARS-CoV-2, was rapidly identified Less than one year later, published phase 3 clinical trials underlined the effectiveness of vaccines utilizing hitherto unusual technology consisting in injection of the messenger RNA (m-RNA) of a viral protein In the meantime, numerous clinical trials had failed to identify a maximally effective antiviral treatment, and mass vaccination came to be considered as the strategy most likely to put an end to the pandemic The objective of this text is to address and hopefully answer the questions being put forward by healthcare professionals on the different anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as regards their development, their modes of action, their effectiveness, their limits, and their utilization in different situations;we are proposing a report on both today's state of knowledge, and the 14 February 2021 recommendations of the French health authorities","output":"Covid-19 vaccines: frequently asked questions and updated answers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA replicon particles derived from a vaccine strain of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) were used as a vector for expression of the major envelope proteins (G(L) and M) of equine arteritis virus (EAV), both individually and in heterodimer form (G(L)/M).

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old Japanese man was brought into our emergency department after receiving a left retroauricular stab wound by broken glass fragments. After spinal immobilization, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed glass fragments penetrating at the right craniocervical junction to the interatlantooccipital subarachnoid space. CT angiography showed that both vertebral arteries were not injured. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the glass fragments did not penetrate the cervical cord or medulla oblongata. These glass fragments were removed via a midline incision from the external occipital protuberance to the C7 and with laminectomy without suboccipital craniectomy. Five of the glass fragments were found and removed in total. The dural defect was patched with a free fascia autograft. His postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative CT angiography showed that both vertebral arteries were intact and the glass fragments had been removed completely. CONCLUSIONS: CT graphical diagnosis is useful for the management of penetrating craniocervical junction trauma, and it should be considered in the evaluation of patients who have suffered craniocervical penetrating injury even in the absence of major wounds or bleeding. Spinal immobilization of patients with craniocervical penetrating injuries is crucial to avoid not only secondary neurologic damage but also secondary critical vascular damage.

To build a new predictive model for in-hospital mortality in patients over the age of 75 years admitted with pneumonia due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients older than 75 years admitted from the emergency department for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 12 and April 27, 2020. We recorded demographic (age, sex, living in a care facility or not), clinical (symptoms, comorbidities, Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]), and analytical (serum biochemistry, blood gases, blood count, and coagulation factors) variables. A risk model was constructed, and the ability of the 3 scales to predict all-cause in-hospital mortality was compared. RESULTS: We included 186 patients with a median age of 85 years (interquartile range, 80-89 years);44.1% were men. Mortality was 47.3%. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were as follows for each tool: PSI, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82);CURB-65 score, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62-0.79);and SCAP score, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63-0.81). Risk factors included in the model were the presence or absence of symptoms (cough, dyspnea), the CCI, and analytical findings (aspartate aminotransferase, potassium, urea, and lactate dehydrogenase. The AUC for the model was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.88). CONCLUSION: This study shows that the predictive power of the PSI for mortality is moderate and perceptibly higher than the CURB-65 and SCAP scores.

Outpatient diabetes medications were not observed to be significant predictors of study outcomes.","output":"Preadmission Predictors of Severe COVID-19 in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The early widespread dissemination of Omicron indicates the urgent need to better understand the transmission dynamics of this variant, including asymptomatic spread among immunocompetent and immunosuppressed populations. In early December 2021, the Ubuntu clinical trial, designed to evaluate efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) among persons living with HIV (PLWH), began enrolling participants. Nasal swabs are routinely obtained at the initial vaccination visit, which requires participants to be clinically well to receive their initial jab. Of the initial 230 participants enrolled between December 2 and December 17, 2021, 71 (31%) were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2: all of whom were subsequently confirmed by S gene dropout to be Omicron; 48% of the tested samples had cycle threshold (CT) values <25 and 18% less than 20, indicative of high titers of asymptomatic shedding. Asymptomatic carriage rates were similar in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and seronegative persons (27% respectively). These data are in stark contrast to COVID-19 vaccine studies conducted pre-Omicron, where the SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate at the first vaccination visit ranged from <1%?2.4%, including a cohort of over 1,200 PLWH largely enrolled in South Africa during the Beta outbreak. We also evaluated asymptomatic carriage in a sub study of the Sisonke vaccine trial conducted in South African health care workers, which indicated 2.6% asymptomatic carriage during the Beta and Delta outbreaks and subsequently rose to 16% in both PLWH and PHLWH during the Omicron period.","output":"High Rate of Asymptomatic Carriage Associated with Variant Strain Omicron"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global Covid-19 crisis has shown its impact on all the aspect of life: health, social, economic, and politic. The attention mainly reserved to the economic and politic aspect musts also take into account the risk of social fragmentation. In which way this emergency has impact on communities where social fragilities were already existing? In which way, social dynamics are changed by the fear of the pandemic and the physical isolation imposed by governments to contain it. In which way local associations and citizen are coping the new challenges imposed by this emergency? In this article, the Sicilian context will be explored with a specific view on the Palermo capital. This Italian region has a peculiar and complex social asset determined by interrelated socio-economic phenomena such as mafia, unemployment and poverty. Fortunately, the existence of problematic and historical social phenomena has to face with the constant activities organized by local associations, civil society and authorities to fight them. There is one element that must to be consider: a global event like a pandemic oblige to be careful to the new ways in which phenomena we are accustomed to can manifest. Inequalities and racial matter can be exacerbated even in a multicultural context like Palermo one if social balance is missing. New form of poverty and the higher number of people exposed to this risk can give to mafia-type organizations more instrument to establish their control on the territory. The same introduction of economic measures aiming to support people can be manipulated and have a distorted effect when concretely applied. It is a great challenge because the lack of a complete comprehension can determine a failure of the adopted measures and a lack of cohesion of the social tissue. Starting from the context definition, the analysis will explore the perspective and the experiences of associations working with people belonging to the weaker part of the community, thanks to semi-structured interviews to representatives of the main local associations as privileged witness. In this way, the analysis will try to highlight how local actors' activities and how dynamics of solidarity are influenced by the global Covid-19 phenomenon.","output":"The Covid-19 Emergency and the Risk of Social Fragmentation in the Palermo Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined administration of interferon alfa-2b in combination with antioxidants, Viferon as rectal suppositories 3,000,000 IU and gel for topical use 36,000 IU/g in pregnant patients with new coronavirus infection (NCI) COVID-19. Materials and methods. The study included 140 pregnant women with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 NCI. Pregnant women were divided into two groups of 70 subjects each: Group 1 received Viferon and complex standard of care;Group 2 received standard of care only. The efficacy of therapy was evaluated by a comparative analysis of the course of disease symptoms, laboratory parameters, and birth outcomes. Results. The addition of interferon alfa-2b with an antioxidant complex into the regimen of complex standard of care in pregnant women with NCI COVID-19 resulted in quicker relief of the main disease symptoms and development of a persistent antiviral immune response. Significant decrease in the level of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 due to the complex therapy with Viferon (interferon alfa-2b with antioxidants) is a favorable prognostic index for recovery after the disease. Based on the analysis of birth outcomes depending on the therapy, the efficacy and safety of complex therapy with Viferon in Group 1 pregnant women was confirmed. Most of the births occurred at 3840 weeks of gestation and no perinatal losses were recorded. In group 2 pregnant women receiving only standard of care, two cases of antenatal fetal death were recorded. Conclusion. The addition of interferon alpha-2b with antioxidant, Viferon in the form of rectal suppositories and gel for topical use for COVID-19 treatment in pregnant women results in a quicker relief of symptoms, development of a sustained immune response and birth of infants with no abnormalities. ? 2021, Media Sphera Publishing Group.

Previous studies have shown that the intervention results in an increase in knowledge and communication on kidney replacement therapy, and eventually in an increase in the number of living donor kidney transplantations. The study assesses the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to standard care. METHODS: A dynamic probabilistic Markov model was used to estimate the monetary and health benefits of the intervention in The Netherlands over 10 years. Data on costs and health-related quality of life were derived from the literature. Transition probabilities, prevalence, and incidence rates were calculated using a large national database. An optimistic and a pessimistic implementation scenario were compared to a base case scenario with standard care. RESULTS: In both the optimistic and pessimistic scenario, the intervention is cost-effective and dominant compared to standard care: savings were 108,681,985 and 51,770,060 and the benefits were 1382 and 695 QALYs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The superior cost-effectiveness of the intervention is caused by the superior health effects and the reduction of costs associated with transplantation, and the relatively small incremental costs of the intervention. The favorable findings of this implementation project resulted in national uptake of the intervention in The Netherlands as of 2021. This is the first time a psychosocial intervention has been implemented as part of standard care in a kidney replacement therapy program worldwide.","output":"A dynamic Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Kidney Team at Home intervention in The Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On-demand delivery services are experiencing a moment of expansion, which the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to foster.

During a pandemic, working as a rider potentially increases the risks of an already precarious job given the contractual arrangements and the algorithmic control that characterize this gig economy sector. We argue that platforms have generated forms of injustice that are reproduced and amplified by digital platforms encoded in the Global North, which are governed by regulations and optimization criteria that do not dialogue with the precarious reality of Global South cities. Focusing on the case of Santiago de Chile, our analysis draws on the triangulation and complementarity of two instruments: interviews before the COVID-19 pandemic and surveys involving riders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings show that platforms generate specific forms of injustice that affect riders and their mobility in particular. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened such forms of digital injustice, increasing the pressure for constantly working and the exposure of riders to threats such as accidents, criminality and health risks.","output":"Delivery workers and the interplay of digital and mobility (in)justice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The 5-membered oxadiazole and thiadiazole scaffolds are the most privileged and well-known heterocycles, being a common and essential feature of a variety of natural products and medicinal agents. These scaffolds take up the center position and are the core structural components of numerous drugs that belong to different categories. These include antimicrobial, anti-tubercular, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antiepileptic, antiviral, and anticancer agents. In this review, we mostly talk about the isomers 1,2,4-oxadiazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole because they have important pharmacological properties. This is partly because they are chemical and heat resistant, unlike other isomers, and they can be used as bio-isosteric replacements in drug design. We are reviewing the structural modifications of different oxadiazole and thiadiazole derivatives, more specifically, the anti-tubercular and anticancer pharmacological activities reported over the last 5 years, as we have undertaken this as a core area of research.

Addressing the need for a PoC test, several diagnostic tests, including serological and molecular methods, have been developed and evaluated in the past. One promising molecular method, already implemented for diagnosis of a range of diseases, is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) protocol. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, using a comprehensive search strategy, we focus on studies evaluating the performance of LAMP for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis in humans and other mammals such as dogs, compared with microscopy and/or any other molecular diagnostic method. A meta-analysis, pooling sensitivity and specificity rates and calculating areas under the curve (AUCs) in summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) plots, was conducted on datasets extracted from studies, grouped by clinical condition and sample type. We found high sensitivity and specificity for LAMP when compared with microscopy and PCR using blood samples, with pooled estimate values of > 90% for all subgroups, corresponding to calculated AUC values > 0.96, except for LAMP compared to microscopy for diagnosis of CL. However, only a limited number of studies were truly comparable. Most of the observed heterogeneity is likely based on true differences between the studies rather than sampling error only. Due to simple readout methods and low laboratory equipment requirements for sample preparation compared to other molecular methods, LAMP is a promising candidate for a molecular (near-)PoC diagnostic method for VL and CL.

OBJECTIVES: The RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit covering 14 respiratory viruses was compared to the RespiFinder Smart22, a broad-spectrum multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) test, targeting 22 viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: After verification of its analytical performance, the clinical performance of the RespiFinder Smart22 was evaluated by re-analysis of 96 respiratory samples from oncological patients. Additionally, the time to result (TTR) of both methods was compared. RESULTS: The analytical performance of the RespiFinder Smart22 fulfilled all previously specified criteria. Concordant results in both assays were achieved in 74.0% of all clinical specimens and in 91.2% when only positive results were taken into account. The RespiFinder Smart22 yielded additional results in a total of 22 (22.9% of 96) samples due to higher test sensitivity and a broader, highly multiplexed spectrum of pathogens. The TTR of a typical routine test consisting of three samples were 206 and 356 min for the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit and the RespiFinder Smart22, respectively. However, hands-on time was reduced by 59.0% applying the MLPA method. CONCLUSIONS: In our hands, the RespiFinder Smart22 showed excellent analytical performance while hands-on time was halved in comparison to the RT PCR method.

METHODS This research was conducted as part of a larger study on childhood immunisations in Hong Kong. In-depth interviews were conducted with a subsample of parents (n = 15) to further explore general perceptions and health beliefs about childhood immunisations. Interview data were analysed using content analysis techniques. RESULTS Three core themes emerged from the data: individual influences factors, family and social factors, and system factors. [Correction added after online publication 21/8/08: sentence corrected from \\"Four core themes emerged from the data: individual influences, family influences and system influences.\\"] Parents readily admitted knowledge deficits concerning childhood vaccines but believed that the benefits of immunisation outweighed the risks. Family members and peers were a source of pro-immunisation advice and comprehensive public health programmes and mandatory vaccination requirements for school entry ensured that childhood immunisation recommendations were followed.

The field study was performed with a subject wearing an N95 filtering facepiece respirator while performing animal feeding, grain harvesting and unloading, and routine investigation of facilities. As expected, the geometric means (GM) of the WPFs increased with increasing particle size ranging from 21 for 0.7-1 microm particles to 270 for 5-10 microm particles (p < 0.001). The WPF for total culturable fungi (GM = 35) was significantly greater than for total culturable bacteria (GM = 9) (p = 0.01). Among the different microorganism groups, the WPFs of Cladosporium, culturable fungi, and total fungi were significantly correlated with the WPFs of particles of the same sizes. As compared with the WPFs for dust particles, the WPFs for bioaerosols were found more frequently below 10, which is a recommended assigned protection factor (APF) for N95 filtering facepiece respirators. More than 50% of the WPFs for microorganisms (mean aerodynamic diameter < 5 microm) were less than the proposed APF of 10. Even lower WPFs were calculated after correcting for dead space and lung deposition. Thus, the APF of 10 for N95 filtering facepiece respirators seems inadequate against microorganisms (mean aerodynamic size < 5 microm). These results provide useful pilot data to establish guidelines for respiratory protection against airborne dust and microorganisms on agricultural farms.

In this study, we tested whether conspiracy beliefs affect containment-related behaviour in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and whether this relationship is mediated by political trust, preference for saving the economy or for saving lives. The data were collected at two time points, at the beginning of the epidemic and after the state of emergency was introduced. The sample consisted of 790 adults from Serbia (349 at time 1 and 441 at time 2), of which around 60% were female, with a mean age of around 33. The results indicate that holding more conspiracy beliefs is related to less adherence to containment-related behaviour, both directly and indirectly, via decreased political trust. Preference for saving lives has a direct effect on containment-related behaviour, while preference for saving economy plays no important role in this relationship, although it has a negative zero-order association with containment-related behaviour.

Additionally, technology must be more available in order to gain a better understanding of the factors that condition the presence of mosquitoes in residential settings. This study is the first to report on the use of drones for mosquito breeding surveillance in Mexico and aims to evaluate the effectiveness of low-cost drone images in order to identify Aedes aegypti mosquito breeding sites on the roofs of buildings and backyards. The results were compared to the current government Aedes vector surveillance program, which is based on on-ground activities in Tapachula city, Chiapas, southern Mexico. Through drone surveillance, we identified a total of 983 containers that were distributed in 10 types; approximately one-third (2752) of the containers were inspected by ground surveillance systems that were distributed in 26 container types. The concordance between drone and ground surveillance was 64.9% in detecting at least one container using both methods. Drones can identify the most common roof containers and should be used in dengue-endemic areas that have many possible breeding sites and are in accessible housing areas. Drones can be useful in complementing mosquito surveillance and control programs. ABSTRACT: Aedes aegypti control programs require more sensitive tools in order to survey domestic and peridomestic larval habitats for dengue and other arbovirus prevention areas. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, field technicians have faced a new occupational hazard during their work activities in dengue surveillance and control. Safer strategies to monitor larval populations, in addition to minimum householder contact, are undoubtedly urgently needed. Drones can be part of the solution in urban and rural areas that are dengue-endemic. Throughout this study, the proportion of larvae breeding sites found in the roofs and backyards of houses were assessed using drone images. Concurrently, the traditional ground field technicians surveillance was utilized to sample the same house groups. The results were analyzed in order to compare the effectiveness of both field surveillance approaches. Aerial images of 216 houses from El Vergel village in Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico, at a height of 30 m, were obtained using a drone. Each household was sampled indoors and outdoors by vector control personnel targeting all the containers that potentially served as Aedes aegypti breeding sites. The main results were that the drone could find 1 container per 2.8 found by ground surveillance; however, containers that were inaccessible by technicians in roofs and backyards, such as plastic buckets and tubs, disposable plastic containers and flowerpots were more often detected by drones than traditional ground surveillance. This new technological approach would undoubtedly improve the surveillance of Aedes aegypti in household environments, and better vector control activities would therefore be achieved in dengue-endemic countries.","output":"Field Effectiveness of Drones to Identify Potential Aedes aegypti Breeding Sites in Household Environments from Tapachula, a Dengue-Endemic City in Southern Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation is an intrinsic defence mechanism triggered by the immune system against infection or injury. Chronic inflammation allows the host to recover or adapt through cellular and humoral responses, whereas acute inflammation leads to cytokine storms resulting in tissue damage. In this review, we present the overlapping outcomes of cancer inflammation with virus-induced inflammation. The study emphasises how anti-inflammatory drugs that work against cancer inflammation may work against the inflammation caused by the viral infection. It is established that the cytokine storm induced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to disease-associated mortality. While cancer remains the second among the diseases associated with mortality worldwide, cancer patients' mortality rates are often observed upon extended periods after illness, usually ranging from months to years. However, the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 disease are robust. The cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be responsible for the multi-organ failure and increased mortality rates. Since both cancer and COVID-19 disease share overlapping inflammatory mechanisms, repurposing some anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs for COVID-19 may lower mortality rates. Here, we review some of these inflammatory mechanisms and propose some potential chemotherapeutic agents to intervene in them. We also discuss the repercussions of anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine with zinc or antiviral drugs such as ivermectin and remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm. In this review, we emphasise on various possibilities to reduce SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm.","output":"Cancer vs. SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation, overlapping functions, and pharmacological targeting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A CDCL SAT solver can backtrack a large distance when it learns a new clause, e.g, when the new learnt clause is a unit clause the solver has to backtrack to level zero.

Different techniques have been proposed to reduce this potential redundancy, e.g., partial/chronological backtracking and trail saving on restarts. In this paper we present a new trail saving technique that is not restricted to restarts, unlike prior trail saving methods. Our technique makes a copy of the part of the trail that is backtracked over. This saved copy can then be used to improve the efficiency of the solvers subsequent redescent. Furthermore, the saved trail also provides the solver with the ability to look ahead along the previous trail which can be exploited to improve its efficiency. Our new trail saving technique offers different tradeoffs in comparison with chronological backtracking and often yields superior performance.

Pathogen genome sequencing has emerged as the primary tool for variant characterization, so it is important to consider the number of sequences needed when designing surveillance programs or studies, both to ensure accurate conclusions and to optimize use of limited resources. However, current approaches to calculating sample size for variant monitoring often do not account for the biological and logistical processes that can bias which infections are detected and which samples are ultimately selected for sequencing. In this manuscript, we introduce a framework that models the full process from infection detection to variant characterization and demonstrate how to use this framework to calculate appropriate sample sizes for sequencing-based surveillance studies. We consider both cross-sectional and continuous sampling, and we have implemented our method in a publicly available tool that allows users to estimate necessary sample sizes given a specific aim (e.g., variant detection or measuring variant prevalence) and sampling method. Our framework is designed to be easy to use, while also flexible enough to be adapted to other pathogens and surveillance scenarios.","output":"Sample Size Calculations for Variant Surveillance in the Presence of Biological and Systematic Biases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As part of a concerted pandemic response to protect public health, businesses can enact non-pharmaceutical controls to minimise exposure to pathogens in workplaces and premises open to the public. Amendments to working practices can lead to the amount, duration and/or proximity of interactions being changed, ultimately altering the dynamics of disease spread. These modifications could be specific to the type of business being operated. We use a data-driven approach to parameterise an individual-based network model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 amongst the working population, stratified into work sectors. The network is comprised of layered contacts to consider the risk of spread in multiple encounter settings (workplaces, households, social and other). We analyse several interventions targeted towards working practices: mandating a fraction of the population to work from home; using temporally asynchronous work patterns; and introducing measures to create 'COVID-secure' workplaces. We also assess the general role of adherence to (or effectiveness of) isolation and test and trace measures and demonstrate the impact of all these interventions across a variety of relevant metrics. The progress of the epidemic can be significantly hindered by instructing a significant proportion of the workforce to work from home. Furthermore, if required to be present at the workplace, asynchronous work patterns can help to reduce infections when compared with scenarios where all workers work on the same days, particularly for longer working weeks. When assessing COVID-secure workplace measures, we found that smaller work teams and a greater reduction in transmission risk reduced the probability of large, prolonged outbreaks. Finally, following isolation guidance and engaging with contact tracing without other measures is an effective tool to curb transmission, but is highly sensitive to adherence levels. In the absence of sufficient adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions, our results indicate a high likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 spreading widely throughout a worker population. Given the heterogeneity of demographic attributes across worker roles, in addition to the individual nature of controls such as contact tracing, we demonstrate the utility of a network model approach to investigate workplace-targeted intervention strategies and the role of test, trace and isolation in tackling disease spread.","output":"A network modelling approach to assess non-pharmaceutical disease controls in a worker population: An application to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of zinc (Zn) sufficiency/supplementation on COVID-19-associated mortality and incidence (SARS-CoV-2 infections) remains unknown. During an infection, the levels of free Zn are reduced as part of nutritional immunity to limit the growth and replication of pathogen and the ensuing inflammatory damage. Considering its key role in immune competency and frequently recorded deficiency in large sections of different populations, Zn has been prescribed for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes in COVID-19 without any corroborating evidence for its protective role. Multiple trials are underway evaluating the effect of Zn supplementation on COVID-19 outcome in patients getting standard of care treatment. However, the trial designs presumably lack the power to identify negative effects of Zn supplementation, especially in the vulnerable groups of elderly and patients with comorbidities (contributing 9 out of 10 deaths; up to >8,000-fold higher mortality).

AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism and active chemicals in the ethanol extracts of V. patula (VP) and L. chinensis (LC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibitory activities of VP and LC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production were investigated in RAW264.7 macrophages and BV2 microglia. Downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and upregulation of Nrf2 (NF-E2 p45-related factor 2)-ARE (antioxidant response element) pathway were investigated using RT-Q-PCR and Western blotting. Direct antioxidant capacities were measured using free radical scavenging and Folin-Ciocalteu assays. The flavonoids and triterpenes in VP and LC were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS. RESULTS: VP and LC inhibited NO and IL-6 production and suppressed iNOS, IL-6, IL-1 and CCL2 gene expression. VP and LC were potent direct antioxidants and effective indirect antioxidants assayed by Nrf2 activation and induction of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Three flavonoids including apigenin (1), luteolin (2) and chryseriol (3), and one triterpene betulinic acid (4) were found in VP; while compounds 1-4 and oleanolic acid (5) were in LC.

Methods and findings This retrospective observational case series study analyzed transmission patterns of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections found by local health authorities and commercial laboratories during January 14 through July 31, 2020 in Japan. After ascertaining the infection source for every symptomatic case as clusters at households, daycare facilities, schools, hospitals and workplaces etc., their associated transmission patterns were analyzed. Identified cases were divided into three groups: underage, < 20; adults, 20- 59; and elderly people 60 years old and older. The reproductive number (R)s of respective transmission directions found for the respective age groups were compared. Of 26,986 total cases, 23,746 unknown cases were found, leaving 3,240 ascertained sources of infection (12.0%) comprising 125 (3.9%) underage, 2350 (72.5%) adult, and 765 (23.6%) elderly people. The respective Rs of underage infection sources directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0415 (95% CI, 0.0138- 0.0691), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.9171-1.3226), and 0.2811 (95% CI, 0.2074-0.3687). The respective Rs of adult infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0140 (95% CI, 0.0120-0.0162), 0.5392 (95% CI, 0.5236-0.5550), and 0.1135 (95% CI, 0.1074-0.1197). The respective Rs of elderly infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated as 0.065 (95% CI, 0.0039-0.0091), 0.3264 (95% CI, 0.3059-0.3474), and 0.3991 (95% CI, 0.3757-0.4229). Conclusions The main sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection were adults and elderly people. The R of underage people directed to adults was greater than 1 because of close familial contact but they were unlikely to become carriers transmitting SARS-CoV-2 because they accounted for a minority for transmissions. Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted among adults and elderly people, suggesting that infection control of SARS-CoV-2 should be managed specifically by generation.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection control implementation based on sources of infection showing directions for three age groups in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The development of the incidence of COVID-19 in the OECD countries is characterized by strong variability and heterogeneity, which determines their different impact on the economies of these countries.

It looks at the debate between John Swan and Noel Peattie on the inclusion of books representing outright lies in the collection (e.g., Holocaust denial). It then contrasts a right to information and authorities propagating and validating that information with a right to misinformation and authorities for propagating and validating that misinformation that exists within disinformation ecologies. The problem of truth, its authorities and its context appears to be more complicated than an appeal to alethic truths: for example, liberals and conservatives differ on the meaning of a rational consensus on contentious political matters, such as climate change. Given the dire consequences of misinformation on democracies and public health, an appeal to professional neutrality is woefully inadequate. There must be proactive resistance, if not outright repudiation.

Therefore, the current study focuses on the association between PSMU and happiness, exploring a mediating effect of lifestyle habits (e.g., difficulties in getting to sleep and frequency of physical activity) among Italian adolescents. Methods: A total of 58,976 Italian adolescents (mean age = 13.6, SD = 1.63; age range = 10.5C16.5; 49.4% females) were included. The pattern of relationships specified by the theoretical model was examined through path analysis. Results: Difficulties in getting to sleep ( = ?0.037, p < 0.001) and frequency of physical activity ( = ?0.012, p < 0.001) were mediators in the relationship between PSMU and happiness. Multi-group analyses across gender and age groups (11, 13, and 15 years old) showed that the chain mediating effect of the frequency of physical activity on the difficulties in getting to sleep was not significant for females but significant for males and for all of the three age groups. Overall, females and older ages were sensitive to the whole model. Conclusion: Along with difficulties in getting to sleep and the frequency of physical activity, lifestyle habits may contribute to the association between PSMU and happiness. We also recommend that future studies focus on PSMU in females and older adolescents, as they show more general sleep problems and reduced physical activity.","output":"The Effect of Problematic Social Media Use on Happiness among Adolescents: The Mediating Role of Lifestyle Habits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most pediatric patients with COVID-19 described in the literature have unusual or mild respiratory symptoms.

The impact of such closures on automated external defibrillator (AED) accessibility compared to changes in foot traffic levels is unknown. METHODS: We identified all publicly available online AED registries in Canada last updated May 1, 2019 or later. We mapped AED locations to location types and classified each location type as completely inaccessible, partially inaccessible, or unaffected based on government-issued closure orders as of May 1, 2020. Using location and mobility data from Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, we identified the change in foot traffic levels between February 15-May 1, 2020 (excluding April 10-12) compared to the baseline of January 3-February 1, 2020, and determined the discrepancy between foot traffic levels and AED accessibility. RESULTS: We identified four provincial and two municipal AED registries containing a total of 5848 AEDs. Of those, we estimated that 69.9% were completely inaccessible, 18.8% were partially inaccessible, and 11.3% were unaffected. Parks, retail and recreation locations, and workplaces experienced the greatest reduction in AED accessibility. The greatest discrepancies between foot traffic levels and AED accessibility occurred in parks, retail and recreation locations, and transit stations. CONCLUSION: A majority of AEDs became inaccessible during the COVID-19 pandemic due to government-mandated closures. In a substantial number of locations across Canada, the reduction in AED accessibility was far greater than the reduction in foot traffic.","output":"Public defibrillator accessibility and mobility trends during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hobbs examines how the expanded activities of women in the First World War and their public reception impact on the philosophy of heroism, arguing that whom and what a society regards as heroic tells us much about that societys values, including its perception of women.

BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) share ~98% of their genome and current subunit vaccines are almost exclusively designed as BCG boosters. The goal of this study is to design a TB subunit vaccine composed of antigens not shared with BCG and explore the advantages of this design in a BCG + subunit co-administration vaccine strategy. Eight protective antigens are selected to create an Mtb-specific subunit vaccine, named H107. Whereas traditional vaccines containing BCG-shared antigens exhibit in vivo cross-reactivity to BCG, H107 shows no cross-reactivity and does not inhibit BCG colonization. Instead, co-administering H107 with BCG leads to increased adaptive responses against both H107 and BCG. Importantly, rather than expanding BCG-primed T cells, H107 broadens the overall vaccine repertoire with new T cell clones and introduces adjuvant-imprinted qualities including Th17 responses and less-differentiated Th1 cells. Collectively, these features of H107 are associated with a substantial increase in long-term protection.","output":"A Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific subunit vaccine that provides synergistic immunity upon co-administration with Bacillus Calmette-Gurin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To the best of our knowledge, the application of deep learning in the field of quantitative risk management is still a relatively recent phenomenon.

Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are at elevated risk of mental health difficulties. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the pandemic on anxiety, depression and mental wellbeing in adults with NDDs using longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children study (n=3,058). Mental health data were collected pre-pandemic (age 21-25) and at three timepoints during the pandemic (ages 27-28) using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7, and Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. ADHD and ASD were defined using validated cut-points of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Autism Spectrum Quotient, self-reported at age 25. We used multi-level mixed-effects models to investigate changes in mental health in those with ADHD and ASD compared to those without. Prevalences of depression, anxiety and poor mental wellbeing were higher at all timepoints (pre-pandemic and during pandemic) in those with ADHD and ASD compared to those without. Anxiety increased to a greater extent in those with ADHD ({beta}=0.8 [0.2,1.4], p=0.01) and ASD ({beta}=1.2 [-0.1,2.5], p=0.07), while depression symptoms decreased, particularly in females with ASD ({beta}=-3.1 [-4.6,-1.5], p=0.0001). On average, mental wellbeing decreased in all, but to a lesser extent in those with ADHD ({beta}=1.3 [0.2,2.5], p=0.03) and females with ASD ({beta}=3.0 [0.2,5.9], p=0.04). To conclude, anxiety disproportionately increased in adults with NDDs during the pandemic, however, the related lockdowns may have provided a protective environment for depressive symptoms in the same individuals.","output":"Mental-health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults with neurodevelopmental disorders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a major impact on transplant recipients, with mortality rates up to 20%. Therefore, the effect of established messenger RNA (mRNA)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have to be evaluated for solid organ transplant patients (SOT) since they are known to have poor responses after vaccination. We investigated the SARS-CoV-2 immune response via SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection in 23 renal transplant recipients after two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 following the standard protocol. The antibody response was evaluated once with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG CLIA 15.8 +/- 3.0 days after the second dose. As a control, SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined in 23 healthcare workers (HCW) and compared to the patient cohort. Only 5 of 23 (22%) renal transplant recipients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies after the second dose of vaccine. In contrast, all 23 (100%) HCWs were tested positive for antibodies after the second dose. Thus, the humoral response of renal transplant recipients after two doses of the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, Kronach, Germany) is impaired and significantly lower compared to healthy controls (22% vs. 100%; p = 0.0001).

As the natural history and variety of clinical presentations of this disease unfolds, extrapulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 have emerged, especially in the digestive system. While the respiratory mode of transmission is well known and is probably the principal mode of transmission of this disease, a possibility of the fecal-oral route of transmission has also emerged in various case series and clinical scenarios. In this review article, we summarize four different aspects in published studies to date: (a) gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19; (b) microbiological and virological investigations; (c) the role of fecal-oral transmission; and (d) prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the digestive endoscopy room. A timely understanding of the relationship between the disease and the digestive system and implementing effective preventive measures are of great importance for a favorable outcome of the disease and can help climnicians to mitigate further transmission by taking appropriate measures.","output":"Digestive system involvement of novel coronavirus infection: Prevention and control infection from a gastroenterology perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a global emergency with over 10 million cases and over 500, 000 deaths worldwide.

The occurrence of COVID-19 in COPD patients can be related with smoking. The ACE-2 expression in such patients was considerably high. The relation between COVID-19 and Tuberculosis can also be reflected in terms of the stigma associated with diagnosis and treatment of such diseases in some communities, eventually increasing the chances of people's reluctance to seek medical help. Cancer patients are usually more susceptible to infections. Lung cancer is no different. Additionally, lung cancer also has strong association with smoking further increasing the risk.

It is worth noting that many infected COVID-19 patients have malignant tumors, and their prognosis is poor. To explore the susceptibility factors of cancer patients, we assessed the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and the endocytic regulator AAK1 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and explored their effects on immune infiltration. We found that the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in LUAD patients was significantly increased, which may explain why LUAD patients are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and the patients with high-expression genes presented increased infiltration of immune cells such as B cells and CD4 T cells. In addition, we also identified miR-432-5p as a potential targeted molecule and bexarotene as a potential targeted drug of the three genes through bioinformatic analysis and further verified the anti-inflammatory effect of bexarotene, providing new ideas for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"The Landscape of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Integrated Analysis SARS-CoV-2 Receptors and Potential Inhibitors in Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is emerging as a public health crisis worldwide Patients with COVID-19 range from being asymptomatic to suffering from severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure (MOF) Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have been reported in a number of patients with COVID-19, suggesting that GI microbiota may play a role in the pathogeneses of the disease Theoretically, patients with confirmed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with immune-based therapies may be at a higher risk of manifesting a severe form of COVID-19, owing to immune system impairment This hypothesis has evoked the concerns of patients and treating physicians throughout the pandemic However, surprisingly, the findings of a number of studies show that immunosuppressive therapies, such as anti-TNF agents, could reduce the severity of symptoms associated with Covid-19 Dysbiosis of gut microbiota, characteristic of IBD patients, can be positively changed after using anti-TNF agents Vitamin D has been revealed to have a profound effect on reducing the viral infections, aside from its role in modulating the gut microbiome In this review, we discuss possible susceptibility of IBD patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the impact of immunosuppressive therapies on the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD, and the potential protective role of gut microbiota against COVID-19 in patients with IBD in the presence of normal vitamin D levels ? 2020, AL?KI Kft , Budapest, Hungary","output":"Covid-19 infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with tnf- antagonists: A possible critictal enrollment of gut microbiota and vitamin d level C a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: South Korea took preemptive action against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by implementing extensive testing, thorough epidemiological investigation, strict social distancing, and rapid treatment of patients according to disease severity. The Korean government entrusted large-scale hospitals with the operation of living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) for the management for clinically healthy COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to introduce our experience implementing information and communications technology (ICT)-based remote patient management systems at a COVID-19 LTSC. METHODS: We adopted new electronic health record templates, hospital information system (HIS) dashboards, cloud-based medical image sharing, a mobile app, and smart vital sign monitoring devices. RESULTS: Enhancements were made to the HIS to assist in the workflow and care of patients in the LTSC. A dashboard was created for the medical staff to view the vital signs and symptoms of all patients. Patients used a mobile app to consult with their physician or nurse, answer questionnaires, and input self-measured vital signs; the results were uploaded to the hospital information system in real time. Cloud-based image sharing enabled interoperability between medical institutions. Korea's strategy of aggressive mitigation has \\"flattened the curve\\" of the rate of infection. A multidisciplinary approach was integral to develop systems supporting patient care and management at the living and treatment support center as quickly as possible.

Phlorotannins that are isolated from E. cava are well-known to have an antioxidant effect and strong antiviral activity against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which has a high mortality rate in piglets. In this study, the bioactive components were determined based on two different approaches: (i) bio-guided isolation using the antiviral activity against the H1N1 viral strain, which is a representative influenza virus that originates from swine and (ii) high-resolution mass spectrometry-based dereplication, including relative mass defects (RMDs) and HPLC-qTOFMS fragmentation analysis. The EC70 fraction showed the strongest antiviral activity and contained thirteen phlorotannins, which were predicted by dereplication. Ten compounds were directly isolated from E. cava extract and then identified. Moreover, the dereplication method allowed for the discovery of two new phlorotannins. The structures of these two isolated compounds were elucidated using NMR techniques and HPLC-qTOFMS fragmentation analysis. In addition, molecular modelling was applied to determine the absolute configurations of the two new compounds. The antiviral activities of seven major phlorotannins in active fraction were evaluated against two influenza A viral strains (H1N1 and H9N2). Six of the compounds showed moderate to strong effects on both of the viruses and phlorofucofuroeckol A (12), which showed an EC(50) value of 13.48  1.93 M, is a potential active antiviral component of E. cava.","output":"Dereplication by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectroscopy (qTOF-MS) and Antiviral Activities of Phlorotannins from Ecklonia cava"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nation-wide response to COVID-19 has impacted the structure of facilities and training since March 2020.

After 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, four animals, respectively, underwent a new laparoscopy with the harvesting of mesh and fascia. Quantitative measurement of the mesh size was performed and expressed as percentage shrinkage. Random core biopsies of mesh and adjacent tissue were obtained and histologically examined. RESULTS There was a significant difference of the two meshes with respect to shrinkage at all time points. The coated polyester-based mesh was exposed to more shrinkage compared to the polypropylene mesh covered with anti-adhesive material. Random biopsies at 3 months showed an increased foreign body reaction to the coated polyester mesh.

Under pathological conditions and in response to inflammatory stimuli, extracellular ATP is released from damaged cells and is metabolized to extracellular adenosine. However, studies over the past 30 years provide strong evidence for another source of extracellular adenosine, namely the cAMP-adenosine pathway. The cAMP-adenosine pathway is a biochemical mechanism mediated by ATP-binding cassette transporters that facilitate cAMP efflux and by specific ectoenzymes that convert cAMP to AMP (ecto-PDEs) and AMP to adenosine (ecto-nucleotidases such as CD73). Importantly, the cAMP-adenosine pathway is operative in many cell types, including those of the airways. In airways, (2)-adrenoceptor agonists, which are used as bronchodilators for treatment of asthma and chronic respiratory diseases, stimulate cAMP efflux and thus trigger the extracellular cAMP-adenosine pathway leading to increased concentrations of extracellular adenosine in airways. In the airways, extracellular adenosine exerts pro-inflammatory effects and induces bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. These considerations lead to the hypothesis that the cAMP-adenosine pathway attenuates the efficacy of (2)-adrenoceptor agonists. Indeed, our recent findings support this view. In this mini-review, we will highlight the potential role of the extracellular cAMP-adenosine pathway in chronic respiratory inflammatory disorders, and we will explore how extracellular cAMP could interfere with the regulatory effects of intracellular cAMP on airway smooth muscle and innate immune cell function.

Early clinical indicators of severe hepatitis B include acratia, gastrointestinal symptoms, a daily increase in serum bilirubin >1 mg/dL, toxic intestinal paralysis, bleeding tendency and mild mind anomaly or character change, and the presence of other diseases inducing severe hepatitis. Laboratory indicators include T-Bil, PTA, cholinesterase, pre-albumin and albumin. The roles of immune indicators (such as IL-6, TNF-, and fgl2), gene polymorphisms, HBV genotypes, and gene mutations as early clinical indicators. 2. Intensive Care Unit monitor patients with severe hepatitis include intracranial pressure, infection, blood dynamics, respiratory function, renal function, blood coagulation function, nutritional status and blood purification process. Nursing care should not only include routine care, but psychological and special care (complications). 3. Nutrition support and nursing care should be maintained throughout treatment for severe hepatitis. Common methods of evaluating nutritional status include direct human body measurement, creatinine height index (CHI) and subject global assessment of nutrition (SGA). Malnourished patients should receive enteral or parenteral nutrition support. 4. Immune therapies for severe hepatitis include promoting hepatocyte regeneration (e.g. with glucagon, hepatocyte growth factor and prostaglandin E1), glucocorticoid suppressive therapy, and targeting molecular blocking. Corticosteroid treatment should be early and sufficient, and adverse drug reactions monitored. Treatments currently being investigated are those targeting Toll-like receptors, NK cell/NK cell receptors, macrophage/immune coagulation system, CTLA-4/PD-1 and stem cell transplantation. 5. In addition to conventional drugs and radioiodine, corticosteroids and artificial liver treatment can also be considered for severe hepatitis patients with hyperthyreosis. Patients with gestational severe hepatitis require preventive therapy for fetal growth restriction, and it is necessary to choose the timing and method of fetal delivery. For patients with both diabetes and severe hepatitis, insulin is preferred to oral antidiabetic agents to control blood glucose concentration. Liver toxicity of corticosteroids and immune suppressors should be monitored during treatment for severe hepatitis in patients with connective tissue diseases including SLE, RA and sicca syndrome. Patient with connective tissue diseases should preferably be started after the antiviral treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues. 6. An artificial liver can improve patients liver function; remove endotoxins, blood ammonia and other toxins; correct amino acid metabolism and coagulation disorders; and reverse internal environment imbalances. Non-bioartificial livers are suitable for patients with early and middle stage severe hepatitis; for late-stage patients waiting for liver transplantation; and for transplanted patients with rejection reaction or transplant failure. The type of artificial liver should be determined by each patients condition and previous treatment purpose, and patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions and complications. Bio- and hybrid artificial livers are still under development. 7. MELD score is the international standard for choosing liver transplantation. Surgical methods mainly include the in situ classic type and the piggyback type; transplantation includes no liver prophase, no liver phase or new liver phase. Preoperative preparation, management of intraoperative and postoperative complications and postoperative long-term treatment are keys to success. 8.

The importance of these micronutrients starts early in the human life cycle and continues across its different stages. Several studies have emphasized the critical role of a well-balanced micronutrient intake. However, the majority of studies looked into or examined such issues in relation to a specific element or life stage, with the majority merely reporting the effect of either excess or deficiency. Herein, in this review, we will look in depth at the orchestration of the main element requirements across the human life cycle beginning from fertility and pregnancy, passing through infancy, childhood, adolescence, and reaching adulthood and senility, with insight on the interactions among them and underlying action mechanisms. Emphasis is given towards approaches to the role of the different minerals in the life cycle, associated symptoms for under- or overdoses, and typical management for each element, with future perspectives. The effect of sex is also discussed for each micronutrient for each life stage as literature suffice to highlight the different daily requirements and or effects.","output":"Dietary Micronutrients from Zygote to Senility: Updated Review of Minerals Role and Orchestration in Human Nutrition throughout Life Cycle with Sex Differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared a worldwide pandemic in 2020. Infection triggers the respiratory tract disease COVID-19, which is accompanied by serious changes in clinical biomarkers such as hemoglobin and interleukins. The same parameters are altered during hemolysis, which is characterized by an increase in labile heme. We present two computational-experimental approaches aimed at analyzing a potential link between heme-related and COVID-19 pathophysiologies. Herein, we performed a detailed analysis of the common pathways induced by heme and SARS-CoV-2 by superimposition of knowledge graphs covering heme biology and COVID-19 pathophysiology. Focus was laid on inflammatory pathways and distinct biomarkers as the linking elements. In a second approach, four COVID-19-related proteins, the host cell proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as well as the viral proteins 7a and S protein were computationally analyzed as potential heme-binding proteins with an experimental validation. The results contribute to the understanding of the progression of COVID-19 infections in patients with different clinical backgrounds and may allow for a more individual diagnosis and therapy in the future.","output":"Linking COVID-19 and Heme-Driven Pathophysiologies: A Combined Computational-Experimental Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to profound limitations in patient care and student teaching at the University Hospitals of Otorhinolaryngology (ORL). In contrast, the impact on research has been variable. To classify the pandemic-related effect on research, the development of the number of scientific publications of the German ORL university hospitals before and during the pandemic was analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The publication performance between 2015 and 2020 of the 39 current chairmen was surveyed using a literature search (Pubmed). All entries relating to the chairmen of the university hospital as first, last or co-author were included. The absolute and relative development of each author's publication performance was determined and evaluated using nonparametric statistical methods. RESULTS: A total of 2420 publications could be documented. From 2015 to 2019, an average of 368 publications were published per year. In 2020, this number increased by 57.9a??% to 581 publications. While the number of monthly publications remained constant between 2015 and 2019, a significant increase was seen from May 2020 up to a maximum of 74 publications in September 2020. In 2020, 34 articles (5.9a??%) had a thematic relation to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with 7 of these papers (20.6a??%) resulting from cross-site publications. CONCLUSION: In 2020, the number of scientific publications was raised to more than 1.5 times the usual annual publications. This increase was clearly related in time to the reduction of elective patient care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic starting in mid-March 2020. Probably, free time capacities enabled this increased publication output. Our results confirm the great scientific potential of the ORL university hospitals, which has been successfully implemented despite the pandemic.","output":"[Development of the publication activity at the German university hospitals for Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic in 2020]./ Entwicklung der Publikationsleistung der Universit?tskliniken fr Hals-Nasen-Ohrenheilkunde, Kopf- und Hals-Chirurgie w?hrend der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie im Jahr 2020 in Deutschland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Timely and effective contact tracing is an essential public health measure for curbing the transmission of COVID-19. App-based contact tracing has the potential to optimize the resources of overstretched public health departments. However, its efficiency is dependent on widespread adoption. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the uptake of the Australian Government's COVIDSafe app among Australians and examine the reasons why some Australians have not downloaded the app. METHODS: An online national survey, with representative quotas for age and gender, was conducted between May 8 and May 11, 2020. Participants were excluded if they were a health care professional or had been tested for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 (16.0%) were excluded prior to completing the survey, 13 (0.7%) declined, and 1500 (83.2%) participated in the survey. Of the 1500 survey participants, 37.3% (n=560) had downloaded the COVIDSafe app, 18.7% (n=280) intended to do so, 27.7% (n=416) refused to do so, and 16.3% (n=244) were undecided. Equally proportioned reasons for not downloading the app included privacy (165/660, 25.0%) and technical concerns (159/660, 24.1%). Other reasons included the belief that social distancing was sufficient and the app was unnecessary (111/660, 16.8%), distrust in the government (73/660, 11.1%), and other miscellaneous responses (eg, apathy and following the decisions of others) (73/660, 11.1%). In addition, knowledge about COVIDSafe varied among participants, as some were confused about its purpose and capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: For the COVIDSafe app to be accepted by the public and used correctly, public health messages need to address the concerns of citizens, specifically privacy, data storage, and technical capabilities. Understanding the specific barriers preventing the uptake of contact tracing apps provides the opportunity to design targeted communication strategies aimed at strengthening public health initiatives, such as downloading and correctly using contact tracing apps.","output":"Concerns and Misconceptions About the Australian Government's COVIDSafe App: Cross-Sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) exhibit a wide spectrum of clinical and laboratory features when presenting to hospital and pathophysiologic mechanisms differentiating low-risk and high-risk PE are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognostic value of clinical, laboratory and radiological information that is available within routine tests undertaken for patients with acute PE. METHODS: Electronic patient records (EPR) of patients who underwent Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) scan for the investigation of acute PE during 6-month period (01.01.2016C30.06.2016) were examined. Data was gathered from EPR for patients that met inclusion criteria and all CTPA scans were re-evaluated. Biochemical thresholds of low-grade and high-grade inflammation, serum CRP >10mg/L and >150mg/L and serum albumin concentrations <35g/L and <25 g/L, were combined in the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and peri-operative Glasgow Prognostic Score (poGPS) respectively. Neutrophil Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also calculated. Pulmonary Embolus Severity Index score was calculated. RESULTS: Of the total CTPA reports (n = 2129) examined, 245 patients were eligible for inclusion. Of these, 20 (8%) patients had died at 28-days and 43 (18%) at 6-months. Of the 197 non-cancer related presentations, 28-day and 6-month mortality were 3% and 8% respectively. Of the 48 cancer related presentations, 28-day and 6-month mortality were 29% and 58% respectively. On univariate analysis, age 65 years (p<0.01), PESI score 100(p = <0.001), NLR 3(p<0.001) and Coronary Artery Calcification (CAC) score  6 (p<0.001) were associated with higher 28-day and 6-month mortality. PESI score 100 (OR 5.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 24.2, P <0.05), poGPS 1 (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2C5.0, P = 0.01) and NLR 3 (OR 3.7, 95% CI: 1.0C3.4, P <0.05) remained independently associated with 28-day mortality. On multivariate binary logistic regression analysis of factors associated with 6-month mortality, PESI score 100 (OR 6.2, 95% CI: 2.3C17.0, p<0.001) and coronary artery calcification score 6 (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1C4.8, p = 0.030) remained independently associated with death at 6-months. When patients who had an underlying cancer diagnosis were excluded from the analysis only GPS1 remained independently associated with 6-month mortality (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.2C22.0, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: PESI score >100, poGPS1, NLR 3 and CAC score 6 were associated with 28-day and 6-month mortality. PESI score 100, poGPS1 and NLR 3 remained independently associated with 28-day mortality. PESI score 100 and CAC score 6 remained independently associated with 6-month mortality. When patients with underlying cancer were excluded from the analysis, GPS1 remained independently associated with 6-month mortality. The role of the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) in determining treatment and prognosis requires further study.

Different research perspectives on health are needed in order to manage and monitor this crisis. Performance intelligence is an approach that emphasises the need for different research perspectives in supporting health systems decision-makers to determine policies based on well-informed choices. In this paper, we present the viewpoint of the Innovative Training Network for Healthcare Performance Intelligence Professionals (HealthPros) on how performance intelligence can be used during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: A lack of standardised information, paired with limited discussion and alignment between countries contribute to uncertainty in decision-making in all countries. Consequently, a plethora of different non-data-driven and uncoordinated approaches to address the outbreak are noted worldwide. Comparative health system research is needed to help countries shape their response models in social care, public health, primary care, hospital care and long-term care through the different phases of the pandemic. There is a need in each phase to compare context-specific bundles of measures where the impact on health outcomes can be modelled using targeted data and advanced statistical methods. Performance intelligence can be pursued to compare data, construct indicators and identify optimal strategies. Embracing a system perspective will allow countries to take coordinated strategic decisions while mitigating the risk of system collapse.A framework for the development and implementation of performance intelligence has been outlined by the HealthPros Network and is of pertinence. Health systems need better and more timely data to govern through a pandemic-induced transition period where tensions between care needs, demand and capacity are exceptionally high worldwide. Health systems are challenged to ensure essential levels of healthcare towards all patients, including those who need routine assistance. CONCLUSION: Performance intelligence plays an essential role as part of a broader public health strategy in guiding the decisions of health system actors on the implementation of contextualised measures to tackle COVID-19 or any future epidemic as well as their effect on the health system at large. This should be based on commonly agreed-upon standardised data and fit-for-purpose indicators, making optimal use of existing health information infrastructures. The HealthPros Network can make a meaningful contribution.","output":"Managing COVID-19 within and across health systems: why we need performance intelligence to coordinate a global response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rather than receive the effective 2vHPV vaccines that are readily available in China, Chinese women usually wait to receive 4v and 9vHPV vaccines, which are difficult to acquire.

METHODS: We performed secondary data analysis using tract (N = 73,056) and county (N = 3142) level data from the US Census Bureau and other sources for the USA. Confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population was our outcome measure. We performed mixed-effect negative binomial regression to examine the association of county population's percentage residing in concentrated disadvantage and Black-concentrated tracts with COVID-19 deaths while controlling for several other characteristics. RESULTS: For every 10% increase in the percentage of county population residing in concentrated disadvantage and Black-concentrated tracts, the rate for confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population increases by a factor of 1.14 (mortality rate ratio [MMR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.11, 1.18) and 1.11 (MMR = 1.11; 95% CI:1.08, 1.14), respectively.

DTS is challenging for children. Swabbing the respiratory mucosa requires trained personnel and may trigger sneezing and coughing, which generate droplets. A reliable, simple and safe sampling method applicable to a wide age range is required for community-based surveillance. Methods: We introduced nasal strip as an easy and low-risk collection method. Asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n = 38) were recruited. Nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) (n = 43) strip paired with nasal swab (n = 13) were collected by a healthcare worker to compare with NPSTS (n = 21) or DTS (n =22) collected within 24 hours as reference. All samples were subjected to viral RNA quantitation by real-time PCR targeting the nucleoprotein gene. Results: Comparable Ct values were observed between paired nasal strip and nasal swab samples. The agreement between nasal strip samples and NPSTS was 94.44% and 100% for NPSTS positive and negative samples. Higher viral RNA concentration was detected in nasal strips than DTS samples.

Patients/Method: In this pre-planned sub-study of the PermiT (Permissive Underfeeding vs. Target Enteral Feeding in Adult Critically Ill Patients) trial, we included critically ill patients who were expected to stay for 14 days in the intensive care unit. We measured FFAs level on day 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 of enrollment. Of 70 enrolled patients, 23 (32.8%) patients had high FFAs level (baseline FFAs level >0.45 mmol/L in females and >0.6 mmol/L in males). Results: Patients with high FFAs level were significantly older and more likely to be females and diabetics and they had lower ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, higher creatinine, and higher total cholesterol levels than those with normal FFAs level. During the study period, patients with high FFAs level had higher blood glucose and required more insulin. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the predictors of high baseline FFAs level were diabetes (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 5.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56, 18.43, p = 0.008) and baseline cholesterol level (aOR, 4.29; 95% CI: 11.64, 11.19, p = 0.003).

In this study, we propose a non-invasive hydration monitoring technique employing non-ionizing electromagnetic power in the microwave band to estimate the changes in the water content of the whole body. Specifically, we investigate changes in the attenuation coefficient in the frequency range 2C3.5 GHz between a pair of planar antennas positioned across a participants arm during various states of hydration. Twenty healthy young adults (10M, 10F) underwent controlled hypohydration and euhydration control bouts. The attenuation coefficient was compared among trials and used to predict changes in body mass. Volunteers lost [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] body mass during hypohydration and euhydration, respectively. The microwave transmission-based attenuation coefficient (2C3.5 GHz) was accurate in predicting changes in hydration status.

Life expectancies have been extended by cART, but age-related comorbidities have increased which are associated with heavy physiological and economic burdens on PLWH. The obstacle to a functional HIV cure can be ascribed to the formation of latent reservoir establishment at the time of acute infection that persists during cART. Recent studies suggest that some HIV reservoirs are established in the early acute stages of HIV infection within multiple immune cells that are gradually shaped by various host and viral mechanisms and may undergo clonal expansion. Early cART initiation has been shown to reduce the reservoir size in HIV-infected individuals. Memory CD4+ T cell subsets are regarded as the predominant cellular compartment of the HIV reservoir, but monocytes and derivative macrophages or dendritic cells also play a role in the persistent virus infection. HIV latency is regulated at multiple molecular levels in transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Epigenetic regulation of the proviral promoter can profoundly regulate the viral transcription. In addition, transcriptional elongation, RNA splicing, and nuclear export pathways are also involved in maintaining HIV latency. Although most proviruses contain large internal deletions, some defective proviruses may induce immune activation by expressing viral proteins or producing replication-defective viral-like particles. In this review article, we discuss the state of the art on mechanisms of virus persistence in the periphery and tissue and summarize interdisciplinary approaches toward a functional HIV cure, including novel capabilities and strategies to measure and eliminate the infected reservoirs and induce immune control.","output":"Insights Into Persistent HIV-1 Infection and Functional Cure: Novel Capabilities and Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plant communities worldwide show varied responses to nutrient enrichment-including shifts in species identity, decreased diversity, and changes in functional trait composition-but the factors determining community recovery after the cessation of nutrient addition remain uncertain. We manipulated nutrient levels in a tundra community for 6 years of nutrient addition followed by 8 years of recovery. We examined how community recovery was mediated by traits related to plant resource-use strategy and plant ability to modify their environment. Overall, we observed persistent effects of fertilization on plant communities. We found that plants with fast-growing traits, including higher specific leaf area, taller stature and lower foliar C:N, were more likely to show a persistent increase in fertilized plots than control plots, maintaining significantly higher cover in fertilized plots 8 years after cessation of fertilization. Additionally, although graminoids responded most strongly to the initial fertilization treatment, forb species were more vulnerable to fertilization effects in the long-term, showing persistent decline and no recovery in 8 years. Finally, these persistent fertilization effects were accompanied by modified environmental conditions, including persistent increases in litter depth and soil phosphorous and lower soil C:N. Our results demonstrate the potential for lasting effects of nutrient enrichment in nutrient-limited systems and identify species traits related to rapid growth and nutrient-use efficiency as the main predictors of the persistence of nutrient enrichment effects.

The Womens Advanced Risk-assessment in Manitoba (WARM) Hearts study will examine the use of novel non-invasive assessments and biomarkers to identify women who are at elevated risk for adverse cardiovascular events. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: One thousand women 55 years of age or older will be recruited and screened by the WARM Hearts observational, cohort study. The two screening appointments will include assessments of medical history, gender variables, body composition, cognition, frailty status, functional fitness, physical activity levels, nutritional status, quality of life questionnaires, sleep behaviour, resting blood pressure (BP), BP response to moderate-intensity exercise, a non-invasive measure of arterial stiffness and heart rate variability. Blood sample analysis will be used to assess lipid and novel biomarker profiles and stool samples will support the characterisation of gut microbiota.

Small molecules offer an attractive alternative to growth factors for producing hepatic cells since they are more economical and relatively stable. METHODS: We dissect small-molecule combinations and identify the ideal cocktails to achieve an optimally efficient and cost-effective strategy for hepatic cells differentiation, expansion, and maturation. RESULTS: We demonstrated that small-molecule cocktail CIP (including CHIR99021, IDE1, and PD0332991) efficiently induced definitive endoderm (DE) formation via increased endogenous TGF-/Nodal signaling. Furthermore, we identified that combining Vitamin C, Dihexa, and Forskolin (VDF) could substitute growth factors to induce hepatic specification. The obtained hepatoblasts (HBs) could subsequently expand and mature into functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) by the established chemical formulas. Thus, we established a stepwise strategy with complete small molecules for efficiently producing scalable HBs and functionally matured HLCs. The small-molecule-derived HLCs displayed typical functional characteristics as mature hepatocytes in vitro and repopulating injured liver in vivo.

Among presented data, we were surprised to see that serum albumin (ALB) concentrations during hospitalization did not significantly predict patient death at the multivariate analysis (MA), even if 86.6% of patients showed ALB values <35 g/L, i.e. the lower reference limit. In a similar COVID\\\\19 population enrolled in our national reference center for infectious diseases, we recently analysed a group of common biochemistry tests, including ALB, as major predictor of COVID\\\\19 severity (2). Although the patient rate showing an ALB <35 g/L was quite similar (89%) to that of Hundts study, at MA low ALB concentrations remained significantly associated (P=0.003) with higher odds of death, ALB values 18 g/L giving a positive likelihood ratio of 12.2 for predicting in\\\\hospital death. In terms of absolute ALB levels in the respective populations, it is however somewhat difficult to compare our results with those of Hundt et al. as the authors do not mention the methodology used to determine ALB in their hospital network. It is known that immunoturbidimetric assays for ALB determination, such as the one in use in our institution, are specific for the ALB measurement contrary to nonspecific colorimetric methods, which are in use in the majority of U.S. healthcare institutions, also reacting with proteins other than ALB (3). The well\\\\known lack of specificity of the latter methods, especially at low ALB and high globulin (including acute phase reactants) concentrations, i.e. the typical COVID\\\\19 situation, may have influenced the Hundts results.

The unique ethnic, socioeconomic, and cultural diversities in these settings have important implications for the IC process, such as individual decisional autonomy, beneficence, confidentiality, and signing the IC document. MAIN TEXT: Drawing on insights and field observations from conducting CBPARs across several rural, highly communal, low literate, and low-income communities in Ghana, we discuss some theoretical, ethico-cultural, and methodological challenges associated with applying the universal, Western individualistic cultural value-laden IC process in sub-Saharan Africa. By citing field situations, we discuss how local cultural customs and the socioeconomic adversities prevalent in these settings can influence (and disrupt) the information disclosure process, individual decisional authority for consent, and voluntariness. We review the theoretical assumptions of the Declaration of Helsinkis statement on IC and discuss its limitations as an ultimate guide for the conduct of social science research in the highly communal African context. We argue that the IC process in these settings should include strategies directed at preventing deception and coercion, in addition to ensuring respect for individual autonomy. We urge Universities, research institutions, and institutional review boards in Africa to design and promote the use of context-appropriate ethical IC guidelines that take into consideration both the local customs and traditional practices of the people as well as the scientific principles underpinning the universal IC standards. CONCLUSION: We recommend that, rather than adopt a universal one-size-fits-all IC approach, researchers working in the rural, highly collectivistic, low literate, socioeconomically disadvantaged settings of sub-Saharan Africa should deeply consider the roles and influence of cultural values and traditional practices on the IC and the research process.

While the vaccine prevents severe course of and death from COVID-19, the observation of pulmonary, abdominal, and intracranial venous thromboembolic events has raised concerns. Objective: To describe the clinical manifestations and the concerning management of patients with cranial venous sinus thrombosis following first exposure to the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca. Methods: Patient files, laboratory findings, and diagnostic imaging results, and endovascular interventions of three concerning patients were evaluated in retrospect. Results: Three women with intracranial venous sinus thrombosis after their first vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca were encountered. Patient #1 was 22 years old and developed headaches four days after the vaccination. On day 7, she experienced a generalized epileptic seizure. Patient #2 was 46 years old. She presented with severe headaches, hemianopia to the right, and mild aphasia 13 days after the vaccination. MRI showed a left occipital intracerebral hemorrhage. Patient #3 was 36 years old and presented 17 days after the vaccination with acute somnolence and right-hand hemiparesis. The three patients were diagnosed with extensive venous sinus thrombosis. They were managed by heparinization and endovascular recanalization of their venous sinuses. They shared similar findings: elevated levels of D-dimers, platelet factor 4 antiplatelet antibodies, corona spike protein antibodies, combined with thrombocytopenia. Under treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin, platelet counts normalized within several days. Conclusion: Early observations insinuate that the exposure to the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca might trigger the expression of antiplatelet antibodies, resulting in a condition with thrombocytopenia and venous thrombotic events (e.g., intracranial venous sinus thrombosis).

METHODS Disease progression models of HCV infection for each country were updated with latest data on chronic HCV prevalence, and annual diagnosis and treatment levels, assumed to remain constant in the future. Modelled outcomes were analysed to determine the year in which each country would meet the WHO 2030 elimination targets. RESULTS Of the 45 countries studied, 11 (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom) are on track to meet WHO's elimination targets by 2030; five (Austria, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, and South Korea) by 2040; and two (Saudi Arabia and Taiwan) by 2050. The remaining 27 countries are not expected to achieve elimination before 2050. Compared to progress in 2017, South Korea is no longer on track to eliminate HCV by 2030, three (Canada, Germany, and Sweden) are now on track, and most countries (30) saw no change. CONCLUSIONS Assuming high-income countries will maintain current levels of diagnosis and treatment, only 24% are on track to eliminate HCV by 2030, and 60% are off track by at least 20 years.

Limited data exist regarding comparison with non-Covid-19 patients with similar characteristics. The objective was to compare the rates of DVT in patients with and without COVID-19 and to determine the impact of DVT on outcome. METHODS: Retrospective, observational cohort study. Single institution, level 1 Trauma Center. COVID-19 patients compared with a group of non-COVID-19. Patients included a non-COVID-19 group from March 20, 2019 to June 30, 2019 and a COVID-19 group from the same interval in 2020. Standard prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin 5,000 units three times daily or enoxaparin 40 mg daily not weight adjusted (n=573) and enoxaparin 40 mg daily not weight adjusted (n=213). Two primary outcomes included the rate of DVT in the COVID-19 group compared to the historic control, and the impact of DVT on mortality. Subgroup analysis included patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), and intensive care unit patients (ICU). RESULTS: The rate of DVT and PE in the 573 patients, age 61  17 years, male 44.9%, was 71/573 (12.4%) and 19/573 (3.3%) compared to 72/213 (33.8%) and 15.213 (7.0%) in COVID-19 patients, age 61  16 years, male 61.0%. Unprovoked PE occurred in 10/15 (66.7%) in COVID-19 patients compared to 8/497 (1.6%) in non-COVID-19. Patients with ARDS (n=60) had an incidence of DVT 28/60 (46.7%) versus 44/153 (28.8%), p=0.01. ICU patients had an increased rate of DVT in COVID-19 patients: 39/90 (43.3%) versus 33/123 (33.3%), p=0.01. Risk factors for mortality included age, DVT, multiple organ failure syndrome, and prolonged ventilatory support with the following odd ratios: 1.030, 95% CI 1.002 C 1.058, 2.847, 95% CI 1.356-5.5979, 4.438, 95% CI 1.973-9.985, and 5.321, 95% CI 1.973-14.082. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of DVT in COVID-19 patients receiving standard dose not weight-adjusted prophylactic anticoagulation is high, particularly in ICU patients. DVT is one of the contributing factors to increased mortality. These results suggest re-evaluation of the present standard dose thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19.","output":"The incidence and the impact of deep vein thrombosis on the outcome of patients with COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: 3D printing technology in hospitals facilitates production models such as point-of-care manufacturing.

Thus, RNA cap methylation is an attractive target for antiviral discovery and development of new live attenuated vaccines. For coronaviruses, RNA cap structure is first methylated at the guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) position by nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14), which facilitates and precedes the subsequent ribose 2'-O methylation by the nsp16-nsp10 complex. Using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an Alphacoronavirus, as a model, we showed that G-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) of PEDV nsp14 methylated RNA substrates in a sequence-unspecific manner. PEDV nsp14 can efficiently methylate RNA substrates with various lengths in both neutral and alkaline pH environments and can methylate cap analogs (GpppA and GpppG) and single-nucleotide GTP but not ATP, CTP, or UTP. Mutations to the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) binding motif in the nsp14 abolished the G-N-7 MTase activity and were lethal to PEDV. However, recombinant rPEDV-D350A with a single mutation (D350A) in nsp14, which retained 29.0% of G-N-7 MTase activity, was viable. Recombinant rPEDV-D350A formed a significantly smaller plaque and had significant defects in viral protein synthesis and viral replication in Vero CCL-81 cells and intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-DQ). Notably, rPEDV-D350A induced significantly higher expression of both type I and III interferons in IPEC-DQ cells than the parental rPEDV. Collectively, our results demonstrate that G-N-7 MTase activity of PEDV modulates viral replication, gene expression, and innate immune responses.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) include a wide range of important human and animal pathogens. Examples of human CoVs include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the most recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Examples of pig CoVs include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV). There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs for most of these viruses. All known CoVs encode a bifunctional nsp14 protein which possesses ExoN and guanine-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) activities, responsible for replication fidelity and RNA cap G-N-7 methylation, respectively. Here, we biochemically characterized G-N-7 MTase of PEDV nsp14 and found that G-N-7 MTase-deficient PEDV was defective in replication and induced greater responses of type I and III interferons. These findings highlight that CoV G-N-7 MTase may be a novel target for rational design of live attenuated vaccines and antiviral drugs.","output":"Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Deficient in RNA Cap Guanine-N-7 Methylation Is Attenuated and Induces Higher Type I and III Interferon Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective.

Recent advances in treatment and care of CF patients including the use of new and highly effective CFTR modulators, have led to a dramatic increase in survival; young patients with CF can now expect to live to or beyond middle age, where cancer is more frequent. CF patients are now known to face an increased risk of digestive tract cancer-particularly cancer of the colon. The risk, which could be triggered by associated CF-related conditions or other genetic mechanisms, is even greater in patients who received a transplant. There is also some evidence that CF patients develop adenomatous polyps more frequently and at an earlier age than non-CF subjects. To reduce the excess risk of intestinal cancer in CF patients, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has developed colonoscopy-based guidelines. For non-transplanted patients, colonoscopy should commence at age 40, with rescreening at five-year intervals; the screening interval should be shortened to three years if adenomatous polyps are discovered. For transplanted patients, screening should start at age 30, or within two years of the transplant operation. Prior to colonoscopy, it is essential for CF patients to undergo a special, more intensive bowel preparation than normally used for non-CF persons. Whether the new drugs that have dramatically improved morbidity and mortality for CF patients will alter the risk of cancer is unknown and needs to be assessed in future studies.","output":"Cancer in Cystic Fibrosis: A Narrative Review of Prevalence, Risk Factors, Screening and Treatment Challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world's practice has shown the importance of medical rehabilitation, which allows increasing the effectiveness of treatment of patients with COVID-19, and also significantly reduce the risks of developing complications after COVID-19.

Herein, we performed RNA sequencing using peripheral blood from acute and convalescent patients and interrogated the dynamic changes of adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection over time. Our results revealed numerous alterations in these cohorts in terms of gene expression profiles and the features of immune repertoire. Moreover, a machine learning method was developed and resulted in the identification of five independent biomarkers and a collection of biomarkers that could accurately differentiate and predict the development of COVID-19. Interestingly, the increased expression of one of these biomarkers, UCHL1, a molecule related to nervous system damage, was associated with the clustering of severe symptoms. Importantly, analyses on immune repertoire metrics revealed the distinct kinetics of T-cell and B-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with B-cell response plateaued in the acute phase and declined thereafter, whereas T-cell response can be maintained for up to 6 months post-infection onset and T-cell clonality was positively correlated with the serum level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG.

METHODS: In a retrospective single-center study design, 1193 patients with COVID-19 infection were studied. Patients were then classified into those with and without a history of HCV, 50 (4.1%) and 1157 (95.9%) respectively. RESULTS: Multivariate cox-regression models showed that age, HCV, D-Dimer, and ferritin were the only predictors of in-hospital mortality. Acute liver injury and fibrosis score (Fib-4 score) were not different between both groups. Multivariate cox-regression model for liver profile revealed that aspartate aminotransferase/ alanine aminotransferase ratio, Fib-4 score, and HCV were predictors of in-hospital mortality. After propensity score matching HCV was the only predictor of mortality in the multivariate cox-regression model.

However, DDX3 seems to be an important target for several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and poxvirus. DDX3 interacts with HIV-1 Rev or HCV Core protein and modulates its function. At least, DDX3 is required for both HIV-1 and HCV replication. Therefore, DDX3 could be a novel therapeutic target for the development of drug against HIV-1 and HCV.","output":"Multiple functions of DDX3 RNA helicase in gene regulation, tumorigenesis, and viral infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Sociodemographic factors such as age, race, education, family income, and sex have been reported to influence COVID-related perceptions, reflected by knowledge, stress, and preventive behavior. We conducted a US-based survey to estimate the difference in COVID-related perceptions among diverse sociodemographic groups and the influence of sociodemographic heterogeneity on COVID-related perceptions. Methods: The survey enquired about sociodemographic parameters and relevant information to measure knowledge, stress, and preventive behavior. COVID-perception scores among sociodemographic subgroups were compared with ANOVA (Bonferroni). The general linear model (GLM) was used to estimate the association among sociodemographic factors and COVID-related perceptions. Results: Females (75%) and White participants (78%) were the predominant (N = 3734). Females, White participants, wealthy, and educated participants demonstrated better knowledge, while participants of minority races, younger ages, low incomes, and females experienced high stress. Females, African-Americans, and educated participants better adopted preventive behaviors. Race, family income, and sex were the highest contributors to the predictive model. Sociodemographic determinants had statistically significant associations with knowledge (F-score = 7.72, p < 0.001; foremost predictor: race), stress (F-score = 16.46, p < 0.001; foremost predictor: income), and preventive behavior (GLM: F-score = 7.72, p < 0.001, foremost predictor: sex).

Recent differentiable fluid simulations allow gradient based methods to optimize e.g. fluid control systems in an informed manner. Solving the partial differential equations governed by the dynamics of the underlying physical systems, however, is a challenging task and current numerical approximation schemes still come at high computational costs. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework that allows powerful deep neural networks to learn the dynamics of incompressible fluids end to end on a grid-based representation. For this purpose, we introduce a loss function that penalizes residuals of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations. After training, the framework yields models that are capable of fast and differentiable fluid simulations and can handle various fluid phenomena such as the Magnus effect and K\\\\'arm\\\\'an vortex streets.

Hospital or secondary care contact may present a teachable moment to provide parents with support to change their home smoking behaviours to reduce childrens SHSe. There is a lack of robust qualitative evidence around parents and healthcare professionals (HCPs) views on using this teachable moment to successfully initiate behavioural change. We aim to identify and understand what is important to stakeholders with a view to informing the development of a support package to help parents change their home smoking behaviours. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This qualitative study will be theoretically underpinned by the Capability, Opportunity and Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) model of behavioural change. It will involve semistructured interviews and/or discussion groups with up to 20 parents who smoke and up to 25 HCPs. Stakeholders will be recruited from a single National Health Service childrens hospital in England. Interviews and/or discussion groups will be audio recorded, transcribed and anonymised. The transcripts and any field notes will be analysed using the framework method. Initially, we will apply COM-B to the data deductively and will then code inductively within each domain.

With rising new cases of COVID 19 propelling various African governments to enforce strict restrictions of varying degrees to curb the spread. Thus, the pandemic posed unprecedented shocks on agriculture and food supply chains in Sub Saharan Africa. In this study, we use survey data collected from nine countries in Central, Eastern, and Southern, Africa to understand the immediate impact of COVID-19 on production, distribution, and consumption of common beans, and possible food security implications. Descriptive analysis of data collected from bean farmers, aggregators, processors, bean regional coordinators, and mechanization dealers reveal that COVID-19 and government restrictions had impacted the availability and cost of farm inputs and labour, distribution, and consumption of beans in Eastern and Southern Africa. The immediate impacts were dire in Southern Africa with Central Africa slightly impacted. The production and distribution challenges negatively impacted on frequency and patterns of food consumption in households in Africa. Thus, the pandemic poses a greater risk to food security and poverty in the region.

In the present study, viral interference between two capripox viruses (sheeppox SPPV and lumpy skin disease virus LSDV in cattle) with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) was investigated in vitro and in their natural hosts, sheep and cattle. A combination of SPPV/RVFV and LSDV/RVFV was used to co-infect susceptible cells and animals to detect potential competition. In-vitro interference was evaluated by estimating viral infectivity and copies of viral RNA by a qPCR during three serial passages in cell cultures, whereas in-vivo interference was assessed through antibody responses to vaccination. When lamb testis primary cells were infected with the mixture of capripox and RVFV, the replication of both SPPV and LSDV was inhibited by RVFV. In animals, SPPV/RVFV or LSDV/RVFV combinations inhibited the replication SPPV and LSDV and the antibody response following vaccination. The combined SPPV/RVFV did not protect sheep after challenging with the virulent strain of SPPV and the LSDV/RVFV did not induce interferon Gamma to LSDV, while immunological response to RVFV remain unaffected. Our goal was to assess this interference response to RVFV/capripoxviruses' coinfection in order to develop effective combined live-attenuated vaccines as a control strategy for RVF and SPP/LSD diseases. Our findings indicated that this approach was not suitable for developing a combined SPPV/LSDV/RVFV vaccine candidate because of interference of replication and the immune response among these viruses.","output":"In-vitro and in-vivo study of the interference between Rift Valley fever virus (clone 13) and Sheeppox/Limpy Skin disease viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The landscape of dermatology services, already rapidly evolving into an increasingly digital one, has been irretrievably altered by the COVID\\\\19 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) pandemic. Data are needed to assess how best to deliver virtual dermatology services in specific patient subgroups in an era of ongoing social distancing and beyond. Initial studies of teledermatology in paediatric populations suggest that many of the problems experienced in adult telemedicine are more apparent when treating children and come with additional challenges. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of a virtual paediatric dermatology telephone clinic in comparison to traditional face\\\\to\\\\face (FTF) clinics, both from the clinician and patient/parental perspective. METHODS: We carried out a prospective service evaluation examining a single centre cohort of paediatric dermatology patients managed during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic via a telephone clinic supported by images. The study period covered JuneCSeptember 2020. Data on outcomes were collected from clinicians and a qualitative patient/parental telephone survey was undertaken separately. A five\\\\point Likert scale was used to assess both satisfaction and levels of agreement regarding whether a telephone clinic was more convenient than an FTF clinic. RESULTS: Of 116 patients included, 24% were new and 76% were follow\\\\up patients, with a mixture of inflammatory dermatoses (75%) and lesions (25%). From the clinician's perspective, most consultations (91%) were successfully completed over the telephone. However, qualitative patient and parent feedback paradoxically illustrated that although nearly all (98%) respondents had no outstanding concerns, 52% felt highly unsatisfied and only 22% agreed that telephone clinics were more convenient. Most (65%) preferred FTF follow\\\\up in the future. Statistical analysis using 2 test showed that among those with established follow\\\\ups, the preference for future consultation type was independent of specific reasons for follow\\\\up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a clear discrepancy between the practical successes of a virtual service from the clinicians perspective compared with the patient/parental perspective. Parental anxiety appears to be less effectively allayed virtually than with FTF. This raises the question of whether there is a role for virtual paediatric telephone clinics in the postpandemic future, which may be better left to patients/parents to decide on an individual basis.","output":"Evaluating paediatric dermatology telephone clinics during COVID\\\\19 from a dual clinician and patient perspective: a prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"B cells play a central role in antiviral and antiparasitic immunity, not only as producers of antibodies, but also as APCs and mediators of inflammation.

In order to investigate the mechanisms driving these issues, we have developed a mouse model for tissue engineered tracheal graft implantation. TETGs were constructed using electrospun polymers polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyurethane (PU) in a mixture of PET and PU (20:80 percent weight). Scaffolds were then seeded using bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from 6-8 week-old C57BL/6 mice by gradient centrifugation. Ten million cells per graft were seeded onto the lumen of the scaffold and allowed to incubate overnight before implantation between the third and seventh tracheal rings. These grafts were able to recapitulate the findings of stenosis and delayed epithelialization as demonstrated by histological analysis and lack of Keratin 5 and Keratin 14 basal epithelial cells on immunofluorescence.

However, not all US hospitals possess telehealth capabilities. This brief report was designed to explore US hospitals readiness with respect to telehealth availability. We hope to gain deeper insight into the factors affecting possession of these valuable capabilities, and how this varies between rural and urban areas. METHODS: Based on 2017 data from the American Hospital Association survey, Area Health Resource Files and Medicare cost reports, we used logistic regression models to identify predictors of telehealth and eICU capabilities in US hospitals. RESULTS: We found that larger hospitals (OR(telehealth) = 1.013; P < .01) and system members (OR(telehealth) = 1.55; P < .01) (OR(eICU) = 1.65; P < .01) had higher odds of possessing telehealth and eICU capabilities. We also found evidence suggesting that telehealth and eICU capabilities are concentrated in particular regions; the West North Central region was the most likely to possess capabilities, given that these hospitals had higher odds of possessing telehealth (OR = 1.49; P < .10) and eICU capabilities (OR = 2.15; P < .05). Rural hospitals had higher odds of possessing telehealth capabilities as compared to their urban counterparts, although this relationship was marginally significant (OR = 1.34, P < .10). CONCLUSIONS: US hospitals vary in their preparation to use telehealth to aid in the COVID\\\\19 battle, among other issues. Hospitals odds of possessing the capability to provide such services vary largely by region; overall, rural hospitals have more widespread telehealth capabilities than urban hospitals.

RANDOMISATION: Treatment will be allocated by block randomisation stratified by patient age (< or &#8805; 75 years of age). For this purpose, we will use the R randomizeR package using two block sizes (4 and 6) with random permutation. The randomisation sequence will be generated by a unit (the Navarrabiomed Clinical Trials Platform) independent from the researchers who will recruit patients and implement the protocol. BLINDING (MASKING): The study will be quadruple-blinded, specifically, with blinding of patients, intervention providers, outcome assessors and data managers. The pharmacy at each participating hospital will prepare indistinguishable bags of methylprednisolone or placebo (0.9% saline) for patients of the experimental and placebo groups, respectively. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The percentage of patients with treatment failure (primary endpoint) is currently unknown. Assuming an absolute difference of 25% in the primary outcome between the two groups (35% in the control group and 10% in the intervention group), we estimate that 60 patients (30 per group) are required to detect this difference with a two-tailed type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.2. Estimating a loss to follow-up of 20%, we should recruit a total sample size of 72 patients (36 per group).

METHODS: Retrospective case series in the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium of confirmed COVID-19 patients 'after surviving an ICU-stay', 'aged &#8805; 70 years', or 'aged < 70 years with a length of hospitalization > 7 days'. Exclusion criteria were 'unwilling to cooperate', 'medically unstable', or 'palliative care policy'. Following tests were used: 'Five Times Sit To Stand Test', 'hand grip dynamometry', 'Barthel index', 'Swallowing screening', 'Montreal Cognitive Assessment', 'Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale', and 'Nutritional Risk Screening 2002'. RESULTS: One or more tests were obtained in 135/163 patients (83.3%). Physical impairments were present in 43.2-82.8% of the patients. Median BI was 10/20 indicating limited self-dependency. Swallow impairments were present in 3/53 (5.7%) and 24/76 (31.6%) had risk of malnutrition. Impaired memory was seen in 26/43 (60.5%) and 22/47 (46.8%) had elevated anxiety/depression scores. Older adults had more physical, functional, and cognitive impairments. ICU patients had a lower hand grip force. CONCLUSION(S): The high prevalence of physical, cognitive, psychological, and functional impairments in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, both ICU and non-ICU patients, indicates that assessment of impairments is imperative. These results imply that rehabilitation and follow-up is essential for these patients.

SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction. General characteristics and chronic comorbidities were explored. Clinical outcomes of interest were hospital admission, pneumonia, intensive care unit admission, endotracheal intubation and mortality. Prevalence of chronic comorbidities was 49.4%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the effect of age, male sex, bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease on clinical outcomes was similar for both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. Adverse clinical outcomes were associated with the time from symptoms onset to medical contact, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and obesity in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, but with cardiovascular disease in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (p value < 0.01 for all comparisons). Chronic comorbidities are commonly found in patients with suspicion of viral respiratory disease. The knowledge of the impact of comorbidities on adverse clinical outcomes can better define those COVID-19 patients at higher risk.

We outline the limitations of HCTs and find that HCTs are likely to be most useful for vaccine candidates currently in preclinical stages of development. We conclude that, while currently limited in their application, there are scenarios in which HCTs would be extremely beneficial. Therefore, the option of conducting HCTs to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development should be preserved. As HCTs require many months of preparation, we recommend an immediate effort to (1) establish guidelines for HCTs for COVID-19; (2) take the first steps toward HCTs, including preparing challenge virus and making preliminary logistical arrangements; and (3) commit to periodically re-evaluating the utility of HCTs.","output":"Evaluating use cases for human challenge trials in accelerating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The urgent need for massively scaled clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2, along with global shortages of critical reagents and supplies, has necessitated development of streamlined laboratory testing protocols. Conventional nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nasopharyngeal swab in transport medium, nucleic acid extraction, and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RTCqPCR). As testing has scaled across the world, the global supply chain has buckled, rendering testing reagents and materials scarce. To address shortages, we developed SwabExpress, an end-to-end protocol developed to employ mass produced anterior nares swabs and bypass the requirement for transport media and nucleic acid extraction. METHODS: We evaluated anterior nares swabs, transported dry and eluted in low-TE buffer as a direct-to-RTCqPCR alternative to extraction-dependent viral transport media. We validated our protocol of using heat treatment for viral inactivation and added a proteinase K digestion step to reduce amplification interference. We tested this protocol across archived and prospectively collected swab specimens to fine-tune test performance. RESULTS: After optimization, SwabExpress has a low limit of detection at 2C4 molecules/L, 100% sensitivity, and 99.4% specificity when compared side by side with a traditional RTCqPCR protocol employing extraction. On real-world specimens, SwabExpress outperforms an automated extraction system while simultaneously reducing cost and hands-on time. CONCLUSION: SwabExpress is a simplified workflow that facilitates scaled testing for COVID-19 without sacrificing test performance.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the impact of the combinations of MetS components in overall survival (OS) and risk of death among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Using public data of the Ministry of Health, suspected, and confirmed COVID-19 cases from February 25CJune 6, 2020 was analyzed. Mortality odds ratio (OR) was calculated with a univariate analysis (95% CI) and attributable risk. Interactions between components and survival curves were analyzed and a multivariate logistics regression analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The analysis included 528,651 cases out of which 202,951 were confirmed for COVID-19. Probabilities of OS among confirmed patients were 0.93, 0.89, 0.87, 0.86, and 0.83 while the OR of multivariate analysis was 1.83 (1.77C1.89), 2.58 (2.48C2.69), 2.83 (2.66C3.01), and 3.36 (2.83C3.99) for zero, one, two, three, and four MetS components, respectively. The combination with the highest risk was DM2 + hypertension at 2.22 (2.15C2.28), and the attributable risk for any component was 9.35% (9.21C9.49).

This study introduces a novel PO2 sensing technology based on Multi-Frequency Phase Fluorimetry (MFPF). The aim was to validate MFPF against polarographic Clark-type electrode (CTE) PO2 measurements. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS MFPF technology was first investigated in N = 8 anaesthetised pigs at FIO2 of 0.21, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0. At each FIO2 level, blood samples were withdrawn and PO2 was measured in vitro with MFPF using two FOXY-AL300 probes immediately followed by CTE measurement. Secondly, MFPF-PO2 readings were compared to CTE in an artificial circulatory setup (human packed red blood cells, haematocrit of 30%). The impacts of temperature (20, 30, 40C) and blood flow (0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 3.2, 4.0 L min(-1)) on MFPF-PO2 measurements were assessed. MFPF response time in the gas- and blood-phase was determined. Porcine MFPF-PO2 ranged from 63 to 749 mmHg; the corresponding CTE samples from 43 to 712 mmHg. Linear regression: CTE = 15.59+1.18*MFPF (R(2) = 0.93; P<0.0001). Bland Altman analysis: meandiff 69.2 mmHg, rangediff -50.1/215.6 mmHg, 1.96-SD limits -56.3/194.8 mmHg. In artificial circulatory setup, MFPF-PO2 ranged from 20 to 567 mmHg and CTE samples from 11 to 575 mmHg. Linear regression: CTE = -8.73+1.05*MFPF (R(2) = 0.99; P<0.0001). Bland-Altman analysis: meandiff 6.6 mmHg, rangediff -9.7/20.5 mmHg, 1.96-SD limits -12.7/25.8 mmHg. Differences between MFPF and CTE-PO2 due to variations of temperature were less than 6 mmHg (range 0-140 mmHg) and less than 35 mmHg (range 140-750 mmHg); differences due to variations in blood flow were less than 15 mmHg (all P-values>0.05). MFPF response-time (monoexponential) was 1.480.26 s for the gas-phase and 1.510.20 s for the blood-phase. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE MFPF-derived PO2 readings were reproducible and showed excellent correlation and good agreement with Clark-type electrode-based PO2 measurements. There was no relevant impact of temperature and blood flow upon MFPF-PO2 measurements.

METHODS: From Danish biobanks, we obtained plasma samples from 323 subjects aged 30-70 years with known SARS-CoV-2 infection. The PFAS concentrations measured at the background exposures included five PFASs known to be immunotoxic. Register data was obtained to classify disease status, other health information, and demographic variables. We used ordered logistic regression analyses to determine associations between PFAS concentrations and disease outcome. RESULTS: Plasma-PFAS concentrations were higher in males, in subjects with Western European background, and tended to increase with age, but were not associated with the presence of chronic disease. Of the study population, 108 (33%) had not been hospitalized, and of those hospitalized, 53 (16%) had been in intensive care or were deceased. Among the five PFASs considered, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) showed an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.19 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.39-3.46) for increasing severities of the disease. Among those hospitalized, the fully adjusted OR for getting into intensive care or expiring was 5.18 (1.29, 20.72) when based on plasma samples obtained at the time of diagnosis or up to one week before. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of individual exposures to immunotoxic PFASs included short-chain PFBA known to accumulate in the lungs. Elevated plasma-PFBA concentrations were associated with an increased risk of a more severe course of COVID-19.

However, observational studies discovered that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 have higher risks of negative pregnancy and delivery outcomes compared to non-pregnant women, raising the question of the risksCbenefits of administering COVID-19 vaccines to pregnant women. By mid-2021, there was general consensus on the relative safety of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy; therefore, it is critical to investigate the safety issues related to these vaccines, considering the increasing acceptance among pregnant women. To address these concerns, we developed a research project to study the short-term effects and outcomes of COVID-19 vaccination during the first trimester of pregnancy. Our research followed an observational retrospective design for 12 months from the beginning of the vaccination campaign, and included 124 cases of spontaneous abortions and 927 ongoing pregnancies.

Moreover, the hospital admission and PCR positivity rates have not been assessed and compared yet. Objectives: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Lebanon and identify risk factors for severe disease or death. Study design: This is a retrospective mono-center cohort study in which we used patients files to extract and analyse data on demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as mortality. Moreover, we tracked the pandemic by recording the daily total and ICU inpatient census and the PCR positivity rate for admitted and outpatients. Results: Although the total admission rate increased from September to April, the ICU census switched this trend in December to stabilize at an average of around 10 patients/day until April. The case fatality rate was 19% for the 902 hospitalized patients, of which the majority (80%) had severe COVID-19. The severity odds ratio is significantly decreased in immunosuppressed cases (OR, 0.18;CI, 0.05-0.67;p=0.011). Additionally, the odds of COVID-19 related death are significantly greater if consolidations are found in the chest computed tomography (CT) scan (OR, 12;CI, 2.63-55.08;p=0.0013). Conclusion: Consolidations in the lungs significantly increase the COVID-19 death risk. Risk factors identification is important to improve patients management and vaccination strategies.

Secondary end points were to analyze the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctiva of ocular symptomatic patients and to record the presence of ocular disturbances at this point of the disease. METHODS: An observational study including consecutive COVID19 patients treated at Humanitas Clinical and Research Hospital who were attending for nasopharyngeal swab to confirm the resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection and end of isolation. We examined 129 consecutive patients from May to June 2020. The primary end point was to determine if symptomatic conjunctivitis at this point of the disease could be associated to a persistent presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract. Secondary end points were to analyze the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctiva of ocular symptomatic patients and to record the presence of ocular disturbances at this point of the disease. RESULTS: One hundred twenty eight patients were included, 9.38% had conjunctivitis, none resulted positive to conjunctival PCR swab test, while two of them had positive nasopharyngeal result. Mean time elapsed since the first COVID-19 positive swab to the time of examination was 6 weeks (  3). The only significant association was the presence of conjunctivitis with older age (65.3  12.7 vs 56.7 + 13.5. p = 0.046). Nasopharyngeal swab resulted positive in 22 patients (17.19%).

Smart/stimuli-responsive hydrogels are remarkable three-dimensional (3D) bioscaffolds intended for tissue engineering and other biomedical purposes. They can simulate the physicochemical, mechanical, and biological characters of the innate tissues.

A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations.

Recently, however, SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid lateral flow tests (LFT) have been rolled out in several countries for testing asymptomatic individuals in public health programmes. Validation studies for LFT have been largely cross-sectional, reporting sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of LFT relative to PCR. However, because PCR detects genetic material left behind for a long period when the individual is no longer infectious, these statistics can under-represent the sensitivity of LFT for detecting infectious individuals, especially when sampling asymptomatic populations. LFTs (intended to detect individuals shedding SARS-CoV-2 antigens) validated against PCR (intended to diagnose infection) are not reporting against a gold standard of equivalent measurements. Instead, these validation studies have reported relative performance statistics that need recalibrating to the purpose for which LFT is being used. We present an approach to this recalibration. We derive a formula for recalibrating relative performance statistics from LFT vs PCR validation studies to give likely absolute sensitivity of LFT for detecting individuals who are shedding shedding SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We contrast widely reported apparent sensitivities of LFT with recalibrated absolute sensitivity for detecting individuals shedding SARS-CoV-2 antigens. After accounting for within-individual viral kinetics and epidemic dynamics within asymptomatic populations we show that a highly performant test for SARS-CoV-2 antigen should show LFT-to-PCR relative sensitivity of less than 50% in conventional validation studies, which after re-calibration would be an absolute sensitivity of more than 80%. Further studies are needed to ascertain the absolute sensitivity of LFT as a test of infectiousness in COVID-19 responses. These studies should include longitudinal series of LFT and PCR, ideally in cohorts sampled from both contacts of cases and the general population.","output":"Recalibrating SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Lateral Flow Test Relative Sensitivity from Validation Studies to Absolute Sensitivity for Indicating Individuals Shedding Transmissible Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the overall quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by averting 1 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection over the duration of the pandemic. METHODS: A cohort-based probabilistic simulation model, informed by the latest epidemiological estimates on COVID-19 in the United States provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and literature review. Heterogeneity of parameter values across age group was accounted for. The main outcome studied was QALYs for the infected patient, patient's family members, and the contagion effect of the infected patient over the duration of the pandemic. RESULTS: Averting a COVID-19 infection in a representative US resident will generate an additional 0.061 (0.016-0.129) QALYs (for the patient: 0.055, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.014-0.115; for the patient's family members: 0.006, 95% CI 0.002-0.015). Accounting for the contagion effect of this infection, and assuming that an effective vaccine will be available in 3 months, the total QALYs gains from averting 1 single infection is 1.51 (95% CI 0.28-4.37) accrued to patients and their family members affected by the index infection and its sequelae. These results were robust to most parameter values and were most influenced by effective reproduction number, probability of death outside the hospital, the time-varying hazard rates of hospitalization, and death in critical care.

The primary outcome was day-28 ventilatory free days. Secondary outcomes were mortality on day 28, acute kidney injury, acute cardiac injury, pulmonary embolism, and deep venous thrombosis. Multiple factor analysis and hierarchical classification on principal components were performed to distinguish different clinical phenotypes. Results: We identified three different phenotypes in 150, 176, and 90 patients, respectively. Phenotype 3 was characterized by short evolution, severe hypoxemia, and old comorbid patients. Phenotype 1 was mainly characterized by the absence of comorbidities, relatively high compliance, and long duration of symptoms, whereas phenotype 2 was characterized female sex, and the presence of mild comorbidities such as uncomplicated diabetes or chronic hypertension.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the RBD have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, firstly we analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and the human ACE2 receptor. Among 1609 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated during the early transmission phase, 32 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and found clustered into nine mutant types under high positive selection pressure. Applying molecular dynamics simulations, three mutant types (V367F, W436R, N354D/D364Y) displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2, likely due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The increased infectivity of one mutant (V367F) circulating worldwide was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Genome phylogenetic analysis of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F + D614G), which emerged later and formed a distinct sub-cluster. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 under high selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.","output":"Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD mutants that enhance viral infectivity through increased human ACE2 receptor binding affinity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA interference (RNAi) is an antiviral pathway common to many eukaryotes that detects and cleaves foreign nucleic acids.

The induction of RNAi also requires the conserved RNA decapping enzyme EOL-1/DXO. The transcriptional induction of eol-1 requires DRH-1 as well as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)). Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, EOL-1 is concentrated into foci that depend on the transcription of mitochondrial RNAs that may form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), as has been observed in mammalian antiviral responses. Enhanced RNAi triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction is necessary for the increase in longevity that is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.","output":"Mitochondrial dysfunction induces RNA interference in C. elegans through a pathway homologous to the mammalian RIG-I antiviral response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Thrombocytopenia is associated with many viral infections suggesting virions interact with and affect platelets. Consistently, viral particles are seen inside platelets, and platelet activation markers are detected in viremic patients. In this article, we sought mechanistic insights into these virion/platelet interactions by examining how platelets endocytose, traffic, and are activated by a model virion. Approach and Results: Using fluorescently tagged HIV-1 pseudovirions, 3-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, and transgenic mouse models, we probed the interactions between platelets and virions. Mouse platelets used known endocytic machinery, that is, dynamin, VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein)-3, and Arf6 (ADP-ribosylation factor 6), to take up and traffic HIV-1 pseudovirions. Endocytosed HIV-1 pseudovirions trafficked through early (Rab4+) and late endosomes (Rab7+), and then to an LC3+ (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) compartment. Incubation with virions induced IRAK4 (interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4), Akt (protein kinase B), and IKK (IB kinase) activation, granule secretion, and platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation. This activation required TLRs (Toll-like receptors) and MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) but was less extensive and slower than activation with thrombin. In vivo, HIV-1 pseudovirions injection led to virion uptake and platelet activation, as measured by IKK activation, platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation, and mild thrombocytopenia. All were decreased in VAMP-3-/- and, megakaryocyte/platelet-specific, Arf6-/- mice. Similar platelet activation profiles (increased platelet-leukocyte aggregates, plasma platelet factor 4, and phospho-IB) were detected in newly diagnosed and antiretroviral therapy-controlled HIV-1+ patients. CONCLUSIONS Collectively, our data provide mechanistic insights into the cell biology of how platelets endocytose and process virions. We propose a mechanism by which platelets sample the circulation and respond to potential pathogens that they take up.","output":"Platelets Endocytose Viral Particles and Are Activated via TLR (Toll-Like Receptor) Signaling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In order to help control the COVID-19 pandemic, elective procedures have been cancelled in most US hospitals by government order.

The availability of labeled training data is extremely limited owing to the nature of the data containing protected health information. Natural language processing and machine learning to process clinical text for such a task have great potential. However, supervised machine learning requires a great amount of labeled data to train a model, which is at the origin of the main bottleneck in model development. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to address the lack of labeled data by proposing 2 alternatives to manual labeling for the generation of training labels for supervised machine learning with English clinical text. We aim to demonstrate that using lower-quality labels for training leads to good classification results. METHODS: We addressed the lack of labels with 2 strategies. The first approach took advantage of the structured part of electronic health records and used diagnosis codes (International Classification of DiseaseC10th revision) to derive training labels. The second approach used weak supervision and data programming principles to derive training labels. We propose to apply the developed framework to the extraction of symptom information from outpatient visit progress notes of patients with cardiovascular diseases. RESULTS: We used >500,000 notes for training our classification model with International Classification of DiseaseC10th revision codes as labels and >800,000 notes for training using labels derived from weak supervision. We show that the dependence between prevalence and recall becomes flat provided a sufficiently large training set is used (>500,000 documents). We further demonstrate that using weak labels for training rather than the electronic health record codes derived from the patient encounter leads to an overall improved recall score (10% improvement, on average). Finally, the external validation of our models shows excellent predictive performance and transferability, with an overall increase of 20% in the recall score. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the power of using a weak labeling pipeline to annotate and extract symptom mentions in clinical text, with the prospects to facilitate symptom information integration for a downstream clinical task such as clinical decision support.","output":"Strategies to Address the Lack of Labeled Data for Supervised Machine Learning Training With Electronic Health Records: Case Study for the Extraction of Symptoms From Clinical Notes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human and social toll of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has already spurred several major public health \\"lessons learned,\\" and the theme of effective and responsible scientific communication is among them.

In this study, 94 compounds showing high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells were identified from 2,580 FDA-approved small-molecule drugs. Among them, 24 compounds with low cytotoxicity were selected, and of these, 17 compounds also effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in HeLa cells transduced with human ACE2. Six compounds disturb multiple processes of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Their prophylactic efficacies were determined in vivo using Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seven compounds reduced weight loss and promoted weight regain of hamsters infected not only with the original strain but also the D614G variant. Except for cisatracurium, six compounds reduced hamster pulmonary viral load, and IL-6 and TNF- mRNA when assayed at 4 d postinfection.

However, there are few valuable prognostic factors in penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). Here, the authors investigated whether laminin gamma 2 (LAMC2) expression, especially serum LAMC2 (sLAMC2) level, was a suitable prognostic factor that could aid in the prediction of survival in PSCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 114 PSCC patients. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect LAMC2 expression; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to test sLAMC2 concentration; and a Transwell assay and an in vivo experiment in nude mice were used to test PSCC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. The chi-squared test was used to analyze the association between LAMC2 level and clinical parameters, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio for death, and KaplanCMeier analysis with a log-rank test was used for the survival analysis. RESULTS: LAMC2 was overexpressed in PSCC tissues, and the LAMC2 expression level was higher in metastatic lymph node (LN) tissues than in primary cancer tissues; moreover, the LAMC2 levels in primary cancer tissues and sLAMC2 were higher in patients with LN metastasis than in those without LN metastasis. Upregulated LAMC2 facilitated the migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of PSCC cells in vitro and promoted LN metastasis of PSCC cells in nude mice. Elevated LAMC2 levels were strongly correlated with advanced clinicopathologic parameters, especially LN metastasis, in PSCC patients and predicted shorter disease-specific survival. The predictive value of sLAMC2 is superior to that of C-reactive protein and squamous cell carcinoma antigen previously reported in PSCC patients, and a stratification analysis revealed that the level of sLAMC2 had a higher predictive value for disease-specific survival in early penile cancer (especially at the N(0/X) stage) than in later-stage penile cancer. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that sLAMC2 is a potential serologic prognostic marker in PSCC and could aid in risk stratification in early-stage PSCC patients.","output":"Elevated serum LAMC2 is associated with lymph node metastasis and predicts poor prognosis in penile squamous cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Health disparities are associated with poor outcomes related to public health. The objective of this study was to assess health disparities associated with influenza infection based on median household income and educational attainment. METHODS We geocoded people with documented confirmed influenza infection by home address to identify the US Census 2010 tract in which they lived during 4 influenza surveillance seasons (2013-2014, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018) in Rhode Island. We dichotomized influenza as severe if the person with influenza infection was hospitalized (ie, inpatient) or as nonsevere if the person was not hospitalized (ie, outpatient). We examined 2 socioeconomic factors: median household income (defined as low, medium low, medium high, and high) and educational attainment (defined as a ratio among people who completed <high school, high school, some college, or bachelor's degree). We calculated relative rates (RRs) to determine the associated level of risk for each socioeconomic factor. RESULTS The incidence of influenza per 100 000 person-years was significantly higher in populations with low vs high median household income (620 vs 303; P < .001) and in populations with low vs high educational attainment (583 vs 323; P < .001). The RR of a severe infection in the quartile with the lowest educational attainment (0.57) was significantly higher than the RR in the other 3 quartiles of educational attainment (range, 0.36-0.39; P = .01). However, the RR of a severe infection was higher in the 3 quartiles of median household income (range, 0.38-0.40) than in the quartile with the lowest median household income (0.29).

In vivo, repression of PCs activity by the general PC inhibitors 1-PDX, Spn4A, or decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (CMK) significantly reduced tumor expression levels of the stem cell markers LGR5 and NANOG that are associated with reduced tumor xenografts.

Moreover, with the rise of newer strains, the period ahead has to be tread carefully to prevent resurgence of infections. There have been recommendations regarding the ideal setup to operate orthopaedic cases in this pandemic scenario. However, many of the hospitals in India with financial and logistic constraints are unable to implement these structural changes into their existing setup. We propose a model which can be used in an existing operation theatre which has a single entry and exit corridor, which is the layout in many hospitals. METHODOLOGY: A protocol with the consultation of a panel of health care professionals was designed on the basis of WHO guidelines in a way so as to remain dynamic. Prior to its implementation, online classes were conducted and a dry run of the protocol was done with the whole team involved. The theatre layout is one with a single entry and exit and had predesignated rooms. The personnel were divided into 3 teams, each with a fixed set of people and preset workflow, to be followed during entry and exit. Five COVID positive cases have been operated since then using the protocol and has been used as a pilot study to further amend the protocol. CONCLUSION: This model can be used as a guideline by hospitals having a limited infrastructure, to develop their own protocol to operate on COVID positive cases, in the present situation of increasing trauma cases post the relaxation of lockdown and also in any subsequent waves of infection with newer strains.

In some countries, despite the presence of smart meters, a fragmentary data availability and/or the lack of standardization hinders the creation of post-metering value-added services and confines such innovative solutions to the prototypal and experimental level. We take inspiration from the technology adopted in Italy, where the national regulatory authority actively supported the definition of a solution agreed upon by all the involved stakeholders. In this context, smart meters are enabled to convey data to low voltage end users through a power line communication channel (CHAIN 2) in near real-time. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it describes the proof of concept that the channel underwent and its subsequent validation (with performances nearing 99% success rate). On the other hand, it defines a classification framework (I2MA) for post-metering value-added services, in order to categorize each use case based on both level of service and expected benefits, and understand its maturity level. As an example, we apply the methodology to the 16 use cases defined in Italy. The lessons learned from the regulatory, technological, and functional approach of the Italian experience bring us to the provision of recommendations for researchers and industry experts. In particular, we argue that a well-functioning post-metering value-added services' market can flourish when: i) distribution system operators certify the measurements coming from smart meters; ii) national regulatory authorities support the technological innovation needed for setting up this market; and iii) service providers create customer-oriented solutions based on smart meters' data.","output":"Post-Metering Value-Added Services for Low Voltage Electricity Users: Lessons Learned From the Italian Experience of CHAIN 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 disease is caused by novel coronavirus known as SARS CoV 2.

The panel allows for targeted sequencing by overlapping amplicons, thereby providing specific, accurate, and high throughput analysis. A modified reverse transcription reaction, which consists of the use of a SARS-CoV-2 specific primers pool from the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel, was assessed in order to promote viral RNA specific reverse transcription. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Ion AmpliSeq&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel in sequencing the entire viral genome in different samples. SARS-CoV-2 sequence data were obtained from ten viral isolates and one nasopharyngeal swab from different patients. The ten isolate samples amplified with 12 PCR cycles displayed high mean depth values compared to those of the two isolates amplified with 20 PCR cycles. High mean depth values were also obtained for the nasopharyngeal swab processed by use of a target-specific reverse transcription. The relative depth of coverage (rDoC) analysis showed that when 12 PCR cycles were used, all target regions were amplified with high sequencing coverage, while in libraries amplified at 20 cycles, a poor uniformity of amplification, with absent or low coverage of many target regions, was observed. Our results show that the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel can achieve rapid and high throughput SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing from 10 ng of DNA-free viral RNA from isolates and from 1 ng of DNA-free viral RNA from a nasopharyngeal swab using 12 PCR cycles for library amplification.

Induction of anti-tumor T cells in immunogenic tumors depends on STING, the intracellular innate immune receptor for cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) and related cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). However, the optimal way to leverage STING activation in non-immunogenic tumors is still unclear. Here, we show that cGAMP delivery by intra-tumoral injection of virus-like particles (cGAMP-VLP) leads to differentiation of tumor-specific T cells, decrease in tumor regulatory T cells (Tregs) and anti-tumoral responses that synergize with PD1 blockade. By contrast, intra-tumoral injection of synthetic CDN leads to tumor necrosis and systemic T cell activation but no differentiation of tumor-specific T cells, and a demise of immune cells in injected tumors. Analyses of cytokine responses and genetic models revealed that cGAMP-VLP preferentially targets STING in dendritic cells at a 1000-fold less dose than synthetic CDN. Sub-cutaneous administration of cGAMP-VLP showed synergy when combined with a tumor Treg-depleting antibody to elicit systemic tumor-specific T cells, leading to complete and lasting tumor eradication. These finding show that cell targeting of STING stimulation shapes the anti-tumor T cell response and reveal a therapeutic strategy with T cell modulators.","output":"Cellular selectivity of STING stimulation determines priming of anti-tumor T cell responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a long-simmering disquiet in Catholic circles regarding the use cell lines derived from aborted fetal tissue.

METHODS: The noncytotoxic antifungal concentration of baicalein was determined using CCK8, cell scratch assay, minimum inhibitory concentration, biofilm formation, scanning electron microscopy, propidium iodide uptake test and adherence assay in vitro and Draize test in vivo. In fungal keratitis (FK) mouse models, clinical score and plate count were used to evaluate FK severity, and myeloperoxidase assay and immunofluorescence staining were performed to examine neutrophil infiltration and activity. Real-time PCR, ELISA, and Western blot were performed to explore the anti-inflammatory activity of baicalein and the underlying mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: Baicalein at 0.25 mM (noncytotoxic) significantly inhibited A. fumigatus growth, biofilm formation, and adhesion in vitro. In A. fumigatus keratitis mice, baicalein mitigated FK severity, reduced fungal load, and inhibited neutrophil infiltration and activity. Baicalein not only suppressed mRNA and protein levels of proinflammatory factors IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-, but also inhibited the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and TSLP receptor (TSLPR) in vivo and in vitro. In HCECs, mRNA and protein levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- were significantly lower in the TSLP siRNACtreated group, while higher in the rTSLP-treated group than in the corresponding control.

In animals, CoVs cause several diseases, including pneumonia, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system diseases. In humans, the CoVs work as respiratory tract diseases, and the new CoVs can penetrate the barrier between other species and humans and can cause a high mortality rate.

Negative RT-PCR testing associated with positive serology in most cases suggests a post-infectious syndrome. Because the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still poorly understood, extensive virological and immunological investigations are needed. METHODS: We report a series of four pediatric patients admitted to Geneva University Hospitals with persistent fever and laboratory evidence of inflammation meeting published definition of MIS-C related to COVID-19, to whom an extensive virological and immunological workup was performed. RESULTS: RT-PCRs on multiple anatomical compartments were negative whereas anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were strongly positive by ELISA and immunofluorescence. Both pseudo- and full virus neutralization assays showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in all children, confirming a recent infection with SARS-CoV-2. Analyses of cytokine profiles revealed an elevation in all cytokines, as reported in adults with severe COVID-19. Although differing in clinical presentation, some features of MIS-C show phenotypic overlap with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). In contrast to patients with primary HLH, our patients showed normal perforin expression and NK cell degranulation. The levels of soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) correlated with the severity of disease, reflecting recent T-cell activation. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MIS-C related to COVID-19 is caused by a post-infectious inflammatory syndrome associated with elevation in all cytokines, and markers of recent T-cell activation (sIL-2R) occurring despite a strong and specific humoral response to SARS-CoV2. Further functional and genetic analyses are essential to better understand the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions.","output":"Immunological assessment of pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome related to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has led to a global health emergency worldwide. As a result, healthcare workers undergo distress mainly due to the perceived risk of contracting the virus. Such stress might cause them to leave their jobs. In this context, the current study: (1) introduced the concept of perceived risk of COVID-19 and measured it by adapting and validating an existing scale available on the risk of infectious diseases and (2) investigated its outcomes, underlying mechanisms, and boundary conditions for healthcare workers. With the support of conservation of resources theory, the current study aimed to investigate the association between perceived risk of COVID-19 and turnover intentions among healthcare workers, particularly Doctors, nurses, and paramedics staff. This study also aimed to investigate the mediating role of perceived fear of COVID-19 between perceived risk of COVID-19 and turnover intention. The current study also aimed to examine the buffering role that perceptions of hospital measures against COVID-19 could have on diminishing workers turnover intentions. Data were collected through a three time-lag email survey of healthcare workers in Pakistan (N = 178) who currently provide treatment to COVID-19 patients. The results supported the hypothesis that perceived risk of COVID-19 enhances fear of COVID-19 among healthcare workers and, consequently, their turnover intentions. Perceptions of hospital measures against COVID-19 weaken the relationship between perceived risk of COVID-19 and fear of COVID-19, which reduces turnover intentions of health care workers.

In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/- mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4s impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis. Given the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection.

We present a case of EBA presenting with Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) and pneumomediastinum;an extremely rare complication. CASE PRESENTATION: An 84 year-old man presented to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea and multiple blistering lesions along with associated fatigue and weight loss for approximately 6 months. Past medical history was significant for previously diagnosed EBA, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient is a Veteran and retired salesman who denied hazardous occupational exposure. Physical examination revealed bilaterally decreased breath sounds and also multiple crusted blisters in all four extremities. COVID test was negative and initial laboratory panel was only remarkable for mild macrocytic anemia. Outpatient chest radiograph obtained ten days prior to admission (fig 1) and repeat on admission showed bilateral interstitial reticulonodular opacities with new asymmetric opacifications in the right lung apex (fig 2). Chest CT angiogram demonstrated fibrotic changes and honeycombing in the peripheries and bases with moderate pneumomediastinum (fig 3). He was diagnosed with UIP given the radiologic pattern and this was attributed to be likely due to his current EBA flare-up given no other obvious trigger. The patient's home dose of dapsone for EBA was continued and he was given nebulized bronchodilators with improvement in his symptoms over 48 hours. Pulmonology was consulted and recommended outpatient follow up in 3 weeks as he remained hemodynamically stable and was saturating well on room air. Repeat Chest CT on follow up showed improvement of the pneumomediastinum (fig 4). Pulmonary function tests showed moderate restrictive lung disease with moderately reduced diffusing capacity, however his symptoms were mostly resolved. DISCUSSION: EBA is an orphan autoimmune whose pathophysiology involves auto-antibodies against type VII collagen (COL7). These create a specific u-serrated pattern on peri-lesional skin biopsies [1]. COL7 is also known to be a component of the pulmonary basement membrane;with collagen accounting for a third of the dry mass of the lung. EBA has been weakly associated with multiple autoimmune diseases including anecdotal reports of association with pulmonary fibrosis [2]. However extensive review of literature showed no published case reports connecting the two conditions. In our opinion, this patient's presentation is likely a result of the interaction of COL7 antibodies with the pulmonary basement membrane leading to UIP with pneumomediastinum. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the rare association between EBA and UIP which are likely connected pathophysiologically by anti-COL7 antibodies. Further research and analysis will be needed to confidently establish this association. REFERENCE #1: Koga H, Prost-Squarcioni C, Iwata H, Jonkman MF, Ludwig RJ, Bieber K.

These features provide a rationale for restoring functional T cell immunity in COVID-19 patients by adoptive transfer of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells. Methods To generate SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 7 COVID-19 recovered and 13 unexposed donors. Consequently, we stimulated cells with SARS-CoV-2 peptide mixtures covering spike, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. Then, we culture expanded cells with IL-2 for 21 days. We assessed immunophenotypes, cytokine profiles, antigen specificity of the final cell products. Results Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells could be expanded in both COVID-19 recovered and unexposed groups. Immunophenotypes were similar in both groups showing CD4+ T cell dominance, but CD8+ and CD3+CD56+ T cells were also present. Antigen specificity was determined by ELISPOT, intracellular cytokine assay, and cytotoxicity assays. One out of 14 individuals who were previously unexposed to SARS-CoV-2 failed to show antigen specificity. Moreover, ex-vivo expanded SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells mainly consisted of central and effector memory subsets with reduced alloreactivity against HLA-unmatched cells suggesting the possibility for the development of third-party partial HLA-matching products.

In addition, it is believed to function as a defense against viruses and transposons. In recent years, RNAi has become a widely used approach for studying gene function by targeted cleavage of a specific RNA. Moreover, the technology has been developed as a new therapeutic option that has already made its way into clinical testing. Treatment of viral infections remains a serious challenge due to the emergence of new viruses and strain variation among known virus species. RNAi holds great promise to provide a flexible approach that can rapidly be adapted to new viral target sequences. A major challenge in the development of an efficient RNAi approach still remains the design of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with high silencing potency. While large libraries with validated siRNAs exist for silencing of endogenously expressed genes in human or murine cells, siRNAs still have to be designed individually for new antiviral approaches. The present chapter describes strategies to design highly potent siRNAs by taking into consideration thermodynamic features of the siRNA, as well as the structural restrictions of the target RNA. Furthermore, assays for testing the siRNAs in reporter assays as well as options to improve the properties of siRNAs by the introduction of modified nucleotides will be described.

A significant increase in the number of new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrates the urgency of finding drugs effective against this pathogen.The aim of this work was to evaluate the in vitro antiviral efficacy of human recombinant alpha-2b interferon (IFN-2b) against SARS-CoV-2 virus. MATERIAL AND METHODS The experiments had been carried out on Vero Cl008, the continuous line of African green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) kidney cells. The effectiveness of the drugs was assessed by the suppression of viral reproduction in vitro. The biological activity was determined using titration of a virus-containing suspension in a Vero Cl008 cell culture by the formation of negative colonies. RESULTS The antiviral efficacy of the IFN-2b-based medications, which have a high safety profile and proven efficacy in the prevention and treatment of influenza and acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI), has been studied against the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro experiments in Vero C1008 cell culture. IFN-2b effectively inhibits the reproduction of the virus when applied both 24 hrs before and 2 hrs after infection. In the IFN-2b concentration range 102-106 IU/ml a complete suppression of the reproduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been demonstrated. DISCUSSION IFN-2b demonstrated in vitro high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the substance has a high chemotherapeutic index (>1000).

While such frameworks recapitulate the cellular entry process in ACE2+ cells, they are largely unable to factor in supplemental contributions by other SARS CoV-2 genes. To address this, we performed an unbiased ORF screen and identified the nucleoprotein (N) as a potent enhancer of spike-pseudotyped LV particle infectivity. We further demonstrate that the spike protein is better enriched in virions when the particles are produced in the presence of N protein. This enrichment of spike renders LV particles more infectious as well as less vulnerable to the neutralizing effects of a human IgG-Fc fused ACE2 microbody. Importantly, this improvement in infectivity is observed with both wild-type spike protein as well as the D614G mutant.

Search terms included calcium test, heart score, calcium score, coronary calcium, and calcium test score. We accessed Google Trends in January 2021 and analyzed data from 2004 to 2020. RESULTS: From 2004 to December 31, 2020, CAC-related search interest (in relative search volume) increased continually worldwide (+201.9%) and in the United States (+354.8%). Three main events strongly influenced search interest in CAC: reports of a CAC scan of the president of the United States led to a transient 10-fold increase in early January 2018. American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline release led to a sustained increase, and lockdown after the global pandemic due to COVID-19 led to a transient decrease.

Results 113 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected elderly participated in the study. After 28 days of follow up, 75(66%) elders remained asymptomatic. In 38(34%) presymptomatic patients, median time to onset of symptoms was 3 days(IQR 5). 20/38(56%) pre-symptomatic patients developed hypoxemia, a presenting sign in 10/20(50%). Ten pre-symptomatic patients [26%;10/113(9%)] died(median day 14, IQR 12). Dementia was the only clinical risk factor associated with disease (OR 2.36(95%CI 1.05 to 5.29);P=.036;Table 1). PCR mean cycle threshold was similar in both groups at the time of enrollment. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR re-testing on day 15(IQR 1) was detectable in 61% of pre-symptomatic vs. 30% asymptomatic subjects(P=.012). Anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays on day 28 detected similar rates of antibody seropositivity in both groups (Table 1). Conclusion Our findings suggest that disease inception and disease progression may be driven by different pathogenic pathways. Dementia was the sole baseline difference potentially predicting progression to symptomatic disease in our study. Other comorbidities associated with progression from mild to severe symptoms did not affect the odds of experiencing pre-symptomatic illness. Evolution to symptomatic disease associated with longer viral shedding, suggesting that control of viral replication may influence symptom inception. In summary, dementia and persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding associated with progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection in elders. These observations suggest that the mechanistic pathway to experiencing disease symptoms differs from the pathways determining severity in COVID-19.","output":"Asymptomatic COVID-19 in the elderly: Dementia and viral clearance as risk factors for disease progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Awareness of burnout and its implications within the medical field has been growing. However, an understanding of the prevalence and consequences of burnout among underrepresented minority (URM), specifically underrepresented minority in medicine (UiM) populations, is not readily available. OBJECTIVE: To examine literature investigating burnout among UiM compared to non-UiM, with particular attention to which measures of burnout are currently being used for which racial/ethnic groups. METHODS: The authors identified peer-reviewed articles, published in English through systematic examination using PubMed, PsycINFO, Countway Discovery Medicine, and Web of Science databases. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were summarized and study quality was assessed. RESULTS: Sixteen studies assessing racial/ethnic differences in burnout were eligible for inclusion. Nearly all studies were cross-sectional (n = 15) in design and conducted among populations in North America (n = 15). Most studies examined burnout among medical students or physicians and used the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Differences in burnout among UiM and non-UiM are inconclusive, although several studies have nuanced findings.

Accordingly, laboratories worldwide focus on the development of suitable delivery systems. Among the different available non-viral systems like cationic polymers, cationic liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) represent an attractive concept to bypass the problem of poor membrane permeability of these charged macromolecules. While uptake per se in most cases does not represent the main obstacle of nucleic acid delivery in vitro, it becomes increasingly apparent that intracellular trafficking is the bottleneck. As a consequence, in order to optimize a given delivery system, a side-by-side analysis of nucleic acid cargo internalized and the corresponding biological effect is required to determine the overall efficacy. In this review, we will concentrate on peptide-mediated delivery of siRNAs and steric block oligonucleotides and discuss different methods for quantitative assessment of the amount of cargo taken up and how to correlate those numbers with biological effects by applying easy to handle reporter systems. To illustrate current limitations of non-viral nucleic acid delivery systems, we present own data as an example and discuss options of how to enhance trafficking of molecules entrapped in cellular compartments.","output":"Peptide-Mediated Cellular Delivery of Oligonucleotide-Based Therapeutics In Vitro: Quantitative Evaluation of Overall Efficacy Employing Easy to Handle Reporter Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We calculated the dosimetric indices and estimated the tumor control probability (TCP) considering six degree-of-freedom (6DoF) patient setup errors in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using a single-isocenter technique. METHODS: We used simulated spherical gross tumor volumes (GTVs) with diameters of 1.0 cm (GTV 1), 2.0 cm (GTV 2), and 3.0 cm (GTV 3), and the distance (d) between the target center and isocenter was set to 0, 5, and 10 cm. We created the dose distribution by convolving the blur component to uniform dose distribution. The prescription dose was 20 Gy and the dose distribution was adjusted so that D95 (%) of each GTV was covered by 100% of the prescribed dose. The GTV was simultaneously rotated within 0-1.0 (?R) around the x-, y-, and z-axes and then translated within 0-1.0 mm (?T) in the x-, y-, and z-axis directions. D95, conformity index (CI), and conformation number (CN) were evaluated by varying the distance from the isocenter. The TCP was estimated by translating the calculated dose distribution into a biological response. In addition, we derived the x-y-z coordinates with the smallest TCP reduction rate that minimize the sum of squares of the residuals as the optimal isocenter coordinates using the relationship between 6DoF setup error, distance from isocenter, and GTV size. RESULTS: D95, CI, and CN were decreased with increasing isocenter distance, decreasing GTV size, and increasing setup error. TCP of GTVs without 6DoF setup error was estimated to be 77.0%. TCP were 25.8% (GTV 1), 35.0% (GTV 2), and 53.0% (GTV 3) with (d, ?T, ?R) = (10 cm, 1.0 mm, 1.0). The TCP was 52.3% (GTV 1), 54.9% (GTV 2), and 66.1% (GTV 3) with (d, ?T, ?R) = (10 cm, 1.0 mm, 1.0) at the optimal isocenter position. CONCLUSION: The TCP in SRS for multiple brain metastases with a single-isocenter technique may decrease with increasing isocenter distance and decreasing GTV size when the 6DoF setup errors are exceeded (1.0 mm, 1.0). Additionally, it might be possible to better maintain TCP for GTVs with 6DoF setup errors by using the optimal isocenter position.","output":"Radiobiological evaluation considering setup error on single-isocenter irradiation in stereotactic radiosurgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The long-term complication rates of open repair and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) have not yet been determined. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the long-term outcomes and aortic reintervention rates between open repair and TEVAR in patients with descending thoracic aortic pathologies. METHODS: Between January 2002 and December 2017, 230 patients with descending thoracic aortic pathologies underwent surgery. Of these, 136 patients were included in this retrospective study: 45 patients (10, 2, and 33 with dissection, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and pseudoaneurysm, respectively) underwent open repair and 91 patients (27, 1, and 63 with dissection, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and pseudoaneurysm, respectively) underwent TEVAR. The primary end points were in-hospital mortality, and short-term complications. The secondary end points were long-term mortality and reintervention rates. Based on the propensity score matching (PSM), 35 patients who underwent open repair were matched to 35 patients who underwent TEVAR (ratio = 1:1). RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 70.2  51.9 months. Shorter intensive care unit and hospital stay were seen in the TEVAR group than in the open repair group before and after PSM (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). However, in-hospital mortality, and spinal cord ischemia were not significantly different among the two groups (before PSM: p = 0.068 and p = 0.211, respectively; after PSM: p = 0.303 and p = 0.314, respectively). The cumulative all-cause death and aorta-related death showed no significant differences between the two groups (before PSM: p = 0.709 and p = 0.734, respectively; after PSM: p = 0.888 and p = 0.731, respectively). However, aortic reintervention rates were higher in the TEVAR group than in the open repair group before and after PSM (p = 0.006 and p = 0.013, respectively). CONCLUSION: The TEVAR group was superior in short-term recovery outcomes but had higher reintervention rates compared to the open repair group.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of combined interferon beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial in adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to six hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days (combination group) or to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (control group). The primary endpoint was the time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RT-PCR, and was done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04276688. FINDINGS: Between Feb 10 and March 20, 2020, 127 patients were recruited; 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 were assigned to the control group. The median number of days from symptom onset to start of study treatment was 5 days (IQR 3-7). The combination group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7 days [IQR 5-11]) than the control group (12 days [8-15]; hazard ratio 437 [95% CI 186-1024], p=00010). Adverse events included self-limited nausea and diarrhoea with no difference between the two groups. One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavir-ritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis. No patients died during the study. INTERPRETATION: Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

In the present study we apply the proposed method to a complex of measles virus hemagglutinin and human SLAM receptor, thus finding a usefulness for efficiently eliciting the correlated interactions among the amino-acid residues involved in the two proteins.

This study aims to explore whether clinical profiles and healthcare utilization patterns are related to suicide among cancer sufferers. METHODS: Verified suicide cases with cancer (2012-2016) were identified. Each case was matched with two non-suicide controls suffering cancer, by birthyear, sex, and admission year. Cancer-related information, physical and psychiatric comorbidities, opioid-based painkiller usage, the number and length of inpatient admissions, and the number of outpatient and Accident & Emergency (A&E) attendances, in the six months leading up to the suicide, were identified. Conditional logistic regression models were constructed to explore the influence of clinical profiles and hospital utilization on suicide. These models were stratified by age and cancer stage. OUTCOMES: 383 cases and 766 controls were included in the analyses. Overall, younger age, metastasis/recurrent status, suffering head and neck cancer, having psychiatric comorbidities, using opioid-based painkillers, and high frequency of A&E attendances and inpatient admissions increased the odds of suicide. Being diagnosed with liver cancer, consuming high numbers of outpatient attendances, and high numbers of inpatient days decreased the odds of suicide. Stratified analyses confirmed the influence of young age and metastatic/recurrent cancer status on risk of suicide. INTERPRETATIONS: Suicidal cancer sufferers had distinctive clinical profiles and hospital utilization patterns. Detecting and mitigating suicidal risk should be incorporated as an important component in treatment of cancer sufferers in the clinical setting.

Transmissibility is usually quantified in terms of the reproduction number Rt, the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual. Here we show the central role also played by w(z), the distribution of generation times z, namely the time between successive infections in a transmission chain. We obtain an accurate estimate of w(z) by means of a novel method which allows us to simultaneously obtain its evaluation together with the measure of Rt, over the course of an epidemic, and the number of exogenous infected cases. We use one year of data from COVID-19 officially reported cases in the 21 Italian regions, since the first confirmed case on February 2020. We find that w(z) is a distribution very peaked around its average value z ? 6 days with a standard deviation  smaller than one day. This estimate of  is much smaller than previous ones obtained by means of contact tracing from the distribution of serial intervals.

METHOD: Primary data was collected through a telephonic survey of 132 respondents randomly selected from the pool of obstetrics patients who used telemedicine services of Shifa International Hospital (SIH) in Islamabad during the pandemic. We changed the survey tool of Medical Group Management Association to the study purpose. Required information included the respondents socioeconomic and antenatal characteristics and their telemedicine use experience on four parameters, namely, Appointment, Staff Attitude, Communication, and telemedicine services. Patients were inquired about their intent to use telemedicine beyond COVID-19 and the reasons supporting their answer. The data was analyzed descriptively and through t-test mean comparisons and binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Majority (54%) intend to use telemedicine in future. Average age of respondents was 30 years with gravidity 2.36, parity 1.40 and gestational amenorrhea 27.3 weeks. The respondents average schooling was 9.5 years, marriage duration was 4.5 years and monthly household income was PKR 83,000. However, the overall experience of those who were confident in future use of telemedicine was 0.677 points higher and significantly different than those who were not inclined to use it in future. Of those lacking interest in future use of telemedicine, nearly two-third felt in-person visit was more satisfying, 11% needed physical examination, 6% experienced long waiting time, 5% each had inadequate access to ICT and online payment facilities, and 6% faced other issues such as excess payments. The binary logistic regression analysis (R2 37.3%) held Medical Consultations and Communications as the most important determinants and could predict nearly two-fifth of variation in respondents intent for future use of telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Uptake of telemedicine for obstetrics patients is one of the positive externalities of COVID-19 and may appear as a cost-effective and culturally acceptable way to ensure universal coverage of antenatal care in Pakistan. However, telemedicines future beyond COVID-19 for obstetrics hinges upon improving users experience primarily through consultant and staff trainings and provision of effective communication e.g., in regional languages.

Data collection was accomplished using a self-administered questionnaire with questions about socio-demographic characteristics, questions assessing general vaccination-related intentions and behaviors, and the intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination. A sample of 437 responders answered the survey, with 93% being nurses and 7% midwives. A small proportion of the participants would accept a vaccine against COVID-19, while 70% could be qualified as vaccine hesitant. The main reasons for not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine were concerns about the vaccine's expedited development and fear of side effects. More females, individuals with a larger median age, and a higher number of years of working experience, intended to accept the COVID-19 vaccination, compared with those not intended to accept and undecided groups (p < 0.01). Having a seasonal flu vaccination in the last 5 years, receiving the vaccines recommended for health professionals, and working in the private sector were associated with a higher probability of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enteral antiplatelet agents are affected and variable due to erratic enteral absorption in end-stage heart failure and VAD circulation. Additionally, 20%-40% of the population are poor metabolizers of clopidogrel, a prodrug, making cangrelor an alternative when antiplatelet therapy is crucial. Cangrelor has been used effectively and safely for short durations in adults during percutaneous coronary interventions, but the use of cangrelor is still under investigation in pediatrics. This case series utilized cangrelor, a novel short-acting, reversible, intravenous P2Y12 platelet inhibitor in managing pediatric patients supported with a VAD. We performed a retrospective, single-center review of patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with end-stage heart failure requiring mechanical circulatory support and concomitant cangrelor administration between January 2019 and March 2020. Platelet function testing, cangrelor dose, bleeding complications, thromboembolic events, and frequency of circuit interventions during the use of cangrelor were recorded. Optimal platelet reactivity, defined as P2Y12 < 180 platelet reaction units (PRU), was measured with serial point-of-care testing (VerifyNow). Seven patients, median age of 4.9 years, met the above criteria. Three patients had a diagnosis of complex congenital heart disease. Four patients had dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy. All patients were on continuous flow VADs. The median VAD duration was 84.5 days (IQR 61.5-103). The median duration on cangrelor was 43 days (IQR 8-70). The median cangrelor dose to reach the therapeutic threshold was 0.75 g/kg/min with the mean P2Y12, while on cangrelor of 164.75 PRU. Bleeding complications included mild gastrointestinal bleeding and hematuria. There was one patient with pump thrombosis requiring intervention. There were no cerebrovascular events while on cangrelor. We report the first successful long-term use of cangrelor in pediatric patients. The reversibility and short half-life of cangrelor make it a feasible antiplatelet agent in selected patients.

Despite progress in automation in various industries, like mining and downstream, the drilling industry has lagged far behind in the real application of autonomous technologies implementation. This can be attributed to harsh environment, high level of uncertainty in input data, and that majority of stock is legacy drilling rigs, resulting in capital intensive implementations. In the past years there have been several attempts to create fully automated rigs, that includes surface automation and drilling automation. Such solutions are very attractive, because they allow people to move out of hazardous zones and, at the same time, improve performance. However, the main deficiency of such an approach is the very high capital investment required for development of highly bespoke rigs (Slagmulder 2016). And in the current business environment, with high volatility in oil and gas prices, plus the huge negative effect of the Covid-19 crisis on the world's economic situation, it would be hard to imagine that there are a lot of companies willing to make such a risky investment. In addition to this, due to the lack of demand, the market is full of relatively new, high-performance rigs. Taking all these into account, the obvious question is whether it makes sense to invest money and time into the development of drilling automation. The answer should be yes, for three substantial reasons: ? Automation improves personal safety, by moving people out of danger zones;? Automation improves process safety, by transferring execution from person to machine, which reduces the risk of human error;? Automation improves efficiency by bringing consistency to drilling and through the use of self-learning algorithms, which allow machines to drill each successive well better than the previous. This paper will not look into surface automation, such as pipe-handling, chemical and mud handling on site. The paper is focused on the subsurface, namely on the drilling automation process, the challenges that need to be overcome to deploy a vendor agnostic system on a majority of existing rigs. A vendor agnostic system is a modification of an operator's autonomous drilling system (Rassenfoss 2011), designed to use existing rigs, BHAs, and have minimum footprint on the rigs for operational use.

BACKGROUND: The rapid diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 together with the need for isolation for infected patients might be responsible for a suboptimal treatment for SARS-CoV-2 ACS patients. Recently, the group of Sichuan published a protocol for COVID/ACS infected patients that see the thrombolysis as the gold standard of care. METHODS: We enrolled 31 consecutive patients affected by SARS-COV-2 admitted to our emergencies room for suspected ACS. RESULTS: All patients underwent urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when required except two patients with severe hypoxemia and unstable hemodynamic condition that were conservatively treated. Twenty-one cases presented diffuse ST-segment depression while in the remaining cases anterior and inferior ST-elevation was present in four and six cases, respectively. PCI was performed in all cases expect two that were diagnosed as suspected myocarditis because of the absence of severe coronary disease and three with apical ballooning at ventriculography diagnostic for Tako-Tsubo syndromes. Two patients conservatively treated died. The remaining patients undergoing PCI survived except one that required endotracheal intubation (ETI) and died at Day 6.

Patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The illness is associated with tissue hemorrhage, causing local hemolysis and the release of heme in the lung. Extracellular heme is rapidly oxidized from Fe2+ to Fe3+, and has been reported to activate MYD88-mediated inflammatory signaling through Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4. SARS-CoV2 is a single strand RNA virus, which is sensed in part by endosomal TLR7/8 for initiating host innate responses. We hypothesized that heme impairs TLR7/8 mediated type 1 interferon response to coronaviruses, thereby worsening the infection. MethodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from each of 6 donor leukocytes, followed by CD14+ isolation. CD14+ monocytes were either studied directly or further differentiated into macrophages under the stimulation of M-CSF. Resiquimod (R848), an agonist for TLR7/8 in humans and TLR7 in a murine systems, was used as a mimic of coronaviruses. CD14+ monocytes and monocytes derived macrophages (MDM) were treated with hemin (heme containing Fe3+ iron), R848, or a combination of hemin and R848. Untreated cells were used as control. The production of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL6, IFN-alpha, and IFN-beta, were measured by ELISA. The expressions of type 1 interferon stimulated genes (x MX1, ISG15, ISG20, and OASL) were assessed via quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results Hemin alone has no effect on the expression of IL6, TNF, or type 1 interferon-stimulated genes by CD14+ monocytes and MDM, in comparison to untreated cells. In monocytes, hemin resulted in marked inhibition of type-I interferon responses induced by TLR7/8 agonism, but had no effect on IL6 or TNF production. In macrophages, hemin significantly downregulated the production of IL6, but did not affect TNF production or interferon signaling induced by TLR7/8 agonism. Conclusion Heme appears to impair the type 1 interferon response to coronavirus and proinflammatory cytokines productions in human mononuclear phagocytes. Furthermore, heme has different effects on human primary monocytes as compared to macrophages in vitro. We speculate that heme may thus worsens the infection caused by SARS-CoV2 in vivo.

The disease has caused more than 5.1 million deaths worldwide. While cells in the respiratory system are frequently the initial target for SARS-CoV-2, clinical studies suggest that COVID-19 can become a multi-organ disease in the most severe cases. Still, the direct affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for cells in other organs such as the kidneys, which are often affected in severe COVID-19, remains poorly understood. Method In this study, we employed a human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived model to investigate the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney glomerular podocytes. We studied uptake of the live SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as pseudotyped viral particles by human iPS cell derived podocytes using qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Global gene expression and qPCR analyses revealed that human iPS cell-derived podocytes express many host factor genes (including ACE2, BSG/CD147, PLS3, ACTR3, DOCK7, TMPRSS2, CTSL CD209, and CD33) associated with SARS-CoV-2 binding and viral processing. Result Infection of podocytes with live SARS-CoV-2 or spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles revealed viral uptake by the cells at low Multiplicity of Infection (MOI of 0.01) as confirmed by RNA quantification and immunofluorescence studies. Our results also indicate that direct infection of human iPS cell-derived podocytes by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause cell death and podocyte foot process retraction, a hallmark of podocytopathies and progressive glomerular diseases including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Additionally, antibody blocking experiments identified BSG/CD147 and ACE2 receptors as key mediators of spike binding activity in human iPS cell-derived podocytes. Conclusion These results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney glomerular podocytes in vitro. These results also show that the uptake of SARS-CoV-2 by kidney podocytes occurs via multiple binding interactions and partners, which may underlie the high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney tissues. This stem cell-derived model is potentially useful for kidney-specific antiviral drug screening and mechanistic studies of COVID-19 organotropism. Significant statement Many patients with COVID19 disease exhibit multiorgan complications, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection can extend beyond the respiratory system. Acute kidney injury is a common COVID-19 complication contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Still, SARS-Cov-2 affinity for specialized kidney cells remain less clear. By leveraging our protocol for stem cell differentiation, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect kidney glomerular podocytes by using multiple Spike-binding proteins including ACE2 and BSG/CD147. Our results also indicate that infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause podocyte cell death and foot process effacement, a hallmark of podocytopathies including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease.

METHODS: In this study, we have enlisted more than 1100 phytochemicals from Asian plants based on deep literature mining. The compounds library was screened against the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The selected three ligands, Flemichin, Delta-Oleanolic acid, and Emodin 1-O-beta-D-glucoside had a binding energy of -8.9, -8.9, -8.7 KJ/mol respectively. The compounds bind to the active groove of the main protease at; Cys145, Glu166, His41, Met49, Pro168, Met165, Gln189.

Management options include discharge home versus overnight observation, with the latter allowing monitoring for immediate postoperative complications, presumably reducing the need for subsequent readmission. This study investigates the association between overnight observation and ambulatory management of children undergoing Sistrunk procedures and relevant postoperative complication and revisit rates to clarify best practice for these patients. METHODS This was a retrospective database review using the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2007 to 2016. RESULTS The cited dataset identified 6,434 qualifying patients, categorized into ambulatory versus overnight observation cohorts. The overall 30-day revisit rate was 4.9%; the revisit rate with overnight observation (6.1%) was higher than for ambulatory patients (3.8%, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.60; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21, 2.12). Revisit rates were significantly higher in patients 2 years of age or younger compared to older patients (6.7% vs. 4.3%).

RubPro has well-conserved sequence motifs that are also found in its newly discovered Rubivirus relatives. The RubPro construct was shown to have protease activity in trans against a construct of RUBV protease-helicase and fluorogenic peptide. A protease-helicase construct was also cleaved in E. coli expression. RubPro was demonstrated to possess deubiquitylation activity, suggesting a potential role of RubPro in modulating the hosts innate immune responses. The structural and functional insights of the RubPro will advance our current understanding of its function and point to more structure-based research into the RUBV replication machinery, in hopes of developing antiviral therapeutics in the future.","output":"Crystal structure of the Rubella virus protease reveals a unique papain-like protease fold"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Early reports suggest that patients with novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection carry a significant risk of altered coagulation with an increased risk for venous thromboembolic events. This report investigates the relationship of significant COVID-19 infection and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as reflected in the patient clinical and laboratory characteristics. METHODS We reviewed the demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory and radiologic evaluations, results of venous duplex imaging and mortality of COVID-19-positive patients (18-89 years) admitted to the Indiana University Academic Health Center. Using oxygen saturation, radiologic findings, and need for advanced respiratory therapies, patients were classified into mild, moderate, or severe categories of COVID-19 infection. A descriptive analysis was performed using univariate and bivariate Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to examine the distribution of patient characteristics and compare the DVT outcomes. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio of experiencing DVT and a receiver operating curve analysis to identify the optimal cutoff for d-dimer to predict DVT in this COVID-19 cohort. Time to the diagnosis of DVT from admission was analyzed using log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier plots. RESULTS Our study included 71 unique COVID-19-positive patients (mean age, 61 years) categorized as having 3% mild, 14% moderate, and 83% severe infection and evaluated with 107 venous duplex studies. DVT was identified in 47.8% of patients (37% of examinations) at an average of 5.9 days after admission. Patients with DVT were predominantly male (67%; P = .032) with proximal venous involvement (29% upper and 39% in the lower extremities with 55% of the latter demonstrating bilateral involvement). Patients with DVT had a significantly higher mean d-dimer of 5447  7032 ng/mL (P = .0101), and alkaline phosphatase of 110 IU/L (P = .0095) than those without DVT. On multivariable analysis, elevated d-dimer (P = .038) and alkaline phosphatase (P = .021) were associated with risk for DVT, whereas age, sex, elevated C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels were not. A receiver operating curve analysis suggests an optimal d-dimer value of 2450 ng/mL cutoff with 70% sensitivity, 59.5% specificity, and 61% positive predictive value, and 68.8% negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that males with severe COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization are at highest risk for developing DVT. Elevated d-dimers and alkaline phosphatase along with our multivariable model can alert the clinician to the increased risk of DVT requiring early evaluation and aggressive treatment.","output":"Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus disease-2019 infection and deep venous thrombosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To report the initial clinical case of single-port transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) bilateral inguinal hernia repair.

Given the high infection rate in New York City, we conducted a COVID-19 assessment survey in a cohort of CKD and liver patients previously consented into genetic studies. Methods: Between March and August 2020, we completed 1601 unique IRBapproved COVID-19 assessment surveys. The survey covered COVID-19 symptoms, exposure risk, PCR and/or serology testing, and hospitalization. 298 of those patients were exome sequenced. We analyzed differences in COVID-19 PCR, serology and hospitalization rate and genetic analysis to identify possibly associated variants in the immune/coagulation pathways, suggested to be involved in COVID-19 susceptibility/ severity by recent publicationw. We also analyzed variants based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for clinical annotation of genetic results Results: Hispanic/Latino patients were more likely to have a positive COVID-19 PCR (Fisher Exact Test p: 0.01, 29.5% vs 16.7%), serology (Fisher Exact Test p: 0.02, 22.9% vs 9.7%) and hospitalization (Fisher Exact Test p: 0.01, 29.5% vs 16.7%). Patients with glomerulopathy had lower positive COVID-19 PCR tests (Fisher Exact Test p: 0.01, 14.7% vs 48.7%). Analysis of exome data identified an excess number of rare variants in genes in the immune dysregulation pathways among patients with positive COVID-19 PCR test, (fisher p: 0.01, 75% vs 18%). These results were mostly driven by rare variants in CASP10, which were more common among the Hispanic/Latino population. Conclusions: We confirm that Hispanic/Latino ethnicity is a significant risk factor for positive COVID-19 PCR, serology and hospitalization. The analysis of the genetic mechanisms in immune/coagulation pathways identified an excess of rare variants in the CASP10 gene, results that overlap with Hispanic/Latino ethnicity.","output":"Genetic findings in COVID19-positive patients from a cohort of kidney and liver patients at columbia university"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CRISPR\\\\Cas systems are a form of prokaryotic adaptive immunity that employs RNA\\\\guided endonucleases (Cas effectors) to cleave foreign genetic elements.

METHODS: Pubmed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and medRxiv were searched until November 21, 2020 using the following keywords: proton pump inhibitors and COVID-19 as well as their related MESH terms. The studies considered in the meta-analysis were either cohort or case-control in design and adjusted for confounding factors. The quality of the studies included in this meta-analysis was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In addition, a random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled Odds Ratio (ORs) and the corresponding confidence interval (95% CI).

SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and can affect various species capable of crossing the species barrier due to active mutation. Although reports on reverse zoonosis (human-to-animal transmission) of SARS-CoV-2 remain limited, reverse zoonosis has been reported in many species such as cats, tigers, minks, etc. Therefore, transmission to more animals cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population could result in an increased risk of reverse zoonosis. To counteract reverse zoonosis, we developed the first COVID-19 subunit vaccines for dogs, which are representative companion animals, and the vaccine includes the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein of whole S1 protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). A subunit vaccine is a vaccine developed by purifying only the protein region that induces an immune response instead of the whole pathogen. This type of vaccine is safer than the whole virus vaccine because there is no risk of infection and proliferation through back-mutation of the virus. Vaccines were administered to beagles twice at an interval of 3 weeks subcutaneously and antibody formation rates were assessed in serum. We identified a titer, comparable to that of vaccinated people, shown to be sufficient to protect against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the vaccination of companion animals, such as dogs, may prevent reverse zoonosis by protecting animals from SARS-CoV-2; thus, reverse zoonosis of COVID-19 is preventable.","output":"A COVID-19 Vaccine for Dogs Prevents Reverse Zoonosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic.

Despite large numbers of reported seroprevalence studies, there remains a limited understanding of how the magnitude and epitope utilization of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 viral anti-gens varies within populations following natural infection. Here, we designed a quantitative, multi-epitope protein microarray comprising various nucleocapsid protein structural motifs, including two structural domains and three intrinsically disordered regions. Quantitative data from the microarray provided complete differentiation between cases and pre-pandemic controls (100% sensitivity and specificity) in a case-control cohort (n = 100). We then assessed the influence of disease severity, age, and ethnicity on the strength and breadth of the humoral response in a multi-ethnic cohort (n = 138). As expected, patients with severe disease showed significantly higher antibody titers and interestingly also had significantly broader epitope coverage. A significant increase in antibody titer and epitope coverage was observed with increasing age, in both mild and severe disease, which is promising for vaccine efficacy in older individuals. Additionally, we observed significant differences in the breadth and strength of the humoral immune response in relation to ethnicity, which may reflect differences in genetic and lifestyle factors. Furthermore, our data enabled localization of the immuno-dominant epitope to the C-terminal structural domain of the viral nucleocapsid protein in two independent cohorts. Overall, we have designed, validated, and tested an advanced serological assay that enables accurate quantitation of the humoral response post natural infection and that has revealed unexpected differences in the magnitude and epitope utilization within a population.","output":"Age, Disease Severity and Ethnicity Influence Humoral Responses in a Multi-Ethnic COVID-19 Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Intake of the antioxidant vitamins C and E lowers the oxidative stress.

METHODS: Patients previously included in the COVID-19 High-intensity Immunosuppression in Cytokine storm syndrome (CHIC) study who received immunosuppressive treatment versus standard of care for COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation were invited for follow-up at 3 and 6 months after hospitalisation. At both visits, patients were assessed by a pulmonologist, completed quality of life (QoL) questionnaires and performed pulmonary and exercise function tests. At 3 months, patients additionally completed questionnaires on dyspnoea, anxiety, depression and trauma. Outcomes were compared between patients receiving and those not receiving intensive short-term immunosuppressive therapy for COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation. RESULTS: 131 (66.5%) patients survived hospitalisation due to COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation and 118 (90.1%) were included.

The rapid development of FinTech lending due to the use of internet-based mobile application platforms, so that it is easily accessible by anyone and anywhere, it encourages an increase in lending to the customers, however credit risk (although absorbed by lenders or investors, still indirectly affects the platform operators), experienced an increase due to non performing loan or NPL. The increase in NPL is an important concern for FinTech lending industry stakeholders, and if it is not addressed it will disrupt the FinTech ecosystem, let alone cause systemic risk, it will be the toughest disturbance in the stability of the FinTech ecosystem, considering that the risk of FinTech lending has a significant influence on the FinTech ecosystem, so that if the level of risk increases, it affects the FinTech ecosystem, this condition requires the key role of financial (FinTech) regulation that can mitigate risk, because financial (FinTech) regulation has a very strong correlation or relationship, so that it can mitigate the risks faced. Another key role of financial (FinTech) regulation is to strengthen the FinTech ecosystem, with new elements needed by the industry and encourage the industry to develop the concept of ecosystem-based risk management in this industry, because it is believed that this concept can mitigate risk as well. Fundamental risks in the FinTech lending industry include: (i) credit risk, (ii) operational risk and (iii) liquidity risk, meanwhile pandemic risk is a new element that is also being investigated, the results of the study show that pandemic risk has a positive correlation with start-up FinTech companies, this means that a pandemic still allows this industry to develop and grow.

In contrast, the reciprocal of the binomial proportion, also known as the inverse proportion, is often overlooked, even though it also plays an important role in various fields including clinical studies and random sampling. The maximum likelihood estimator of the inverse proportion suffers from the zero-event problem, and to overcome it, alternative methods have been developed in the literature. Nevertheless, there is little work addressing the optimality of the existing estimators, as well as their practical performance comparison. Inspired by this, we propose to further advance the literature by developing an optimal estimator for the inverse proportion in a family of shrinkage estimators. We further derive the explicit and approximate formulas for the optimal shrinkage parameter under different settings. Simulation studies show that the performance of our new estimator performs better than, or as well as, the existing competitors in most practical settings.

This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 in gastroenterology departments across Portugal and the strategies developed to overcome this challenge. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on an online survey. A detailed questionnaire concerning different aspects of gastroenterology department activity was sent via e-mail to the heads of gastroenterology departments of Portuguese District Hospitals (Nucleo de Gastroenterologia dos Hospitais Distritais). Two periods were assessed, i.e., the emergency state and the recovery period between May and September. The responses were collected between September and October 2020. Results: A total of 21 hospitals were enrolled (80.8% response rate). Twenty-eight percent of the responders reported healthcare professionals from their unit infected with COVID-19. At least 1 member (mostly fellows) of the department was deployed to another workplace in 66.7% of the hospitals. During the emergency state, 47.6% of the hospitals only performed urgent/emergent endoscopic procedures. In 38.5% of the hospitals the need to ration personal protective equipment led to the suspension of endoscopic training. Regarding the recovery period, nonurgent procedures were restarted in almost all of the centers. The same was reported for the colorectal cancer screening program. Remarkably, 81% of the responders confirmed that they had postponed procedures at patients' request for \\"fear of getting infected.\\" Remote consultation was maintained in 81% of the hospitals.

If the virus spreads uncontrollably and rapidly, there is a risk of an unpredictable increase of patients with COVID-19 disease requiring hospital treatment. The capacities of a hospital can quickly reach the limit and consequently patients can no longer be adequately treated. Therefore, in the acute phase of the pandemic, it is necessary to release all hospital resources for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Strict hygiene regulations must also be observed in order to prevent the virus from spreading unexpectedly in the hospital in order to protect patients and hospital staff. Elective operations and outpatient clinics must be cancelled in the acute phase. Special hygiene measures must be observed for urgent and unpostponable operations. These relate to the admission of the patients, the accommodation in the ward and the operative care in the operating room. In the post-acute phase, a normal surgical program can be resumed step by step. In this phase, however, clear hygiene regulations must also be observed.

Chest CT identified pulmonary thromboembolism (PE), later confirmed with CT angiography. Chest CT identified myocardial late enhancement in 16 patients (80% in CE vs. 71% in non CE, p=0.68), myocardial fat in 1, and coronary calcification in 77% [with 2.62.2 vs 3.83.6 coronary calcified segments in CE vs. non CEstrokes, p=0.36). The mean ECV was 354% in CE vs 326% in non CE strokes (p=0.17). The 2patients with a positive PCR test for COVID-19 showed evidence of myocardial late iodineenhancement, and incremented ECV of the septal wall (38% and 40%, respectively). Conclusions: In this pilot study, DP, non ECG gated, low dose chest CT scan performed 5 min afterbrain CTP with a spectral scanner;enabled straightforward identification of CE sources amongpatients with AIS. This approach allowed detection of PE and myocardial injury.","output":"Identification of cardioembolic sources and myocardial injury in acute ischemic stroke with delayed-phase, low-dose chest ct by means of a dual-layer spectral ct scanner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human race has often faced pandemic with substantial number of fatalities. As COVID-19 pandemic reached and endured in every corner on earth, countries with moderate to strong healthcare support and expenditure seemed to struggle in containing disease transmission and casualties. COVID-19 affected countries have variability in demographic, socioeconomic and life style health indicators. At this context it is important to find out at what extent these parametric variations are actually modulating disease outcomes. To answer this, we have selected demographic, socioeconomic and health indicators e.g. population density, percentage of urban population, median age, health expenditure per capita, obesity, diabetes prevalence, alcohol intake, tobacco use, case fatality of non communicable diseases (NCDs) as independent variables. Countries were grouped according to these variables and influence on dependent variables e.g. COVID-19 test positive, case fatality and case recovery rates were statistically analyzed. The results suggest that countries with variable median age has significantly different outcome on test positive rate (P<0.01). Both median age (P=0.0397) and health expenditure per capita (P=0.0041) has positive relation with case recovery. Increasing number of test per 100K population showed positive and negative relation with number of positives per 100K population (P=0.0001) and percentage of test positives (P<0.0001) respectively. Alcohol intake per capita in liter (P=0.0046), diabetes prevalence (P=0.0389) and NCDs mortalities (P=0.0477) also showed statistical relation with case fatality rate. Further analysis revealed that countries with high healthcare expenditure along with high median age and increased urban population showed more case fatality but also had better recovery rate. Investment in health sector alone is insufficient in controlling pandemic severity. Intelligent and sustainable healthcare both in urban and rural settings and healthy lifestyle acquired immunity may reduce disease transmission and comorbidity induced fatalities respectively.","output":"Lifestyle acquired immunity, decentralized intelligent infrastructures and revised healthcare expenditures may limit pandemic catastrophe: a lesson from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dysregulated immune profiles have been described in symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, scientists around the world have been studying the genome and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection to develop effective therapies and prevention. In this review, we summarize the progressive development of various treatments and vaccines as they have emerged, a year after the outbreak of the pandemic. Initially for COVID-19, patients were recommended drugs with presumed antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects that were previously used to treat other diseases. Thereafter, therapeutic interventions were supplemented with promising approaches based on antibodies, peptides, and stem cells. However, licensed COVID-19 vaccines remain the most effective weapon in combating the pandemic.

The active monitoring model in CHPS was used to detect ADR signals of the hospital information system. The risk factors for the ADRs were classified using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to analyze the risk factors of ADRs. Our results showed that the prevalence of ADRs was 37.8% in the patients, which was predominated by drug-induced gastrointestinal disorders and liver system disorders (23.0% vs. 13.8%). The ADR could be explained by the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir and umifenovir by 63.8% and 18.1%, respectively. There were 96.8% of ADRs that occurred within 14 days of hospitalization.

Case presentation: We introduce four patients who complained of fever, cough, chest tightness and other symptoms, all of them were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). They were treated with mechanical ventilation because of severe ARDS. After respiratory support, antiviral and anti-infective treatment, they were weaned from mechanic ventilation with the improvement of hypoxemia.

Models were adjusted for relevant confounders.ResultsCompared with Swedish-Swedish couples (1.18 deaths per thousand person-years), both immigrants partnered with another immigrant and a native showed excess mortality for COVID-19 (HR 1.43;95% CI 1.29 to 1.58 and HR 1.24;95% CI 1.10 to 1.40, respectively), which translates to 1.37 and 1.28 deaths per thousand person-years. Moreover, similar results are found for natives partnered with an immigrant (HR 1.15;95% CI 1.02 to 1.29), which translates to 1.29 deaths per thousand person-years.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compared the lethality of suicide attempts and the methods chosen between the three months before the COVID-19 pandemic and three months during curfew and lockdown in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a retrospective, causal-comparative study conducted at King Saud Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 62 suicide attempt cases between January 2020 and June 2020 were included in this study. The scale for assessment of the lethality of suicide attempts (SALSA) was used for comparison, and cross-tabulation was used for the data of suicide methods. RESULTS: There was a significant difference (P = 0.003) in the total SALSA score before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. The scores of lethality of suicide attempts were high during the lockdown. No significant difference was found in the suicide methods selected between the two time periods. However, the use of psychotropic medication overdose and self-immolation were prominent during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely associated with increased lethality of suicide attempts as well as an increased suicide rate. The development of appropriate mental health services is required.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Lethality of Suicide Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustained coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission is ongoing in Italy, with 7,375 reported cases and 366 deaths by 8 March 2020.

In Spain, this mandatory home confinement started on March 14, 2020. In this scenario, some calls have been made to better understand the exact impact of the quarantine on the emotional status of individuals across time. Materials and Methods: On the first day that the Spanish government imposed the quarantine, our team launched an online longitudinal study to monitor emotional responses to the COVID-19 emergency over time. For 2 weeks, 187 people have responded to a daily diary on emotion functioning. An emotion network analysis was performed to study the network structure of 30 mood states and its changes during the first 2 weeks of the quarantine. Results: The emotional network showed critical changes in the interactions of emotions over time. An analysis of mean emotional levels did not show statistically significant changes in mood over time. Interestingly, two different network patterns were found when the sample was divided between those with favorable responses and those with unfavorable responses. Discussion: This new approach to the study of longitudinal changes of the mood state network of the population reveals different adaptation strategies reflected on the sample's emotional network. This network approach can help identify most fragile individuals (more vulnerable to external stressors) before they develop clear and identifiable psychopathology and also help identify anti-fragile individuals (those who improve their functioning in the face of external stressors). This is one of the first studies to apply an emotional network approach to study the psychological effects of pandemics and might offer some clues to psychologists and health administrators to help people cope with and adjust to this critical situation.","output":"Emotion Network Analysis During COVID-19 Quarantine - A Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of recent SARS-CoV-2 has become a global health issue. This single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus is continuously spreading with increasing morbidities and mortalities. The proteome of this virus contains four structural and sixteen nonstructural proteins that ensure the replication of the virus in the host cell. However, the role of phosphoprotein (N) in RNA recognition, replicating, transcribing the viral genome, and modulating the host immune response is indispensable. Recently, the NMR structure of the N-terminal domain of the Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein has been reported, but its precise structural mechanism of how the ssRNA interacts with it is not reported yet. Therefore, here, we have used an integrated computational pipeline to identify the key residues, which play an essential role in RNA recognition. We generated multiple variants by using an alanine scanning strategy and performed an extensive simulation for each system to signify the role of each interfacial residue. Our analyses suggest that residues T57A, H59A, S105A, R107A, F171A, and Y172A significantly affected the dynamics and binding of RNA. Furthermore, per-residue energy decomposition analysis suggests that residues T57, H59, S105 and R107 are the key hotspots for drug discovery. Thus, these residues may be useful as potential pharmacophores in drug designing.","output":"Structural Insights into the mechanism of RNA recognition by the N-terminal RNA-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(D,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/25.md","filePath":"drive/25.md"}'),P={name:"drive/25.md"},E=Object.assign(P,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
