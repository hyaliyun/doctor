Methods that detect viral presence into the host excretions measure current infection by SARS-CoV-2, whereas the detection of human antibodies exploited against SARS-CoV-2 evaluates the past exposure to the virus. OBJECTIVE: This review provides a comprehensive overview for the use of saliva as a specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the methods for the salivary diagnostics utilized till very recently, and the arisen considerations for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: The major advantage of using saliva as a specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is that saliva collection is a non-invasive method which produces no discomfort to the patient and permits the patients to utilize home self-sampling techniques in order to protect health providers from the exposure to the pathogen. There is an urgent need to increase the active research for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva because the non-invasive salivary diagnostics may provide a reliable and cost-effective method suitable for the fast and early detection of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Salivary diagnostics of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about the quality of polyclonal antibody responses in COVID-19 patients, and how it correlates with disease severity or patients' prior exposure to other pathogens.

International practice currently encourages integrated care for physical and mental health in oncology. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the delivery of healthcare services across the world. The current research paper is on the psycho-oncology service provision for hospitalised cancer patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All patients who were referred to psycho-oncology services during the study period of 1 month, in the two successive years of 2019 and 2020, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected from the centralised electronic medical records for patients. Data included cancer diagnosis, reason for admission, admitting team and reason for a psychiatric referral. Other parameters that were measured were the timing of the psychiatric assessment, psychiatric diagnosis and psycho-oncology care provided, which included psychological interventions carried out and medications prescribed. The overall institutional data on cancer care provision are also presented in brief to provide context to the psycho-oncology services. RESULTS: Integrated psycho-oncology services reviewed and managed patients round the year in the hospital where the study was conducted. During the 1-month study period, in 2019 and 2020, the total number of hospitalised cancer patients managed by the services was 74 and 52, respectively. During the study period of 2020, 292 patients with cancer who were being treated in the hospital had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tested on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 50 members of healthcare staff also tested positive. The most common diagnosis of patients was found to be stress-related adjustment disorder [16/74 (21.6%) in 2019 and 16/52 (30.8%) in 2020]. The paper discusses the common stressors voiced by the patients and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several challenges of providing psychological services were overcome by the team and the paper touches upon the common strategies that were used during the pandemic. Most patients did not need medications, but a significant minority did benefit from treatment with psychotropic medications. Simple psychological interventions such as sleep hygiene, supportive therapy sessions and psycho-education benefited many patients and were feasible even during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The provision of psycho-oncology services to cancer patients and their caregivers was important before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Physiological changes due to aging as well as comorbidities and polypharmacy are responsible for a complex clinical approach. Concomitantly, in cognitive impairment, including advanced dementia, changes in the central nervous system along with changes in the peripheral nervous system due to aging have a significant impact on pain perception. Sometimes clinicians decide to prescribe opioids to relieve pain, also without a clear indication. This review aims to investigate the effect of opioids in elderly patients with cognitive impairment. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane databases was conducted using keyword searches to generate lists of articles that were screened for relevance by title and abstract to give a final list of articles for full-text review. Further articles were identified by scanning the reference lists of the full-text articles. DISCUSSION: This review discusses the complex physiological and pharmacological changes in the elderly as well as the neurological changes that affect pain perception in this population. Additionally, it focuses on cognitive impairment and pain in Alzheimers disease and other dementias, the pain assessment in the elderly with cognitive impairment as well as the safety of opioid use in the elderly. Information regarding opioid prescription in nursing homes and recorded indications for opioid use, type and dosing of opioids, and compliance of treatment in advanced dementia are also provided. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid prescription in the elderly population with cognitive impairment is particularly complex. All healthcare professionals involved in the care of such patients need to be aware of the challenges and strive to ensure analgesic use is guided by appropriate and accurate pain assessment.","output":"Opioids in the Elderly Patients with Cognitive Impairment: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) significantly affected our society, the country, and the world.

We describe the epidemiology and public health response to the first known outbreak of 2009 H1N1 in a train, which occurred in June 2009 in China. METHODS: After 2 provinces provided initial reports of 2009 H1N1 infection in 2 persons who had travelled on the same train, we conducted a retrospective epidemiologic investigation to collect information from the passengers, crew members, contacts, and health care providers. We explored the source of infection and possible routes of transmission in the train. All cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. RESULTS: Train #1223 traveled 40 hours, made 28 stops in 4 Chinese provinces, and boarded 2555 passengers, who logged a total of 59 144 person-hours of travel time. Nineteen confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases were identified. Of these, 13 were infected and developed symptoms on the train and 6 occurred among contacts who developed illness during medical monitoring. In addition, 3 asymptomatic cases were identified based on RT-PCR testing of respiratory swabs from contacts. The attack rate among contacts of confirmed cases in the same car was higher than that among contacts in other cars (3.15% vs. 0%, P < 0.001). Attack rates increased with exposure time.

However, a causal impact of the gut microbiome on COVID-19 patient health has not been established. Here we provide evidence that gut microbiome dysbiosis is associated with translocation of bacteria into the blood during COVID-19, causing life-threatening secondary infections. Antibiotics and other treatments during COVID-19 can potentially confound microbiome associations. We therefore first demonstrate that the gut microbiome is directly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner in a mouse model, causally linking viral infection and gut microbiome dysbiosis. Comparison with stool samples collected from 101 COVID-19 patients at two different clinical sites also revealed substantial gut microbiome dysbiosis, paralleling our observations in the animal model. Specifically, we observed blooms of opportunistic pathogenic bacterial genera known to include antimicrobial-resistant species in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analysis of blood culture results testing for secondary microbial bloodstream infections with paired microbiome data obtained from these patients suggest that bacteria translocate from the gut into the systemic circulation of COVID-19 patients. These results are consistent with a direct role for gut microbiome dysbiosis in enabling dangerous secondary infections during COVID-19.","output":"Gut microbiome dysbiosis during COVID-19 is associated with increased risk for bacteremia and microbial translocation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection was reported in Wuhan, China.

Among the etiological factors S. pneumoniae-causing lobar pneumonia plays a leading role. According to current textbook knowledge at least three sequential stages of lobar pneumonia are distinguished: congestion, red hepatization and gray hepatization. However, there are no detailed data supporting this stage concept. There are also controversial views on its etiology. In this study, the lung changes in lobar pneumonia were related to the cause and duration of the disease. In addition, the complications of the disease were evaluated. PCR studies verified the etiology of pneumonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Lobar pneumonia was analyzed in 252 post mortem cases examined in a large hospital in Irkutsk. The pathology, etiology of pneumonia, course of disease and cause of death were recorded and correlated to its clinical course and duration. In the second part of the study, the results in 95 patients were analyzed in detail and related to PCR findings. RESULTS: Most patients were adult men of low social status who showed signs of severe alcoholism. Lobar pneumonia was observed in 85% of the patients, while the remaining patients showed sublobar (lobular, focal) lung involvement. Histologically, three patterns of inflammation were observed, which in most patients occurred concurrently in different parts of the involved lobe: congestion, characterized by serous exudation with multiple cocci (41% of cases), red hepatization (41% of cases) and gray hepatization (100% of cases). The latter pattern was subdivided into three subgroups according to the ratio of fibrinneutrophils and the presence of macrophages. The mean number of different histological patterns observed per patient was 3.8. There was no correlation between the inflammatory patterns and the duration of the disease. In 23% of the patients, the cause of death was of pulmonary origin, while the remaining patients died of extrapulmonary complications (i.e. acute heart failure 26%, acute vascular insufficiency 15% purulent meningitis 11C24.3%. In 29/95 patients (20 with lobar and 9 with focal pneumonia) pneumococcal etiology of pneumonia was established by PCR. CONCLUSION: Lobar pneumonia is a distinct clinico-pathological entity caused by S. pneumoniae, demonstrated by PCR testing and/or cytological examinations. Bacteriologic studies frequently give falsenegative results. Lobar pneumonia is characterized by three main histopathological patterns (congestion or microbeous edema, and red and gray hepatization) which usually occur side by side and not in chronological order. Early death is often related to heart failure and septic shock, while meningitis is a frequent complication later in the course.","output":"Lobar (croupous) pneumonia: old and new data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Antibiotics represent the most widely prescribed drugs in children worldwide, both in hospital and community settings. A comprehensive approach to understanding the reasons and determinants of antibiotic prescription in the pediatric age is needed. This study aimed to assess parents' attitudes and perspectives about antibiotic use. METHODS Prospective observational study was conducted in all Italian Regions between February 1 and April 30, 2020, using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS Six thousand six hundred twenty-five parents from all Italian regions completed the survey. Seventy-six percent of parents were aware that only bacteria are the target of antibiotics, but 92.9% knew that the antibiotic has no direct effect on fever. Antibiotic self-prescription (10.4%) or by remote consultation by phone call (19.9%) or message (9.6%) were relatively common. Ninety-three percent of parents were aware that excessive use of antibiotics could select resistant bacteria and 84.7% of them knew that they could actively fight antibiotic resistance. About two thirds of participants (66.1%) received information on antibiotic resistance from their family pediatrician. Parents born of Italy or those with lower income had a higher probability of having less information from pediatricians or knowledge of proper antibiotic use. DISCUSSION Our study suggests that parents' knowledge and attitudes toward antibiotic use and prescription are improving compared with previous studies, while there is still a gap regarding antibiotic resistance, particularly on practices that can reduce its burden. Our study's negative finding is that families from low-income settings or those born abroad have significantly more misconceptions about important antibiotic practices.","output":"Parents' Perspective of Antibiotic Usage in Children: A Nationwide Survey in Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The mRNA encoding the 49-kDa nucleocapsid protein (N) of the bovine coronavirus is bicistronic.

In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains using the time course of the fraction of B.1.1.7 strains. Based on Wallinga-Teunis's method to estimate the instantaneous reproduction numbers, our method allows the reproduction number to change during the target period of analysis. Our approach is also based on the Maynard Smith's model of allele frequencies in adaptive evolution, which assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains is constant over time. Applying this method to the sequence data in England using serial intervals of COVID-19, we found that the transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain is 40% (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 40% to 41%) higher than previously circulating strains in England.

In preschoolers, viral infections remain the main cause of these exacerbations, although environmental factors may also play a role. In older children and adolescents, many other risk factors are present including respiratory allergies, exercise, strong emotions, active and passive smoking and poor adherence to recommended treatments. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have been concerned about the possibility of a significant increase in urgent consultations for asthma in children. However, due to the confinement imposed on a large part of the population from March 2020, we have suspected a reduction in the number of viral infections leading to urgent visits and hospitalizations in pediatric patients. OBJECTIVES: Our hypothesis was that the number of children hospitalized with asthma exacerbations during the pandemic lockdown declined significantly. Our objective was to determine if the number and severity of hospitalizations at the CME of the CHU de Qubec for asthma exacerbations in children aged 1 to 17 had significantly decreased during the confinement period from April 1 to July 1, 2020 and to what extent, according to various clinical features. DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective study reviewing episodes of care in medical records in children aged 1 to 17 and hospitalized on all wards at the CME-CHU de Qubec. All patients with primary diagnosis of asthmatic exacerbation according to the summary sheets between April 1 to July 1, 2020 for the study group and from April 1 to July 1, 2019 for the control group were included. We aimed to determine the number of hospitalizations for this diagnosis for each period and determine the length of stay on the various pediatric wards for each episode of care according to the established criteria. We have determined the presence of risk factors (asthma diagnosis, underlying condition, regular asthma medication, allergies, and other factors relevant to asthma).We have further determined the presence of gravity markers during the course of hospitalization (need for: IV corticosteroids, Mg sulfate, IV bronchodilators, non-invasive ventilation, intubation, ICU stay and radiological pneumonia) for each episode of care. The data was denominated and collated in an encoded file, and shareable only between the investigators. RESULTS: After exclusions, a total of 97 charts were analyzed. Between April 1 and July 1 2019, a total of 89 patients were admitted with a diagnosis of asthma exacerbation while only eight patients were admitted during the same period in 2020. The median age of patients admitted in 2020 was higher than in 2019 (53 vs 25 months). In 2019, 40 children (48%) had a previous diagnosis of asthma, of whom 28 used regular controller medications compared to 2 children (25%) in 2020, both taking regular controller medications.

To our knowledge, no study has evaluated specific factors that affected patient satisfaction with telemedicine and the receptiveness to continue virtual visits post COVID-19 in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients. Thus, the purposes of our study were to determine: 1) patient satisfaction with using TJA telemedicine services, 2) whether patient characteristics might be associated with satisfaction, and 3) whether virtual clinic visits may be used post-COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional survey study was completed by 126 TJA patients who participated in telemedicine visits with TJA surgeons from May 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020. The survey consisted of questions regarding demographics, satisfaction and telemedicine experiences. RESULTS: 101 (80.2%) patients were satisfied with their telemedicine visit, with patients less than 80 years old (p=0.008) and those with a longer commute time being more satisfied (p=0.01). There was a significant preference for in-person visits when meeting arthroplasty surgeons for the first time (p<0.001), but patients were equally amenable to follow-up telemedicine visits once there was an established relationship with the surgeon. CONCLUSION: Younger patients, patients with longer commute distances, and patients who had established relationships with their provider expressed higher satisfaction with telemedicine arthroplasty visits. While greater than 80% of patients were satisfied with their telemedicine visit, an established patient-provider relationship may be integral to the success of an arthroplasty telemedicine practice.","output":"Telemedicine Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Experience During Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In a typical winter respiratory season, Influenza A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections are common in pediatrics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we noted a marked decrease in all except for Rhinovirus/Enterovirus at our free-standing quaternary level childrens hospital. METHODS: We prospectively reviewed all patients with positive testing for viral respiratory pathogens from October 1, 2018 through May 29, 2021. Testing was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (BioFire? FilmArray? Respiratory 2 Panel, UT) and by SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing (Cepheid?, CA). The latter may have been done for pre-procedure or admission screening. We submitted 74 specimens to the California Department Public Health (CDPH) for definitive identification and serotyping analysis. RESULTS: The number of Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (RV/EV) infections was compared with Influenza A & B, RSV, and hMPV over the past 3 years. There was a 152% increase in RV/EV from 2018-2019 to 2020-2021 with near absence of other respiratory viruses (Figure 1). In 2020-2021, RV/EV (N=877, 84%) made up a larger percentage of all viral etiologies compared to 2018-2019 (N=348, 11%) (Figure 2). Healthcare acquired infections (HAI) due to respiratory viruses decreased in 2020-2021 compared to both of the prior seasons, though all cases were due to RV/EV (Figure 3). There were no RV/EV associated deaths. Of 74 submitted, CDPH did typing on 24 samples; all were found to be rhinovirus (RV). Figure 1. High-Risk Winter Viral Infections 2019-2021.

This was reflected in both our community data and HAI due to respiratory viruses. There was a marked increase in RV/EV starting with week 18 (Figure 4). We hypothesize this is due to schools re-opening. Understanding RV epidemiology and transmission is important, as it may inform return to school and work protocols for the upcoming respiratory viral season. Figure 4.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the 2020 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pandemic, is present in 215 countries, and is described as a pathogen that is most deadly to individuals 65 years and older. However, it is unclear if the majority of COVID-19-related deaths are targeting individuals above or below life expectancy. Methods Through seven months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, an association between life expectancy and COVID-19 related deaths was assessed. The reported age of those suffering from COVID-19-related deaths was evaluated across eight countries (United States, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, and Switzerland), and placed into binary categories depending on whether or not the death occurred above or below the country's life expectancy. Results Given this dataset, it was observed that there was a greater proportion of COVID related deaths above life expectancy (M=64.58%, SD=6.46) as opposed to below life expectancy (M=35.41%, SD=6.46), as these differences were significant (95%CI [18.518, 42.881], p<0.001). In contrast, an insignificant trend was observed when examining the relationship between deaths above life expectancy and Gini index (Pearson correlation coefficient r= -0.62, n=8, p=0.09). The disparity, or percent difference in death occurring above versus below life expectancy was greatest in the countries with life expectancies of 80+ (Sweden, Switzerland, Germany).

However, the factors regulating the T cell pathogenic gene expression program remain unclear. Here, we investigated how the Ikaros transcription factor regulates the global gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes in murine T cells during Th17 polarization and after activation via the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28. We found that, in both conditions, Ikaros represses the expression of genes from the pathogenic signature, particularly Csf2, which encodes GM-CSF. We show that, in TCR/CD28-activated T cells, Ikaros binds a critical enhancer downstream of Csf2 and is required to regulate chromatin accessibility at multiple regions across this locus. Genome-wide Ikaros binding is associated with more compact chromatin, notably at multiple sites containing NFB or STAT5 target motifs, and STAT5 or NFB inhibition prevents GM-CSF production in Ikaros-deficient cells. Importantly, Ikaros also limits GM-CSF production in TCR/CD28-activated human T cells. Our data therefore highlight a critical conserved transcriptional mechanism that antagonizes GM-CSF expression in T cells.","output":"CD4+ T cells require Ikaros to inhibit their differentiation toward a pathogenic cell fate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Older adults are at greater risk of both infection with and mortality from COVID\\\\19.

The objective of this study is to describe and identify patterns in the disease course of nursing home residents infected with COVID\\\\19. SETTING AND METHODS: This is a case series of 74 residents with COVID\\\\19 infection in a nursing home in central Indiana between March 28 and June 17, 2020. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record and from nursing home medical director tracking notes from the time of the index infection through August 31, 2020. The clinical authorship team reviewed the data to identify patterns in the disease course of the residents. RESULTS: The most common symptoms were fever, hypoxia, anorexia, and fatigue/malaise. The duration of symptoms was extended, with an average of over 3 weeks. Of those infected 25 died; 23 of the deaths were considered related to COVID\\\\19 infection. A subset of residents with COVID\\\\19 infection experienced a rapidly progressive, fatal course. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Nursing home residents infected with COVID\\\\19 from the facility we studied experienced a prolonged disease course regardless of the severity of their symptoms, with implications for the resources needed to care for and support of these residents during active infection and post\\\\disease.

The algorithm is built on the sensitivity matrix analysis using the methods of differential and linear algebra. It allows one to determine the parameters that are the least and most sensitive to data changes to build a regularization for solving an identification problem of the most accurate pandemic spread scenarios in the region. The performed analysis has demonstrated that the virus contagiousness is identifiable from the number of daily confirmed, critical and recovery cases. On the other hand, the predicted proportion of the admitted patients who require a ventilator and the mortality rate are determined much less consistently. It has been shown that building a more realistic forecast requires adding additional information about the process such as the number of daily hospital admissions. In our study, the problems of parameter identification using additional information about the number of daily confirmed, critical and mortality cases in the region were reduced to minimizing the corresponding misfit functions. The minimization problem was solved through the differential evolution method that is widely applied for stochastic global optimization. It has been demonstrated that a more general COVID-19 spread compartmental model consisting of seven ordinary differential equations describes the main trend of the spread and is sensitive to the peaks of confirmed cases but does not qualitatively describe small statistical datasets such as the number of daily critical cases or mortality that can lead to errors in forecasting.

The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients' lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C-N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

In far to many cities around the world rebounds of the epidemic are occurring or, in others, plateau-like states have appeared where high incidence rates remain constant for relatively long periods of time. Nonetheless, faced with the challenge of urgent social need to reactivate their economies, many countries have decided to lift mitigation measures at times of high incidence. In this paper, we use a mathematical model to characterize the impact of short duration transmission events within the confinement period previous but close to the epidemic peak. The model describes too, the possible consequences on the disease dynamics after mitigation measures are lifted. We use Mexico City as a case study. The results show that events of high mobility may produce either a later higher peak, a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence or the same peak as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay. Finally, we also show the importance of carefully timing the lifting of mitigation measures.

We determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using a large dataset (N = 21 000 - 157 000) from the Brazilian Sistema de Informao de Vigilancia Epidemiolgica da Gripe database. A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2 and 17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of 15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalized lognormal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.","output":"Inference of COVID-19 epidemiological distributions from Brazilian hospital data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Retroviruses exist as exogenous infectious agents and as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) integrated into host chromosomes. Such endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are grouped into three classes roughly corresponding to the seven genera of infectious retroviruses: class I (gamma-, epsilonretroviruses), class II (alpha-, beta-, delta-, lentiretroviruses) and class III (spumaretroviruses). Some ERVs have counterparts among the known infectious retroviruses, while others represent paleovirological relics of extinct or undiscovered retroviruses. RESULTS: Here we identify an intact ERV in the Anuran amphibian, Xenopus tropicalis. XtERV-S has open reading frames (ORFs) for gag, pol (polymerase) and env (envelope) genes, with a small additional ORF in pol and a serine tRNA primer binding site. It has unusual features and domain relationships to known retroviruses. Analyses based on phylogeny and functional motifs establish that XtERV-S gag and pol genes are related to the ancient env-less class III ERV-L family but the surface subunit of env is unrelated to known retroviruses while its transmembrane subunit is class I-like. LTR constructs show transcriptional activity, and XtERV-S transcripts are detected in embryos after the maternal to zygotic mid-blastula transition and before the late tailbud stage. Tagged Gag protein shows typical subcellular localization. The presence of ORFs in all three protein-coding regions along with identical 5 and 3 LTRs (long terminal repeats) indicate this is a very recent germline acquisition. There are older, full-length, nonorthologous, defective copies in Xenopus laevis and the distantly related African bullfrog, Pyxicephalus adspersus. Additional older, internally deleted copies in X. tropicalis carry a 300 bp LTR substitution. CONCLUSIONS: XtERV-S represents a genera-spanning member of the largely env-less class III ERV that has ancient and modern copies in Anurans. This provirus has an env ORF with a surface subunit unrelated to known retroviruses and a transmembrane subunit related to class I gammaretroviruses in sequence and organization, and is expressed in early embryogenesis. Additional XtERV-S-related but defective copies are present in X. tropicalis and other African frog taxa. XtERV-S is an unusual class III ERV variant, and it may represent an important transitional retroviral form that has been spreading in African frogs for tens of millions of years.

A primary causative agent for typical HFMD outbreaks, enterovirus 71 (EV71), has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in S phase for own replication; however, it is not clear whether coxsackievirus (CVA6), the main agent for atypical HFMD, also regulates the host cell cycle. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that CVA6 infection arrests the host cell cycle in G0/G1-phase. Furthermore, synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase or G2/M phase, promotes viral production. To investigate the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by CVA6 infection, we analyzed cell cycle progression after cell cycle synchronization at G0/G1 or G2/M. Our results demonstrate that CVA6 infection promotes G0/G1 phase entry from G2/M phase, and inhibits G0/G1 exit into S phase. In line with its role to arrest cells in G0/G1 phase, the expression of cyclinD1, CDK4, cyclinE1, CDK2, cyclinB1, CDK1, P53, P21, and P16 is regulated by CVA6. Finally, the non-structural proteins of CVA6, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D and protease 3C , are demonstrated to be responsible for the G0/G1-phase arrest.

An overview of the existing models of the processes of the epidemic development and methods for solving direct and inverse problems of its analysis is given. A model for the development of the COVID-19 epidemic via a transport network of nine Russian cities is proposed: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. The cities are selected both by geographic location and by the number of population. The model consists of twenty seven differential equations. An algorithm for reverse analysis of the epidemic model has been developed. The initial data for solving the problem were the data on the population, the intensity of process transitions from one state to another, as well as data on the infection rate of the population at given time moments. The paper also provides the results of a detailed analysis of the solution approaches to modeling the development of epidemics by type of model (basic SEIR model, SIRD model, adaptive behavioral model, modified SEIR models), and by country (in Poland, France, Spain, Greece and others) and an overview of the applications that can be solved using epidemic spread modeling. Additional environmental parameters that affect the modeling of the spread of epidemics and can be taken into account to improve the accuracy of the results are considered. Based on the results of the modeling, the most likely source cities of the epidemic beginning in Russia, as well as the moment of its beginning, have been identified.

Since it is known that antibodies wane with time and new immune-evasive variants are emerging, we aimed to assess the dynamics of anti-Spike antibodies in an African adult population with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and to determine the effect of subsequent COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Using a prospective cohort design, we recruited adults with prior laboratory-confirmed mild/moderate COVID-19 in Blantyre, Malawi, and followed them up for 270 days (n = 52). A subset of whom subsequently received a single dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx nCov-19) (n = 12). We measured the serum concentrations of anti-Spike and receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies using a Luminex-based assay. Anti-RBD antibody cross-reactivity across SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) was measured using a haemagglutination test. A pseudovirus neutralisation assay was used to measure neutralisation titres across VOCs. Ordinary or repeated measures one-way ANOVA was used to compare log10 transformed data, with p value adjusted for multiple comparison using ?dk's or Holm-?dk's test. RESULTS: We show that neutralising antibodies wane within 6 months post mild/moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection (30C60 days vs. 210C270 days; Log ID(50) 6.8 vs. 5.3, p = 0.0093). High levels of binding anti-Spike or anti-RBD antibodies in convalescent serum were associated with potent neutralisation activity against the homologous infecting strain (p < 0.0001). A single dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine following mild/moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a 2 to 3-fold increase in anti-Spike and -RBD IgG levels 30 days post-vaccination (both, p < 0.0001). The anti-RBD IgG antibodies from these vaccinated individuals were broadly cross-reactive against multiple VOCs and had neutralisation potency against original D614G, beta, and delta variants. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is an effective booster for waning cross-variant antibody immunity after initial priming with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potency of hybrid immunity and its potential to maximise the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines needs to be taken into consideration when formulating vaccination policies in sub-Saharan Africa, where there is still limited access to vaccine doses.","output":"AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine induces robust broadly cross-reactive antibody responses in Malawian adults previously infected with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to produce significant emotional consequences at the individual, community, societal, and global levels.

The city of Ningbo decided to use this opportunity to develop a systematic procedure, using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), to identify which allotments within the municipal area have the greatest potential of delivering green buildings, ensuring the set targets are fair and deliverable. This paper explains in detail the use of FAHP in the production of the Specific Plans for Green Buildings for the city of Ningbo in the Zhejiang Province of China. This innovative multi-faceted method incorporates the level of development in each of the 3213 land allotments in the municipal area, assessing each one for critical aspects such as environmental potential, local economic development land-use and land prices in order to determine an individual roadmap for the ratio of green buildings to be built in each region within the city. This method incorporates a scientific process, in which Pairwise Comparison Analysis was conducted for the selected criteria and aspects to determine the weighting factors and scores in each case. This allowed planners to rank all allotments in the municipal area in terms of their potential to provide green buildings, and thus make the setting of targets to provide these accordingly. This approach breaks away from the traditional method which relies on simple estimation, which is often unjustified. Over the two years since this method was introduced, the effects had been positive, within all the allotments abiding to the set targets. Other cities and regions in China, such as the provinces of Liaoning and Hebei, have also adopted this process. The Specific Plans for Green Buildings in Ningbo also include the adoption rate of prefabricated buildings and the mandatory date for when by which new residential buildings should be fully-furnished before they are sold (this is not currently the case in most residential buildings in China).

Stronger community interventions (e.g. remote work, social distancing) decreased the risk of within-school transmission across all measures studied, with the influence of community transmission minimized as the effectiveness of the within-school measures increased.","output":"School closures reduced social mixing of children during COVID-19 with implications for transmission risk and school reopening policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proceeding from the insights about crisis as a metaphor and particular kind of cultural narrative delineated in the introduction to this special issue, this essay examines the competing narratives that have emerged in the wake of the crises generated by the Coronavirus pandemic and the Covid-19 illness It argues that crisis narratives in general and the particular stories that have been disseminated to report on and explain the ongoing Corona crisis always consist of both a diagnosis of the present state of affairs in a society and an attempt to project scenarios of possible futures The first section introduces the ongoing battle between competing narratives and the concomitant question of whether the Coronavirus pandemic qualifies as a 'Black Swan' (sensu Nassim Nicholas Taleb), i e the kind of highly improbable event that causes massive consequences Taking its cue from the question \\"Crisis compared to what?\\" posed by the anthropologist Janet Roitman, section 2 explores the relation between crisis narratives, the diagnoses of the present that they entail, and the underlying norms and values of such judgments about crises Section 3 then examines the implications of the most salient competing narratives that have been disseminated about the Coronavirus pandemic and the Covid-19 crises In section 4, we make an attempt to clarify what kind of crisis we are currently witnessing, asking whether the latter can be understood as a catalyst of a cluster or series of different crises, as a 'deep crisis' with various dimensions and layers, and as a 'patchwork pandemic' In section 5 we turn our attention to the contagious nature of narratives in general and competing stories surrounding the Coronavirus pandemic in particular, arguing that they constitute more than just an 'infodemic' in that they amount to nothing less than an epistemological and normative crisis The essay concludes by exploring the underlying big questions mat crisis narratives of the pandemic as critiques of non-sustainable forms of life raise and that the scenarios of possible futures they project inevitably entail, i e how do we want to live and how do we want to live together?

The NTS works closely with the Dutch hospitals, two tissue banks and a procurement organization. Potential tissue donors are reported to the NTS 24/7. After consulting the Donor Register and relatives give consent for donation, donors are subject to a thorough medical evaluation. If no medical contraindication is mentioned, the donor is approved for tissue donation. Each year, tissues of an average of 1918 donors (112.1 donors Per Million Population) are procured. After procurement of tissues, donor blood and tissues are tested on virology and quality respectively. Based on the test results and the assessment of potential disease transmission, tissues can either be released for transplantation or discarded. In conclusion, the Netherlands has developed a uniform, nationwide approach for safe and efficient post mortem tissue donation in which the NTS plays a central role. In the past 5 years, tissues from a considerable number of donors are procured. The NTS will continue to work together with their partners, by stimulating donor recognition, registration of the donor will, relatives' informed consent and by extending donor selection criteria, for an even more efficient way to help patients on the waiting list for a transplantation.","output":"Post mortem tissue donation in the Netherlands: a nationwide approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonoses refers to the infectious diseases and infestations that are transmissible directly from an animal host to humans.

Such platforms also influence people's health behavior in the way they communicate about personal health, treatment, or physicians. Individuals' ability to find and apply online health information on specific health problems can be measured using a valid and reliable instrument, the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric aspects of the Polish version of this instrument (eHEALS-Pl) among social media users, which has not been explored so far. We examined the translated version of the eHEALS in a representative sample of Polish social media users (n = 1527). CAWI (computer-assisted web interviews) was a method to collect data. The reliability of the eHEALS-Pl was measured by calculating the Cronbach alpha coefficients and analyzing the principal components. Exploratory factor analysis and hypothesis testing was used to assess the construct validity of the instrument. The internal consistency of the eHEALS-Pl was sufficient: Cronbach alpha = 0.84. The item-to-total correlations ranged from r = 0.514 to 0.666. EFA revealed a single structure explaining 47.42% of the variance, with high factor loadings of the item ranging from 0.623 to 0.769. Hypothesis testing also supported the validity of eHEALS-Pl. The eHEALS-Pl evaluation supported by social media users reviled its equivalence to the original instrument developed by Norman and Skinner in 2006 and it can be used to measure e-health literacy.

The main objective was to determine pre-/intraoperative risk factors for anastomotic leak after elective right colon resection for cancer. Secondary objectives were to determine risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality. METHODS Fifty-two hospitals participated in this prospective, observational study (September 2011-September 2012), including 1102 patients that underwent elective right colectomy. Forty-two pre-/intraoperative variables, related to patient, tumor, surgical procedure, and hospital, were analyzed as potential independent risk factors for anastomotic leak and postoperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Anastomotic leak was diagnosed in 93 patients (8.4 %), and 72 (6.5 %) of them needed radiological or surgical intervention. Morbidity, mortality, and wound infection rates were 29.0, 2.6, and 13.4 %, respectively. Preoperative serum protein concentration was the only independent risk factor for anastomotic leak (p < 0.0001, OR 0.6 per g/dL). When considering only clinically relevant anastomotic leaks, stapled technique (p = 0.03, OR 2.1) and preoperative serum protein concentration (p = 0.004, OR 0.6 g/dL) were identified as the only two independent risk factors. Age and preoperative serum albumin concentration resulted to be risk factors for postoperative mortality. Male gender, pulmonary or hepatic disease, and open surgical approach were identified as risk factors for postoperative morbidity, while male gender, obesity, intraoperative complication, and end-to-end anastomosis were risk factors for wound infection. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative nutritional status and the stapled anastomotic technique were the only independent risk factors for clinically relevant anastomotic leak after elective right colectomy for cancer.

Although there is a vast literature regarding the acoustic characterization of such materials in terms of attenuation or propagation velocity, there is limited data regarding the quantification of the scattering coefficient. Herein stimulated the utilisation of four agar-based phantoms featuring different sizes of scattering agar-structures on one of their surfaces so as to provide experimental evaluation of the magnitude of scattering. METHODS: The agar-based phantoms were developed with 6% w/v agar and 4% w/v silica and featured scatterers of sizes of 0-1 mm. The acoustic properties of propagation speed, impedance, insertion loss and attenuation were evaluated utilising the pulse-echo and through-transmission techniques. Scattering was deduced from the data. RESULTS: The propagation speed measured at 2.7 MHz was in the range of 1531.23-1542.97 m/s. Respectively the attenuation as measured at 1.1 MHz was in the range of 1.216-1.546 dB/cm increasing with increased scatterer size. Respectively the scattering coefficient was in the range of 0.078-0.324 dB/cm. Moreover, the scattering coefficient was linearly dependent on frequency in the range of 0.8-2.1 MHz indicating a 6-23% effect of the total attenuation.

Reductions in stroke admissions have been reported, despite many expecting an increase due to the pro-thrombotic nature of 2019 novel coronavirus. Aims: To assess the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown on stroke admissions and transient ischaemic attack referrals at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, and additionally on patient behaviours affecting modifiable risk factors or perspectives related to accessing healthcare. Methods: A single-centre retrospective data analysis was carried out on a lockdown cohort of suspected stroke patients admitted between 11 March to 26 May 2020 and a pre-lockdown cohort admitted in 2019. Differences in weekly admissions, weekly referrals, onset-to-presentation time and weekly thrombolysis cases were examined. Further analysis interrogated these cohorts separated by Bamford classification and stroke mimics (such as seizure/hemiplegic migraine/functional neurology). A binary-format questionnaire was separately administered to admitted patients from 15 April to 5 June 2020. Results: Significant reductions in weekly posterior circulation infarct (?43%, p = 0.017) and stroke-mimic (?47%, p < 0.001) admissions and weekly referrals diagnosed as non-transient ischaemic attack (?55%, p = 0.002) were observed in the lockdown cohort, with no differences in onset-to-presentation time.

Unlike typical respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 frequently causes systemic infection by breaking the boundaries of the respiratory systems. The development of animal models recapitulating the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is of utmost importance not only for the development of vaccines and antivirals but also for understanding the pathogenesis. However, there has not been developed an animal model for systemic infection of SARS-CoV-2 representing most aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 with systemic symptoms. Here we report that a hamster strain of Phodopus roborovskii SH101, a laboratory inbred hamster strain of P. roborovskii, displayed most symptoms of systemic infection upon SARS-CoV-2 infection as in the case of the human counterpart, unlike current COVID-19 animal models. P. roborovskii SH101 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2 represented most clinical symptoms of COVID-19 such as snuffling, dyspnea, cough, labored breathing, hunched posture, progressive weight loss, and ruffled fur, in addition to high fever following shaking chills. Histological examinations also revealed a serious right-predominated pneumonia as well as slight organ damages in the brain and liver, manifesting systemic COVID-19 cases. Considering the merit of a small animal as well as its clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human, this hamster model seems to provide an ideal tool to investigate COVID-19. Author summary Although the current animal models supported SARS-CoV-2 replication and displayed varying degrees of illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the infections of SARS-CoV-2 were mainly limited to the respiratory systems of these animals, including hACE2 transgenic mice, hamsters, ferrets, fruit bats, guinea pigs, African green monkey, Rhesus macaques, and Cynomolgus macaques. While these animal models can be a modest model for the respiratory infection, there is a clear limit for use them in the study of COVID-19 that also displays multiple systemic symptoms. Therefore, the development of an animal model recapitulating COVID-19-specific symptoms such as the right-predominated pneumonia would be the utmost need to overcome the imminent threat posed by COVID-19. We identified a very interesting hamster strain, Phodopus roborovskii SH101, which mimics almost all aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike the current animal models, SARS-CoV-2-infected P. roborovskii SH101 not only displayed the symptoms of respiratory infection but also clinical manifestations specific to human COVID-19 such as high fever following shaking chills, serious right-predominated pneumonia, and minor organ damages in the brain and liver.","output":"Phodopus roborovskii SH101 as a systemic infection model of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of networks has been accelerated by social adaptations to the Covid-19 pandemic, such as remote work, online shopping, and online meetings.

We sought to provide descriptive statistics for stroke and ACS from a sample of hospitals throughout the United States, comparing data from March 2020 to similar months pre-COVID. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 65 academic and community hospitals in the Vizient Clinical Data Base. The primary outcome is monthly count of stroke and ACS, and acute procedures for both, from February and March in 2020 compared to the same months in 2018 and 2019. Results are aggregated for all hospitals and reported by Census Region. Results We identified 51,246 strokes (42,780 ischemic, 8,466 hemorrhagic), 1,043 mechanical thrombectomies (MT), 836 tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administrations, 36,551 ACS, and 3,925 percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for ACS. In February 2020, relative to February 2018 and 2019, hospitalizations with any discharge diagnosis of stroke and ACS increased by 9.8% and 12.1%, respectively, while in March 2020 they decreased 18.5% and 7.5%, relative to March 2018 and 2019.

We investigated these virological attributes of the Omicron variant in comparison with those of the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in the golden Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron-infected hamsters developed significantly less body weight losses, clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine/chemokine dysregulation, and tissue damages than Delta-infected hamsters. The Omicron and Delta variant were both highly transmissible (100% vs 100%) via contact transmission. Importantly, the Omicron variant consistently demonstrated about 10-20% higher transmissibility than the already-highly transmissible Delta variant in repeated non-contact transmission studies (overall: 30/36 vs 24/36, 83.3% vs 66.7%).

In this paper, we use agent-based simulations of a network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to investigate two network intervention strategies for mitigating the spread of transmission while maintaining economic activities. In the simulations, we assume that people engage in group activities in multiple sectors (e.g., going to work, going to a local grocery store), where they interact with others in the same group and potentially become infected. In the first strategy, each group is divided into two subgroups (e.g., a group of customers can only go to the grocery store in the morning, while another separate group of customers can only go in the afternoon). In the second strategy, we balance the number of group members across different groups within the same sector (e.g., every grocery store has the same number of customers). The simulation results show that the dividing groups strategy substantially reduces transmission, and the joint implementation of the two strategies could effectively bring the spread of transmission under control (i.e., effective reproduction number &#8776; 1.0).","output":"Network interventions for managing the COVID-19 pandemic and sustaining economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a severe global epidemic in human history. Even though there are particular medications and vaccines to curb the epidemic, tracing and isolating the infection source is the best option to slow the virus spread and reduce infection and death rates. There are three disadvantages to the existing contact tracing system: 1. User data is stored in a centralized database that could be stolen and tampered with, 2. User's confidential personal identity may be revealed to a third party or organization, 3. Existing contact tracing systems only focus on information sharing from one dimension, such as location-based tracing, which significantly limits the effectiveness of such systems. We propose a global COVID-19 information sharing and risk notification system that utilizes the Blockchain, Smart Contract, and Bluetooth. To protect user privacy, we design a novel Blockchain-based platform that can share consistent and non-tampered contact tracing information from multiple dimensions, such as location-based for indirect contact and Bluetooth-based for direct contact. Hierarchical smart contract architecture is also designed to achieve global agreements from users about how to process and utilize user data, thereby enhancing the data usage transparency. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism to protect user identity privacy from multiple aspects. More importantly, our system can notify the users about the exposure risk via smart contracts.

However, several ICT solutions lack evidence-based content. Therefore, there is a need to identify important features that have the potential to efficiently and consistently support the PA of adolescents using ICT solutions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to create evidence-based models of requirements for ICT solutions supporting PA by combining scientific evidence from literature and health experts. In addition, we test the suitability of agent-oriented goal models in this type of modeling process. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was conducted to identify evidence-based functional, quality, and emotional goals that have previously been proven to be relevant in supporting PAs among youth using ICT solutions. The identified goals were presented in the form of goal models. These models were used to collaborate with health experts to receive their input on the topic and suggestions for improvement. The initial goal models were improved based on the feedback from the experts. RESULTS: The results indicated that agent-oriented goal modeling is a suitable method for merging information from the literature and experts. One strength of agent-oriented goal models is that they present emotional requirements together with quality and functional requirements. Another strength is the possibility of presenting results from a literature review in a systematic manner and using them thereafter in the communication process with stakeholders. Agent-oriented goal models that were created were easy to understand for health experts without previous experience in requirements engineering, which facilitates and supports collaboration with nontechnical stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed agent-oriented goal models effectively merged information from scientific literature and experts in the field and presented early functional, quality, and emotional requirements in a holistic and coherent manner. We believe that the created models have high potential to help requirements engineers and developers to provide more efficient ICT solutions that support PA among adolescents in the future.","output":"Agent-Oriented Goal Models in Developing Information Systems Supporting Physical Activity Among Adolescents: Literature Review and Expert Interviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The BCG vaccine is known to impart nonspecific immunological benefits alongside conferring protection to tuberculosis in endemic regions.

Although coagulation dys-function was reported to affect the severity of COVID-19, the association between pregnancy, which is usually accompanied by changes in coagulation function, and the worsening of COVID-19 is unknown. We present a case of a 30-year-old woman in the 36(th) week of pregnancy who was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and required postpartum extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old, 36-weeks pregnant woman presented to our hospital and was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia soon after she had undergone a cesarean section. Her respiratory failure could not be managed by conventional therapeutic approaches. Therefore, ECMO was administered on day 7. Controlling coagulation function to maintain ECMO therapy was challenging. Nafamostat mesylate and cryoprecipitate were administered to treat the hypercoagulative status and severe hypofibrinogenemia, respectively. Since coagulopathy and her respiratory state improved, the ECMO therapy was terminated on day 15. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a pregnant woman urgently treated with ECMO in the post-partum period. Thus, this case highlights the importance of close monitoring and appropriate medical care for pregnant women with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia in a 30-Year-Old Woman in the 36(th) Week of Pregnancy Treated with Postpartum Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Of the 47 applications currently available, 24 contain Google and Facebook tracking, 11 have no privacy policy, 25 do not disclose the length of time that they hold the data for, and 28 have no publicly disclosed anonymity measures 1 (p1782) This essay is likely to generate debate about the nature of signals intelligence and the overall utility of contact-tracing apps \\"3 It can be difficult to see the implications of change while it is occurring, but we all experience the ubiquity of data collection through stores, apps, physical activity monitors (e g , Fitbit Trackers), our cars, and even our refrigerators The crisis could usher in totalitarianism or solidarity;medical martial law or a holistic renaissance;greater fear of the microbial world, or greater resiliency in participation in it;permanent norms of social distancing, or a renewed desire to come together 6 Bernard et al raise interesting issues that implicitly suggest that ignoring the surveillance capabilities of those apps and similar technology may lead us to the darker version of these choices","output":"Contact-Tracing Apps: Time to Confront Broader Societal Change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ecuador, despite having taken aggressive and early measures to stop the progression of the pandemic (COVID-19), ended up becoming an epicenter of the pandemic in Latin America, and with the collapse of its health care system.

The patients included a 72-year-old male, an 82-year-old female, and a 56-year-old male. They typically presented with fever, dyspnea, loss of taste and smell, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Oxygen saturation during the initial evaluation ranged from 80-89%. Laboratory results reported lymphopenia and neutrophilia, with leukocytosis in two patients. Inflammatory markers were also elevated for all three patients. CT scan findings showed bilateral ground-glass pulmonary opacities.

In reply, a philosophical account is offered that points at three related but distinct criteria that (taken together) make the distinction between cultural and biological inheritance not only precise but also justify it as real, i.e. as ontologically adequate. These three criteria are (i) the autonomy of cultural change, (ii) the near-decomposability of culture and (iii) differences in temporal order between cultural and biological inheritance.

Currently, no standard exists for optimal timing or a pharmacological agent for VTE prophylaxis (pharmacological thromboprophylaxis - PTP) in patients with TBI. PTP is often delayed out of fear of causing extension of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The purpose of this study was to report the frequency of VTE and ICH progression after initiation of PTP with a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin in patients with moderate to severe TBI, and to identify risk factors associated with development of VTE. METHODS In this single-center retrospective study, patients with moderate to severe TBI admitted to the ICU of a Swiss Level I Trauma Center over a three-year period were analyzed. RESULTS In 23 (13%) of the 177 patients included in the study a VTE episode occurred during the hospital stay. ICH progression after initiation of PTP occurred in 7 (4%) patients. In a multivariable logistic regression model, only the timing of initiation of PTP was identified as an independent predictor of VTE. CONCLUSIONS In this study population, the risk of developing VTE increased with the delay of initiation of a pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, while ICH progression after initiation of PTP was a rare event.","output":"Delayed prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: a retrospective analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A universal primer set was developed that amplifies a region covering hypervariable region (HVR) 1 and HVR 2 in the S1 gene of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).

The results of statistical and multiple criteria analyses on the success of 169 countries and on COVID-19 cumulative cases and excess deaths show that the prosperity of a country relates directly to the consequences due to the pandemic. The topic of this article is the Country Success and COVID-19 (CSC) Map of the World. As a countrys success grows, this map shows how cumulative cases of COVID-19 increase; at the same time, excess deaths decrease. The indicators in the system of criteria regarding country success and sustainability are interrelated. Conditional country successes remain quite similar, despite changes to the numbers of countries and their indicators. Likewise, the seven clusters of countries under consideration group together independently of which system of indicators had been applied for their analysis. The 2020 InglehartCWelzel Cultural Map of the World, which is grounded on surveys, and the CSC Map, which is grounded on statistical indicators, have axes that correlate with one another significantly. The CSC Map Model explains over 63% of the dispersions pertinent to COVID-19 cumulative cases, over 52% of COVID-19 excess deaths, and over 95% of country success variables. The layout of the clusters on the CSC Map changes little over time. Upon performance of the correlation analysis, it was established that strong and statistically significant relationships exist between 169 countries success and sustainability linked with their current air quality score (r=.602, p<0.01) and the environmental performance index (EPI) score (r=.931, p<0.01). The results obtained show that when a countrys EPI score and current air quality improve by 1%, excess deaths decrease, respectively, by 2.33 and 1.55%.

In clinical practice, the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 can be challenging during the flu season, entailing serious consequences such as delays in appropriate control measures against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Another problem is posed by co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus (IV), which significantly contributes to the severity of the COVID-19 disease. This study was aimed to explore the cross-impact of co-administration of Russian influenza and COVID-19 vaccines on development of specific immunity in laboratory animals. Materials and methods. The study was conducted on BALB/c mice. The animals were inoculated intramuscularly with the vaccine for COVID-19 prevention (CoviVac) and the vaccine for influenza prevention (Flu-M). The sera from the immunized animals were examined separately. Three IV strains were used in the hemagglutination inhibition assay. Antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The neutralization test was performed to detect virus neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and IV. Results. Relatively high titers of specific Abs were found in the groups of animals inoculated with one vaccine and with two vaccines concurrently. In the groups of animals inoculated with CoviVac and with two vaccines concurrently, both in the ELISA test and in the neutralization test, the average titers of specific Abs against SARSCoV-2 did not demonstrate any statistical difference. The group of animals inoculated concurrently with two vaccines demonstrated statistically higher titers of Abs against IV after the second immunization compared to the group of animals inoculated with Flu-M. Discussion. The study has shown that post-vaccination immunity both to IV and to SARS-CoV-2 develops after co-vaccination with two vaccines. The observed enhanced post-vaccination immune response to IV in the coimmunized laboratory animals needs further research. Conclusion. The performed studies suggest the possibility of co-administration of two vaccines to prevent influenza and COVID-19. ? 2021, Central Research Institute for Epidemiology.

Although some telepsychiatry guidelines and best practices have been developed, the literature has not described how psychiatrists make decisions about offering different care modalities. The authors explored how psychiatrists decide whether telemedicine is appropriate for a given patient. METHODS From June 25 to August 4, 2021, the authors conducted semistructured interviews with 20 outpatient psychiatrists. The authors used a critical incident technique and clinical vignettes to identify conscious and unconscious factors that influence psychiatrists' decision to offer telemedicine. Using inductive thematic analysis, the authors analyzed interview data. RESULTS Psychiatrists perceived that most patients are good candidates for telemedicine visits in the context of hybrid care models. Patient preference and situational factors, such as access to private spaces, rather than any particular diagnosis or patient demographic characteristic, drove telemedicine versus in-person care. Psychiatrists described numerous factors affecting their decision to offer telemedicine, and they were driven to try telemedicine and adjust as needed to \\"meet patients where they are\\" and to improve engagement in care. Psychiatrists reported using telemedicine as a bargaining chip in negotiations with patients, leveraging the offer of telemedicine to improve treatment attendance and adherence. CONCLUSIONS This detailed assessment of how psychiatrists choose different care modalities can inform clinical practice guidelines and reimbursement policies that often mandate in-person visits.

As a result of high mortality rate among the severe COVID-19 patients, the early detection of the disease stage and early effective interventions are very important in reducing mortality. Hence, it is important to differentiate severe and non-severe cases from each other. To date, there are no proven diagnostic or prognostic parameters that can be used in this manner. Due to the expensive and not easily accessible tests that are performed for COVID-19, researchers are investigating some parameters that can be easily used. In some recent studies, hematological parameters have been evaluated to see if they can be used as predictive parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, almost all hematological parameters were used, including the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio, monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to platelet ratio, plateletcrit, and D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio (DFR), neutrophil/lymphocyte/platelet scoring system, and systemic immune-inflammation index. A total of 750 patients, who were admitted to Ankara City Hospital due to COVID-19, were evaluated in this study. The patients were classified into 2 groups according to their diagnosis (confirmed or probable) and into 2 groups according to the stage of the disease (non-severe or severe). RESULTS: The values of the combinations of inflammatory markers and other hematological parameters in all of the patients with severe COVID-19 were calculated, and the predicted values of these parameters were compared. According to results of the study, nearly all of the hematological parameters could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers for subsequent analysis, because the area under the curve (AUC) was higher than 0.50, especially for the DFR and NLR, which had the highest AUC among the parameters.

A detailed time series analysis along with linear regression was used to state a possible correlation among some climates factor variability (temperature and relative humidity) and daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19. The results showed a weak correlation between daily new cases of COVID-19 and meteorological factors throughout the selected regions. In addition, we concluded that the COVID-19 could fit to high or low values of temperature and relative humidity, and other factors not climates could affect the spreading of the virus like demography and human contact. So, after the discovery of the vaccine and before vaccination of 70% of the worlds population, living with the virus has become an inevitable reality, and it is mandatory to apply the sanitary procedures to slow down the COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Effects of temperature and relative humidity on the COVID-19 pandemic in different climates: a study across some regions in Algeria (North Africa)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Syria, medical students were placed on call to provide sufficient human resources during COVID-19 pandemic.

To date only a few compounds have been approved for prophylactic and none for therapeutic use. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) has proven its efficacy in vitro against C. parvum and is approved by FDA for the treatment of human cryptosporidiosis. In a first experimental study, 3 uninfected calves were treated with NTZ and pharmacokinetics was followed through blood samples. Serum samples of uninfected treated calves contained both NTZ metabolites (tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide) and oral administration at 12 h intervals was considered as optimal. Three groups of three calves (1C3 days old) were then each inoculated with 1  10(7) oocysts of C. parvum (cattle genotype): the prophylactic group received 15 mg/kg body weight NTZ twice daily orally in milk from 1 day before to 8 days postinoculation (dpi). The therapeutic group received the same dosage of NTZ for 10 days from the appearance of diarrhoea (between 1 and 5 dpi). The control group was left untreated. All calves were monitored daily from day ?1 to 28 dpi and faecal samples were collected for evaluation of consistency and for determination of oocyst numbers per gram (OPG) of faeces. Diarrhoea was observed in all calves within the first week. Neither prophylactic nor therapeutic use of NTZ improved the clinical appearance and calves of the therapeutic showed a longer diarrheic episode (p < 0.05) with strong altered faecal consistence compared to the untreated control group. The number of days with oocyst excretion did not differ significantly between the groups. In 5 out of 6 infected and treated calves oocyst excretion stopped only after discontinuation of treatment. In the prophylactic and in the control group mean values of the sum of the daily OPG per calf (8.5  10(6) and 8.0  10(6), respectively) and of the mean daily number of OPG (0.3  10(6) and 0.3  10(6), respectively) were similar, while the therapeutic group showed significantly lower values (1.9  10(6) and 0.06  10(6), respectively, p < 0.05). However oocyst determinations in this group may have been altered by the severe diarrhoea, diluting oocyst densities in the analysed faecal samples. In conclusion, these preliminary results about the first prophylactic and therapeutic use of NTZ in calves did not show the expected positive effect on the course of the Cryptosporidium-infection, neither on reducing the clinical severity, nor on oocyst excretion.","output":"Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of nitazoxanide against Cryptosporidium parvum in experimentally challenged neonatal calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the global coronavirus pandemic (COVID\\\\19) spreads across the world, new clinical challenges emerge in the hospital landscape.

DESIGN: An anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire survey. SETTING: A large, mid-western academic general surgery residency program. PARTICIPANTS: 47 PDs of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited General Surgery residency programs. RESULTS: During the virtual-only interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic-era 2020-21 General Surgery residency application cycle, PDs shifted their focus to virtual outreach efforts and bolstered social media presences to recruit strong applicants. Also, our study found statistically significant changes to the increased value of letters of recommendation (LORs) for the PDs when assessing an applicant's commitment to surgery. These findings suggest that the necessity of adapting to the virtual-only interview format significantly altered how the PDs recruited and evaluated applicants for the General Surgery residency match. CONCLUSIONS: A complete replacement of the in-person interviews with virtual-only interviews may be challenging unless buy-in exists from key stakeholders in the surgical community. Our study highlights the PDs hesitation in assessing candidates commitment to surgery from virtual interviews alone. Incorporating virtual interviews as a part of the screening process for applicants may serve as an avenue to maximize the benefits of the virtual interview format.

Several drug interventions targeting multiple stages of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 can significantly reduce induced infection and thus mortality. In this study, we first develop SIV model at within-host level by incorporating the intercellular time delay and analyzing the stability of equilibrium points. The model dynamics admits a disease-free equilibrium and an infected equilibrium with their stability based on the value of the basic reproduction number R0. We then formulate an optimal control problem with antiviral drugs and second-line drugs as control measures and study their roles in reducing the number of infected cells and viral load. The comparative study conducted in the optimal control problem suggests that if the first-line antiviral drugs show adverse effects, considering these drugs in reduced amounts along with the second-line drugs would be very effective in reducing the number of infected cells and viral load in a COVID-19 infected patient. Later, we formulate a time-optimal control problem with the goal of driving the system from any initial state to the desired infection-free equilibrium state in finite minimal time. Using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, it is shown that the optimal control strategy is of the bang-bang type, with the possibility of switching between two extreme values of the optimal controls. Numerically, it is shown that the desired infection-free state is achieved in a shorter time when the higher values of the optimal controls.

The knowledge about COVID-19 is accumulating rapidly. An important distinction is the prevalence of exposure versus clinical infectivity, which determine the risk versus benefit of modifying potentially highly curative therapies in leukemia. At present, the rate of clinical infection is <1C2% worldwide. With a mortality rate of 1C5% in CO-VID-19 patients in the general population and potentially of >30% in patients with cancer, careful consideration should be given to the risk of COVID-19 in leukemia. Instead of reducing patient access to specialized cancer centers and modifying therapies to ones with unproven curative benefit, there is more rationale for less intensive, yet effective therapies that may require fewer clinic visits or hospitalizations.

METHODS: We examined the disease burden of the 2009C10 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic relating to illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and mortality, compared to influenza seasons 2010 to 2019, in the United States, as compiled by the Centers for Disease Control. RESULTS: With regard to seasonal influenza, rates of illnesses and medical visits were highest in infants aged 0C4 years, followed by adults aged 50C64 years. Rates of hospitalizations and deaths evinced a starkly different pattern, both dominated by elderly adults aged 65 and over. Youths aged 0 to 17 years were especially adversely affected by the H1N1 pandemic relative to hospitalizations and mortality compared to seasonal influenza; but curiously the opposite pattern was observed in elderly adults (aged 65 and older). CONCLUSIONS: Determination of a baseline influenza mortality profile in the United States over the 2010C19 decade is not straightforward.

Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a new peak in infections. In this study, we wanted to quantify the relative contribution of mobility restrictions, and that of behavioral changes that occurred already before the lockdowns, on the reduction of transmission during lockdowns in Western countries in early 2020. METHODS: Incidence data of cases and deaths from the first wave of infections for 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada) were analyzed using epidemiological compartment models in a Bayesian framework. Mobility data was used to estimate the timing of changes associated with a lockdown, and was correlated with estimated reductions of Rt. RESULTS: Across all countries, the initial median estimate for Rt was 3.6 (95% IQR 2.4-5.2), and it was reduced to 0.78 (95% IQR 0.58-1.01) during lockdown. 48% (18-65%) of the reduction occurred already in the week before lockdown, with lockdown itself causing the remaining drop in transmission. A lower Rt during lockdown was independently associated with an increased time spent at home (0.21 per 10% more time, p < 0.007), and decreased mobility related to retail and recreation (0.07 per 10% less mobility, p < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In a Western population unaware of the risk, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly contagious with a reproduction number R0 > 5. Our results are consistent with evidence that recreational activities (including restaurant and bar visits) enable super-spreading events.

They also offer an effective solution in healthcare for bi-directional protection against air-borne diseases. Wearing and positioning the mask correctly is essential for its function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution for face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and positioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms can be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and other indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application scenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The inference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing sufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably low latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain on the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address these challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for correct facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is implemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations. Classification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling multi-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings. When deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is reduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an accuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset. To maintain equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures, skin-tones, hair types, and mask types, the algorithms are tested for their ability to generalize the relevant features over all subjects using the Grad-CAM approach.","output":"BinaryCoP: Binary Neural Network-based COVID-19 Face-Mask Wear and Positioning Predictor on Edge Devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To review published studies related to the association of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections with pregnancy, foetal, and neonatal outcomes during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in a systematic manner. METHODS: A comprehensive electronic search was done through PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019, to May 22, 2020, along with the reference list of all included studies. All cohort studies that reported on outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy were included. Qualitative assessment of included studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: Upon admission, most pregnant women underwent a low-dose radiation CT scan; the reports of which included unilateral/bilateral pneumonia in most patients. A marked lymphopenia was also noted in many patients with COVID-19. 513 titles were screened, and 22 studies were included, which identified 156 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 108 neonatal outcomes. The most common maternal/foetal complications included intrauterine/foetal distress (14%) and premature rupture of membranes (8%). The neonatal clinical manifestations of COVID-19 commonly included shortness of breath (6%), gastrointestinal symptoms (4%), and fever (3%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in pregnancy leads to increased risk in pregnancy complications such as preterm birth, PPROM, and may possibly lead to maternal death in rare cases. There is no evidence to support vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the unborn child.

RESULTS: Of the 1,168 patients treated with ECMO for severe ARDS (age 48  16 years, 76% male, SAPS II score 51  18) during the enrollment period, 353 (30%) and 177 (15%) underwent tracheostomy placement during or after ECMO, respectively. Severe complications were uncommon in both groups. Local bleeding within 24 h of tracheostomy was four times more frequent during ECMO (25 vs 7% after ECMO, p < 0.01). Cumulative sedative consumption decreased more rapidly after the procedure with sedative doses almost negligible 48C72 h later, when tracheostomy was performed after ECMO decannulation (p < 0.01). A significantly increased level of consciousness was observed within 72 h after tracheostomy in the after ECMO group, whereas it was unchanged in the during-ECMO group. CONCLUSION: In contrast to patients undergoing tracheostomy after ECMO decannulation, tracheostomy during ECMO was neither associated with a decrease in sedation and analgesia levels nor with an increase in the level of consciousness. This finding together with a higher risk of local bleeding in the days following the procedure reinforces the need for a case-by-case discussion on the balance between risks and benefits of tracheotomy when performed during ECMO.

Multiple sputum and throat swab specimens from 161 confirmed COVID-19 patients were tested with a commercial fluorescent RT-PCR kit targeting the ORF1ab and N regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome. The RNA level of a cellular housekeeping gene ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p30 (RPP30) in these specimens was also assessed by RT-PCR. Data for a total of 1052 samples were retrospectively re-analyzed and a strong association between positive results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and high level of RPP30 RNA in respiratory tract specimens was revealed. By using the ROC-AUC analysis, we identified Ct cutoff values for RPP30 RT-PCR which predicted false negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR with high sensitivity (95.03%C95.26%) and specificity (83.72%C98.55%) for respective combination of specimen type and amplification reaction. Using these Ct cutoff values, false negative results could be reliably identified.

Only a few public health agencies in Canada and the United States have publically reported detailed occupation information for non-health care worker COVID-19 cases. Objective We conducted a media surveillance analysis to identify new or emerging occupational groups at risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus ('COVID-19 exposure'). Methods We searched the Factiva database for media articles reporting COVID-19 workplace outbreaks (February 1-December 22, 2020). Job titles were coded to the 2016 National Occupational Classification (V1.3) and industries to the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (V3.0). Occupations with COVID-19 workplace transmission identified in media articles were compared and contrasted with the same occupation in the Vancouver School of Economics (VSE) COVID Risk Tool by risk rating (seven categories between very high to very low). Results We identified 1,111 unique COVID-19 workplace outbreaks in the media. After nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates, industrial butchers and meat cutters, poultry preparers and related workers had the most workplace outbreaks reported in the media (n=79) but were rated as medium risk occupations for COVID-19 transmission in the VSE COVID Risk Tool. Outbreaks were also reported in the media among material handlers (n=61) and general farm workers (n=28) but were rated medium-low risk and low risk, respectively. Outbreaks reported in the media among food and beverage services (n=72) and cashiers (n=60) were identified as high risk occupations in the VSE COVID Risk Tool. Conclusion Media surveillance can identify COVID-19 workplace outbreaks and indicate transmission risk. Our results point to key determinants of health that compound the risk of COVID-19 exposure in the workplace, and highlight the importance of collecting occupation data during a pandemic.","output":"A media surveillance analysis of COVID-19 workplace outbreaks in Canada and the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic is stretching the global supply situation for face masks and PPE beyond production capacity.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential for the acceptance of research-orientated apps (ROAs) in the German population. To this end, we identified distinctive attitudes toward pandemic apps and data sharing for research purposes among smartphone users in general and with a focus on differences in attitudes between app users and nonusers in particular. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, national, telephone-based survey of 1003 adults in Germany, of which 924 were useable for statistical analysis. The 17-item survey assessed current usage of pandemic apps, motivations for using or not using pandemic apps, trust in app distributors and attitudes toward data handling (data storage and transmission), willingness to share coded data with researchers using a pandemic app, social attitudes toward app use, and demographic and personal characteristics. RESULTS: A vast majority stated that they used a smartphone (778/924, 84.2%), but less than half of the smartphone users stated that they used a pandemic app (326/778, 41.9%). The study focused on the subsample of smartphone users. Interestingly, when asked about preferred organizations for data storage and app distribution, trust in governmental (federal or state government, regional health office), public-appointed (statutory health insurance), or government-funded organizations (research institutes) was much higher than in private organizations (private research institutions, clinics, health insurances, information technology [IT] companies). Having a university degree significantly (P<.001) increased the likelihood of using a pandemic app, while having a migration background significantly (P<.001) decreased it. The overwhelming majority (653/778, 83.9%) of smartphone users were willing to provide their app data for state-funded research. Regarding attitudes toward app usage, striking differences between users and nonusers were found. Almost all app users (317/327, 96.9%) stated they would be willing to share data, whereas only 74.3% (336/452) of nonusers supported data sharing via an app. Two-thirds (216/326, 66.3%) of app users fully or rather agreed with the statement that using a pandemic app is a social duty, whereas almost the same proportion of nonusers entirely or rather disagreed with that statement (273/451, 60.5%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a high potential for the adoption of ROAs among smartphone users in Germany as long as organizational providers engaged in development, operation, and distribution are state-funded or governmental institutions and transparency about data-using research institutions is provided.","output":"Attitudes Toward Mobile Apps for Pandemic Research Among Smartphone Users in Germany: National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is involved in DNA damage repair and cell death. However, the association between PARP's biological activities and the immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. The present study will explore whether combining a PARP inhibitor with anti-PD1 might improve the anti-HCC impact and explain how it works. Method: The PARP inhibitor olaparib was screened out of 867 drugs through Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) assay. The expression of PARP was verified through the TCGA and TISIDB databases. The impacts exerted by PARP inhibitor olaparib to HCC cells were assessed via wound healing, Transwell, and proliferation assay. In vivo, experiments were performed in a C57BL/6 mouse model to evaluate the function of PARP inhibitor olaparib combination with anti-PD1 in HCC and mice tumors were further detected by immunohistochemically staining. Result: Olaparib was selected as the research object on the basis of drug screening. The results of the TCGA and Human Protein Atlas databases revealed that PARP was significantly upregulated in carcinoma cell cluster of HCC tissues compared to normal tissues. Higher expression of PARP showed a poorer prognosis based on Kaplan-Meier Plotter. qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that olaparib could increase PD-L1 expression through inhibiting miR-513 in HCC cells. In vivo, experiment confirmed that the combination of olaparib and anti-PD1 could enhance the immunotherapy effect of HCC. Conclusion: The present study reveals that inhibition of PARP potentiates immune checkpoint therapy through the miR-513/PD-L1 pathway in HCC and the combination of PARP inhibitor olaparib and anti-PD1 is beneficial to HCC therapy.","output":"Inhibition of PARP Potentiates Immune Checkpoint Therapy through miR-513/PD-L1 Pathway in Hepatocellular Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract On December 31, 2019, Chinese authorities reported the first case of what would become known as COVID-19 to the World Health Organization (WHO), which declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern one month later.

This increases the production and release of inflammatory cytokines, promotes mitochondrial dynamics leading to heightened cell motility and disrupts 3D mammary acini architecture with aberrant cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis and EMT. Mechanistically, Integrin-Linked Kinase packaged in sEVHYP via HIF1 is sufficient to activate NFB in the normal mammary epithelium, in vivo.

All cases were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests. We used logistic regression models to identify demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory markers in classifying COVID-19 versus influenza, and COVID-19 versus dengue. The performance of each model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Shortness of breath was the strongest predictor in the models for differentiating between COVID-19 and influenza, followed by diarrhoea. Higher lymphocyte count was predictive of COVID-19 versus influenza and versus dengue. In the model for differentiating between COVID-19 and dengue, patients with cough and higher platelet count were at increased odds of COVID-19, while headache, joint pain, skin rash and vomiting/nausea were indicative of dengue. The cross-validated area under the ROC curve for all four models was above 0.85.

Pathological examination revealed 50% residual tumor cells after treatment, and the CT evaluation of the primary tumor showed a stable disease. The patient experienced a recurrence eight months after surgery. To identify immune correlates of the limited response to immunotherapy, we conducted genomic and transcriptional assays, multiplex immunoassay, and multiplex immunohistochemistry on the pre- and post-immunotherapy tumor, lymph node, and plasma samples. TP53 R181C, KRAS G12C and SMAD4 R361H were identified as driver mutations of the tumor.

However, the hemispheres do not work independent of each other but share information through the corpus callosum. The integration of information across the corpus callosum is dependent on its structural integrity and functionality. Several hormones, like estradiol and progesterone, can influence this function. Since earlier work has demonstrated that long-term changes in stress hormone levels are accompanied by changes in hemispheric asymmetries in several mental disorders, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether acute stress and the associated changes in stress hormone levels also affect information transfer across the corpus callosum. For this purpose, we collected EEG data from 51 participants while completing a lexical decision task and a Poffenberger paradigm twice, once after stress induction with the Trier Social Stress Test and once after a control-condition. While there were no differences in interhemispheric transfer between the stress and the non-stress condition in the Poffenberger paradigm, we observed shorter latencies to stimuli in the left visual field in the left hemisphere at the CP3-CP4 electrode pair after stress. These results suggest that the transfer of lexical material from the right to the left hemisphere was quicker under stress.

The impact of axillary complete pathologic response (pCR) is less clear. We evaluate the impact of NET on axillary downstaging and surgical management. METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), we identified all patients with node positive (N(+)), ER(+), HER(2?) BC undergoing NET and performed a systemic review of literature using PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: The literature review identified 1479 clinically N(+) patients in four studies, 148 of whom had axillary pCR (10.0%). In the two studies of patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), 7.8% (69/883) of clinically N(+) patients had axillary pCR. The NCDB query identified 4580 female patients with clinically N(+) ER(+) HER(2?) BC who underwent NET from 2010 to 2016 with mean age of 61.4 years. Patients who achieved a pCR were more likely to have N1 disease (p 0.008), moderately differentiated tumors (p 0.003), and ductal histology (p 0.04). There was no statistically significant difference in race, comorbidity score, education, income, hospital setting, or clinical tumor stage. Of the 4580 total patients, 663 (14.48%) had an axillary pCR (pN0) after NET, and 3917 (85.52%) remained pN+. CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients who underwent NET for N(+) disease had a higher axillary pCR than previously reported (10%) in smaller studies. Although NET is not a common treatment option for women with N(+) ER(+) HER(2?) BC, it may be a suitable option for axillary downstaging, which is currently underutilized.

We report a case series of patients who developed new or relapsing GN post vaccination. Method We evaluated baseline characteristics, vaccine type and clinical outcomes of 13 patients from our institution who had a new diagnosis or relapse of their GN post mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Results Of 13 patients, 8 patients were newly diagnosed GNs and 5 patients had relapse. Median age was 62 years (range 19-83 years). Autoimmune disease (38%) was the most prevalent underlying disease followed by cancer (23%). Majority of patients were white male. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) was the most common GN in our series (5 patients, 38%) followed by membranous nephropathy (MN) (3 patients, 23%). One patient with IgAN had evidence of IgA deposits prior to vaccination suggesting that the immune activation following vaccination triggered a flare of the disease. Our case series also included the first case report of tip-variant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, NELL-1 associated MN, and atypical anti-GBM nephritis. Seventy seven percent developed acute kidney injury with the majority being KDIGO stage 1 (67%). Outcome are favorable with 80% responding to therapy.

For several decades, investigators have sought a long-term, implantable intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor to assist in the diagnosis of shunt malfunction, but efforts have been impeded by device complexity, marked measurement drift, and limited instrumentation lifespan. In the current report, the authors introduce an entirely novel, simple, compressible gas design that addresses each of these problems. METHODS The device described herein, termed the \\"baric probe,\\" consists of a subdural fluid bladder and multichannel indicator that monitors the position of an air-fluid interface (AFI). A handheld ultrasound probe is used to interrogate the baric probe in vivo, permitting noninvasive ICP determination. To assess the function of device prototypes, ex vivo experiments were conducted using a water column, and short- and long-term in vivo experiments were performed using a porcine model with concurrent measurements of ICP via a fiberoptic monitor. RESULTS Following a toe region of approximately 2 cm H(2)O, the baric probe's AFI demonstrated a predictable linear relationship to ICP in both ex vivo and in vivo models. After a 2-week implantation of the device, this linear relationship remained robust and reproducible. Further, changes in ICP were observed with the baric probe, on average, 3 seconds in advance of the fiberoptic ICP monitor reading. CONCLUSIONS The authors demonstrate \\"proof-of-concept\\" and feasibility for the baric probe, a long-term implantable ICP monitor designed to facilitate the prompt and accurate diagnosis of shunt malfunction. The baric probe showed a consistent linear relationship between ICP and the device's AFI in ex vivo and short- and long-term in vivo models. With a low per-unit cost, a reduced need for radiography or CT, and an indicator that can be read with a handheld ultrasound probe that interfaces with any smart phone, the baric probe promises to simplify the care of patients with shunt-treated hydrocephalus throughout both the developed and the developing world.","output":"The baric probe: a novel long-term implantable intracranial pressure monitor with ultrasound-based interrogation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A two centre clinical study was performed to analyse exposure levels of cardiac physicians performing electrophysiology and haemodynamic procedures with the use of state of the art Zero-Gravity? radiation protective system (ZG).

The operators exposure was assessed using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) during both ablation (radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation (CRYA)) and angiography and angioplasty procedures (CA/PCI). The dosimeters were placed in multiple body regions: near the left eye, on the left side of the neck, waist and chest, on both hands and ankles during each measurement performed with the use of ZG. In total 29 measurements were performed during 105 procedures. To compare the effectiveness of ZG against CSS an extra 80 measurements were performed with the standard lead apron, thyroid collar and ceiling suspended lead shield during CA/PCI procedures. For ZG, the upper values for the average eye lens and whole body doses per procedure were 4 Sv and 16 Sv for the left eye lens in electrophysiology lab (with additionally used CSS) and haemodynamic lab (without CSS), respectively, and about 10 Sv for the remaining body parts (neck, chest and waist) in both labs. The skin doses to hands and ankles non-protected by the ZG were 5 Sv for the most exposed left finger and left ankle in electrophysiology lab, while in haemodynamic lab 150 Sv and 17 Sv, respectively.

Characterized by rapid and high frequency human-to-human transmission, the World Health Organization has recommended implementation of public health measures, including isolation of all suspected infectious individuals for a 14-day quarantine period, while governments have introduced social distancing and lock-downs of varying severity to curtail COVID-19 spread. Recent COVID-19 research further suggests there are major sleep problems and psychological disorders (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) associated with the reduction of movement and activities, as well as the reduced social interaction. There have been no studies examining the effect of physical activity at home during such periods of isolation. However, based on previous research, potential tactics to overcome these negative effects include home-based exercise, exergaming, dancing to music, and participation in yoga. Adults should accumulate at least 150 min of moderate-intensity and at least 75 min of vigorous-intensity of activity divided in to 5C7 sessions per week. This training volume could be reduced by 30% for children and adolescents if replaced by recess or active play in and around the home. Additionally, exercises should be adapted to the fitness level of the participant and a progressive model of intensity and training volume should be utilized, preferably monitored by telephone applications and wearable sensors.","output":"Staying Physically Active During the Quarantine and Self-Isolation Period for Controlling and Mitigating the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Overview of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Persons with an intellectual disability are at increased risk of experiencing adversities. The current study aims at providing an overview of the research on how resilience in adults with intellectual disabilities, in the face of adversity, is supported by sources in their social network.

Several studies have recently been published on the impact of COVID-19-related loneliness among older populations, but little has been written about the experiences of already-lonely older individuals; those who had lived with persistent loneliness before the advent of COVID-19. This qualitative study sought to understand how already-lonely older individuals navigated and endured the social isolation of the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve semistructured interviews were conducted with individuals aged 65 or older who scored a 6 or above on the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Risk screening tool. Interviews were coded using the constant comparative method. Themes and understandings of loneliness that reoccurred within and across interviews were identified and collected. RESULTS: Already-isolated older interviewees did not necessarily experience the abject loneliness hypothesized by analysts. Most interviewees used longstanding arrangements, in place to mitigate loneliness and endure social isolation, to manage the social deprivation of COVID-19. As a result, their loneliness did not compound during long bouts of mandated social isolation. To the contrary, loneliness during the pandemic appeared to carry a new valence for interviewees, as COVID-19 imbued their isolation with new meaning, rendering their loneliness necessary and responsible. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Exploring individuals subjective perceptions of loneliness can help provide a deeper understanding of what it means to be isolated and alone during COVID-19 and aid in designing strategies to mitigate loneliness.","output":"The Lived Experience of Already-Lonely Older Adults During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for the coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19).

The utilisation of AI-based healthcare tools such as symptom assessment applications (SAAs) has the potential to reduce the burden on healthcare systems. The purpose of the AFYA Study (AI-based Assessment oF health sYmptoms in TAnzania) is to evaluate the accuracy of the condition suggestions and urgency advice provided by a user on a Swahili language Ada SAA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is designed as an observational prospective clinical study. The setting is a waiting room of a Tanzanian district hospital. It will include patients entering the outpatient clinic with various conditions and age groups, including children and adolescents. Patients will be asked to use the SAA before proceeding to usual care. After usual care, they will have a consultation with a study-provided physician. Patients and healthcare practitioners will be blinded to the SAAs results. An expert panel will compare the Ada SAAs condition suggestions and urgency advice to usual care and study provided differential diagnoses and triage. The primary outcome measures are the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Ada SAA evaluated against the gold standard differential diagnoses.

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 14 patients with pneumomediastinum and COVID-19 infection without mechanical ventilation. We discussed the world data on pneumomediastinum in patients with coronavirus infection. RESULTS Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual number of own observations of spontaneous pneumomediastinum did not exceed 1-2 patients. The mechanism of pneumomediastinum is explained by the Macklin effect. COVID-19 pandemic in the Russian Federation was followed by increase of the number of patients with pneumomediastinum up to 2.4% of the total number of patients in the thoracic department. In this sample, pneumomediastinum occurred at all variants of the course of coronavirus infection. The timing of pneumomediastinum ranged from 2 to 18 (median 14) days after clinical manifestation of COVID-19. In 2 out of 14 cases, pneumomediastinum was the main symptom of coronavirus infection at admission. One patient had a combination of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. In 6 cases, pneumomediastinum was stable and regressed under conservative therapy. Eight patients underwent Razumovsky suprajugular mediastinotomy. There were no postoperative deaths. Recurrent pneumomediastinum was noted in one patient.

An unprecedented rapid and global response has been set in motion to identify efficient antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2, mostly relying on the repurposing of drugs presenting or not previously known antiviral activity. Ivermectin is an approved drug used as antiparasitic in humans and animals with well documented broad-spectrum antiviral properties that emerge from host-directed effects. Recent results reported by Wagstaff and coworkers (Antiviral Research 2020, 178, 104787) show a potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro by ivermectin, and clinical trials with human volunteers have already started. However, the mode of action of ivermectin is still largely unknown, especially at the molecular level. Here, we employ advanced molecular dynamics simulations to assess the influence of ivermectin on several key viral protein targets, with the aim to reveal the molecular bases of antiviral mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we show that ivermectin could be regarded as a multitarget agent, inhibiting different viral functions. These include blocking the recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the interactions with the two viral proteases 3CLpro and PLpro, and the SARS Unique Domain (SUD) non-structural protein. Hence, the wide spectrum of actions involving i) the interference with cell infection, ii) the inhibition of viral replication, and iii) elusion of the host immune system, could point to an unprecedented synergy between host- and virus-directed effects explaining the high anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity observed for this compound.","output":"Has Ivermectin Virus-Directed Effects against SARS-CoV-2?

The objective of this study was to investigate the immunostimulatory roles of individual and combined AFM1 and OTA on the immature intestine. Thus, we used ELISA assays to evaluate the generation of cytokines from ex vivo CD-1 fetal mouse jejunum induced by AFM1 and OTA and explored the related regulatory pathways and pivot genes using RNA-seq analysis. It was found that OTA exhibited much stronger ability in stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 from jejunum tissues than AFM1 (OTA of 4 M versus AFM1 of 50 M), whereas the combination of the two toxins seemed to exert antagonistic actions. In addition, transcriptomics also showed that most gene members in the enriched pathway 'cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction' were more highly expressed in OTA than the AFM1 group. By means of PPI network analysis, NFKB1 and RelB were regarded as hub genes in response to OTA but not AFM1. In the human FHs 74 Int cell line, both AFM1 and OTA enhanced the content of reactive oxygen species, and the oxidative response was more apparent in OTA-treated cells in comparison with AFM1. Furthermore, OTA and AFM1 + OTA raised the protein abundance of p50/RelB, and triggered the translocation of the dimer from cytosol to nucleus. Therefore, the experimental data ex vivo and in vitro showed that OTA-induced inflammation was thought to be bound up with the up-regulation and translocation of NF-B, though AFM1 seemed to have no obvious impact. Since it was the first attempt to uncover the appearances and inner mechanisms regarding inflammation provoked by AFM1 and OTA on immature intestinal models, further efforts are needed to understand the detailed metabolic steps of the toxin in cells and to clarify their causal relationship with the signals proposed from current research.","output":"Ex Vivo and In Vitro Studies Revealed Underlying Mechanisms of Immature Intestinal Inflammatory Responses Caused by Aflatoxin M1 Together with Ochratoxin A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Consumption of traditional and social media markedly increased at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as new information about the virus and safety guidelines evolved. Much of the information concerned restrictions on daily living activities and the risk posed by the virus. The term doomscrolling is used to describe the phenomenon of elevated negative affect after viewing pandemic-related media. The magnitude and duration of this effect, however, is unclear. Furthermore, the effect of doomscrolling likely varies based on prior vulnerabilities for psychopathology, such as a history of childhood maltreatment. It was hypothesized that social and traditional media exposure were related to an increase in depression and PTSD and that this increase was moderated by childhood maltreatment severity. METHOD: Participants completed a baseline assessment for psychopathology and 30 days of daily assessments of depression, PTSD, and pandemic-related media use. RESULTS: Using multilevel modeling, social media exposure was associated with increased depression and PTSD. This association was stronger for those with more severe maltreatment histories. Furthermore, those with more severe baseline psychopathology used more social media during this period. These relations were not observed for traditional media sources. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that regular viewing of pandemic-related social media is associated with increases in psychopathology for those with existing vulnerabilities. Those with such vulnerabilities should adopt strategies to limit social media consumption.

In Italy, some Stroke Units were transformed into sub-intensive COVID-19 Units, making the management of neurological patients demanding. We described how the flow of neurological emergencies was affected by the pandemic impact. METHODS: We analyzed accesses to the Emergency Department (ED) of the Maggiore della Carit Hospital, Piedmont, Italy, during a period of 8 months (COVID time; March to May 2020 and October 2020 to February 2021) and analyzed the admissions to the Neurology Unit and the underlying diagnosis. We also evaluated potential changes in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in the same period. These variables were compared with two equivalent periods of time (2019C2020; 2018C2019). RESULTS: During the COVID time, there was a clear-cut reduction of the total ED accesses compared to NoCOVID times. However, admissions for acute neurological conditions showed a mild but non-significant decrease (6.3%vs.7.3%). The same applied to acute ischemic stroke, which represented the most common condition (47.7%). The proportion of patients who underwent emergent reperfusion therapies remained unchanged. Furthermore, no difference was found in door-to-needle and door-to-groin intervals between COVID time and NoCOVID times. On the contrary, the onset-to-door interval was significantly longer during the COVID time (p value: 0.001). DISCUSSION: While the percentage of admissions following an ED access grew dramatically, those to the Neurology Unit showed overall only a slight non-significant decrease. This finding implicitly reflects the serious and urgent nature of many neurological diseases, compelling people to access EDs at any time.","output":"Neurological emergency at the COVID-19 pandemic: report from a referral hospital in Eastern Piedmont, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We present the integration of telemedicine into the healthcare system of West China Hospital of Sichuan University (WCH), one of the largest hospitals in the world with 4300 inpatient beds, as a means for maximising the efficiency of healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, moral distress in medical personnel has gained attention, related to the impact of pandemic-associated factors, such as the uncertainty of treatment options for the virus and the accelerated pace of deaths. Measures to provide aid and mitigate the long-term pandemic effect on providers are starting to be designed. Yet, little has been said about the moral distress experienced by patients and the relational and additive effect on provider moral distress. Pandemic-associated factors affecting moral distress in patients include the constraining effects of isolation on spiritual and religious traditions as well as the intentional separation of patients from their families. This paper will explore the idea that patients are suffering their own moral distress and further how this impacts the intensity of moral distress experienced by the providers-nurses and physicians. The paucity of research in this area with the implications on patient's distress, decision making, and distress experienced by providers compels further investigation and analysis.","output":"Moral Distress Entangled: Patients and Providers in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To evaluate the prognostic value of chest computed tomography (CT) imaging features in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 201 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled consecutively. The patients' chest CT scans were analyzed, and the disease severity was rated using two methods: (1) total lung involvement (TLI) in which each lobe is scored from 0 to 4 based on the percentage of involvement;and (2) modified TLI in which each lobe involvement score is multiplied by the number of its segments, and the sum is recorded as the modified TLI. The patients were categorized into four groups depending on their prognosis (patients admitted to hospital wards, patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), patients with intubation during hospitalization, and expired patients). The relationship between both scoring methods and the clinical outcomes of patients was examined in the four groups. Results: The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed no significant difference between the two scoring methods (TLI and modified TLI) in predicting the patients' prognosis. The average disease severity based on the two scoring methods was significantly different between the four groups. Patients who were intubated during hospitalization and patients who expired had significantly higher scores than patients admitted to the ICUs and hospital wards (P = 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for the prediction of mortality was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72 - 0.90;P &lt; 0.001);the TLI score of 18.5 could predict mortality with specificity of &gt; 95%. Conclusion: The TLI scoring system can be used for predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU admission in COVID-19 patients.

Out-of-pocket cost was also considered as characteristic of the vaccines to derive welfare measures. RESULTS: All vaccine attributes had expected signs with significant estimates. Vaccines developed in the USA and the UK were preferred to a hypothetical German vaccine, whereas a Chinese origin was very negatively perceived. Since the choice scenarios also gave the option to opt out from taking the vaccine, odds ratios were derived to characterize the segments that are more and less likely to accept vaccination. More likely to opt out were found to be those who stated to be against vaccination in general, African Americans, individuals without health insurance, and older people. Males, democrats, those who took the flu vaccine appear as more willing to accept vaccination.

The assay is based upon detection of R-MuLV encoded p30 protein production in virus infected murine cells. The assay reagents are readily available and the assay system is amenable to automated data collection systems. Cytotoxicity evaluations are conducted in parallel to the Rauscher MuLV ELISA assay in order to assess drug-induced reductions in cell viability. Cytotoxicity evaluations are important to interpretation of the ELISA results since reductions in cell viability reduce viral protein production which would indicate an antiviral drug effect.

Until 5/2011, 154 LRPs have been performed. Urine leakage from a suction drain appeared in 9 cases (5.8%). Permanent active suction (with a machine for Bllae thoracic drainage) of the prevesical space with negative pressure of 7-12 cm of H2O was started immediately. RESULTS Urine leakage started after a mean of 0.9 (0-2) days postoperatively and stopped after a mean of 8.1 (15-42) days. Leakage stopped with only suctioning in 7 cases. In one case, open re-anastomosis was performed on the 7(th) postoperative day (POD). In another case, ineffective active suction was replaced on the 10(th) POD by needle vented suction without effect and the leakage stopped following gradual shortening of the drain up to the 15(th) POD.

Mitigation strategies to control infection are modelled to allow analysis of their effectiveness in supressing infection outbreaks and in limiting pupil absence. The model is applied to re-examine Covid-19 in schools in the UK in autumn 2020, and to forecast infection levels in autumn 2021 when the more infectious Delta-variant is dominant and school transmission is likely to play a major role in a new wave of the epidemic. Our results indicate that testing-based surveillance of infections in the classroom population with isolation of positive cases is a more effective mitigation measure than bubble quarantine both for reducing transmission in schools and for avoiding pupil absence, even accounting for insensitivity of self-administered tests. Bubble quarantine results in large numbers of pupils absent from school, with only modest impact of classroom infection.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data of 360 DCIS patients and 125 DCIS-Mi patients treated by a single institution from 2016 to 2019. TILs are regarded as continuous variables and are divided into low ( 5%), medium (5-40%) and high ( 40%) for statistical analysis. RESULTS In DCIS and DCIS-Mi patients, larger tumor size, higher nuclear grade, hormone receptor (HR) negativity and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) overexpression are all related to high TILs (P < 0.05). In addition, compared with DCIS, DCIS-Mi patients were significantly associated with high TILs (P < 0.001). Based on the different results of the subtypes, we further studied the correlation between TILs and DFS in 279 cases of HER2+ patients (204 of DCIS; 75 of DCIS-Mi). In HER2+ group, DCIS-Mi was significantly associated with HR negativity (P = 0.015) and high TILs (P = 0.002) compared with DCIS patients. In the survival analysis, we found that TILs had no effect on the DFS of DCIS (P = 0.938), DCIS-Mi (P = 0.807), and HER2+ (P = 0.379) BC patients.

The rapid transformation of the in-person to virtual practice by the implementation of telehealth/telephonic sessions has eroded the boundary between personal/professional life and created a new Zoom fatigue.","output":"Debate: #Together despite the distance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyse mathematically the constraints on weights resulting from Hebbian and STDP learning rules applied to a spiking neuron with weight normalisation.

A similar relation can be derived for STDP algorithms, where the normalised weight values reflect a difference between the promotion and demotion probabilities of the weight. These relations are practically useful in that they allow checking for convergence of Hebbian and STDP algorithms. Another application is novelty detection.

By the analysis of close to 200,000 genomes we show that the patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations along its genome are closely correlated with the structural and functional features of the encoded proteins. Requirements of foldability of proteins 3D structures and the conservation of their key functional regions, such as protein-protein interaction interfaces, are the dominant factors driving evolutionary selection in protein-coding genes. At the same time, avoidance of the host immunity leads to the abundance of mutations in other regions, resulting in high variability of the missense mutation rate along the genome. Unexplained peaks and valleys in the mutation rate provide hints on function for yet uncharacterized genomic regions and specific protein structural and functional features they code for. Some of these observations have immediate practical implications for the selection of target regions for PCR-based COVID-19 tests and for evaluating the risk of mutations in epitopes targeted by specific antibodies and vaccine design strategies.","output":"The interplay of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and constraints imposed by the structure and functionality of its proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2) pandemic was an unprecedented event and New York City was at the epicenter of the outbreak in the early months of 2020 with greater than 15,000 deaths by the end of May of that year. While the possibility of viral respiratory co-infection was not known, there have been few cases of SARS-CoV-2 coexisting with other viruses. We present three cases of patients from varied demographic backgrounds who presented with respiratory illness and were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) co-infections. CASE PRESENTATION: The first patient was a 60 year old woman with a history of recent travel presented with severe back pain and headache for three days prior to admission. She was febrile to 101.3 F and had tachycardia with a pulse rate of 130 beats per minute (bpm). Serologic testing via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV on nasopharyngeal swab testing. She was managed conservatively and was discharged home for self isolation. The second patient was a 62 year old man who presented with a fever of 103 F, chills, rigors, worsening and hypotension with a systolic blood pressure reading of 72 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure reading of 45 mm Hg. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit and managed for septic shock requiring intubation and vasopressor support. The patient died on the fourth day of admission. Serologic testing was positive for RSV and SARS-CoV-2.The third patient was a 33 year old woman who was 29 weeks pregnant. She presented to the emergency department with a fever of 103.1F and had tachycardia with a pulse rate of 133 bpm. She also complained of a sore throat, body aches and frontal headache. She was discharged home with self isolation protocols. Serologic testing was positive for RSV and SARS-CoV-2. DISCUSSION: These cases highlight the possibility of the presence of co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections, namely RSV. The treatment for pneumonia with RSV is predominantly supportive but little is known of the outcomes when co-infection exists. It is our aim to underline the importance of respiratory panel testing for patients suspected of having viral pneumonia as multiple causative agents may exist and the treatment options and responses may be varied. Our patients had different clinical outcomes which may be due to their underlying medical conditions and demographics. CONCLUSIONS: While SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a prevalent cause of viral pneumonia during the current pandemic, it may co-exist with other infectious agents such as RSV, which may alter the clinical course of management. While testing protocols may vary, common viral respiratory illnesses should be evaluated in selected patient populations. Further research may be warranted to standardize testing protocols and management.

The enterprises employ the customization production paradigm, where the products have similar functions and structures, and adapt to such environment. However, for this mode, the mechanism is lack of making a quotation rapidly due to the complex of product and changeable demands. Formulating the relationship between factors and quotation of an order becomes an issue concerned by academia and entrepreneurs. We present control metrics to connect with those factors and existing quotation of a product. Since a quotation of product needs a large number of parameters to represent, the control metrics can be alternative of those parameters of quotation. Then, we propose a model of quoting. The correlation between the control metrics and a quotation of product is explored. Finally, a reduction approach of crucial metrics is developed by rough set on incomplete data. The case study is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method of reduction. The outcomes show that the multiple reducts can be obtained to facilitate the enterprises to make viable quotation decision from the multiple schemes in terms of their characteristics and different demands of the customers.","output":"Factor reduction of quotation with rough set on incomplete data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While IgM and IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively studied, relatively little is known about secretory IgA (sIgA) response in respiratory mucosa.

The assays showed sIgA in respiratory mucosa could be detected on the first day after illness onset (AIO), and the median conversion time for sIgA in sputum, throat swabs, and serum was 3, 4, and 10 days, respectively. The positive rates of sIgA first week AIO were 100% (24/28) and 85.7% (24/28) in sputum and throat swabs, respectively, and were both 100% during the mid-onset (2C3 weeks AIO).

An ethical dilemma arises when one effective vaccine has been successfully developed against an epidemic disease and researchers seek to test the efficacy of another vaccine for the same pathogen in clinical trials involving human subjects. On the one hand, there are compelling reasons why it would be unethical to trial a novel vaccine when an effective product exists already. First, it is a firm principle of medical ethics that an effective treatment or vaccine should not be withheld from patients if their life may depend on it. Second, since epidemic outbreaks often emerge in settings with less-resourced health systems, there is a pronounced risk that any trial withholding an effective vaccine would disproportionately affect the vulnerable populations that historically have been exploited for biomedical research. Third, clinical trials for novel vaccines may be at odds with efforts to control active outbreaks. On the other hand, it may be justified to conduct a trial for a candidate vaccine if it is expected to have certain advantages compared with the existing product. This essay discusses key factors for comparing vaccines against epidemic pathogens, including immunological, logistical and economic considerations. Alongside a case study of the development of vaccines for Ebola, the essay seeks to establish a general framework that should be expanded and populated by immunologists, epidemiologists, economists and bioethicists, and ultimately could be applied to the case of COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Ethical considerations for epidemic vaccine trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Miocene, extensive carbonate deposition thrived over wide latitudinal ranges in Southeast Asia despite perturbations of the global climate and thermohaline circulation that affected the Asian continent.

Here we show, through newly acquired high-resolution geophysical data and accurate stratigraphic records based on strontium isotopic dating, the evolution of these platforms from ~15.5-9.5 Ma is initially tied to tectonics and eustasy, and ultimately, after ~9.5 Ma, to changes in the global climate patterns and consequent palaeoceanographic conditions.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents are associated with an increased risk of serious infections and treatment discontinuation among elderly IBD patients but little is known about non anti-TNF biologics in this cohort. We aimed to examine safety and efficacy of ustekinumab in elderly Crohns disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Patients 60 years old commencing ustekinumab for CD were included in this retrospective multi-centre cohort study. We gathered data on adverse events, Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) and concomitant steroid therapy. The primary outcome was serious infections, defined as requiring hospitalisation. Efficacy was assessed by serial HBI measurement and treatment persistence. RESULTS: 70 patients were included, with a median age of 68 years (range 60C87), a male:female ratio of 9:5 and a median Charlson co-morbidity index of 4 (range 2C9). 44 (62.9%) had prior anti-TNF exposure and 15 (21.4%) previous vedolizumab. Median treatment duration was 12 months (range 2C48), with a total of 84 patient years. 31 patients (41.3%) had steroids at initiation, and 33 (47.1%) required a course of steroids at a later date. Seven patients (10%) had a combined 9 serious infections, of which 1 was life threatening requiring organ support. Incidence of serious infections was 0.107 per patient year. A further 18 patients had a combined 22 non-severe infections (Table 1). The overall infection rate was 0.417 per patient year. Charlson co-morbidity index was numerically higher among those who developed severe infections (median 5, range 3C7 vs. median 4, range 2C9, P=NS). 3 patients developed a malignancy; non-Hodgkins lymphoma, melanoma and prostate cancer. Mean HBI improved from 8.13 at baseline to 4.64 at 6 months and 4.10 at last follow up (both P<0.0001). Treatment persistence rate was 61.4% (N=43) and 36 (51.4%) were steroid-free. Reasons for discontinuation were primary non-response (42%), adverse event (32%), secondary loss of response (10%), malignancy (10%) and lack of funding (5%).

The exhaust emissions from the seven international commercial ports in Taiwan (namely Kaohsiung, Keelung, Taichung, Taipei, Hualien, Anping, and Suao) were calculated using actual data. Then, the regional ship exhaust emissions were estimated based on the number and size of ships and the type of fuel they used. Our method of predicting and evaluating the effectiveness of green port policies is shown to be intuitive and precise. Small vessels, which are the most common vessel type to enter and leave Taiwan ports, were shown to generate most of the emissions, but unit emissions from large vessels were the highest among three types of vessels (i.e., small, medium, and large). Moreover, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions corresponded to sailing speed. Taiwan International Ports Co., Ltd (TIPC) has slightly reduced carbon dioxide equivalent and sulfur oxide emissions by implementing a green port policy, consisting of multiple ways of building a sustainable port environment (such as vessel speed reduction and use of low-sulfur oil). However, nitrogen oxide emissions have not decreased significantly.

We utilized the Radiation Risk Assessment Tool (RadRAT) established at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, to evaluate the risk of cancer-related CTA radiation. Results: The study recruited 29 adult MFS patients who had CTA of the aorta during a 5-year study period with 89 CTA studies.

Primary outcomes included survival, morbidity, length of stay (LOS), and factors associated with survival or mortality. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients underwent HFOV with a 66 % overall survival rate. Survivors had a greater LOS than nonsurvivors (p = 0.001). Mortality odds ratio (OR) for patients without bronchiolitis was 8.19 (CI = 1.02, 65.43), and without pneumonia it was 3.07 (CI = 1.12, 8.39).

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. METHODS: It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. These confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD  22.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease.

METHODS Before and after a modified Biering-Sorensen fatigue protocol for the back extensors, countermovement (CMJ) and lateral jumps (LJ) were performed on a force plate under stable and unstable (balance pad on the force plate) conditions. Performance measures for LJ (contact time) and CMJ height and leg and trunk muscles EMG activity were tested in 14 male experienced jumpers during 2 time intervals for CMJ (braking phase, push-off phase) and 5 intervals for LJ (-30 to 0, 0-30, 30-60, 60-90, and 90-120 ms) in non-fatigued and fatigued conditions. RESULTS A significant main effect of test (fatigue) (p = 0.007, f = 0.57) was observed for CMJ height. EMG analysis showed a significant fatigue-induced decrease in biceps femoris and gastrocnemius activity with CMJ (p = 0.008, f = 0.58 andp = 0.04, f = 0.422, respectively). LJ contact time was not affected by fatigue or surface interaction. EMG activity was significantly lower in the tibialis anterior with LJ following fatigue (p = 0.05, f = 0.405). A test x surface (p = 0.04, f = 0.438) interaction revealed that the non-fatigued unstable CMJ gastrocnemius EMG activity was lower than the non-fatigued stable condition during the onset-of-force phase.

While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. MethodsThe systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) for relevant literature published between 1st January 2020 and 9th July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable. ResultsSeventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR = 2.65 (1.81-3.90)), male sex (OR = 2.05(1.39-3.04)) and severe obesity (OR = 2.57 (1.31-5.05)).

Conversely, a higher subjective social status (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83C0.93, p<0.001), at least weekly exercise (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47C0.70, p<0.001), and sanitizing ones phone (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63C0.99, p = 0.037) were each associated with a lower risk of developing viral symptoms. INTERPRETATION: While several immutable characteristics were associated with the risk of developing viral symptoms, multiple immediately modifiable exposures and habits that influence risk were also observed, potentially identifying readily accessible strategies to mitigate risk in the COVID-19 era.","output":"Predictors of incident viral symptoms ascertained in the era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remote computerized neurocognitive testing (CNT) is a promising solution to have these assessments more accessible to a population facing a global pandemic and increased aging. BrainCheck (BC) is a CNT software available on iPhone, iPad, and computer browser, designed to fit the need for remote testing. Consistent measures across these varying platforms are necessary to ensure users have consistent cognitive assessments and results. We aimed to assess BC across all administration platforms and interactions to observe any differences in assessment performance. 75 participants were enrolled in the study and were divided into two groups: participants who took BC across multiple platforms and participants who took BC in both an administered and self-administered fashion. Here we found Stroop, Digit Symbol, and Trail A/B had significantly different performance across the platforms, while Flanker, Coordination, Matrix, Immediate and Delayed Recognitions did not. Also, we found that the test metrics did not show significant differences in performance between being administered and self-administering the test. We did observe quicker completion times during the second instance of the test when taken in quick succession (within a day apart, which would not be a typical clinical pattern) and despite this, composite scores did not change reflecting the resilience of BC to practice effects. In conclusion, our results demonstrate BC may be a robust, self-administered CNT solution with an appropriate adjustment for the platform used.","output":"Validation of Remote Testing using BrainCheck, a Computerized Neurocognitive Test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in border closures in many countries and a sharp reduction in overall international mobility. However, this disruption of legal pathways to migration has raised concerns that potential migrants may turn to irregular migration routes as a substitute. We examine how the pandemic has changed intentions to migrate from The Gambia, the country with the highest pre-pandemic per-capita irregular migration rates in Africa. We use a large-scale panel survey conducted in 2019 and 2020 to compare changes in intentions to migrate to Europe and to neighboring Senegal. We find the pandemic has reduced the intention to migrate to both destinations, with approximately one-third of young males expressing less intention to migrate. The largest reductions in migration intentions are for individuals who were unsure of their intent pre-pandemic, and for poorer individuals who are no longer able to afford the costs of migrating at a time when these costs have increased and their remittance income has fallen. We also introduce the methodology of priming experiments to the study of migration intentions, by randomly varying the salience of the COVID-19 pandemic before eliciting intentions to migrate. We find no impact of this added salience, which appears to be because knowledge of the virus, while imperfect, was already enough to inform migration decisions. Nevertheless, despite these decreases in intentions, the overall desire to migrate the backway to Europe remains high, highlighting the need for legal migration pathways to support migrants and divert them from the risks of backway migration.","output":"How Has Covid-19 Affected the Intention to Migrate Via the Backway to Europe and to a Neighboring African Country?

Correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for improving epidemic control, but may be hindered by data incompleteness or unavailability. Here we explore the opportunity of using proxies for individual mobility to describe commuting flows and predict the diffusion of an influenza-like-illness epidemic. We consider three European countries and the corresponding commuting networks at different resolution scales, obtained from (i) official census surveys, (ii) proxy mobility data extracted from mobile phone call records, and (iii) the radiation model calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on these countries and integrating the different mobility layers are compared in terms of epidemic observables. We show that commuting networks from mobile phone data capture the empirical commuting patterns well, accounting for more than 87% of the total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from mobile phones and census sources are similar and highly correlated, however a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone data is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census commuting networks, once the mobile phone commuting network is considered in the epidemic model, however preserving to a high degree the order of infection of newly affected locations. Proxies' calibration affects the arrival times' agreement across different models, and the observed topological and traffic discrepancies among mobility sources alter the resulting epidemic invasion patterns. Results also suggest that proxies perform differently in approximating commuting patterns for disease spread at different resolution scales, with the radiation model showing higher accuracy than mobile phone data when the seed is central in the network, the opposite being observed for peripheral locations. Proxies should therefore be chosen in light of the desired accuracy for the epidemic situation under study.","output":"On the Use of Human Mobility Proxies for Modeling Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we address the limitations of existing implicit bias interventions as a strategy for achieving maternal health equity.

METHODS Prospective, noninterventional observational study of 50 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) beds equipped with Better Care? software throughout MV. The software distinguished ventilatory modes and detected ineffective inspiratory efforts during expiration (IEE), double-triggering, aborted inspirations, and short and prolonged cycling to compute the asynchrony index (AI) for each hour. We analyzed 7,027 h of MV comprising 8,731,981 breaths. RESULTS Asynchronies were detected in all patients and in all ventilator modes. The median AI was 3.41 % [IQR 1.95-5.77]; the most common asynchrony overall and in each mode was IEE [2.38 % (IQR 1.36-3.61)]. Asynchronies were less frequent from 12 pm to 6 am [1.69 % (IQR 0.47-4.78)]. In the hours where more than 90 % of breaths were machine-triggered, the median AI decreased, but asynchronies were still present. When we compared patients with AI > 10 vs AI  10 %, we found similar reintubation and tracheostomy rates but higher ICU and hospital mortality and a trend toward longer duration of MV in patients with an AI above the cutoff.

This is of particular importance for Black, Latino, and Native populations living in rural areas in the U.S., who remain marginalized in health care spaces. In this article, we describe the household production of health approach (HHPH) as a contextually-sensitive approach to examining health care seeking and treatment decisions and actions. The HHPH approach is based on several decades of research and grounded in anthropological theory on the household, gender, and therapy management. This approach directs analytical attention to how time, money, and social resources are secured and allocated within the household, sometimes in highly unequal ways that reflect and refract broader social structures. To demonstrate the benefits of such an approach to the study of cancer in rural populations in the U.S., we take lessons from our extensive HHPH research in Zambia. Using a case study of a rural household, in which household members had to seek care in a distant urban hospital, we map out what we call a rural HHPH approach to bring into focus the relations, negotiations, and interactions that are central to individual and familial health care seeking behaviors and clinical treatment particular to rural regions. Our aim is to show how such an approach might offer alternative interpretations of existing rural cancer research in the U.S. and also present new avenues for questions and for developing interventions that are more sensitive to peoples realities.","output":"The Rural Household Production of Health Approach: Applying Lessons from Zambia to Rural Cancer Disparities in the U.S."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immigration Detention is a patchwork of public and private correctional facilities overseen by ICE, a federal enforcement agency.

This study focuses on the infiltration-induced inter-unit pollutant dispersion in a high-rise residential (HRR) building. The outdoor wind pressure distribution on the building facades was obtained from the wind tunnel experiments. And the inter-household infiltration and tracer gas transmission were simulated using multi-zone model. The risk levels along building height and under different wind directions were examined, and influence of component leakage area was analysed. It is found that, the cross-infection risk can be over 20% because of the low air infiltration rate below 0.7 ACH, which is significantly higher than the risk of 9% obtained in our previous on-site measurement with air change rate over 3 ACH. As the air infiltration rate increases along building height, cross-infection risk is generally higher on the lower floors. The effect of wind direction on inter-unit dispersion level is significant, and the presence of a contaminant source in the windward side results in the highest cross-infection risks in other adjacent units on the same floor. Properly improving internal components tightness and increasing air change via external components are beneficial to the control of internal inter-unit transmission induced by infiltration. However, this approach may increase the cross-infection via the external transmission, and effective control measures should be further explored considering multiple transmission routes.","output":"Air infiltration induced inter-unit dispersion and infectious risk assessment in a high-rise residential building"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Phthisis bulbi is an irreversible cause of visual loss with insufficient evidence about its aetiology and status of patients' fellow eyes.

METHODS: A network pharmacology strategy involving drug-likeness evaluation, prediction of oral bioavailability, network analyses, and virtual molecular docking were used to predict the mechanism of action of MXYG against COVID-19. RESULTS: Thirty-three core COVID-19-related targets were identified from 1023 gene targets through analyses of protein- protein interactions. Eighty-six active ingredients of MXYG decoction hit by 19 therapeutic targets were screened out by analyses of a compound-compound target network. Via network topology, three \\"hub\\" gene targets (interleukin (IL-6), caspase-3, IL-4) and three key components (quercetin, formononetin, luteolin) were recognized and verified by molecular docking. Compared with control compounds (ribavirin, arbidol), the docking score of quercetin to the IL-6 receptor was highest, with a score of 5. Furthermore, the scores of three key components to SARS-CoV-2 are large as 4, 5, and 5, respectively, which are even better than those of ribavirin at 3. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that MXYG could prevent and treat COVID-19 through anti-inflammatory and immunity-based actions involving activation of T cells, lymphocytes, and leukocytes, as well as cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, and chemokine signaling pathways.

Meanwhile, we are also experiencing an infodemic induced by the overabundance of information, some accurate and some inaccurate, spreading rapidly across social media platforms. Social media has arguably shifted the information acquisition and dissemination of a considerably large population of internet users toward higher interactivities. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate COVID-19-related health beliefs on one of the mainstream social media platforms, Twitter, as well as potential impacting factors associated with fluctuations in health beliefs on social media. METHODS: We used COVID-19-related posts from the mainstream social media platform Twitter to monitor health beliefs. A total of 92,687,660 tweets corresponding to 8,967,986 unique users from January 6 to June 21, 2020, were retrieved. To quantify health beliefs, we employed the health belief model (HBM) with four core constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We utilized natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate the process of judging the conformity of each tweet with each of the four HBM constructs. A total of 5000 tweets were manually annotated for training the machine learning architectures. RESULTS: The machine learning classifiers yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves over 0.86 for the classification of all four HBM constructs. Our analyses revealed a basic reproduction number R(0) of 7.62 for trends in the number of Twitter users posting health beliefCrelated content over the study period. The fluctuations in the number of health beliefCrelated tweets could reflect dynamics in case and death statistics, systematic interventions, and public events. Specifically, we observed that scientific events, such as scientific publications, and nonscientific events, such as politicians speeches, were comparable in their ability to influence health belief trends on social media through a Kruskal-Wallis test (P=.78 and P=.92 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: As an analogy of the classic epidemiology model where an infection is considered to be spreading in a population with an R(0) greater than 1, we found that the number of users tweeting about COVID-19 health beliefs was amplifying in an epidemic manner and could partially intensify the infodemic. It is unhealthy that both scientific and nonscientific events constitute no disparity in impacting the health belief trends on Twitter, since nonscientific events, such as politicians speeches, might not be endorsed by substantial evidence and could sometimes be misleading.","output":"Using Tweets to Understand How COVID-19CRelated Health Beliefs Are Affected in the Age of Social Media: Twitter Data Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the 18th of March 2020, the Malaysia government declared a movement control order (MCO) due to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.

CONCLUSION: A possible future clinical perspective for patients with COVID-19 treated with HCQ/CQ could reside in the multidisciplinary collaboration between ophthalmologists monitoring the risk of HCQ/CQ-related retinal toxicity and those physicians treating COVID-19 infection.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinal safety concerns during COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Inborn errors of immunity manifest with a greater susceptibility to infections, autoimmunity, autoinflammatory diseases, allergies, or malignancies. One of these is the mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. The most frequent etiology is the complete autosomal recessive deficiency of the 1 subunit of the interleukin 12 receptor. CASE REPORT A female patient who, by the age of six months, started with a nodular lesion in the right shoulder and ipsilateral axillary adenitis after the bacillus Calmette-Gurin vaccine was applied. Later, she developed a cutaneous fistula in the anterior thorax, the inframammary region, and chronic recidivant suppurative lymphadenitis. A disseminated infection caused by Mycobacterium bovis was diagnosed, therefore, individualized pharmacological treatment was required due to failure with the primary treatment. The patient was diagnosed with deficiency in the 1 subunit of the interleukin 12 receptor at age six. During her last hospitalization, she presented fever, cough, and tachypnea, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The patient has had a favorable evolution. CONCLUSION In patients with disseminated infections caused by bacillus Calmette-Gurin vaccination or by environmental mycobacteria, there should be suspicion of an inborn error of immunity and the patient should be referred to a third level hospital for an early immunological assessment.","output":"[Disseminated infection caused by the bacillus Calmette-Gurin vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in a patient with IL-12 receptor 1 subunit deficiency]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Finding an optimal solution for emerging cyber physical systems (CPS) for better efficiency and robustness is one of the major issues. Meta-heuristic is emerging as a promising field of study for solving various optimization problems applicable to different CPS systems. In this paper, we propose a new meta-heuristic algorithm based on Multiverse Theory, named MVA, that can solve NP-hard optimization problems such as non-linear and multi-level programming problems as well as applied optimization problems for CPS systems. MVA algorithm inspires the creation of the next population to be very close to the solution of initial population, which mimics the nature of parallel worlds in multiverse theory. Additionally, MVA distributes the solutions in the feasible region similarly to the nature of big bangs. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a set of test problems is implemented and measured in terms of feasibility, efficiency of their solutions and the number of iterations taken in finding the optimum solution. Numerical results obtained from extensive simulations have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches while solving the optimization problems with large feasible regions.","output":"Novel metaheuristic based on multiverse theory for optimization problems in emerging systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID\\\\19 outbreak has evolved in each country, the approach to the laboratory assessment of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection has had to evolve as well.

A total of 13,656 patients with multiple myeloma were included in the study, thereof 7,404 (54%) had comorbidity at diagnosis. The risk of death was increased for those with one comorbidity at diagnosis compared to those without any comorbidity (hazard ratio=1.19; 95% confidence interval:1.14-1.25), this risk was higher for those with two (1.38; 1.30-1.47) and three or more comorbidities (1.72; 1.62-1.83). Furthermore, the risk of death was increased in patients with prior history of cancer, arrhythmia, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, psychological disease, peptic ulcer, neurological disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, dementia, and inflammatory bowel disease. This large study shows that over 50% of multiple myeloma patients have a comorbidity at diagnosis and survival decreased with increasing numbers of comorbidities.

A total of 123 neonatal female calves, housed in individual hutches, were enrolled sequentially based on date of birth in 41 blocks of 3 animals each. Calves within each block were allocated to one of 3 treatments: remaining untreated, fed with SCFP (Diamond V SmartCare(?) at 1 g/d in milk and NutriTek(?) at 5 g/d in starter grain) for the first 63 days of life, or treated with halofuginone (0.1 mg/kg/d) for the first 7 days of life. Fecal samples collected on days 4C21 post-partum were examined for both Cryptosporidium oocysts and coproantigen. The presence and intensity of diarrhea were monitored by scoring daily for the first 4 weeks of life. Calves were weighed at 0, 21, 42 and 63 days of age. Almost all calves were Cryptosporidium-positive at least once during the study. Halofuginone significantly reduced the number of Cryptosporidium-positive fecal samples as compared to the two other groups. Based on the coproantigen scores, both halofuginone and SCFP feeding significantly reduced the intensity of Cryptosporidium infection as compared to the untreated group. Diarrhea was recorded in almost all calves at least once. Neither the proportion of diarrheic calves nor the intensity and duration of diarrhea differed among the 3 treatment groups significantly. The mean daily weight gain during the first 3 weeks of life was significantly lower in halofuginone treated calves than in both other groups; however, at the end of the study period the total weight gain did not significantly differ among the 3 treatment groups. In conclusion, the clinical results and weight gains of pre-weaning supplementation with the SCFP were neither better nor worse than the 7-day halofuginone treatment suggesting that the SCFP feeding may be from the clinical point of view a natural alternative measure, instead of halofuginone treatment, in bovine cryptosporidiosis.","output":"Long-term use of yeast fermentation products in comparison to halofuginone for the control of cryptosporidiosis in neonatal calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We determined the presence of neutralizing antibodies to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in persons in Qatar with and without dromedary contact.

We used regression analysis to explore predictors of mental health based on Pearlins model. Background characteristics included age (m = 75.7, SD 4.95), gender (77.4% female) and race (White = 93.4%). The CESD-10 provided a measure of mental health. Scores indicated 62.3% of the sample scored in the low range for depressive symptoms and 37.7% in the moderate to high range. Stressors were measured using the Perceived Stress Scale that includes subscales of perceived helplessness and perceived self-efficacy. We also measured perceived social Isolation, and current life space as predictor variables. Results of regressing the CESD-10 onto the set of theoretical predictors revealed that the inclusion both subscales of the Perceived Stress Scale, social isolation, and current life space jointly accounted for approximately 63.0% of the variability in the outcome beyond the baseline model (FChange[4, 449] = 211.15, p < .01), which included age, race, and gender.

We examined the effect of prior infection with ancestral (D614G) or Beta variants on Ad26.COV2.S immunogenicity approximately 28 days post-vaccination. We compared healthcare workers who were SARS-CoV-2 naive (n=20), to those infected during the first wave prior to the emergence of Beta (n=20), and those infected in the second wave (n=20), when Beta was the dominant variant. We demonstrate that a priming exposure from infection significantly increased the magnitude of spike binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity (ADCC) against D614G, Beta and Delta variants. The magnitude of antibody boosting was similar in both waves, despite the longer time interval between wave 1 infection and vaccination (7 months), compared to wave 2 (2 months). ADCC and binding cross-reactivity was similar in both waves. However, neutralization cross-reactivity varied by wave, showing that the antibody repertoire was shaped by the spike sequence of the infecting variant. Robust CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to spike of similar or higher magnitude as those elicited by infection were induced after vaccination. In contrast to antibody responses, prior infection was not required for the generation of high magnitude T cell responses, and T cell recognition of the Beta variant was fully preserved. Therefore, Ad26.COV2.S vaccination following prior infection, even >6 months previously, may result in substantially enhanced protection against COVID-19, of particular relevance in settings of high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Furthermore, the dominant impact of the infecting variant on neutralization breadth after vaccination has important implications for the design of second-generation vaccines based on variants of concern.","output":"Prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 boosts and broadens Ad26.COV2.S immunogenicity in a variant dependent manner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A first report on the short-term effects of COVID-19 pandemic on death by suicide, that included data from Mexico City, suggested that no increase in suicide was apparent immediately following the declaration of emergency. We followed up this initial analysis by adding longer-term suicide trends from Mexico City and by inspecting basic demographic groups. Methods: We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from Jan 1, 2010, to March 31, 2020), comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the following months of the pandemic (from April 1 to November 30, 2020). Findings: The number of monthly suicides changed from 302 to 309. There was an increase in suicide during the first 8 months of the pandemic, with a RR of 174 (137-220). Most of the increase occurred beyond June 2020, when there was an increase of about 70% that was then maintained. The increase was mostly accounted for by male residents of Mexico City, regardless of their age 195 (151-252). Overall, there was no change in the number of female suicides but those in the older age group should be closely monitored (RR=200;096-368). Interpretation: The increase in suicides by male residents of Mexico City is worrying and reinforces the need to strengthen actions for economic development, mental health and wellbeing.

From HIV/AIDS through COVID-19, they demonstrate that pandemics are social processes as well as health occurrences. The roots of these pandemics lie in changes in the socioeconomic interface between humanity and non-human host species that facilitate interspecies transmission. The degree to which zoonoses spread has been increased by the greater speed and extent of modern transportation and trade. Pre-existing sociopolitical and economic structures and conflicts in societies also affect pathogen propagation. As an epidemic develops, it can itself become a social and political factor, and change and interact with pre-existing sociobehavioral norms and institutional structures. This paper uses a Big Events approach to frame these processes. Based on this framework, we discuss how social readiness surveys implemented both before and during an outbreak might help public health predict how overall systems might react to an epidemic and/or to disease control measures, and thus might inform interventions to mitigate potential adverse outcomes or possibly preventing outbreaks from developing into epidemics. We conclude by considering what pathways measures, in addition to those we and others have already developed, might usefully be developed and validated to assist outbreak and epidemic disease responses.","output":"Emerging Zoonotic Infections, Social Processes and Their Measurement and Enhanced Surveillance to Improve Zoonotic Epidemic Responses: A Big Events Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"KEY POINTS: Accumulation of inorganic phosphate, Pi , may contribute to muscle fatigue by precipitating calcium salts inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum, SR. Direct demonstration of this process nor definition of the entry pathway of Pi into SR are fully established. We show that Pi promoted Ca2+ release at concentrations below 10 mm and decreased it at higher concentrations. This decrease correlated well with that of [Ca2+ ]SR . Pre-treatment of permeabilized myofibers with 2 mm Cl- channel blocker 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9AC) inhibited both effects of Pi . The biphasic dependence of Ca2+ release on [Pi ] is explained by a direct effect of Pi acting on the SR Ca2+ release channel, combined with the intra-SR precipitation of Ca2+ salts. 9AC effects demonstrates that Pi enters the SR via a Cl- pathway of as yet undefined molecular nature. ABSTRACT: Fatiguing exercise causes hydrolysis of phosphocreatine, increasing the intracellular concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi ). Pi diffuses into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it is believed to forms insoluble Ca2+ salts, thus contributing to the impairment of Ca2+ release. Information on the Pi entrance pathway is still lacking. In amphibian muscles endowed with isoform 3 of the RyR channel, Ca2+ spark frequency is correlated with Ca2+ load of the SR and can be used to monitor this variable. We studied the effects of Pi on Ca2+ sparks in permeabilized fibres of the frog. Relative event frequency (f/fref ) rose with increasing [Pi ] reaching 2.541.6 at 5 mm and then decreased monotonically, reaching 0.090.03 at [Pi ] = 80 mm. Measurement of [Ca2+ ]SR confirmed a decrease correlated with spark frequency at high [Pi ]. A large [Ca2+ ]SR surge was observed upon Pi removal. Anion channels are a putative path for Pi into the SR. We tested the effect of chloride channel blocker 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9AC) on Pi entrance. 400 m 9AC applied to the cytoplasm produced a non-significant increase in spark frequency and reduced the Pi effects on this parameter. Fibre treatment with 2 mm 9AC in the presence of high cytoplasmic Mg2+ suppressed Pi effects on [Ca2+ ]SR and spark frequency up to 55 mm Pi . These results suggest that chloride channels (or transporters) provide the main pathway of inorganic phosphate into the SR and confirm that it impairs Ca2+ release by accumulating and precipitating with Ca2+ inside the SR, thus contributing to myogenic fatigue.

Our science can inform critical care facilities as to remediation strategies such as work-rest schedules to minimize performance error in highly cognitively demanding circumstances such as intensive care units. METHOD The present exposition draws from the state-of-the-art understanding concerning thermal stress effects on cognition and workload in complex and demanding tasks. RESULTS The summation and synthesis of HF/E findings provides important insights into combinatorial effects of forms of stress, typically dealt with only as discrete sources in traditional standards and regulations. The identified interaction between ascending thermal stress and cognitive task demand provides an instance of the plurality of ways HF/E can specify performance limitations in safety-critical circumstances, as witnessed in the current pandemic. CONCLUSION Accumulated HF/E insights provide systematic ways in which to address and ameliorate the combined forces of physical and cognitive stress on medical personnel constrained to use varying forms of PPE. These principles extend beyond this specific domain to all who are required to work in differential and isolated microclimates. APPLICATION To minimize the possibility of critical and life-threatening error in intensive care facilities which necessitate PPE use, we need principled work-rest ratio and heat stress mitigation guidance. To promote health, we need to champion healthy work practices in our health workers. HF/E insights can help achieve this important goal.","output":"Specifying and Mitigating Thermal Stress Effects on Cognition During Personal Protective Equipment Use."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: We aimed to investigate factors affecting the willingness and acceptance of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among adults in China and sources of knowledge about the vaccine.Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted from September 8th to 15th, 2020, comprising of 23 questions. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with vaccination willingness and acceptance.Results: A total of 983 questionnaires were included and 81.3% of the participants were willing to receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. With a \\"bachelor degree or above\\" (OR = 0.56, p = 0.020) and believing that the vaccine would not cause SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0.50, p = 0.003) were associated with an increased willingness. Aged :30 years (OR = 0.38, p = 0.001), and believing that the vaccine would not cause SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0.52, p = 0.004) were associated with higher acceptance; while from Henan province (OR = 2.49, p < 0.001), not willing to vaccinate (OR = 3.86, p < 0.001), not suffering from chronic diseases (OR = 2.25, p = 0.013), and thinking it was not safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 (OR = 1.94, p = 0.001) were correlated with a lower acceptance.Conclusions: In conclusion, age, education, and vaccine perception might be key factors affecting the vaccine willingness and acceptance.

Methods and Materials: Data of the 159 patients who survived the COVID-19 illness during the first wave (1 March 2020C18 May 2020) were collected. Patient demographics, laboratory findings and electrocardiography data were evaluated. Patients who subsequently died within 1-year of the index illness were compared to those who remained well. Results: Of the 159 patients who had survived the index illness, 28 (17.6%) subsequently perished within 1-year. In comparison to the patients that were alive after 1-year, the deceased were older (68 vs. 83 years, p < 0.01) and equally male (60.4% vs. 53.6%, p = 0.68), with a similar proportion of hypertension (59.5% vs. 57.1%, p = 0.68), diabetes (25.2% vs. 39.2%, p = 0.096) and ischaemic heart disease (11.5% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.54).

Diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema, pneumonia and coronavirus cause respiratory disorders that affect the respiratory systems. Typically, the diagnosis of these diseases is facilitated by pulmonary auscultation using a stethoscope. We present a new attempt to develop a lightweight, comprehensive wearable sensor system to monitor respiration using a multi-sensor approach. We employed new wearable sensor technology using a novel integration of acoustics and biopotentials to monitor various vital signs on two volunteers. In this study, a new method to monitor lung function, such as respiration rate and tidal volume, is presented using the multi-sensor approach. Using the new sensor, we obtained lung sound, electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyogram (EMG) measurements at the external intercostal muscles (EIM) and at the diaphragm during breathing cycles with 500 mL, 625 mL, 750 mL, 875 mL, and 1000 mL tidal volume. The tidal volumes were controlled with a spirometer. The duration of each breathing cycle was 8 s and was timed using a metronome. For each of the different tidal volumes, the EMG data was plotted against time and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. The AUC calculated from EMG data obtained at the diaphragm and EIM represent the expansion of the diaphragm and EIM respectively. AUC obtained from EMG data collected at the diaphragm had a lower variance between samples per tidal volume compared to those monitored at the EIM. Using cubic spline interpolation, we built a model for computing tidal volume from EMG data at the diaphragm. Our findings show that the new sensor can be used to measure respiration rate and variations thereof and holds potential to estimate tidal lung volume from EMG measurements obtained from the diaphragm.","output":"Extraction and Analysis of Respiratory Motion Using a Comprehensive Wearable Health Monitoring System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The physiological response induced by acute prolonged sitting is not fully understood. Therefore, we examined the effects of 8-h constant sitting on microcirculation and associated factors in the lower extremity among healthy males. We also evaluated the protective effects of lower-pressure thigh-length elastic compression garments on these parameters. METHODS: Nine healthy males (age, 22.6  1.4 yr; body mass index, 22.4  1.8 kgm(?2)) completed the 8-h constant sitting experiment. Following baseline measurements, each subject was randomized to wear a lower-pressure elastic garment on the right or left leg from the inguinal region to the ankle joint, with the noncompressed contralateral leg as a control. Circumferences of the calf and malleolus, extracellular water contents, blood flow and shear rate of the dorsal metatarsal artery, and oxygen dynamics in the gastrocnemius muscles were measured in both extremities before and during 8-h constant sitting. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, 8-h constant sitting caused enlargement of circumferences (calf, 2.4%  0.7%; malleolus, 2.7%  1.4%), retention of extracellular water in lower extremity muscles (10.1%  1.78%), deterioration of the blood flow (61.4%  16.2% of baseline) and shear rate of the dorsal metatarsal artery, and decrease in oxygenated hemoglobin and total hemoglobin levels in the gastrocnemius muscle (P < 0.05, respectively). When subjects wore the lower-pressure thigh-length compression garment, a significant reduction of these effects was observed (P < 0.05, for all). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged sitting for 8 h induced edema, as well as deterioration of the arterial blood flow, shear rate, and microcirculation in lower limb muscles.

Classical solutions for controlling the virus, such as travel restrictions, lockdowns, repurposed drugs and vaccines, are socially unpopular and medically limited by the fast mutation and adaptation of the virus. This is exacerbated by microbial resistance to therapeutic drugs and the slowness of vaccine development. In other words, microbial pathogens are somehow smarter and faster than us, thus calling for more intelligent cures to combat future pandemics. Here, we compare therapeutics for COVID-19 such as synthetic drugs, vaccines, antibodies and phages.

METHODS: 28 participants were included for focus group study with the grounded theory methodology. RESULTS: There is considerable misunderstanding among the Chinese community about the role of primary care doctors in the treatment of cardiovascular disease resulting in the variable use of primary care services.

The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of image-based quantitative CT features in discriminating COVID-19 from NC Pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 145 patients with highly suspected COVID-19 were retrospectively enrolled from four centers in Sichuan Province during January 23 to March 23, 2020. 88 cases were confirmed as COVID-19, and 57 patients were NC. The dataset was randomly divided by 3:2 into training and testing sets. The quantitative CT radiomics features were extracted and screened sequentially by correlation analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression (LR) and backward stepwise LR with minimum AIC methods. The selected features were used to construct the LR model for differentiating COVID-19 from NC. Meanwhile, the differentiation performance of traditional quantitative CT features such as lesion volume ratio, ground glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation volume ratio were also considered and compared with Radiomics-based method. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were conducted to evaluate the predicting performance. RESULTS: Compared with traditional CT quantitative features, radiomics features performed best with the highest Area Under Curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in the training (0.994, 0.942, 1.0 and 0.965) and testing sets (0.977, 0.944, 0.870, 0.915) (Delong test, P < 0.001).

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary hospital from January 2016 to June 2021. The severe pARDS patients who received ECMO were enrolled in this study. LUS score was measured at initiation of ECMO (LUS-0 h), then at 24 h (LUS-24 h), 48 h (LUS-48 h), and 72 h (LUS-72 h) during ECMO, and when weaned from ECMO (LUS-wean). The value of LUS scores at the first 3 days of ECMO as a prognostic predictor was analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine children with severe pARDS who received ECMO were enrolled with a median age of 26 (IQR 9, 79) months. The median duration of ECMO support was 162 (IQR 86, 273) h and the PICU mortality was 31.0% (9/29). The values of LUS-72 h and LUS-wean were significantly lower in survivors than that in non-survivors (both P < 0.001). Daily fluid balance volume during the first 3 days of ECMO support were strongly correlated with LUS score [1st day: r = 0.460, P = 0.014; 2nd day: r = 0.540, P = 0.003; 3rd day: r = 0.589, P = 0.001]. The AUC of LUS-72 h for predicting PICU mortality in these patients was 1.000, and the cutoff value of LUS-72 h was 24 with a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 100.0%. Furthermore, patients were stratified in two groups of LUS-72 h  24 and LUS-72 h < 24. Consistently, PICU mortality, length of PICU stay, ratio of shock, vasoactive index score value, and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy were significantly higher in the group of LUS-72 h  24 than in the group of LUS-72 h < 24 (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Lung ultrasound score is a promising tool for predicting the prognosis in patients with ARDS under ECMO support.

The results revealed that 77% (n = 60) and 58% (n = 45) of the responding schools had conducted HE theoretical and practical online teaching, respectively, prior to the pandemic; however, 27% (n = 21) of the medical schools had temporally suspended practical sessions at the time the survey was completed. During the pandemic, 73% (n = 57) and 29% (n = 23) of the medical schools delivered HE theoretical and practical sessions by synchronous live broadcasting, respectively; 65% (n = 51) of the medical schools increased virtual microscopy using during practical sessions. During the pandemic, 54% (n = 42) of the medical schools implemented teaching activities promoting active learning; meanwhile, online assessment was implemented in 84% (n = 66) of the responding medical schools. With regard to the satisfaction with the effectiveness of online teaching during the pandemic, 64% (n = 50) of the medical schools gave positive answers and considered that it was a good opportunity to develop novel and diversified teaching methods. Despite various difficulties such as work overload and unstable online teaching environments, most medical schools are willing to continue or increase theoretical online teaching after the pandemic. Conclusions Medical institutes in China were the earliest of closing campuses and having complete online teaching experience during the pandemic. This paper presents overall HE teaching situation extracted from the survey, to assist other medical schools optimizing the transitions to quality online teaching within a short time, and to serve as reference for schools that demand essential knowledge in online teaching methods, infrastructure construction, and platform integrations.","output":"Adaptions and perceptions on histology and embryology teaching practice in China during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is little published evidence on the gastrointestinal features of COVID-19. AIMS: To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID-19, and to discuss the possibility of faecal transmission. METHODS: We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID-19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak. RESULTS: With an incidence of 3% (1/41)-79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 included anorexia 39.9% (55/138)-50.2% (101/201), diarrhoea 2% (2/99)-49.5% (146/295), vomiting 3.6% (5/138)-66.7% (4/6), nausea 1% (1/99)-29.4% (59/201), abdominal pain 2.2% (3/138)-6.0% (12/201) and gastrointestinal bleeding 4% (2/52)-13.7% (10/73). Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1  2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent in children. About 3.6% (5/138)-15.9% (32/201) of adult and 6.5% (2/31)-66.7% (4/6) of children patients presented vomiting. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and virus nucleocapsid protein were detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection. In 36% (5/14)-53% (39/73) faecal PCR became positive, 2-5 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23% (17/73)-82% (54/66) patients for 1-11 days. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China.

This study aims to understand changes in combustible cigarette and e-cigarette use among U.S. adults. Methods In August 2020, a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of adults aged 18 years in the National Opinion Research Center's AmeriSpeak Panel who reported past 6Cmonth use of combustible cigarettes or e-cigarettes was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression assessed factors associated with increased product use and quit attempts since hearing about COVID-19. Results A total of 1,024 past 6Cmonth cigarette smokers/e-cigarette users were surveyed. Among cigarette smokers, 45% reported no change in cigarette smoking and 33% increased cigarette smoking since hearing about COVID-19. Higher stress was associated with increased cigarette smoking. Among e-cigarette users, 41% reported no change in and 23% reported increasing e-cigarette use. Twenty-six percent of cigarette smokers and 41% of e-cigarette users tried to quit because of COVID-19. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 was associated with attempts to quit combustible cigarettes (AOR=2.37, 95% CI=1.59, 3.55) and e-cigarettes (AOR=3.14, 95% CI=1.73, 5.70). Conclusions Cigarette and e-cigarette use patterns varied in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most cigarette smokers and e-cigarette users perceived product use as increasing COVID-19-related health risks, and this was associated with attempts to quit. Some cigarette smokers, especially those reporting higher stress, increased product use.

We evaluated the impact of the pandemic on the foot and ankle service at our trauma unit, assessing whether these adaptations to practice were justifiable, successful and sustainable for the future. This was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study analysing the patient care pathway from admission to discharge, for two pre-defined timeframes: Phase 0 (pre-lockdown phase) and Phase 1 (lockdown phase). Patients were split into stable and unstable injuries depending on their fracture pattern. The follow-up modality and duration were evaluated. Trauma throughput for the equivalent timeframe in 2019 was also analysed for comparison. There were 106 unstable fractures and 100 stable fractures in 2020.78 interventional procedures were performed on 72 patients with unstable fractures in Phase-1. Close contact casting was performed on 13 patients at presentation in the ED. Selective patients underwent partial fixation in theatre, which still provided adequate stability. 35% of patients with a stable fracture were discharged directly from the ED with written advice from a review letter. The treatment modality in selective patients, particularly the vulnerable should be carefully assessed. Interventions performed at presentation often negate the need for admission. Partial fixation reduces intraoperative time and surgical insult. Integrating telemedicine into the care pathway, particularly for stable ankle fractures reduces the need for physician-patient contact and eases follow-up burden. Many of our recommended changes are easily replicated in other clinical settings. Should these adaptations demonstrate long-term sustainability, it is likely they will remain incorporated into future clinical practice.","output":"Foot and ankle trauma management during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experiences from a major trauma unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is essential to understand the variables that explain and predict the behaviour of starting up a new company in a regional context.

Here, we implement a county-level epidemiological framework to assess and forecast COVID-19 spread through Georgia, where 1,933 people have died from COVID-19 and 44,638 cases have been documented as of May 27, 2020. We find that county-level forecasts trained on heterogeneity due to clustered events can continue to predict epidemic spread over multi-week periods, potentially serving efforts to prepare medical resources, manage supply chains, and develop targeted public health interventions. We find that the premature removal of physical (social) distancing could lead to rapid increases in cases or the emergence of sustained plateaus of elevated fatalities.","output":"Spread of COVID-19 through Georgia, USA.

Amounts of efforts have been made to prevent and control COVID-19s transmission, from early screenings to vaccinations and treatments. Recently, due to the spring up of many automatic disease recognition applications based on machine listening techniques, it would be fast and cheap to detect COVID-19 from recordings of cough, a key symptom of COVID-19. To date, knowledge on the acoustic characteristics of COVID-19 cough sounds is limited, but would be essential for structuring effective and robust machine learning models. The present study aims to explore acoustic features for distinguishing COVID-19 positive individuals from COVID-19 negative ones based on their cough sounds. MethodsWith the theory of computational paralinguistics, we analyse the acoustic correlates of COVID-19 cough sounds based on the COMPARE feature set, i. e., a standardised set of 6,373 acoustic higher-level features. Furthermore, we train automatic COVID-19 detection models with machine learning methods and explore the latent features by evaluating the contribution of all features to the COVID-19 status predictions. ResultsThe experimental results demonstrate that a set of acoustic parameters of cough sounds, e. g., statistical functionals of the root mean square energy and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, are relevant for the differentiation between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative cough samples. Our automatic COVID-19 detection model performs significantly above chance level, i. e., at an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 0.632, on a data set consisting of 1,411 cough samples (COVID-19 positive/negative: 210/1,201). ConclusionsBased on the acoustic correlates analysis on the COMPARE feature set and the feature analysis in the effective COVID-19 detection model, we find that the machine learning method to a certain extent relies on acoustic features showing higher effects in conventional group difference testing.","output":"The Acoustic Dissection of Cough: Diving into Machine Listening-based COVID-19 Analysis and Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: 1 Describe an education initiative designed to improve EOL care received by patients 2 Describe the feasibility, effectiveness, and satisfaction of an education initiative focused on EOL care principles Background: Healthcare providers have an ethical obligation to reduce suffering during a patients end of life (EOL) but few receive formal education on EOL care principles Deficiencies in EOL care can compromise the quality of EOL care received by patients, increase resource utilization, and increase moral distress experienced by providers Aim Statement: The long-term goal of this project is to develop a healthcare workforce that is more adept at providing patient-centered, effective EOL care As an initial step, the objective of this project was to determine the feasibility and potential benefits of offering workshops in which principles of EOL care were taught to senior-level nursing students and practicing nurses Methods: To assess feasibility, data regarding recruitment rates, retention rates, and implementation issues were collected Workshop effectiveness was evaluated through use of the ELNEC-KAT survey that evaluated knowledge levels regarding EOL care principles A mixed-effects linear model was used to test for changes from the pre-workshop to post-workshop scores;it included fixed effects for time (pre- versus post-workshop) and workshop date (face to face versus virtual) Demographic information and satisfaction data were also collected Results: There were 43 total participants, including 19 students and 24 nurses There was a statistically significant time difference (p=0 0001) with the post-scores being larger (43 5 0 93) versus the pre-scores (41 2 0 93) There was no statistically significant workshop date difference (p=0 3146) Satisfaction data was positive Retention for the second workshop was negatively affected by COVID-19 Conclusions and Implications: The unique needs of patients nearing their EOL is significant This project describes the implementation and outcomes of an education initiative, focused on EOL care principles, that was both feasible and beneficial","output":"Facing the Inevitable: Preparing Nurses to Deliver End-of-Life Care (QI729)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has been afflicting the planet for over a year and from the occupational point of view, healthcare workers have recorded a substantial increase in working hours.

The arterial endothelium in these individuals is potentially under multiple attacks caused by particles of both endogenous and exogenous origin. Thus, they have a lifelong highly elevated level of circulating low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol which drives premature atherosclerosis. The high levels of LDL particles, often associated with an elevated level of circulating lipoprotein(a) particles, are both capable of inducing and maintaining endothelial dysfunction. Such pre-existing endothelial dysfunction can be exacerbated by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, by exposure to fine particulate matter generated by climate change-associated wildfires, and by dehydration during deadly heatwaves linked to the globally rising temperatures. The external factors can severely worsen the pre-existing endothelial dysfunction, and thereby significantly increase the risk of a cardiovascular event in the exposed FH patients.","output":"Airborne particles and cardiovascular morbidity in severe inherited hypercholesterolemia: Vulnerable endothelium under multiple attacks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper studies the connectedness among energy equity indices of oil-exporting and oil-importing countries around the world.

The novelty and unstable epidemiologic pattern of the virus had generated so much concern among the global health experts. These concerns were found to be escalated among frontline health care workers to the extent of impeding the timeliness of the response activities. To slow down the spread of the already established community transmission through the surveillance activities, the concern of the health workers at the community level needs to be addressed. Therefore, this study assessed the concern about COVID-19 pandemic among the primary health workers in Oyo State, Nigeria. Methods: This was an online cross-sectional survey conducted among primary health care workers in Oyo State between March and April 2020. Using a two-stage sampling technique, we recruited 284 respondents. A semi-structured questionnaire linked to the Google form was used to collect data. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 25;bivariate analysis was done using Chi-square and binary logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of health workers concern at 5% level of significance. Results: The mean age of respondents was 45.0 + 9.0 years. About 52.5% had goodk knowledge of COVID-19. In the domains of concern, 66.9%, 53.2%, 51.4%, and 46.5% of the respondents expressed government-related concern, self-satisfaction related concern, work-related concern and social status related concern respectively. Male respondents were less likely to express concern about COVID-19 compared with their female counterparts (aOR= 0.39, 95% CI = 0.20 C 0.76). Nurses/midwives (aOR= 0.21, 95% CI = 0.05 C 0.85) had lesser likelihood of expressing concern about COVID-19 while middle staff (aOR= 2.5, 95% CI = 1.18 C 5.39) and income earner of  N200, 000 (aOR= 2.3, 95% CI = 1.34 C 3.92) had higher likelihood of expressing concern about COVID-19.

METHODS: We undertook a scoping review of COVID-19, comprehensively searching databases and other sources to identify literature on COVID-19 between 1 December 2019 and 6 February 2020. We analysed the sources, publication date, type and topic of the retrieved articles/studies. RESULTS: We included 249 articles in this scoping review. More than half (59.0%) were conducted in China. Guidance/guidelines and consensuses statements (n = 56; 22.5%) were the most common. Most (n = 192; 77.1%) articles were published in peer-reviewed journals, 35 (14.1%) on preprint servers and 22 (8.8%) posted online. Ten genetic studies (4.0%) focused on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 while the topics of molecular studies varied. Nine of 22 epidemiological studies focused on estimating the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 infection (R(0)). Of all identified guidance/guidelines (n = 35), only ten fulfilled the strict principles of evidence-based practice.

This report is of a 34-year-old woman from Brazil with a recent diagnosis of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) diagnosed by raised serum VEGF-D levels and the finding of lung cysts on computed tomography (CT) imaging, who presented with COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE REPORT: Five months after the diagnosis of pulmonary LAM, which was based on the presence of diffuse and bilateral cystic lesions on CT scan associated with high serum VEGF-D levels, the patient presented with worsening dyspnea, drop in peripheral oxygen oxygenation, fever, and diffuse myalgia. She was using Sirolimus because it inhibits the development of LAM cells. A worsening of lung abnormalities was demonstrated in a chest CT examination, with the appearance of areas of consolidation and ground-glass abnormalities. A nasal swab sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Thus, Sirolimus was suspended because of concern about its immunosuppressive action.

The effect of VL for critical care education has not yet been evaluated. In a quantitative analysis of survey data and attendance records, we sought to determine the association of VL with conference attendance and work-life balance. Attending physicians, fellows, and advanced practice providers (APP) at a pediatric critical care department at a quaternary children's hospital participated in the study. Attendance records were obtained before and after the adaption of a VL platform. In addition, an electronic, anonymous survey to evaluate current satisfaction and the strengths and weaknesses of VL as well as its impact on work-life balance was administered. In total, 31 learners (17 attending physicians, 13 fellows, and 1 APP) completed the survey. A total of 83.9% (26/31) of participants were satisfied, and 77.4% (24/31) found VL to be similar or more engaging than non-VL. However, 6.5% (2/31) of learners reported difficulty in using the new platform, 87% (27/31) of participants supported VL as an effective learning tool, and 83.3% (25/30) reported a positive impact on work-life balance. Additionally, median monthly conference attendance increased significantly from 85 to 114 attendees per month (p<0.05).

Importantly, cytokines secreted by CD4+ T cells inhibit JHMV replication in NPCs, and CD8+ T cells specifically target viral peptide-pulsed NPCs for lysis. Furthermore, treatment with IFN- inhibits JHMV replication in a dose-dependent manner.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify interventions which are effective in reducing the length of stay (LOS) or improving the day case rate for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: Comparative English-language studies describing perioperative interventions applicable to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in adult patients and their impact on LOS or day case rate were included. RESULTS: Quantitative data were available for meta-analysis from 80 studies of 10,615 patients. There were an additional 17 studies included for systematic review. The included studies evaluated 14 peri-operative interventions. Implementation of a formal day case care pathway was associated with a significantly shorter LOS (MD = 24.9 h, 95% CI, 18.7-31.2, p < 0.001) and an improved day case rate (OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-8.1, p = 0.005). Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, dexamethasone and prophylactic antibiotics were associated with smaller reductions in LOS. CONCLUSION: Care pathway implementation demonstrated a significant impact on LOS and day case rates. A limited effect was noted for smaller independent interventions. In order to achieve optimal day case targets, a greater understanding of the effective elements of a care pathway and local barriers to implementation is required.","output":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of factors which reduce the length of stay associated with elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are growing concerns on the impact of COVID-19 on food security and child health in South Africa.

Breastfeeding practices found in this survey confirmed findings from other studies: with high breastfeeding initiation rates and early introduction of other foods/mixed milk feeding. Logistic regression was conducted to explore the associations between breastfeeding, maternal depression and hunger in the household. The odds of hungry mothers breastfeeding were significantly lower (OR = 0.66;95% CI: 0.44, 0.99). The prevalence of depression in this survey sample was 26.95%, but there was no association between breastfeeding behaviour and depression scores (OR = 0.89;95% CI: 0.63, 1.27). A positive correlation was found between not breastfeeding and not going to the health clinic. Breastfeeding needs to be protected, promoted and supported;and mothers should be encouraged to continue to attend the health clinic. Further to communication to communities, supporting the breastfeeding mother to enable her to breastfeed and feel competent to do so is a critical gap that needs to be addressed. This support could include economic support to enable her to access a nutritious diet. Mothers also need reassurance on the quality of their breastmilk and their ability to breastfeed.

METHODOLOGY: A web-based survey was sent to all SNM patients, including those with implants and who had a cancelled operation because of the pandemic. The survey consisted of 15 questions in Arabic language, which sought to evaluate outcomes, as well as patient concerns and preferences during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients were contacted, and of which, 62 replied. Most of the patients (n = 51; 82.3%) had the device implanted, and 11 (17.7%) patients had a postponed operation secondary to the pandemic. There were 20 males and 42 females.

Given that wetland restoration may require many years to decades to converge to desired outcomes, long-term monitoring of successional patterns may increase our ability to fully evaluate success of wetland mitigation projects or guide adaptive management when needed. In Portsmouth, New Hampshire a 4 ha wetland was constructed in an abandoned gravel quarry as off-site compensatory mitigation for impacts to a scrub-shrub swamp associated with property expansion. Building upon prior evaluations from 1992 and 2002, we conducted a floral survey in 2020 to compare results with prior surveys to document vegetation successional trends over time. In addition, we monitored the avian community throughout the growing season as a measure of habitat quality. The plant community mirrored documented successional trends of freshwater wetland restoration projects as native hydrophytes dominated species composition. Plant species composition stabilized as the rate of turnover, the measurement of succession, declined by nearly half after 17 years. Researchers should consider long-term monitoring of specific sites to better understand successional patterns of created wetlands as we documented long time frames required for the development of scrub-shrub swamps, red maple swamps, and sedge meadows. High species richness was attributed to beaver activity, topographic heterogeneity from Carex stricta tussocks, and the seed bank from the application of peat from the original wetland. Habitat heterogeneity of open water, herbaceous cover, and woody vegetation supports a diverse avian community including 11 wetland dependent species. Although the mitigation project has not created the full area of lost scrub-shrub swamp after 35 years, it has developed a structurally complex habitat and diverse avian community that effectively provides the functions and values of the impacted system.","output":"Successional dynamics of a 35 year old freshwater mitigation wetland in southeastern New Hampshire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: Viruses are the most abundant biological entities and constitute a large reservoir of genetic diversity.

Our approach, based on a micro-simulation model, is innovative in a triple way. Firstly, we quantify the activity loss with respect to a counterfactual situation in which the crisis would not have hit. Secondly, we estimate this shock at the firm level, enabling a thorough analysis of activity loss heterogeneity throughout the crisis. In particular, we shade light on the dispersion of the shock both within and between industries. We show that the industry the firm operates in explains up to 48% of the monthly activity shocks variance weighted by employment, a much larger share than in a normal year. Finally, we leverage our monthly firm-level data on sales to show how corporate activity has evolved along four distinct trajectories throughout 2020. The main determinant of belonging to a given profile of activity is the firm industry C defined at a very granular level. Conditional on industry, the activity trajectory is also correlated with the ability to adapt some firms have demonstrated during the crisis in terms of organization and production.","output":"Corporate Activity in France Amid the Covid-19 Crisis.

Five U.S. high school science internship programs funded by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, with a history of collaboration, developed innovative strategies for distance-learning (DL) opportunities during the pandemic. Forty under-represented high school and undergraduate students were paired with scientific mentors at one of the programs for a DL scientific internship. Summer training combined synchronous and asynchronous programming with research projects adapted for DL success. Ninety-five percent of students who participated were satisfied with the training experience, nearly identical to exit survey responses from 2019 when our programs were held in-person. More students were interested in pursuing a career in research at the end of the program and credited the DL experience with increasing interest in research careers. Some DL elements were ideal for underrepresented youth, including a more flexible schedule and elimination of cost and time for travel. While the lack of in-person instruction challenged our ability to create a strong student community, we found that preparation, communication, and flexibility were key elements to these successful DL programs. The increased emphasis on interpretation and analysis of data, rather than data collection, enhanced student learning.

These are challenging injuries and the standard treatment is surgical repair under general or regional anaesthesia. Wide-awake surgery is an emerging technique in hand surgery where a conscious patient is operated on under local anaesthetic. The vasoconstrictive effect of adrenaline (epinephrine) creates a bloodless operating field and a tourniquet is not required. The potential advantages include intra-operative testing of the repair; removal of the risks of general anaesthesia; reduced costs; no aerosol generation from intubation therefore reduced risk of COVID-19 spread to healthcare professionals. The aim of this study will be to systematically evaluate the evidence to determine if wide-awake surgery is superior to general/regional anaesthetic in adults who undergo flexor tendon repair. METHODS: We designed and registered a study protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative and non-comparative studies. The primary outcome will be functional active range of motion. Secondary outcomes will be complications, resource use (operative time) and patient-reported outcome measures. A comprehensive literature search will be conducted (from 1946 to present) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. Grey literature will be identified through Open Grey, dissertation databases and clinical trials registers. All studies on wide-awake surgery for flexor tendon repair will be included. The comparator will be general or regional anaesthesia. No limitations will be imposed on peer review status or language of publication. Two investigators will independently screen all citations, full-text articles and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion or referral to a third author when necessary. The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using an appropriate tool. If feasible, we will conduct a random effects meta-analysis. DISCUSSION: This systematic review will summarise the best available evidence and definitively establish if function, complications, cost, or patient-reported outcomes are improved when flexor tendons are repaired using wide-awake technique. It will determine if this novel approach is superior to general or regional anaesthesia. This knowledge will help guide hand surgeons by continuing to improve outcomes from flexor tendon injuries.

Though bone marrow is the primary source of multipotent stem cells in adults, other tissues such as adipose tissues, placenta, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, periodontal ligament, and dental pulp also harbor stem cells that can be used for regenerative therapy. In addition, induced pluripotent stem cells also exhibit fundamental properties of self-renewal and differentiation into specialized cells, and thus could be another source for regenerative medicine. Several diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, virus infection (also coronavirus disease 2019) have limited success with conventional medicine, and stem cell transplantation is assumed to be the best therapy to treat these disorders. Importantly, MSCs, are by far the best for regenerative medicine due to their limited immune modulation and adequate tissue repair. Moreover, MSCs have the potential to migrate towards the damaged area, which is regulated by various factors and signaling processes. Recent studies have shown that extracellular calcium (Ca2+) promotes the proliferation of MSCs, and thus can assist in transplantation therapy. Ca2+ signaling is a highly adaptable intracellular signal that contains several components such as cell-surface receptors, Ca2+ channels/pumps/exchangers, Ca2+ buffers, and Ca2+ sensors, which together are essential for the appropriate functioning of stem cells and thus modulate their proliferative and regenerative capacity, which will be discussed in this review.","output":"Calcium channels and their role in regenerative medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) is a novel plasma-derived serine protease structurally homologous to tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators.

We detected PAI-1FSAP complexes in addition to high levels of extracellular RNA, an important FSAP cofactor, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Hydrolytic activity of FSAP was inhibited by PAI-1 with a second-order inhibition rate constant (K(a)) of 3.38  1.12  10(5)m(C1)s(C1). Residue Arg(346) was a critical recognition element on PAI-1 for interaction with FSAP.

RNA also stabilized the active conformation of PAI-1, increasing the half-life for spontaneous conversion of active to latent PAI-1 from 48.4  8 min to 114.6  5 min. In contrast, little effect of DNA on PAI-1 stability was apparent. Residues Arg(76) and Lys(80) in PAI-1 were key elements mediating binding of nucleic acids to PAI-1.

These data indicate that extracellular RNA and PAI-1 can regulate FSAP activity, thereby playing a potentially important role in hemostasis and cell functions under various pathophysiological conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.","output":"Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 Is an Inhibitor of Factor VII-activating Protease in Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in small bowel (SB). Our aim was to identify factors influencing intestinal ACE2 expression in Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. METHODS: Using bulk RNA-seq or microarray transcriptomics from tissue samples (4 SB and 2 colonic cohorts; CD=495; UC=387; non-IBD=94), we analyzed the relationship of ACE2 with demographics, disease activity and prognosis. We examined the outcome of anti-TNF and anti-IL12/IL-23 treatment on SB and colonic ACE2 expression in three clinical trials. Univariate and multivariate regression models were fitted. RESULTS: ACE2 levels were consistently reduced in SB CD and elevated in colonic UC, when compared to non-IBD controls. Elevated SB ACE2 was also associated with demographic features (age and elevated BMI) associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Within CD, SB ACE2 was reduced in patients subsequently developing complicated disease. Within UC, colonic ACE2 was elevated in active disease and in patients subsequently requiring anti-TNF rescue therapy. SB and colonic ACE2 expression in active CD and UC were restored by anti-cytokine therapy, most notably in responders. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced SB, but elevated colonic ACE2 levels in IBD are associated with inflammation and severe disease but normalized following anti-cytokine therapy suggesting compartmentalization of ACE2-related biology in SB and colonic inflammation. The restoration of ACE2 expression with anti-cytokine therapy may be important in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially explain reports of reduced morbidity from COVID-19 in IBD patients treated with anti-cytokines.","output":"Altered intestinal ACE2 levels are associated with inflammation, severe disease and response to anti-cytokine therapy in IBD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases pose a serious threat to public health security; this is especially true in the underdeveloped world because of limited resources to combat them. These emerging pathogens are characterized by a novel mode of pathogenesis and, in some cases, a broad host range. Over the past few decades, Pakistan has suffered a great deal from infectious diseases such as dengue, Crimean-Congo fever, hepatitis, measles, and polio. Changing climate conditions, environmental degradation, global warming, loss of biodiversity, and other ecological determinants have a direct effect on these diseases and result in the emergence and reemergence of infectious entities. The causes of such disease outbreaks are complex and often not well understood. Dealing with an outbreak requires an integrated and coordinated approach, with decision making by various state departments. Stringent biosecurity and biosafety protocols can help to reduce the chances of infection dissemination. In order to mitigate the risks associated with emerging pathogens, there is a greater need to understand the interactions of pathogen-host-environment, to monitor molecular evolution and genomic surveillance, and to facilitate the gearing up of scientists across the globe to control these emerging diseases.

Among the oral hard tissue problems, absence of a maxillary permanent tooth in the cleft region either due to congenital absence or extraction due to compromised prognosis is a common finding. Conventionally, the missing tooth is replaced using a removable or fixed partial denture; however, the treatment modality does not satisfactorily meet patient expectations. The most recent decade has seen increasing use of dental implants in the cleft region; however, the outcome of an immediately loaded dental implant is still elusive for orofacial cleft patients. OBJECTIVE: This protocol is for a single-arm clinical trial aimed at determining the treatment outcome of immediately loaded dental implants in patients with a nonsyndromic orofacial cleft. METHODS: Patients meeting the set criteria will be sequentially enrolled until a sample size of 30 dental implants is met and will undergo the proposed treatment according to the predecided protocol. All patients will be followed up at the designated time intervals to record various clinical and radiographic parameters. Implant success will be defined based on the criteria elucidated by Misch et al in the Pisa, Italy Consensus. A quality-of-life assessment questionnaire will also be recorded at the end of patients follow-up to determine their acceptance of the treatment. RESULTS: A total of 30 dental implants will be placed in patients with a nonsyndromic orofacial cleft. Obtained results will be statistically analyzed to determine the treatment outcomes and success. CONCLUSIONS: This study will help determine the feasibility of immediately loaded dental implants in compromised bone sites such as those presented in cleft patients and will help in generating findings that can be used to fill the lacunae currently present in the holistic treatment of cleft patients.

However, the intrinsic chemical stability of mRNA poses a challenge due to the presence of 2'-hydroxyl groups in ribose sugars. The -OH group in the backbone structure enables a base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack by the deprotonated hydroxyl on the adjacent phosphorous and consequent self-hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond. As expected for in-line hydrolytic cleavage reactions, the chemical stability of mRNA strands is highly dependent on external environmental factors, e.g. pH, temperature, oxidizers, etc. Predicting this chemical instability using a computational model will reduce the number of sequences synthesized and tested through identifying the most promising candidates, aiding the development of mRNA related therapies. This paper proposes and evaluates three deep learning models (Long Short Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit, and Graph Convolutional Networks) as methods to predict the reactivity and risk of degradation of mRNA sequences. The Stanford Open Vaccine dataset of 6034 mRNA sequences was used in this study. The training set consisted of 3029 of these sequences (length of 107 nucleotide bases) while the testing dataset consisted of 3005 sequences (length of 130 nucleotide bases), in structured (Lowest Entropy Base Pair Probability Matrix) and unstructured (Nodes and Edges) forms. The stability of mRNA strands was accurately generated, with the Graph Convolutional Network being the best predictor of reactivity ($RMSE = 0.249$) while the Gated Recurrent Unit Network was the best at predicting risks of degradation ($RMSE = 0.266$). Combining all target variables, the GRU performed the best with 76% accuracy. Results suggest these models can be applied to understand and predict the chemical stability of mRNA in the near future.","output":"Predicting Hydroxyl Mediated Nucleophilic Degradation and Molecular Stability of RNA Sequences through the Application of Deep Learning Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Major public health emergencies would have a negative influence on the psychology of the public, and an effective psychological intervention can help them to relieve some emotions, such as tension and panic.

This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 on 525 smallholder poultry farmers in five states of Nigeria. The study was conducted 15 months after the onset of the pandemic in Nigeria using structured questionnaires focused on socio-demography, income, production systems, markets, and food security. Average household size increased from 6.9 before COVID-19, to 8.3 during COVID-19, representing a 20.3% increase in population growth. Over half (52.6%) of this increase was due to childbirths. Average monthly income before and during the pandemic was reduced from NGN 22,565 (USD 62.70) to NGN15,617 (USD 38.10), respectively. During the pandemic, there was a 28.4% increase in the number of farmers living below the international poverty line of USD 1.90 per day. In addition, reliance on chickens for food and income was significantly (p <0.05) impacted by gender, location, household size, and monthly income.

Two radiologists (blind evaluators) described the tomographic findings. 15 patients with normal CT were excluded, 188 patients with clinical and laboratory parameters were admitted to the statistical analysis of TSS and mortality;data taken from epidemiological records and clinical histories, divided into two groups: recovered and deceased. Data analysis used the statistical package Stata version 14.2;hospital stay was analyzed by Kaplan C Meier curves and mortality prediction was made by Cox regression with 95% CI and a p value <0.05 as statistically significant. Results: Hypertension was the most frequent associated disease, the most common clinical presentation included cough, malaise, fever and dyspnea , there were no significant differences between studied groups (Recovered vs. death patients), 15 cases had normal CT, for this reason, they were excluded from the TSS score and mortality analysis. Mean age of the recovered patients was 53.6  16.4 years and of the deceased 75.9  13.9 years (p <0.0001). A moderate and high TSS ( 8) resulted in deaths (p <0.05), as well as a higher degree of lymphopenia and a history of asthma in the deceased (p <0.05). The variable arterial hypertension predicts the increase in days of hospital stay (p <0.05). The ground glass pattern was the most frequent, followed by the consolidation and distortion of the architecture;however, they were not associated with a type of outcome. The pattern of pleural effusion and bronchial dilation showed a significant difference with respect to the outcome, however, but it could be due to the infrequency of presentation of these patterns. Conclusions: TSS is useful in the initial and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia, in conjunction with markers such as lymphopenia and elevated CRP that can predict a poor short-term outcome. A high TSS score is a predictor of mortality. Hypertension predicts the increase in days of hospital stay.","output":"EARLY PREDICTORS OF HOSPITAL MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA AT A LEVEL III HOSPITAL.

Although assessments of general mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic have been widely reported, there is not adequate research on how schizophrenia patients have been affected. According to the World Health Organization (2020), individuals with chronic diseases who do not pay attention to their personal hygiene and the rules of protection from COVID-19 have a higher risk of getting infected than the healthy individuals who observe these measures. It is well known that the risk of Covid-19 infection is raised among schizophrenia patients due to negligence on the requisite control of personal hygiene and health conditions related to smoking and diabetes ( Cohn et al., 2004;Dinan et al., 2004;Krieger et al. 2019). The cognitive impairment in this disorder which reduces the perceptions on the necessity of self protection and the awareness of the risks proposed to underlie this raised risk of COVID-19 positivity (Yao et al. 2020). These patients have difficulty in following the preventive regulations (Palomar-Ciria et al., 2020). Apart from the risk of infection, there is also the risk of pandemic related development of auditory or visual hallucinations and delusional symptoms by acute and chronic psychosis patients during and after the pandemic (Brown et al. 2020, Cowan 2020). Therefore, this survey has been organised to evaluate the reaction developed by schizophrenia patients to the pandemic conditions. The first Covid-19 case was reported in Turkey on 11 March 2020 (Anadolu Agency, 11.03.2020) which was followed by the gradual increase in case numbers. In order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and maintain the existing public health, the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health established a 'Scientific Committee'' and prepared effective strategies including social isolation, quarantine, school closures, social distancing and wearing face mask in the community. During this process, the approximately 250 schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients followed up by the Psychosis Outpatient Unit of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital Psychiatry Department (DEUPD) were instructed to visit the outpatient unit only in emergency conditions. It was determined that there were 176 schizophrenia patients whose follow up visit appointments for the period of April 1 - June 22, 2020, scheduled before the announcement of the pandemic, were cancelled. Therefore, the survey reported here was conducted with the schizophrenia patients of the DEUPD online and by telephone connections during 10- 20 May, 2020, the 9th and the 10th weeks of the pandemic. Only 76 (43.19%) of the 176 patients joined the survey, since 4 (2.27%) refused to participate and 96 (54.4%) could not be contacted. The survey aimed to determine the incidence of Covid-19 diagnosis among these schizophrenia patients and their attitude to the preventive measures against the infection during the first 2 months of the pandemic, together with how they felt and their needs for psychiatric consultation on outpatient basis during this period. The surveyed 76 patients consisted of 49 (64%) males and 27 (35%) females, with 73 (96.1%) dwelling in urban and 3 (3.9%) in suburban areas;and only 11 (14.5%) employed while 65 (85.5%) were not working.

Standard treatment regimens consist of steroids, immunomodulatory drugs, and biological therapies, but therapeutic decision-making becomes challenging as there are uncertainties about how to deal with these drugs in patients with COVID-19 and active UC. Importantly, guidelines for this particular group of patients with UC are still lacking. To inform therapeutic decision-making, we describe three consecutive cases of patients with active UC and COVID-19 and discuss their treatments based on theoretical knowledge, currently available evidence and clinical observations. Three patients were identified through our national inflammatory bowel disease network [Initiative on Crohns and Colitis (ICC)] for whom diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection was established by reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in nasopharynx, stools, and/or biopsies. Acute severe UC was diagnosed by clinical parameters, endoscopy, and histopathology. Clinical guidelines for SARS-CoV-2-negative patients advocate the use of steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-)-antagonists as induction therapy, and experiences from the current three cases show that steroids and TNF--antagonists could also be used in patients with COVID-19. This could potentially be followed by TNF--antagonists, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab as maintenance therapy in these patients. Future research is warranted to investigate if, and which, immunomodulatory drugs should be used for COVID-19 patients that present with active UC. To answer this question, it is of utmost importance that future cases of patients with UC and COVID-19 are documented carefully in international registries, such as the SECURE-IBD registry.","output":"Treatment of severe acute ulcerative colitis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients: report of three cases and discussion of treatment options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens that cause infection in susceptible host cells. Virus infections could be lytic, chronic, latent or immortalizing. Viruses causing latent infection are associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The human body is protected from viral infection by physical and chemical barriers. However, when these barriers are breached, the body generates an antiviral immune response mediated by Natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, Dendritic Cells (DCs), type I interferon (IFN), neutralizing antibodies, and T cells. DCs play an important role in generating a cell-mediated adaptive immune response to viruses, with conventional DCs playing a crucial role in the interactions between DCs and viruses. Crosstalk between NK cells and DCs facilitates DC maturation in antiviral innate immunity whereas crosstalk between DCs and T cells in antiviral adaptive immunity amplifies the function of mature DC. Viruses employ various strategies to evade the host immune system. They can block Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) - mediated production of type I IFNs, inhibit maturation and functionality of DCs, and interfere with cell-mediated immunity. Here we will focus on important human disease-causing viruses including latest COVID19 that caused worldwide pandemic.

It is known that bacterial infections represent a common complication during viral respiratory tract infections such as influenza, with a concomitant increase in morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, the prevalence of bacterial co-infections and secondary infections in critically ill patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not well understood yet. We performed a review of the literature currently available to examine the incidence of bacterial secondary infections acquired during hospital stay and the risk factors associated with multidrug resistance. Most of the studies, mainly retrospective and single-centered, highlighted that the incidence of co-infections is low, affecting about 3.5% of hospitalized patients, while the majority are hospital acquired infections, developed later, generally 10C15 days after ICU admission. The prolonged ICU hospitalization and the extensive use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs during the COVID-19 outbreak might have contributed to the selection of pathogens with different profiles of resistance. Consequently, the reported incidence of MDR bacterial infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, ranging between 32% to 50%. MDR infections are linked to a higher length of stay in ICU but not to a higher risk of death. The only risk factor independently associated with MDR secondary infections reported was invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 1.062; 95% CI 1.012C1.114), but also steroid therapy and prolonged length of ICU stay may play a pivotal role. The empiric antimicrobial therapy for a ventilated patient with suspected or proven bacterial co-infection at ICU admission should be prescribed judiciously and managed according to a stewardship program in order to interrupt or adjust it on the basis of culture results.","output":"Multi-Drug Resistance Bacterial Infections in Critically Ill Patients Admitted with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: New Medicine Service (NMS) is a community pharmacy service that can increase adherence among patients with a newly diagnosed chronic disease. NMS must be carried out by a pharmacist, which is a barrier for some pharmacy units with no pharmacist physically present. Video communication might be a way to overcome this barrier. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore both patients' and community pharmacy staff's attitudes of video-based NMS in a community pharmacy setting. METHODS: Semi-structured, telephone interviews were conducted with patients who have participated in video-based NMS. Focus groups with pharmacists who have carried out the video-based NMS and with staff that referred patients to the video-based NMS were conducted at community pharmacies. Thematic inductive analysis was used to analyse the interviews and focus groups. RESULTS: In total, 10 patient interviews were conducted, along with one focus group with four pharmacists and one focus group with 10 referring staff. Three main themes emerged during the analysis: (i) Talking to a screen, (ii) content of the NMS, and (iii) tackling the technique. Patients reported that their questions for the pharmacists were the same as if the NMS had been face-to-face. Pharmacists felt that they appeared more professional on video and that non-medical related conversation was reduced compared with ordinary face-to-face NMS. The referring staff either preferred referring to a video-based NMS over an ordinary face-to-face NMS or had no preferences.

To overcome this obstacle, multiple bioreactor designs have been tested for EV production with varying success, but the consistency of EVs produced over time in these systems has not been reported previously. In this study, we demonstrate that several breast cancer cell lines of different subtypes can be cultured simultaneously in space, resource, and time efficient manner using CELLine AD 1000 systems, allowing the consistent production of vast amounts of EVs for downstream experimentation.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of IPA in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We prospectively screened 32 critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia for a time period of 28 days using a standardized study protocol for oberservation of developement of COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We collected laboratory, microbiological, virological and clinical parameters at defined timepoints in combination with galactomannan-antigen-detection from bronchial aspirates. We used logistic regression analyses to assess if COVID-19 was independently associated with IPA and compared it with matched controls. Findings: CAPA was diagnosed at a median of 4 days after ICU admission in 11/32 (34%) of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to 8% in the control cohort. In the COVID-19 cohort, mean age, APACHE II score and ICU mortality were higher in patients with CAPA than in patients without CAPA (36% versus 9.5%; p<0.001). ICU stay (21 versus 17 days; p=0.340) and days of mechanical ventilation (20 versus 15 days; p=0.570) were not different between both groups. In regression analysis COVID-19 and APACHE II score were independently associated with IPA. Interpretation: CAPA is highly prevalent and associated with a high mortality rate.

This meta-analysis quantifies the prevalence of mortality among (1) diabetic and (2) non-diabetic, and (3) the prevalence of DM, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published studies were retrieved from four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and medRxiv) and appraised critically utilizing the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's tool. Meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects model. The measures of heterogeneity were ascertained by I- squared (I 2 ) and Chi-squared (Chi 2 ) tests statistics. Predictors of heterogeneity were quantified using meta-regression models. Results: Of the reviewed 475 publications, 22 studies (chiefly case series (59.09 %)), sourcing data of 45,775 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, were deemed eligible. The weighted prevalence of mortality in hospitlized COVID-19 patients with DM (20.0 %, 95 % CI: 15.0-26.0; I 2 , 96.8 %) was 82 % (1.82-time) higher than that in non-DM patients (11.0 %, 95 % CI: 5.0-16.0; I 2 , 99.3 %). The prevalence of mortality among DM patients was highest in Europe (28.0 %; 95 % CI: 14.0-44.0) followed by the United States (20.0 %, 95 % CI: 11.0-32.0) and Asia (17.0 %, 95 % CI: 8.0-28.0). Sample size and severity of the COVID-19 were associated (p < 0.05) with variability in the prevalence of mortality. The weighted prevalence of DM among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 20 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 15-25, I 2 , 99.3 %). Overall, the quality of the studies was fair. Conclusions: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were appreciably burdened with a high prevalence of DM.

Shortness of breath is one of the hallmark symptoms of COVID-19 infection. The main medical management for shortness of breath in COVID-19 infection is oxygen therapy. Physiotherapy and medical rehabilitation such as breathing exercise and chest physiotherapy can be adjuvant therapy that effectively improves breathing effort in COVID-19 patients. This case report will describe breathing exercises and chest therapy done in a patient with a COVID-19 infection. Case: In this study, we presented the case of a 53-year-old female patient with complaints of fever, cough, fatigue, anosmia, shortness of breath, and diagnosis with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on swab PCR result. On admission in the isolation ward, the patient was on non-invasive ventilation (NIV), medical medication, and physical therapy. The physical therapy done in this patient was breathing exercise and chest therapy once daily. After four series of chest therapy and breathing exercise, the shortness of breath and her breathing effort was improved. The patient was discharged after 15 days of hospitalization.

Results of molecular docking simulations revealed that human furin protease might be targeted by COVID-19. Remdesivir, a nucleic acid derivative, strongly bound to the active site of this protease, suggesting that this molecule can be used as a template for designing novel furin protease inhibitors to fight against the disease.

Causal inference provides a means of investigating causality in non-randomised experiments. Here we report 14-day improvement as well as 30-day and 90-day mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first 86 patients (period 1) received optimal supportive care only; the second 86 patients (period 2) received methylprednisolone and (if necessary) tocilizumab, in addition to optimal supportive care. The main outcomes were 14-day clinical improvement and 30-day and 90-day survival. An 80% decline in C reactive protein (CRP) was recorded on or before day 13 (CRP >100 mg/L was an inclusion criterion). Non-linear mediation analysis was performed to decompose CRP-mediated effects of immunosuppression (defined as natural indirect effects) and non-CRP-mediated effects attributable to natural prognostic differences between periods (defined as natural direct effects). RESULTS: The natural direct (non-CRP-mediated) effects for period 2 versus period 1 showed an OR of 1.38 (38% better) for 14-day improvement and an OR of 1.16 (16% better) for 30-day and 90-day survival. The natural indirect (CRP-mediated) effects for period 2 showed an OR of 2.27 (127% better) for 14-day improvement, an OR of 1.60 (60% better) for 30-day survival and an OR of 1.49 (49% better) for 90-day survival. The number needed to treat was 5 for 14-day improvement, 9 for survival on day 30, and 10 for survival on day 90. CONCLUSION: Causal inference with non-linear mediation analysis further substantiates the claim that a brief but intensive treatment with immunosuppressants in patients with COVID-19 and systemic hyperinflammation adds to rapid recovery and saves lives. Causal inference is an alternative to conventional trial analysis, when randomised controlled trials are considered unethical, unfeasible or impracticable.","output":"COVID-19-induced hyperinflammation, immunosuppression, recovery and survival: how causal inference may help draw robust conclusions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 14.5 million infections and 6,04,917 deaths in 212 countries over the last few months.

Many of those ED visits result in hospitalization, and the length of stay varies. OBJECTIVES The objective of our study was to identify the patients who were only briefly hospitalized and were thus eligible for safe discharge from the ED. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study conducted on all adult patients who have completed a successful BMT and had an ED visit that resulted in hospitalization. RESULTS Our study included 115 unique BMT with a total number of 357 ED visits. Around half of those visits resulted in a short hospitalization. We found higher odds of a short hospitalization among those who have undergone autologous BMT (95%CI [1.14-2.65]). Analysis of the discharge diagnoses showed that patients with gastroenteritis were more likely to have a shorter hospitalization in comparison to those diagnosed with others (95%CI [1.10-3.81]). Furthermore, we showed that patients who presented after a month from their procedure were more likely to have a short hospitalization (95%CI [1.04-4.87]). Another significant predictor of a short of hospitalization was the absence of Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) (95%CI [2.53-12.28]). Additionally, patients with normal and high systolic blood pressure (95%CI [2.22-6.73] and 95%CI [2.81-13.05]; respectively), normal respiratory rate (95%CI [2.79-10.17]) and temperature (95%CI [2.91-7.44]) were more likely to have a shorter hospitalization, compared to those presenting with abnormal vitals. Likewise, we proved higher odds of a short hospitalization in patients with a quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment score of 1-2 (95%CI [1.29-5.20]). Moreover, we demonstrated higher odds of a short hospitalization in patients with a normal platelet count (95%CI [1.39-3.36]) and creatinine level (95%CI [1.30-6.18]). CONCLUSION In our study, we have shown that BMT patients visit the ED frequently and many of those visits result in a short hospitalization. Our study showed that patients presenting with fever/chills are less likely to have a short hospitalization. We also showed a significant association between a short hospitalization and BMT patients without GvHD, with normal RR, normal T C and a normal platelet count.","output":"Predictors of a short hospitalization in bone marrow transplantation patients presenting to the emergency department."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced medical schools in the Philippines to stop face-to-face learning activities and abruptly shift to an online curriculum. This study aimed to identify barriers to online learning from the perspective of medical students in a developing country. Methods: The authors sent out an electronic survey to medical students in the Philippines from 11 to 24 May 2020. Using a combination of multiple-choice, Likert scale, and open-ended questions, the following data were obtained: demographics, medical school information, access to technological resources, study habits, living conditions, self-assessment of capacity for and perceived barriers to online learning, and proposed interventions. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Responses were compared between student subgroups using nonparametric tests. Results: Among 3670 medical students, 93% owned a smartphone and 83% had a laptop or desktop computer. To access online resources, 79% had a postpaid internet subscription while 19% used prepaid mobile data. Under prevailing conditions, only 1505 students (41%) considered themselves physically and mentally capable of engaging in online learning. Barriers were classified under five categories: technological, individual, domestic, institutional, and community barriers. Discussion: Medical students in the Philippines confronted several interrelated barriers as they tried to adapt to online learning. Most frequently encountered were difficulty adjusting learning styles, having to perform responsibilities at home, and poor communication between educators and learners. By implementing student-centered interventions, medical schools and educators play a significant role in addressing these challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

We compared the number of patients in 2020 to the average number of patients from 2016 to 2019.

The overall effect of semen on viral infection and transmission have yet to be fully investigated. In the present study, we aimed at the effect of seminal plasma (SP) on viral infection by focusing on the mumps viral (MuV) infection of HeLa cells. MuV efficiently infected HeLa cells in vitro. MuV infection was strongly inhibited by the pre-treatment of viruses with SP. SP inhibited MuV infection through the impairment of the viruss attachment to cells. The antiviral activity of SP was resistant to the treatment of SP with boiling water, Proteinase K, RNase A, and DNase I, suggesting that the antiviral factor would not be proteins and nucleic acids. PNGase or PLA2 treatments did not abrogate the antiviral effect of SP against MuV. Further, we showed that the prostatic fluid (PF) showed similar inhibition as SP, whereas the epididymal fluid and seminal vesicle extract did not inhibit MuV infection. Both SP and PF also inhibited MuV infection of other cell types, including another human cervical carcinoma cell line C33a, mouse primary epididymal epithelial cells, and Sertoli cell line 15P1. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was not specific to MuV, as the herpes simplex virus 1, dengue virus 2, and adenovirus 5 infections were also inhibited by SP and PF.

Eighty-nine patients, 66 (74.1%) men and 23 (25.9%) women, with a median age of 67.1 years, were recruited. Sixty-eight patients (76.4%) had at least one infection, and 11 patients (12.3%) were colonized, while in the remaining 10 patients (11.2%) neither colonization nor infection occurred. In total, 173 microorganisms were isolated. There were 73 isolates (42.2%) causing bacterial or fungal infections while the remaining 100 isolates (57.8%) were colonizers. Among Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae were the most common species. Among Gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus and E. faecalis were the most common species. Overall, there were 58/105 (55.2%) and 22/59 (37.2%) MDR isolates among Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. The prevalence of an MDR microorganism was significantly higher in those patients who had been exposed to empiric antibiotic treatment before ICU admission.

As establishing baseline thoracic radiography for the cynomolgus monkey is essential, we tested the hypothesis that age and sex may affect the thoracic radiography parameters of this species. METHODS: Here, 697 healthy cynomolgus monkeys were segregated by sex and age (three age groups: 25C36 months, 37C48 months, 49C60 months). The lung length (LL), maximal interior thoracic depth (TD), maximal interior thoracic breadth (TBr), cardiac silhouette breadth (CBr), cardiothoracic ratio (CR), right and left costophrenic angles (RCA and LCA), and right hilar height ratio (R-HHR) were assessed by chest film. Statistical analysis was applied to examine the effect of age, sex, and age  sex interactions. RESULTS: Significant effects by age were shown for LL, TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Significant effects by sex were found for TD, TBr, CBr, CR, and R-HHR. Significant effects by age  sex were observed for TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Both TD and TBr increased with age in both sexes, and both were significantly higher in males than in females in the group aged 49C60 months. CBr increased with age and was significantly higher in males than in females across all age groups. CR declined with age and was significantly higher in males than females across all age groups, and CR was similar or slightly higher relative to those previously found in other non-human primate species. As to the other parameters with no significant sex nor age-related differences, the R-HHR was greater than 1.00, and the angulation of bilateral costophrenic angles were sharp.

However, it can have severe adverse effects, such as rectal bleeding, perforation, and sepsis. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report the case of a healthy 28-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset diffuse abdominal pain and hematochezia. He had undergone stapled hemorrhoidopexy 5days earlier and was discharged after an uneventful postoperative course. For the present condition, after immediate evaluation, we successfully performed emergency laparoscopic repair of the rectal perforation without any stoma. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 16. DISCUSSION This is a rare case of rectal perforation after stapled hemorrhoidopexy in which the perforation was treated successfully by laparoscopic repair. In most cases of rectal perforation following stapled hemorrhoidopexy, surgeons perform open laparotomy and create diverting stoma. However, our patient underwent totally laparoscopic lavage and primary closure without diverting stoma. Multiple investigators have reported that laparoscopic lavage for perforated diverticulitis may be an appropriate treatment option. Factors favoring this approach include early surgery, young age, sufficient irrigation, and meticulous primary closure. CONCLUSION Stapled hemorrhoidopexy can have severe adverse effects, such as rectal bleeding, pelvic sepsis, and rectal perforation, which are potentially life-threatening.

Patient characteristics were compared between 2020 and 2019.The incidence rate of STEMI admission in March-April 2020 was lower than those in March-April 2015-2019, 36 vs. 56 cases per 100 000 inhabitants/year [relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.42-0.96, P = 0.045]. Considering that the incidence rates were constant in the past years (P = 0.24), the turnaround in 2020 is most likely due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Interestingly, this reduction was a dynamic phenomenon with a U-shaped curve during the 2-month period. System-of-care times were similar between 2020 and 2019; however in 2020, patients presented more frequently signs of heart failure compared to 2019 (Killip class 2 in 68% vs. 29%, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a marked reduction in the STEMI incidence rate. This U-shaped phenomenon demands attention because a potential cause for the decrease in STEMI incidence may include the avoidance of medical care. Public campaigns aiming to increase awareness of ischemic symptoms may be needed during community outbreak.","output":"COVID-19 impact on ST-elevation myocardial infarction incidence rate in a north-eastern Italian STEMI network: a U-shaped curve phenomenon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parents of autistic children are routinely advised to raise them monolingually, despite potential negative effects of monolingualism and no evidence of harm from bilingualism.

Contingency management (CM) is one of the most effective behavioral interventions when delivered in combination with medication for opioid use disorder, but its implementation in opioid treatment programs is woefully limited. Project MIMIC (Maximizing Implementation of Motivational Incentives in Clinics) was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to identify effective strategies for helping opioid treatment programs improve CM implementation as an adjunct to medication. Specific aims will test the impact of two different strategies on implementation outcomes (primary aim) and patient outcomes (secondary aims), as well as test putative mediators of implementation effectiveness (exploratory aim). METHODS: A 3-cohort, cluster-randomized, type 3 hybrid design is used with the opioid treatment programs as the unit of randomization. Thirty programs are randomized to one of two conditions. The control condition is the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network implementation strategy, which consists of three core approaches: didactic training, performance feedback, and on-going consultation. The experimental condition is an enhanced ATTC strategy, with the same core ATTC elements plus two additional theory-driven elements. The two additional elements are Pay-for-Performance, which aims to increase implementing staffs extrinsic motivations, and Implementation & Sustainment Facilitation, which targets staffs intrinsic motivations. Data will be collected using a novel, CM Tracker tool to document CM session delivery, session audio recordings, provider surveys, and patient surveys. Implementation outcomes include CM Exposure (number of CM sessions delivered per patient), CM Skill (ratings of CM fidelity), and CM Sustainment (number of patients receiving CM after removal of support). Patient outcomes include self-reported opioid abstinence and opioid-related problems (both assessed at 3- and 6-months post-baseline). DISCUSSION: There is urgent public health need to improve the implementation of CM as an adjunct to medication for opioid use disorder. Consistent with its hybrid type 3 design, Project MIMIC is advancing implementation science by comparing impacts of these two multifaceted strategies on both implementation and patient outcomes, and by examining the extent to which the impacts of those strategies can be explained by putative mediators.

Gram-negative bacteria are the key problematic agents among the human population in overexpressing resistance against ?-lactam antibiotics. These ?-lactam antibiotics being experimentally well studied still lack the key information and mechanism for their resistance. The structural information of the ampC protein is unknown and poorly studied; hence, it is the need of the hour to find effective inhibitors against it. In our study, the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of ampC protein from Morganella morganii was performed using a comparative modelling approach. The predicted structure was energetically stabilized and functional conformations were mapped through 100-ns molecular dynamics simulation runs. Also, Ramachandran plot shows the model to be stereo-chemically stable with most residues found under core allowed regions. Drug screening with several experimentally tested inhibitors was then confirmed to check the activity against ampC protein using an AutoDock tool. The results suggested OncoglabrinolC molecule as the best inhibitor (out of 21 drug molecules) with a binding affinity of - 11.44 kcal/mol. Anti-bacterial/anti-parasitic inhibitors have not only been used against bacterial infections, but later reports have also shown them to work against deadly viruses such as SARS-CoV2.

The role of inflammation in myocardial injury remains unclear. We sought to determine the association of elevated troponin with mortality in a large, ethnically diverse population of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and to determine the association of elevated inflammatory markers with increased troponin levels. We reviewed all patients admitted at our health system with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 27, 2020, who had a troponin assessment within 48 hours of admission. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for mortality during hospitalization, controlling for demographics, co-morbidities, and markers of inflammation. Of 11,159 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 6,247 had a troponin assessment within 48 hours. Of these, 4,426 (71%) patients had normal, 919 (15%) had mildly elevated, and 902 (14%) had severely elevated troponin. Acute phase and inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in patients with mildly and severely elevated troponin compared with normal troponin. Patients with elevated troponin had significantly increased odds of death for mildly elevated compared with normal troponin (adjusted OR, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.68 to 2.53; p < 0.001) and for severely elevated compared with normal troponin (OR, 4.51; 95% confidence interval, 3.66 to 5.54; p < 0.001) independently of elevation in inflammatory markers.

The prevalence of this disease is high in Jazan province, Saudi Arabia. The current protocol for the treatment of SCD is mainly based on alleviating signs and symptoms to avoid severe complications. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is considered a definitive therapy for SCD. However, there is a long patient waiting list for HSCT in Saudi Arabia. A lack of community awareness and incorrect information about the importance of HSCT in SCD treatment is believed to be contributing to the shortage in HSCT. Thus, this study aims to assess community awareness and attitudes toward HSCT as a cure for SCD in Jazan province, Saudi Arabia. Methods: An observational cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted in Jazan province. General and demographic data were collected and pretested survey including questions about public knowledge and attitude toward HSCT for SCD were answered. Both t-test and chi-square tests were used for analysis. Results: 1167 participants were included in this study with a mean age of 26 (SD: 8). About 50% of the study participants believed that SCD can be treated and 78% of the study participants already have heard about HSCT. About 57% of the participants defined HSCT correctly and 42% were willing to donate. Better knowledge and positive attitude toward HSCT were significantly reported among patients with SCD or their relatives as well as among people with higher education and healthcare workers (HCW). Conclusion: About 57% of the study participants were able to define HSCT and most related questions were answered correctly. A positive correlation was found between the knowledge about HSCT and people with higher education or those who were diagnosed with SCD or their relatives and friends. Further, only 42% of our study participants were willing to donate, a percent that is positively associated with better knowledge about HSCT. National education programs are needed to enhance the overall awareness of Jazan communities toward HSCT which could contribute to reducing the number of patients waiting for HSCT.","output":"Awareness and Acceptance of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease in Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review aimed to focus on using foods to boost immunity against COVID-19 in all age groups. In human, coronavirus causes the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and a major threat to public health. The novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization due to its rapid infectivity. COVID-19 infection is most probably reported in people with low immunity response. The nutrients, which show beneficial effects on the immune system, are called immune nutrients and diet is called immune diet. A healthy diet can reduce the risk of infection of COVID-19 and can prevent disease. Nutritional food intake is also necessary for people with chronic illness, obese persons, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction like anxiety and depression. All nutrients are essential for maintaining immunity and providing appropriate amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, and minerals for the surveillance mode of keeping us from getting sick. The use of plenty of water, minerals such as micronutrients, zinc, copper, selenium, iron, magnesium, food rich in vitamins, and a good lifestyle can promote health and overwhelm this coronavirus infection.

To facilitate optimal occupational performance for children with SFAs, it is critical that clinicians understand child behaviour and caregiver strategy use to manage child behaviour during meals. The purpose of this paper is to examine the reliability of a novel coding scheme, the Behavioural Mealtime Coding System (BMCS) and identify associations among child acceptance of preferred and targeted foods, child food exploration and caregiver use of strategies to manage child behaviour. METHODS Twenty-one children (aged 18-60 months) with SFAs and their caregivers were recruited using a convenience sample. An observational video coding system was developed to code mealtime behaviour in 63 typical mealtime videos recorded by caregivers in the home environment. Inter-rater reliability, descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations were calculated. RESULTS The BMCS demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = .95). Child bites of targeted foods were associated with mealtime duration (rs = .51, p = .02) and events of the child licking food (rs = .57, p = .007). Caregiver use of threats was positively associated with child age (rs = .48, p = .03) and negatively associated with caregiver education level (rs = -.49, p = .03). CONCLUSION For children with SFAs, increasing mealtime duration by embedding positive activities to encourage food exploration may improve acceptance of healthy targeted foods. Future research is needed to better understand the complex relationships among caregiver strategy use, mealtime duration and child mealtime behaviour.","output":"Mealtime behaviours of young children with sensory food aversions: An observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the case of an asymptomatic (no fever, no cough, no dyspnea) 80-year-old woman who had an F-FDG PET/CT scan for initial staging of Lieberkhnian adenocarcinoma located on anal canal.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates qualitative outcomes with data insights from the electronic health record, to contrast satisfaction outcomes with the actual use of VC. METHODS: Healthcare providers and patients using VC during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large academic centre in the Netherlands were surveyed for user satisfaction and experiences with VC. In addition, quantitative technical assessment was performed using data related to VC from the EHR record. RESULTS: In total, 1,027/4,443 patients and 87/166 healthcare providers completed their online questionnaire. Users rated the use of VC during a pandemic with an average score of 8.3/10 and 7.6/10 respectively. Both groups believed the use of VC was a good solution to continue the provision of healthcare during this pandemic. The use of VC increased from 92 in March 2020 to 837 in April 2020. CONCLUSION: This study strongly signals that VC is an important modality in futureproofing outpatient care during and beyond pandemic times. Further development in end-user technology is needed for EHR integrated VC solutions. Guidelines needs to be developed advising both patients and healthcare providers. Such guidelines should not solely focus on technical implementation and troubleshooting, but must also consider important aspects such as digital health literacy, patient and provider authentication, privacy and ethics.","output":"Emergency upscaling of video consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic: Contrasting user experience with data insights from the electronic health record in a large academic hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the ongoing COVID\\\\19 pandemic, there is a global concern about patients presenting with inflammatory syndrome with variable clinical features.

While systemic application of niclosamide may lead to unwanted side effects, local administration via aerosol may circumvent these problems, particularly when the drug is encapsulated into small polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrospheres. In the present study, we examined whether PEG-encapsulated niclosamide inhibits the production of mucus and affects the pro-inflammatory mediator CLCA1 in mouse airways in vivo, while effects on mucociliary clearance were assessed in excised mouse tracheas. The potential of encapsulated niclosamide to inhibit TMEM16A whole-cell Cl(?) currents and intracellular Ca(2+) signalling was assessed in airway epithelial cells in vitro. We achieved encapsulation of niclosamide in PEG-microspheres and PEG-nanospheres (Niclo-spheres). When applied to asthmatic mice via intratracheal instillation, Niclo-spheres strongly attenuated overproduction of mucus, inhibited secretion of the major proinflammatory mediator CLCA1, and improved mucociliary clearance in tracheas ex vivo. These effects were comparable for niclosamide encapsulated in PEG-nanospheres and PEG-microspheres. Niclo-spheres inhibited the Ca(2+) activated Cl(?) channel TMEM16A and attenuated mucus production in CFBE and Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. Both inhibitory effects were explained by a pronounced inhibition of intracellular Ca(2+) signals. The data indicate that poorly dissolvable compounds such as niclosamide can be encapsulated in PEG-microspheres/nanospheres and deposited locally on the airway epithelium as encapsulated drugs, which may be advantageous over systemic application.","output":"Airway Delivery of Hydrogel-Encapsulated Niclosamide for the Treatment of Inflammatory Airway Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tetraspanin family of proteins participates in numerous fundamental signaling pathways involved in viral transmission, virus-specific immunity, and virus-mediated vesicular trafficking.

However, few studies have investigated telemedicine from the perspective of the patient experience. OBJECTIVE To evaluate patient satisfaction scores of telemedicine outpatient clinic visits in neurosurgery in comparison with in-person visits. METHODS After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, Press Ganey surveys from 3/1/2019 to 9/15/2020 were evaluated retrospectively from single-institution, academic neurosurgical clinics. Due to the non-normality of our data, stratified Wilcoxon tests were performed with correction for care provider differences. Domain score probability values were corrected for multiple comparisons. Average scores (range 20-100) are documented as mean  standard deviation. RESULTS The response rates were 20% (97 responders) for telemedicine visits and 19% (589 responders) for in-person visits. Patient overall satisfaction score was slightly higher with telemedicine visits compared to in-person corrected for care provider differences (94.2  12.2 vs 93.1  13.4, p = 0.085). The care provider domain demonstrated no statistically significant difference in telemedicine compared to in-person (94.7  14.4 vs 92.4  16.5, p = 0.096). The access domain (93.7  12.3 vs 93.4  12.4, p = 0.999) and overall domains (94.1  12.1 vs 94.4  13.4, p = 1.000) were not found to be different between visit types. CONCLUSION Telemedicine appears to be a valuable option for neurosurgical patients and is not significantly different to in-person visits in all domains. This study demonstrates that telemedicine visits result in comparable satisfaction scores by neurosurgical patients, and providers should continue offering this option to their patients as we approach the post-COVID era.","output":"Patient satisfaction scores with telemedicine in the neurosurgical population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women have been identified as a potentially at\\\\risk group concerning COVID\\\\19 infection, but little is known regarding the susceptibility of the fetus to infection. Co\\\\expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 has been identified as a prerequisite for infection, and expression across different tissues is known to vary between children and adults. However, the expression of these proteins in the fetus is unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a single cell data repository. The data were then validated at both gene and protein level by performing RT\\\\qPCR and two\\\\colour immunohistochemistry on a library of second\\\\trimester human fetal tissues. FINDINGS: TMPRSS2 is present at both gene and protein level in the predominantly epithelial fetal tissues analysed. ACE2 is present at significant levels only in the fetal intestine and kidney, and is not expressed in the fetal lung. The placenta also does not co\\\\express the two proteins across the second trimester or at term. INTERPRETATION: This dataset indicates that the lungs are unlikely to be a viable route of SARS\\\\CoV2 fetal infection. The fetal kidney, despite presenting both the proteins required for the infection, is anatomically protected from the exposure to the virus. However, the gastrointestinal tract is likely to be susceptible to infection due to its high co\\\\expression of both proteins, as well as its exposure to potentially infected amniotic fluid.

There is no agreed model of care for chronic pain management services in Ireland. Previous studies have assessed the extent of services in Ireland without examining waiting times for access to services. AIMS: This study aimed to quantify the extent of, geographical distribution of and waiting times for access to publicly funded chronic pain management services in Ireland. METHODS: Using the British Pain Societys Core Standards for Pain Management Services in the UK (2015) and International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) recommendations, a questionnaire was devised. Publically funded departments in Ireland were contacted and questionnaires completed. Waiting list data was publicly available and obtained from the National Treatment Purchase Fund website. RESULTS: There was a 100% response rate. Sixteen publicly funded chronic pain management services were identified. There are 27 chronic pain management consultants (16.6 whole time equivalents (WTE)) practicing chronic pain management, amounting to 0.55 specialists (0.34 WTEs)/100,000 of the population. There are 21 WTE for non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs), 26.5 WTEs for nursing, 8 WTEs for physiotherapy and 6.2 WTEs for psychology, nationally. A percentage of 93.75% of departments (n = 15) provide interventional therapies, 37.5% (n = 6) provide advanced neuromodulation and 43.75% (n = 7) are managing intrathecal pump therapies. There are five pain management programmes nationally. As of January 2020, ~ 25% patients on waiting lists for outpatient appointments were waiting > 18 months, with ~ 17% patients on waiting lists for interventional treatments waiting > 12 months.

The main trends and prospects for the development of oil and gas resources extraction in the Russian Arctic in the digitalization sphere were identified. Together with this, the researchers considered prospects for digital technologies' introduction into the oil and gas industry, observing their competition with RES. As a result, the authors have come to the following conclusions: (1) in Russian companies, digitalization is being more actively introduced into the processes of general enterprise management. (2) The main purpose of Russian oil and gas sector digitalization is to increase the efficiency of business process management, while the key constraining factors of digitalization are the lack of qualified personnel, lack of material and technical base and cyber-security threats aggravation. (3) The prospects of introducing a new package of sanctions can become both an incentive for a qualitative leap in Russian software development/implementation and an obstacle to the development of Arctic projects due to their rise in price. (4) The COVID-19 pandemic factor is one of the incentives for the widespread introduction of production and various business processes automation in the oil and gas industry, as well as the development of digital communications.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a unique visceral fat, presents with high degree of inflammation in severe COVID-19 disease. Whether and how adipose tissue may respond to the COVID-19 therapies is unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the difference in computed tomography (CT) measured EAT and subcutaneous (SAT) attenuation, defined as mean attenuation expressed in Hounsfield units (HU), in 72 patients [meanSD age was 59.612.4 years, 50 (69%) were men] at the hospital admission for COVID-19 and 99 days [IQR (71-129)] after discharge. RESULTS: At the admission, EAT HU was significantly correlated with blood glucose levels, interleukin 6 , troponin T levels and waist circumference. EAT HU decreased from -87.2116.18 to -100.011 (p<0.001) whereas SAT HU did not change (-110.2112.1 to -111.1127.82, p=0.78) after therapy.

However, they also described some interactional challenges related to participants talking over one another, and suggested more active moderating to facilitate greater turn-taking. The respondents descriptions of the PWDs response suggested a much less successful transition to teleconferencing.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS The study included 56 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (dialysis group) and a control group composed of 95 health care workers. All participants had received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. The serology testing was done using Quant II IgG anti-Spike severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay by Abbott a median of 30 days after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. RESULTS All subjects in the control group developed an antibody response compared with 96% (54 of 56) positive responders in the dialysis group. The IgG levels in the dialysis group (median, 2900; interquartile range, 1128-5651) were significantly lower than in the control group (median, 7401; interquartile range, 3687-15,471). A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that this difference was statistically significant (U=1238; P<0.001). There was a significant inverse correlation of age and IgG levels in both groups. The odds of being in the lower quartile were significantly higher for older individuals (odds ratio, 1.11 per year of age; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.20; P=0.004) and for the dialysis group compared with the control group (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 7.51; P=0.05).

Within the field of maternal and child health (MCH), it is considered a critical professional duty. However, MCH has yet to explicitly embrace mentorship practice as a means to address workforce challenges including turnover, knowledge loss, and undue burden on the part of historically oppressed individuals and communities to overturn oppressive systems. CALL TO ACTION: We advocate for public calls for diversity and equity to be met with strategic enhancement of the practice of MCH mentorship. Transformative MCH mentorship should be used to promote positive identity formation, understanding of self in context, efficacy, and sustained commitment to working with MCH populations in ways that are inclusive and prevent the perpetration of the problematic power dynamics that lead to inequitable outcomes. RECOMMENDATIONS: We present recommendations to strengthen MCH mentorship practice. At the individual level, there should be a refreshment of norms and expectations, where mentorship is seen as a uniquely flexible opportunity for mutual learning. At the organizational level, embedding mentorship in all aspects of practice helps establish and sustain a culture of belonging. This transformative organizational culture can attract and retain future generations of professionals that are not only more representative of the populations that MCH programs support but are prepared to authentically elevate the needs and strengths of those populations.

The Mayo Clinic Bayesian SIR model, recently made publicly available, has informed Mayo Clinic practice leadership at all sites across the United States and has been shared with Minnesota governmental leadership to help inform critical decisions during the past year.

Washing and sanitizing hands (n=4990, 87.9%) and avoiding public places and crowds (n=4865, 85.7%) were identified as the protective measures most frequently used against COVID-19. Social media was the most utilized source for information on the disease (n=4740, 83.5%), followed by the World Health Organization (n=2844, 50.1%). Subgroup analysis revealed that younger subjects (<35 years), males, and those working or studying in health care reported a higher perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19, whereas older subjects, females, and those working or studying in nonChealth care areas reported a lower perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19. Similar trends were observed for vaccination against COVID-19, with older subjects, females, and those working or studying in nonChealth care sectors reporting a lower likelihood of vaccinating against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are indicative of a relatively well-informed cohort implementing appropriate protective measures. However, key knowledge deficiencies exist with regards to vaccination against COVID-19, which future efforts should aim at correcting.","output":"Perceptions, Knowledge, and Behaviors Related to COVID-19 Among Social Media Users: Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We measure the benefit to society created by preventing COVID-19 deaths through a marginal increase in early social distancing.

METHODS This study was an open-label single-center randomized controlled trial of a simple intervention to improve mask use performed at Eskenazi Hospital between April 2020 and October 2020. We permitted participants to either use their own mask or the surgical/cloth mask that we provided. We then randomized the participants to either the control group (no tape over the mask/nose) or to the intervention group (tape placed over the face mask at the bridge of the nose). The primary outcome of this study was the frequency at which participants correctly wore their masks upon reevaluation at 60 minutes. A subgroup analysis based on the mask type compared adherence in those with a hospital-provided mask versus in those with a patient-supplied mask. RESULTS We enrolled 123 participants in this trial. At 60 minutes, 100% of the intervention group participants were correctly wearing their masks versus 69% of control participants (absolute risk reduction, 31%; 95% CI, 19% to 43%; number needed to treat=3.2 patients). Subjects who were observed wearing their masks incorrectly exhibited some combination of either their mask removed or their nose and/or mouth exposed. Hospital-provided masks were not more likely to be worn correctly (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 0.9 to 12.3).

Ravulizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement protein C5 and inhibits terminal complement activation, is being evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19-related severe pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in an ongoing phase 3 randomized controlled trial (ALXN1210-COV-305). To address the overactivation of terminal complement in severe COVID-19 compared to the diseases in which ravulizumab is currently approved, a modified dosing regimen was adopted. This analysis evaluates preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data to confirm the modified dosing regimen. METHODS: Weight-based ravulizumab doses were administered on days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Serum levels of ravulizumab and free C5 were measured before and after administration of ravulizumab and any time on day 22. Free C5 levels < 0.5 g/mL indicate complete C5 inhibition. The pharmacokinetic target was defined as ravulizumab concentrations at the end of the dosing interval > 175 g/mL, the concentration above which C5 is completely inhibited. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included in this evaluation. At baseline, mean C5 concentration was 240  67 g/mL. In all patients and at all individual timepoints after the first dose was administered, ravulizumab concentrations remained > 175 g/mL and free C5 concentrations remained < 0.5 g/mL. CONCLUSION: High levels of baseline C5 observed in patients with severe COVID-19 contribute to the growing body of evidence that suggests this disease is marked by amplification of terminal complement activation. Data from this preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation of 22 patients with severe COVID-19 show that the modified ravulizumab dosing regimen achieved immediate and complete terminal complement inhibition, which can be sustained for up to 22 days. These data support the continued use of this dosage regimen in the ongoing phase 3 study.

Machine learning algorithms have the potential to be superior to traditional prediction methods for the prediction of traumatic femoral head necrosis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use machine learning to construct a model for the analysis of risk factors and prediction of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in patients with FNF after internal fixation. METHODS: We retrospectively collected preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative clinical data of patients with FNF in 4 hospitals in Shanghai and followed up the patients for more than 2.5 years. A total of 259 patients with 43 variables were included in the study. The data were randomly divided into a training set (181/259, 69.8%) and a validation set (78/259, 30.1%). External data (n=376) were obtained from a retrospective cohort study of patients with FNF in 3 other hospitals. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and the support vector machine algorithm were used for variable selection. Logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used to develop the model on the training set. The validation set was used to tune the model hyperparameters to determine the final prediction model, and the external data were used to compare and evaluate the model performance. We compared the accuracy, discrimination, and calibration of the models to identify the best machine learning algorithm for predicting ONFH. Shapley additive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations were used to determine the interpretability of the black box model. RESULTS: A total of 11 variables were selected for the models. The XGBoost model performed best on the validation set and external data. The accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model on the validation set were 0.987, 0.929, and 0.992, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model on the external data were 0.907, 0.807, 0.935, and 0.933, respectively, and the log-loss was 0.279. The calibration curve demonstrated good agreement between the predicted probability and actual risk. The interpretability of the features and individual predictions were realized using the Shapley additive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations algorithms. In addition, the XGBoost model was translated into a self-made web-based risk calculator to estimate an individuals probability of ONFH. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning performs well in predicting ONFH after internal fixation of FNF. The 6-variable XGBoost model predicted the risk of ONFH well and had good generalization ability on the external data, which can be used for the clinical prediction of ONFH after internal fixation of FNF.","output":"Prediction Model of Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head After Femoral Neck Fracture: Machine LearningCBased Development and Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, there has been tremendous interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology in order to automate the interpretation.

The optimal modalities of antimicrobial therapy remain to be determined. Our objective was to describe the epidemiology and prognostic factors associated with S. maltophilia pneumonia, focusing on antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: This nationwide retrospective study included all patients admitted to 25 French mixed intensive care units between 2012 and 2017 with hospital-acquired S. maltophilia HAP during intensive care unit stay. Primary endpoint was time to in-hospital death. Secondary endpoints included microbiologic effectiveness and antimicrobial therapeutic modalities such as delay to appropriate antimicrobial treatment, mono versus combination therapy, and duration of antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Of the 282 patients included, 84% were intubated at S. maltophilia HAP diagnosis for duration of 11 [5C18] days. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 47 [36C63], and the in-hospital mortality was 49.7%. Underlying chronic pulmonary comorbidities were present in 14.1% of cases. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was considered effective on S. maltophilia according to susceptibility patterns in only 30% of cases. Delay to appropriate antimicrobial treatment had, however, no significant impact on the primary endpoint. Survival analysis did not show any benefit from combination antimicrobial therapy (HR = 1.27, 95%CI [0.88; 1.83], p = 0.20) or prolonged antimicrobial therapy for more than 7 days (HR = 1.06, 95%CI [0.6; 1.86], p = 0.84). No differences were noted in in-hospital death irrespective of an appropriate and timely empiric antimicrobial therapy between mono- versus polymicrobial S. maltophilia HAP (p = 0.273). The duration of ventilation prior to S. maltophilia HAP diagnosis and ICU length of stay were shorter in patients with monomicrobial S. maltophilia HAP (p = 0.031 and p = 0.034 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: S. maltophilia HAP occurred in severe, long-stay intensive care patients who mainly required prolonged invasive ventilation.

Further, existing protocols are designed for testing the fit and performance N95 respirators and tight-fitting facemasks rather than the relatively more loose-fitting surgical mask style most cloth masks follow. In this study tools and methods typically used to assess tight-fitting facemasks were modified to assess the efficacy of community-produced fabric and commercially-produced surgical masks in terms of protecting the wearer from airborne particles that may be carrying virus. Two TSI PortaCount (model 8028) instruments were operated concurrently to collect particle counts (particles/cm^3) in size range 0.02 to >1 um from ambient air and air just inside the breathing zone of the mask (1 measurement per second, evaluation period of 1 minute per test). Percent particle removal was determined for ten home-made, fabric masks of different designs, with and without filter layers, as well as three commercially-produced surgical-type masks. N95 masks were used to validate the method, and a 3M model 1826 surgical mask was used as a baseline for comparison of other masks of this style. Home-made masks worn as designed always had lower particle removal rates than the 3M masks, achieving between 38% and 96% of this baseline. As has been previously observed by Cooper et al. (1983), adding a layer of nylon stocking over the masks minimized the flow of air around the edges of the masks and improved particle filtration efficiency for all masks, including all commercial products tested. Use of a nylon stocking overlayer brought the particle filtration efficiency for five of the ten fabric masks above the 3M surgical mask baseline. This rapid testing method (<2 hours per mask design) provides a holistic evaluation of mask particle removal efficacy (material, design, and fit), and use of this method for testing a wider range of mask materials and designs will provide the public and health care providers with information needed to optimize health protection given resources at hand.","output":"Assessment of Fabric Masks as Alternatives to Standard Surgical Masks in Terms of Particle Filtration Efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is currently spreading around the world The WHO declared on January 31 that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was a public health emergency SARS-Cov-2 is a member of highly pathogenic coronavirus group that also consists of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Although respiratory tract lesions were regarded as main manifestation of SARS-Cov-2 infection, gastrointestinal lesions were also reported Similarly, patients with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were also observed Common gastrointestinal symptoms of patients mainly included diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain Gastrointestinal lesions could be used as basis for early diagnosis of patients, and at the same time, controlling gastrointestinal lesions better facilitated to cut off the route of fecal-oral transmission Hence, this review summarizes the characteristics and mechanism of gastrointestinal lesions caused by three highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as SARS-CoV-2 Furthermore, it is expected to gain experience from gastrointestinal lesions caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections in order to be able to better relieve SARS-CoV-2 epidemic Targetin gut microbiota to regulate the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be a concern Especially, the application of nanotechnology may provide help for further controlling COVID-19","output":"Gordian Knot: gastrointestinal lesions caused by three highly pathogenic coronaviruses from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2.

However, the impact of different HRV types and viral load on disease severity has not been thoroughly elucidated. METHODS From January 2012 to September 2014, 1742 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections were analyzed by quantitative HRV-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Among these 1742 children, HRV (407/1742, 23%) was the second most common viral agent after respiratory syncytial virus. HRV-A, HRV-B, HRV-C and HRV untyped were detected in 229 (56%), 27 (7%), 100 (25%) and 51 (13%) specimens, respectively. Children except who experienced wheezing were more common in the HRV-C detection group than in the HRV-A detection group; there were no other significant differences between the 2 groups, including the percent of children diagnosed with severe diseases. Logistic regression models demonstrated that there was no difference in disease severity among HRV types. In HRV-A detection group, in children younger than 2 years, the viral load was higher in the severe group than in the nonsevere group; but in the HRV-C detection group, there was no difference. CONCLUSIONS HRV was frequently present in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections in Chongqing, China. The disease severity for HRV-C and HRV-A was similar.

Following diagnosis, 8 (67%) patients were hospitalized; 5 had mycophenolate held, 2 received steroids, 2 received convalescent plasma, 4 received remdesivir, and 1 received monoclonal Ab therapy. At a median follow-up time of 304 (IQR 212.5 - 331) days after diagnosis, all twelve patients were alive with good allograft function (mean ejection fraction 59  4.8%); interval clinically-relevant immunologic outcomes included one episode of rejection (pAMR1) and three (25%) findings of de novo donor-specific antibodies (dnDSA). Conclusion In this single-center pilot study assessing myocardial injury among HTx recipients within 2 months of SARS-CoV2 infection, the majority of patients had low -cfDNA results (<0.15%) and demonstrated good intermediate-term (6-12 months) graft function. While limited by sample size and protocol-based inclusion criteria, our findings suggest that sustained myocardial injury in HTx recipients after SARS-CoV2 infection may not be common. The impact of SARS-CoV2 infection on immunologic outcomes including rejection and dnDSA in this population merit further study.","output":"Using Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA for Assessment of Myocardial Injury in Heart Transplant Recipients After SARS-CoV2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a novel viral disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 The mid- and long-term outcomes have not yet been determined COVID-19 infection is increasingly being associated with systemic and multi-organ involvement, encompassing cytokine release syndrome and thromboembolic, vascular and cardiac events The patient described experienced unusually rapid development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right ventricular failure after recent severe COVID-19 pneumonia with cytokine release syndrome, which initially was successfully treated with methylprednisolone and tocilizumab The development of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure - in the absence of emboli on multiple CT angiograms - was most likely caused by progressive pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities combined with microvascular damage of the pulmonary arteries (group III and IV pulmonary hypertension, respectively) To the best of our knowledge, these complications have not previously been described and therefore awareness of PH as a complication of COVID-19 is warranted LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 increasingly presents with systemic and multi-organ involvement with vascular, thromboembolic and cardiac events Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and concomitant cytokine release syndrome may be particularly at risk for the development of secondary pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure Pulmonary hypertension can develop unusually rapidly following COVID-19 pneumonia and probably results from progressive pulmonary interstitial and microvascular abnormalities due to COVID-19","output":"Unusually Rapid Development of Pulmonary Hypertension and Right Ventricular Failure after COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Virtual World is a technology that has created countless opportunities for teaching and learning, innovating traditional and online education, and promoting a more sustainable and accessible education.

These outbreaks often led to respiratory tract diseases and have proved to be fatal sometimes. Currently, we are facing an elusive health crisis with the emergence of COVID-19 disease of the coronavirus family. One of the modes of transmission of COVID- 19 is airborne transmission. This transmission occurs as humans breathe in the droplets released by an infected person through breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, or sneezing. Hence, public health officials have mandated the use of face masks which can reduce disease transmission by 65%. For face recognition programs, commonly used for security verification purposes, the use of face mask presents an arduous challenge since these programs were typically trained with human faces devoid of masks but now due to the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, they are forced to identify faces with masks. Hence, this paper investigates the same problem by developing a deep learning based model capable of accurately identifying people with face-masks. In this paper, the authors train a ResNet-50 based architecture that performs well at recognizing masked faces. The outcome of this study could be seamlessly integrated into existing face recognition programs that are designed to detect faces for security verification purposes.","output":"Masked Face Recognition using ResNet-50"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: While demand for telemedicine is increasing, patients are currently restricted to tele-consultation for the most part. Fundamental diagnostics like the percussion still require the in person expertize of a physician. To meet todays challenges, a transformation of the manual percussion into a standardized, digital version, ready for telemedical execution is required. METHODS: In conjunction with a comprehensive telemedical diagnostic system, in which patients can get examined by a remote-physician, a series of three robotic end-effectors for mechanical percussion were developed. Comprising a motor, a magnetic and a pneumatic-based version, the devices strike a pleximeter to perform the percussion. Emitted sounds were captured using a microphone-equipped stethoscope. The 84 recordings were further integrated into a survey in order to classify lung and non-lung samples. RESULTS: The study with 21 participants comprised physicians, medical students and non-medical-related raters in equal parts. With 71.4% correctly classified samples, the ventral motorized device prevailed. While the result is significantly better compared to a manual or pneumatic percussion in this very setup, it only has a small edge over the magnetic devices. In addition, for all ventral versions non-lung regions were rather correctly identified than lung regions. CONCLUSION: The overall setup proves the feasibility of a telemedical percussion. Despite the fact, that produced sounds differ compared to todays manual technique, the study shows that a standardized mechanical percussion has the potential to improve the gold standards accuracy. While further extensive medical evaluation is yet to come, the system paves the way for future uncompromised remote examinations.","output":"Telemedical percussion: objectifying a fundamental clinical examination technique for telemedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxytocin (OT) is considered beneficial to mental health owing to its anxiolytic, prosocial, and anti-stress effects; however, the adverse effects of OT have been controversial, such as its potentially anxiogenic actions. Although OT influences drug abuse and reciprocally affects vulnerability to drug use, the relationship between OT's anxiogenic working and nicotine preference intake has not been clearly defined. To clarify this issue, the effect of acute peripheral administration of OT on anxiety and nicotine preference was investigated in juvenile male rats. Anxiogenic behaviors were noticeably increased in OT-administrated rats, with an increase in serum corticosterone levels. Moreover, increased anxiety-like behaviors and corticosterone levels were observed in the OT analog carbetocin-injected rats. In the nicotine preference test, the rats' aversive responses to initial nicotine choice and preference were not significantly different between saline-injected and OT-injected rats. However, when administered with OT, there was a significant negative correlation between anxiety-like behavior and low-dose nicotine consumption. Collectively, these results provide evidence that acute OT exposure could induce anxiogenic behavior with corticosterone augmentation, contributing to the attenuation of nicotine preference. This suggests that both aspects of OT, as well as their benefits and drawbacks, should be considered.","output":"Oxytocin-induced anxiogenic behavior in juvenile male rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To summarize what we know so far about coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) in children.

METHODS Two hundred two patients were enrolled across 14 centers in Europe, Canada, and Australia. The following time intervals were measured: stroke onset to hospital arrival, hospital arrival to baseline imaging, baseline imaging to groin puncture, groin puncture to first stent deployment, and first stent deployment to reperfusion. Effects of time of day, general anesthesia use, and multimodal imaging on workflow were evaluated. Patient characteristics and workflow processes associated with prolonged interval times and good clinical outcome (90-day modified Rankin score, 0-2) were analyzed. RESULTS Median times were onset of stroke to hospital arrival, 123 minutes (interquartile range, 163 minutes); hospital arrival to thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) 2b/3 or final digital subtraction angiography, 133 minutes (interquartile range, 99 minutes); and baseline imaging to groin puncture, 86 minutes (interquartile range, 24 minutes). Time from baseline imaging to puncture was prolonged in patients receiving intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (32-minute mean delay) and when magnetic resonance-based imaging at baseline was used (18-minute mean delay). Extracranial carotid disease delayed puncture to first stent deployment time on average by 25 minutes. For each 1-hour increase in stroke onset to final digital subtraction angiography (or TICI 2b/3) time, odds of good clinical outcome decreased by 38%.

DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional, observational study. SETTING: High-quality data from ambulance electronic clinical records, New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulance records were obtained from 588 690 attendances during pre-lockdown (prior to 17 February 2020) and from 36 238 records during the lockdown period (23 March to 26 April 2020). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ambulance service utilisation during lockdown was compared with pre-lockdown: (a) descriptive analyses of ambulance events and proportions of event types for each period, (b) absolute rates of ambulance attendance (event types/week) for each period. RESULTS: During lockdown, ambulance patients were more likely to be attended at home and less likely to be aged between 16 and 25 years. There was a significant increase in the proportion of lower acuity patients (Status 3 and Status 4) attended (p<0.001) and a corresponding increase in patients not transported from scene (p<0.001). Road traffic crashes (p<0.001) and alcohol-related incidents (p<0.001) significantly decreased. There was a decrease in the absolute number of weekly ambulance attendances (ratio (95% CI), 0.89 (0.87 to 0.91), p<0.001), attendances to respiratory conditions (0.74 (0.61 to 0.86), p=0.01), and trauma (0.81 (0.77 to 0.85), p<0.001). However, there was a significant increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions (1.37 (1.22 to 1.51), p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative absence of COVID-19 in the community during the 5-week nationwide lockdown, there were significant differences in ambulance utilisation during this period. The lockdown was associated with an increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions and is of concern. In considering future lockdowns, the potential implications on a population's mental well-being will need to be seriously considered against the benefits of elimination of virus transmission.","output":"Changes in demand for emergency ambulances during a nationwide lockdown that resulted in elimination of COVID-19: an observational study from New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tackling inequalities is essential for justice, security, and preparedness","output":"Preparing democracies for pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Before the spread of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), LMS Moodle was used by universities as an alternative and additional tool to support the educational process It demonstrated low effectiveness, primarily because of its episodic use by teachers and students Mass transition to distance learning in the conditions of self-isolation has led to the increased demand for the platform, but at the same time, it has revealed the obvious problems of using this resource The article provides the data from an opinion study about the problems of using LMS Moodle conducted among university professors and students It also presents the results of a correlation analysis of factors that affect the satisfaction of the LMS Mobile consumer audience The complications of using LMS Moodle that arose prior to COVID-19 pandemic are analyzed and some suggestions for improving the platform are offered in the article ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Problems and opportunities of using LMS moodle before and during COVID-19 Quarantine: Opinion of teachers and students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Apart from major health concerns associated to the SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, also the diagnostic workflow encountered serious problems.

Data from seven modules with a total of 8,320 participants who provided the data of at least one task were released to the public researcher. The modules comprise demographics, MDS-UPDRS ICII, PDQ-8, memory, tapping, voice, and walking. Finger-tapping is one of the tasks that easy to perform and has been analyzed for the quantitative measurement of PD. Therefore, participants who performed both the tapping activity and MDS-UPDRS ICII rating scale were selected for our analysis. Note that the MDS-UPDRS mPower Survey only contains parts of the original scale and has not been clinimetrically tested for validity and reliability. We obtained a total of 1851 samples that contained the tapping activity and MDS-UPDRS ICII for the analysis. Nine features were selected to represent tapping activity. K-mean was applied as an unsupervised clustering algorithm in our study. For determining the number of clusters, the elbow method, Sihouette score, and DaviesCBouldin index, were employed as supporting evaluation metrics. Based on these metrics and expert opinion, we decide that three clusters were appropriate for our study. The statistical analysis found that the tapping features could separate participants into three severity groups. Each group has different characteristics and could represent different PD severity based on the MDS-UPDRS ICII and PDQ-8 scores. Currently, the severity assessment of a movement disorder is based on clinical observation.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data collected from the medical records of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia from March to October 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, 490 patients were admitted and diagnosed with suspected and probable COVID-19. Of these patients, 50 (10.2%) were confirmed to have COVID-19, and 20 (40%) had a fatal outcome. The fatality rate was higher in patients aged &#8805;10 years, categorized with severe disease upon admission, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &#8804;300 mmHg and chronic underlying diseases. The most common clinical manifestations were generalized symptoms, while acute respiratory distress syndrome (8/20) and septic shock (7/20) were the two most common causes of death.

Proper and faster diagnosis of pneumonia at an early stage is imperative for optimal patient care. Currently, chest X-ray is considered as the best imaging modality for diagnosing pneumonia. However, the interpretation of chest X-ray images is challenging. To this end, we aimed to use an automated convolutional neural network-based transfer-learning approach to detect pneumonia in paediatric chest radiographs. METHODS Herein, an automated convolutional neural network-based transfer-learning approach using four different pre-trained models (i.e. VGG19, DenseNet121, Xception, and ResNet50) was applied to detect pneumonia in children (1-5 years) chest X-ray images. The performance of different proposed models for testing data set was evaluated using five performances metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity/recall, Precision, area under curve, and F1 score. RESULTS All proposed models provide accuracy greater than 83.0% for binary classification. The pre-trained DenseNet121 model provides the highest classification performance of automated pneumonia classification with 86.8% accuracy, followed by Xception model with an accuracy of 86.0%. The sensitivity of the proposed models was greater than 91.0%. The Xception and DenseNet121 models achieve the highest classification performance with F1-score greater than 89.0%. The plotted area under curve of receiver operating characteristics of VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 models are 0.78, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.86, respectively.

Using topology and interaction based trust properties of nodes in real-world Twitter networks, we are able to predict false information spreaders with an accuracy of over 90%.","output":"Detecting Fake News Spreaders in Social Networks using Inductive Representation Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study sought to assess the magnitude of and factors associated with mental health outcomes among frontline health care workers (FHCWs) providing care during the Spring 2020 COVID-19 pandemic surge in New York City Methods: A cross-sectional, survey-based study over 4 weeks during the Spring 2020 pandemic surge was used to assess symptoms of COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in 2,579 FHCWs at the Mount Sinai Hospital Participants were additionally asked about their occupational and personal exposures to COVID-19 Multivariable logistic regression and relative importance analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with these outcomes Results: A total of 3,360 of 6,026 individuals completed the survey (55 8% participation), with 2,579 (76 8%) analyzed based on endorsing frontline responsibilities and providing information related to the three outcomes 1,005 (39 0%) met criteria for symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD, MDD, or GAD 599 (23 3%) screened positively for PTSD symptoms, 683 (26 6%) for MDD symptoms, and 642 (25 0%) for GAD symptoms Multivariable analyses revealed that past-year burnout was associated with the highest risk of developing symptoms for COVID-19-related PTSD (odds ratio [OR] = 2 10), MDD (OR = 2 83), and GAD (OR = 2 68) Higher perceived support from hospital leadership was associated with a lowest risk of all outcomes [PTSD (OR = 0 75), MDD (OR = 0 72), and GAD (OR = 0 76) Conclusion: In this large sample of FHCWs providing care during the 2020 NYC pandemic surge, 39% experienced symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD, MDD, and/or GAD and pre-pandemic burnout as well as leadership support were identified as the most highly associated factors These findings suggest that interventions aimed at reducing burnout and augmenting support from hospital leadership may be appropriate targets to mitigate the risk for developing further psychopathology in this population and others working in the midst of crisis","output":"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Frontline Health Care Workers During the Pandemic Surge in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regularly scheduled intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections are essential to maintaining and/or improving many ocular conditions including: neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusions with macular edema (RVO). This study aims to assess the effect of unintended delays in anti-VEGF treatment during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective case series identified patients receiving regularly scheduled anti-VEGF intravitreal injections based on current procedural terminology (CPT) code at two practices in Minnesota. Diagnoses were limited to nAMD, diabetic macular edema (DME), proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and RVO. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether they maintained or delayed their follow-up visit by more than two weeks beyond the recommended treatment interval during the COVID-19 lockdown. The COVID-19 lockdown was defined as the period after March, 28(th), 2020, when a lockdown was declared in Minnesota. We then compared the visual acuity and structural changes to the retina using ocular coherence tomography (OCT) to assess whether delayed treatment resulted in worse visual outcomes. A total of 167 eyes from 117 patients met criteria for inclusion in this study. In the delayed group, the average BCVA at the pre- and post-lockdown visits were 0.614 and 0.715 (logMAR) respectively (p = 0.007).

However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. METHODS: We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission using data from January to June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in Rt, levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect, and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. RESULTS: There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced Rt. Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support, and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g. restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on < 10 people gathering were). Evidence about the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Effect sizes varied depending on whether or not we included data after peak NPI intensity. CONCLUSION: Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects, and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many, although not all, actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission across 130 countries and territories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccination topic has been a hot topic of discussions on social media platforms wondering its effectiveness against the SARS-COV-2 virus. Twitter is one of the social media platforms that people widely lunched to express and share their thoughts about different issues touching their daily life.

In humans, the primary motor cortex (M1) in the two hemispheres shows significant anatomical, connectional, and electrophysiological differences associated with motor dominance. It is currently unclear whether the -oscillation phase effects on corticospinal excitability demonstrated previously for the motor-dominant M1 are also different between motor-dominant and motor-non-dominant M1 or, alternatively, are similar to reflect a ubiquitous physiological trait of the motor system at rest. Here, we applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to the hand representations of the motor-dominant and the motor-non-dominant M1 of 51 healthy right-handed volunteers when electroencephalography indicated a certain -oscillation phase (positive peak, negative peak, or random). We determined resting motor threshold (RMT) as a marker of corticospinal excitability in the three -phase conditions. RMT differed significantly depending on the pre-stimulus phase of the -oscillation in both M1, with highest RMT in the positive-peak condition, and lowest RMT in the negative-peak condition. -phase-dependency of RMT correlated directly between the two M1, and interhemispheric differences in -phase-dependency were absent.

However, few studies have focused on the factors that improve the influence of health messages on social media. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of goal-framing effects, information organizing, and the use of pictures or videos in health-promoting messages, we conducted a case study of Sina Weibo, a popular social media platform in China. METHODS: Literature review and expert discussion were used to determine the health themes of childhood obesity, smoking, and cancer. Web crawler technology was employed to capture data on health-promoting messages. We used the number of retweets, comments, and likes to evaluate the influence of a message. Statistical analysis was then conducted after manual coding. Specifically, binary logistic regression was used for the data analyses. RESULTS: We crawled 20,799 Sina Weibo messages and selected 389 health-promoting messages for this study. Results indicated that the use of gain-framed messages could improve the influence of messages regarding childhood obesity (P<.001), smoking (P=.03), and cancer (P<.001). Statistical expressions could improve the influence of messages about childhood obesity (P=.02), smoking (P=.002), and cancer (P<.001). However, the use of videos significantly improved the influence of health-promoting messages only for the smoking-related messages (P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that gain-framed messages and statistical expressions can be successful strategies to improve the influence of messages.

Most of these social robots have provided timely stimuli to the elderly at home and in care centres, including keeping them active and boosting their mood. However, previous investigations have registered shortcomings in these robots, particularly in their ability to satisfy an essential human need: the need for companionship. Reports show that the elderly tend to lose interests in these social robots after the initial excitement as the novelty wears out and the monotonous familiarity becomes all too familiar.

RESULTS Overall rate of infection with SARS-CoV in 635 traders was 16.69%, varying in three different markets. Infection rate in market A mainly engaging in wild animals ranked the highest of 25.61%, significantly higher than that in markets B and C engaging in domestic fowls and snakes. Infection rate in traders only engaging in civet cats was 58.54%, significantly higher than that in traders engaging in snakes only (9.46%). In market A, infection rate varied in different persons, 59.34%, 20.59%, 16.00%, 15.22%, 10.40% and 9.68% in traders engaging in wild animals, managers, children of the traders, traders engaging in domestic fowls, traders engaging in snakes, and traders engaging in frozen food, respectively, in a decreasing pattern as their contact opportunities.

Fentanyl analogs with greater potency than fentanyl (e.g., carfentanil) pose serious risk to public health. While fentanyl analogs are primarily encountered by humans as constituents of a mixture of drugs, research has primarily evaluated the effects of these drugs alone. The present study characterized interactions between mu opioid receptor agonists in seven male Sprague-Dawley rats trained to discriminate 10 g/kg fentanyl from saline while responding under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of food presentation. Dose-effect curves were determined for each drug alone and in binary mixtures (fentanyl:heroin, fentanyl:carfentanil, and heroin:carfentanil) at fixed-dose ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 relative to the ED50 for each drug when given alone. Dose addition analyses were used to determine the nature of the drug-drug interaction for each mixture. Additive interactions were observed for all binary mixtures at each fixed dose ratio, except the 1:3 fentanyl:carfentanil mixture which exhibited supra-additive effects at the 80% effect level. These results suggest a lack of a significant interaction between the discriminative stimulus effects of these mu opioid receptor agonists at the doses tested in this study. Future studies expanding these findings to the respiratory depressant effects of these drugs are of significant importance to rule out possible interactions directly relevant to opioid overdose that occur at doses much larger than those tested in this study. Significance Statement In the United States, drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyls including superpotent fentanyl analogs (e.g., carfentanil), have increased 12-fold over the past decade.

DATA SOURCES The study is based on the consultation of (1) scientific articles from international databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, ProQuest, and Clarivate), (2) public health documents, and (3) official information of various governments. RESULTS The analyzed documents revealed that a few similarities can be observed in European countries when it comes to the first categories of people who have received the vaccine: people living in care facilities and medical staff; it can also be seen that the vaccination plan was adopted by each country for the needs and characteristics of its population, the prioritization being done in 2-14 stages; some of them divided, in their turn, into subsequent substages.

Angiography-derived quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a novel method of assessing these stenoses, and guiding percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS/DESIGN: The PIONEER IV trial is a prospective, all-comers, multi-center trial, which will randomize 2540 patients in a 1:1 ratio to PCI guided by angiography-derived physiology or usual care, with unrestricted use in both arms of the Healing-Targeted Supreme sirolimus-eluting stent (HT Supreme). The stent's fast, biologically healthy, and robust endothelial coverage allows for short dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), hence the antiplatelet regimen of choice is 1-month DAPT, followed by ticagrelor monotherapy. In the angiography-derived physiology guided arm, lesions will be functionally assessed using on-line QFR, with stenting indicated in lesions with a QFR0.80. Post-stenting, QFR will be repeated in the stented vessel(s), with post-dilatation or additional stenting recommended if the QFR<0.91 distal to the stent, or if the delta QFR (across the stent) is >0.05. Usual care PCI is performed according to standard clinical practice.

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis secara kuantitatif perubahan parameter kualitas udara berupa PM2.5 dan visibility di Jakarta selama periode sebelum (2019) dan setelah pandemi (2020) menggunakan metode statistik. Pengaruh mobilitas penduduk dan distribusi spasial konsentrasi polutan juga dianalisis dalam penelitian ini. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan selama masa pandemi COVID-19 terdapat pengurangan konsentrasi polutan pada tahun 2020 hingga lebih dari 100 persen dibandingkan tahun 2019. Jarak pandang mendatar di Jakarta juga meningkat hingga 11 persen selama PSBB. Mobilitas penduduk mempengaruhi konsentrasi polutan di Jakarta sebesar 30 persen dan distribusi spasial menunjukkan adanya fluktuasi konsentrasi PM2.5 sebelum dan setelah diberlakukannya PSBB. Countries worldwide have implemented some sort of lockdowns to slow down COVID-19 infection and mitigate it. Lockdown due to COVID-19 has drastic effects on social and economic fronts. However, this lockdown also has some positive effects on the natural environment especially on air quality. During the 2020 PSBB period in Jakarta outdoor activity decreased significantly. This study quantitatively analyzes air quality parameters of PM2.5 and visibility changes in Jakarta during the period before (2019) and after the pandemic (2020) using statistical methods. The impact of mobility to pollution also become a concern in this study. The results confirmed an improvement in air quality due to the implementation of social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. PSBB has an impact on reducing pollutant concentrations by more than 100 percent during PSBB compared to 2019. The horizontal visibility in Jakarta also increased by 11 percent during the PSBB. Mobility has affected PM2.5 concentration by 30 percent in Jakarta and spatial distribution of PM2.5 shows evidence of fluctuation during and before PSBB was enacted.","output":"Dampak pembatasan sosial berskala besar terhadap kualitas udara di jakarta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD) remains challenging without a definitive diagnostic test and currently is guided by using clinical patient characteristics and supported by laboratory data. The role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of KD is not fully understood. METHODS Charts of patients with KD admitted to Children's Hospital Colorado from January 2009 to May 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with KD who had a nasopharyngeal wash submitted for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral testing were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and outcomes of patients with and without positive respiratory viral PCR results were compared. RESULTS Of 222 patients with KD admitted to the hospital, 192 (86%) had a respiratory viral PCR test performed on or shortly after admission. Ninety-three (41.9%) of the 192 patients with KD had a positive respiratory viral PCR, and the majority were positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus. No statistically significant differences were found in the clinical characteristics and laboratory values between the groups with and without positive respiratory viral PCR findings. Both groups had the same frequency of upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and had the same incidence of admission to the PICU, intravenous immunoglobulin-resistant disease, and coronary artery lesions. CONCLUSIONS No differences in clinical presentations or outcomes in children with KD stratified according to positive or negative respiratory viral PCR testing were observed. A positive respiratory viral PCR or presence of respiratory symptoms at the time of presentation should not be used to exclude a diagnosis of KD.","output":"Concurrent Respiratory Viruses and Kawasaki Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Mononeuritis multiplex (MM) is an unusual form of peripheral neuropathy involving at least two noncontiguous peripheral nerve trunks. The pure sensory form of MM occurs rarely. Immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass deficiency is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Up to 50% of adults with selective subnormal IgG1 levels or selective IgG1 deficiency have a concomitant autoimmune disorder. Herein, we report the case of a patient with MM and selective IgG1 deficiency who showed remarkable clinical improvement after 2-year combination therapy with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin plus vitamin D3. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old man developed numbness in right hand and forearm. After 6 months, the patient developed left forefoot numbness. Approximately 8 years later, the patient started to develop numbness also in the right forefoot, along with symptoms of evening fatigue and occasional orthostatic hypotension. The patient also reported recurrent candidiasis in glans and intergluteal areas since adolescence. Electromyoneurography of lower and upper limbs revealed the presence of multiple mononeuropathies. Protein electrophoresis showed hypogammaglobulinemia and low serum IgG1 levels. Sural nerve biopsy showed the presence of perineuritis. The patient was diagnosed with MM due to perineuritis probably secondary to IgG1 deficiency. We, then, proposed combination therapy with sitagliptin and vitamin D3 in the attempt to achieve immunomodulation. At the last follow-up visit (2 years), the patient showed persistent clinical improvement, increase in IgG1 levels and normalization of protein electrophoresis. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case showing a remarkable clinical improvement of MM and selective IgG1 deficiency achieved through a combination therapy with sitagliptin and vitamin D3.","output":"Improvement of pure sensory mononeuritis multiplex and IgG1 deficiency with sitagliptin plus Vitamin D3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The aim of the study is to define the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacteria from cases of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests have done using the disk-diffusion technique as per the standard of CSLI. Results During 2 years of study, 3489 samples were culture positive. Escherichia coli was the dominant isolate (84%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (10.7%) and Enterococci spp. (2,2%). The overall resistance rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin were 56.1%, 47.2%, and 37%, respectively. The most frequently isolated bacteria were E. coli, which had resistance rates of 58.6%, 49.1% to TMP-STX, and cefixime, also sensitivity rates of 95.1% to nitrofurantoin (FM). Conclusions In the study area, resistance rates to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins were high.

Ground-level equivalent BC (eBC) measurements were performed between January 2020 and July 2020 at a university campus located in Dammam city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The fossil fuel (eBCff) and biomass burning (eBCbb) fractions of total eBC (eBCt) concentrations were estimated as 84% and 16%, respectively, during the entire study period. The mean eBCbb, eBCff, and eBCt concentrations during the lockdown reduced by 14%, 24%, and 23%, respectively. The results of statistical analyses indicated that local fossil fuel burning emissions and atmospheric conditions apparently affected the observed eBC levels.

This paper starts with a review of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, Palestine and Jordan, in the context of the regional health systems, demography and politics. We suggest that Israel and Palestine function as one epidemiological unit, due to extensive border crossing of inhabitants and tourists, resulting in cross-border infections and potential for outbreaks' transmission. Indeed, there is a correlation between the numbers of confirmed cases with a 2-3 weeks lag. In contrast, Jordan has the ability to seal its borders and better contain the spread of the virus. We then discuss comparative public health aspects in relation to the management of COVID-19 and long term adaptation to climate change. We suggest that lessons from the current crisis can inform regional adaptation to climate change. There is an urgent need for better health surveillance, data sharing across borders, and more resilient health systems that are prepared and equipped for emergencies.

We evaluated the safety and therapeutic effects of DP-b99 in patients with acute hemispheric ischemic stroke. METHODS The Membrane-Activated Chelator Stroke Intervention trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trial of intravenous DP-b99 administered for 4 consecutive days (NCT00893867). Acute ischemic stroke patients within 9 hours of onset, but untreated by alteplase, with a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 10 to 16, and evidence of language dysfunction, visual field defect, and neglect were eligible. The primary efficacy analysis compared distributions of functional status measured by modified Rankin score in the intent-to-treat population of patients with any post-treatment outcome, adjusted for initial severity. Functional and neurological recovery were secondary measures. Home time was an exploratory end point. RESULTS Enrollment terminated at n=446 after the planned interim analysis determined futility; follow-up continued. Final modified Rankin score distributions were equal between DP-b99 and placebo-treated groups (P=0.10; P(adj) adjusted for baseline age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale=0.21). Fewer patients recovered to modified Rankin score 1 in the DP-b99-treated group (45/218; 20.6%) than after placebo (63/219; 28.8%) (P=0.05; P(adj)=0.10). Similarly, fewer patients attained National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 1 after DP-b99 (42/218; 19.3%) than placebo (56/219; 25.6%; P=0.10; P(adj)=0.26). Mortality was similar between DP-b99 and placebo intent-to-treat groups (36/218; 16.5% vs 33/219; 15.1%; P=0.68). Home time was unchanged by treatment (median 36 vs 36.5 days; P=0.25).

However, some people are not taking this seriously and due to that government has also issued some rules and regulations for people who are not following the precautionary measures. Methodology:: In this study, we worked on how to find defaulters in real time world and identifying them between the group of number of people and ask them to follow the precautionary measures and if necessary, take actions against them. A convolutional neural network model was created and was implemented in finding the defaulters from a group of people. Results:: The model worked quite well in identifying people with and without face masks and also whether the people are following social distancing or not simultaneously through the webcam. The model was able to detect multiple number of people at once and also calculate distance between them and checking whether they are wearing masks or not. Practical Applications:: The research can be used in various places like factories, shops, roads, and other public places. In the areas where a number of people are working together, during this time it has become a necessity to have precautions. But due to some peoples negligence it has become necessary for government bodies to keep check on these people and take necessary actions required and ensure the safety of others and also them.

Previous studies of mouse thymoma cells showed that GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but enriched in a mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) domain. Because PIG-L has no readily identifiable ER sorting determinants, we were interested in learning how PIG-L is localized to the ER and possibly enriched in MAM. We used HeLa cells transiently or stably expressing epitope-tagged PIG-L variants or chimeric constructs composed of elements of PIG-L fused to Tac antigen, a cell surface protein. We first analyzed the subcellular distribution of PIG-L and Glc-NAc-PI-de-N-acetylase activity and then studied the localization of Tac-PIG-L chimeras to identify sequence elements in PIG-L responsible for its subcellular localization. We show that human PIG-L is a type I membrane protein with a large cytoplasmic domain and that, unlike the result with mouse thymoma cells, both PIG-L and GlcNAc-PI-de-N-acetylase activity are uniformly distributed between ER and MAM in HeLa cells. Analyses of a series of Tac-PIG-L chimeras indicated that PIG-L contains two ER localization signals, an independent retention signal located between residues 60 and 88 of its cytoplasmic domain and another weak signal in the luminal and transmembrane domains that functions autonomously in the presence of membrane proximal residues of the cytoplasmic domain that themselves lack any retention information. We conclude that PIG-L, like a number of other ER membrane proteins, is retained in the ER through a multi-component localization signal rather than a discrete sorting motif.","output":"Subcellular localization and targeting of N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphatidylinositol de-N-acetylase, the second enzyme in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthetic pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bronchoalveolar lavage, or BAL, is a minimally invasive procedure frequently used for clinical and non-clinical research, allowing studies of the respiratory system.

Methods We analyzed the national COVID-19 database that contains data regarding COVID-19 testing, management, and clinical outcomes in Duhok. For this study, different subdistricts within each district of Duhok were considered distinct clusters. Blood samples were collected from and questionnaires were administered to eligible and consenting participants who were members of different families from the subdistricts. Immunoassays were conducted to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and the associations between certain variables were investigated. Results The average number cases of COVID-19 before November 2020 was 23141 {+/-} 4364, which was significantly higher than the average number of cases between November 2020 and February 2021 (3737 {+/-} 2634; P = 0.001). A total of 743 individuals agreed to participate and were enrolled in the study. Among the participants, 465/743 (62.58%) were found to have antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Among the participants with antibodies, 262/465 (56.34%) denied having any history of COVID-19-related symptoms. The most common symptom was fever (81.77%), followed by myalgia (81.28%). We found that antibody levels increased steadily with age (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.117; P = 0.012).

Spuriousness occurs when some features correlate with labels but are not causal; relying on such features prevents models from generalizing to unseen environments where such correlations break. In this work, we focus on image classification and propose two data generation processes to reduce spuriousness. Given human annotations of the subset of the features responsible (causal) for the labels (e.g. bounding boxes), we modify this causal set to generate a surrogate image that no longer has the same label (i.e. a counterfactual image). We also alter non-causal features to generate images still recognized as the original labels, which helps to learn a model invariant to these features. In several challenging datasets, our data generations outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy when spurious correlations break, and increase the saliency focus on causal features providing better explanations.","output":"Towards Robust Classification Model by Counterfactual and Invariant Data Generation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our primary objective is to improve COVID-19 metrics to enhance the quality of COVID-19 surveillance-an urgent need raised by several authors in professional and general media.1-5 We offer specific suggestions on how pandemic surveillance metrics can be better reported to improve the quality of analytical epidemiology.

The situation is further compounded by the lack of an approved vaccine or antiviral drug. Herein, we investigated a novel anti-ASFV approach by targeting G-Quadruplexes (G4s) in the viral genome. Bioinformatics analysis of putative G-quadruplex-forming sequences (PQSs) in the genome of ASFV BA71V strain revealed 317 PQSs on the forward strand and 322 PQSs on the reverse strand of the viral genome, translating to a density of 3.82 PQSs/kb covering 9.52% of the entire genome, which means that 85% of genes in the ASFV genome have at least 1 PQS on either strand. Biochemical characterization showed that 8 out of 13 conserved PQSs could form stable G4s in the presence of K(+), and 4 of them could be stabilized by G4 ligands, N-Methyl Mesoporphyrin (NMM), and pyridostatin (PDS) in vitro. An enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-based reporter system revealed that the expression of two G4-containing genes, i.e., P1192R and D117L, could be significantly suppressed by NMM and PDS in 293T cells. In addition, a virus infection model showed that NMM could inhibit the replication of ASFV in Porcine Alveolar Macrophages (PAM) cells with an EC(50) value of 1.16 M.

RESULTS: Fifty puerperal women participated in the three periods of the study. The median age was 25 years. There was an inverse correlation between the aa FSFI and EPDS values at T2 (p < 0.001) and T3 (p < 0.001), demonstrating that the worsening sexual response was secondary to the higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in the puerperium in the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an increase in EPDS scores in the three periods: at T1, the EPDS scores aawere 5.0 (2.0-9.0), increasing to 7.0 (4.0-14.0) at T2 and 6.5 (3.0-13.0) at T3 (p = 0.004).

In this respect, characterizing local features of the molecular surface, that can potentially be involved in the interaction with other molecules, represents a step forward in the investigation of the mechanisms of recognition and binding between molecules. Predictive methods often rely on extensive samplings of molecular patches with the aim to identify hot spots on the surface. In this framework, analysis of large proteins and/or many molecular dynamics frames is often unfeasible due to the high computational cost. Thus, finding optimal ways to reduce the number of points to be sampled maintaining the biological information (including the surface shape) carried by the molecular surface is pivotal. In this perspective, we here present a new theoretical and computational algorithm with the aim of defining a set of molecular surfaces composed of points not uniformly distributed in space, in such a way as to maximize the information of the overall shape of the molecule by minimizing the number of total points. We test our procedures ability in recognizing hot-spots by describing the local shape properties of portions of molecular surfaces through a recently developed method based on the formalism of 2D Zernike polynomials. The results of this work show the ability of the proposed algorithm to preserve the key information of the molecular surface using a reduced number of points compared to the complete surface, where all points of the surface are used for the description.

While countermeasures are being eased with increasing vaccination rates, the demand for public transport remains uncertain. To investigate user preferences to travel by London Underground during the pandemic, we conducted a stated choice experiment among its pre-pandemic users (N=961). We analysed the collected data using multinomial and mixed logit models. Our analysis provides insights into the sensitivity of the demand for the London Underground with respect to travel attributes (crowding density and travel time), the epidemic situation (confirmed new COVID-19 cases), and interventions (vaccination rates and mandatory face masks). Mandatory face masks and higher vaccination rates are the top two drivers of travel demand for the London Underground during COVID-19. The positive impact of vaccination rates on the Underground demand increases with crowding density, and the positive effect of mandatory face masks decreases with travel time. Mixed logit reveals substantial preference heterogeneity. For instance, while the average effect of mandatory face masks is positive, preferences of around 20% of the pre-pandemic users to travel by the Underground are negatively affected. The estimated demand sensitivities are relevant for supply-demand management in transit systems and the calibration of advanced epidemiological models.","output":"Face masks, vaccination rates and low crowding drive the demand for the London Underground during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a call that psychologists must answer with a dynamic, integrated mental health response that incorporates public education and dissemination, training, research, and service.

Emergency supply allocation system is an important part of emergency governance system. It reflects social organizations' credibility, public safety, and the modernization level of social governance. However, emergency supply allocation system still has some problems, such as information asymmetry, different desires of participants, unreasonable allocation, and so on. At present, it is widely accepted that the advantage of blockchain in co-governance could be of great help in solving above problems. And in order to distinguish the effect of blockchain to the emergency supply allocation, the paper builds a tripartite evolutionary game model among the government, social organizations, and the public to analyse the impact of blockchain platform on emergency supply allocation. The simulation analysis shows the following: (1) The strategy choices of the government have a crucial impact on the evolution and stability of social organizations' strategies. It needs a long-term process to guide social organizations practicing active allocation, and the government should accelerate to build the blockchain platform to promote this process. (2) With the help of blockchain platform, the increment of penalty intensity of the government is conductive to increasing the probabilities that social organizations practice active allocation and the government practices strict supervision. (3) Blockchain platform has a significant impact on social organizations' choice for active allocation in many aspects, such as the positive and negative effects of social organizations, effect's increasing multiple, and the cost of the public informing. In the end, some suggestions are presented to improve the co-governance of emergency supply allocation.

We demonstrate almost perfect levels of interrater agreement between this assay and WGS for 9 of 11 variant calls ({kappa} [] 0.856) and 25 of 30 targets ({kappa} [] 0.820) tested on the panel. The assay had a high diagnostic sensitivity ([]93.67%) for contemporary variants (e.g., Iota, Alpha, Delta, Omicron [BA.1 sublineage]) and a high diagnostic specificity for all 11 variants ([]96.15%) and all 30 targets ([]94.34%) tested. Moreover, we highlight distinct target patterns that can be utilized to identify variants not yet defined on the panel including the Omicron BA.2 and other sublineages. These findings exemplify the power of highly multiplexed diagnostic panels to accurately call variants and the potential for target result signatures to elucidate new ones.","output":"A robust, highly multiplexed mass spectrometry assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 outbreak brought an unprecedented challenge to the world. Knowledge in the field has been increasing exponentially and the main allergy societies have produced guidance documents for better management of allergic patients during this period. However, few publications so far have provided real-life data from the allergy community concerning the allergy practice during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, we proposed an international survey on the management of allergic patients during the current pandemic. Methods We performed an online survey undertaken to reach out the worldwide allergy community by e-mail and social media. The web-questionnaire contained 24 questions covering demographic data from the participants, clinical practice during this period, and questions related to the new international classification and coding tools addressed for COVID-19. It was circulated for 8 weeks and had anonymous and volunteer context. Results Data are presented for 635 participants from 78 countries of all continents. Allergists with long-term professional experience were the main audience. As expected, we received many responses as I have no data or I dont know to the questions of the survey. However, most with more experience on managing allergic patients during the pandemic agreed that patients suffering from allergic or hypersensitivity conditions have no increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing SARS CoV-2. Also, participants mentioned that none of the allergy treatments (inhaled corticosteroids, allergen immunotherapy, biological agents) increased the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection including severe presentations. Conclusion The data presented are a starting point to the process of getting a feedback for all the recommendations provided by the allergy societies, it could also be the basis of new strategies to support the health professionals while new COVID-19 specific treatments and vaccines are being explored. The information here presented intends to be helpful to the community but represents a course of action in a highly specific situation due to the state of emergency, and should be helpful to the health systems.","output":"ALLERGY AND CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) INTERNATIONAL SURVEY: REAL-LIFE DATA FROM THE ALLERGY COMMUNITY DURING THE PANDEMIC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"State-level policy interventions have been critical in managing the spread of the new coronavirus.

Before a large multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the impact of preventing desaturations on perioperative outcomes, the authors undertook a randomized prospective, parallel-arm, multicenter feasibility RCT to determine whether an intervention algorithm could prevent desaturations. METHODS Eight Canadian sites randomized 201 patients between April 2012 and October 2013. The primary outcome was the success rate of reversing cerebral desaturations below 10% relative to baseline in the intervention group. Anesthesiologists were blinded to the cerebral saturation values in the control group. Intensive care unit personnel were blinded to cerebral saturation values for both groups. Secondary outcomes included the area under the curve of cerebral desaturation load, enrolment rates, and a 30-day follow-up for adverse events. RESULTS Cerebral desaturations occurred in 71 (70%) of the 102 intervention group patients and 56 (57%) of the 99 control group patients (P = 0.04). Reversal was successful in 69 (97%) of the intervention group patients. The mean cerebral desaturation load (SD) in the operating room was smaller for intervention group patients compared with control group patients (104 [217] %.min vs. 398 [869] %.min, mean difference, -294; 95% CI, -562 to -26; P = 0.03). This was also true in the intensive care unit (P = 0.02). There were no differences in adverse events between the groups.

In severe cases and if not rapidly eliminated from the plasma, this can lead to multiple organ failure and death. CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old Asian woman (original from Vietnam) was admitted after ecstasy intoxication resulting in multi-organ failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic acidosis, capillary leakage syndrome, renal failure, shock refractory to standard resuscitation). As a consequence, continuous renal replacement therapy and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were started. Methylene blue administration to reverse vasoplegia was decided, but unfortunately, Patent Blue V was erroneously administered, resulting in a severe clinical picture of methemoglobinemia and tissue hypoxia. As a therapeutic intervention, CytoSorb hemoadsorption was initiated, and rapid and significant reduction in plasma methemoglobin, accompanied by improved hemodynamics and normalization in plasma lactate levels, was observed.

Repeated cycles of cleaning were undertaken, including hydrogen peroxide fogging, however, transmission continued. After 7 months of investigation, environmental swabbing identified 106 isolates from kitchen surfaces and restaurant drains matching the outbreak profile. We found structural faults with the drainage system and hypothesised that a reservoir of bacteria in drain biofilm and underfloor flooded areas may have sustained this outbreak. Ineffective drain water-traps (U-bends) may have also contributed by allowing transmission of contaminated aerosols into the kitchen environment. These findings suggest that routine swabbing of sink drain points and inspection of drainage systems should be considered in future outbreak scenarios.","output":"Investigation using whole genome sequencing of a prolonged restaurant outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium linked to the building drainage system, England, February 2015 to March 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SOURCE CITATION: Drain PK, Ampajwala M, Chappel C, et al.

Although pig viruses have been continuously investigated, the full extent of the pig virome has remained unknown and emerging viruses are still a major threat to the pig industry. Here, we report a comprehensive study to delineate the pig virome of 1,841 healthy weaned pigs from 45 commercial farms collected from 25 major pig-producing regions across China. A viromic sequence data set, named Pigs_VIRES, which matched 96,586 viral genes from at least 249 genera within 66 families and which almost tripled the number of previously published pig viromic genes, was established. The majority of the mammalian viruses were closely related to currently known ones. A comparison with previously published viromes of bovines, avians, and humans has revealed the distinct composition of Pigs_VIRES, which has provided characteristic viromic signatures of serum, pharyngeal, and anal samples that were significantly influenced by farming management and disease control measures. Taken together, Pigs_VIRES has revealed the most complete viromic data set of healthy pigs to date. The compiled data also provide useful guidance to pig viral disease control and prevention and the biosafety management of pig farms. Especially, the established viromic protocol has created a precision surveillance strategy to potentially innovate currently used surveillance methods of animal infectious diseases, particularly by making precision surveillance available to other animal species on a large scale or even during a nationwide surveillance campaign. IMPORTANCE Pigs are deeply involved in human lives; hence, their viruses are associated with public health. Here, we established the most comprehensive virome of healthy piglets to date, which provides a viromic baseline of weaned pigs for disease prevention and control, highlighting that longitudinal viromic monitoring is needed to better understand the dynamics of the virome in pig development and disease occurrence. The present study also shows how high standards of animal farm management with strict biosafety measures can significantly minimize the risk of introduction of pathogenic viruses into pig farms. Particularly, the viromic strategy established, i.e., high-throughput detection and analyses of various known and unknown pathogenic viruses in a single test at large scale, has completely innovated current surveillance measures in provision of timely and precise detection of all potentially existing pathogenic viruses and can be widely applied in other animal species.","output":"Viral Metagenome-Based Precision Surveillance of Pig Population at Large Scale Reveals Viromic Signatures of Sample Types and Influence of Farming Management on Pig Virome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global pandemic.

Dark photons alleviate cosmological problems. Meanwhile, dark photons make dark hadrons long-lived in terrestrial experiments. Moreover, the dark hadrons are produced through the very same dark photon. In this study, we discuss the visible decay searches for composite asymmetric dark matter models.

Their etiopathogenesis, including the role of SARS-CoV-2, remains elusive. Objective: To examine the association of chilblain-like lesions with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective case series enrolled 17 adolescents who presented with chilblain-like lesions from April 1 to June 30, 2020, at a tertiary referral academic hospital in Italy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Macroscopic (clinical and dermoscopic) and microscopic (histopathologic) analysis contributed to a thorough understanding of the lesions. Nasopharyngeal swab, serologic testing, and in situ hybridization of the skin biopsy specimens were performed to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory tests explored signs of systemic inflammation or thrombophilia. Structural changes in peripheral microcirculation were investigated by capillaroscopy. Results: Of the 17 adolescents (9 [52.9%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 13.2 [12.5-14.3] years) enrolled during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 16 (94.1%) had bilaterally localized distal erythematous or cyanotic lesions. A triad of red dots (16 [100%]), white rosettes (11 [68.8%]), and white streaks (10 [62.5%]) characterized the dermoscopic picture. Histologic analysis revealed a remodeling of the dermal blood vessels with a lobular arrangement, wall thickening, and a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. SARS-CoV-2 infection was excluded by molecular and serologic testing. In situ hybridization did not highlight the viral genome in the lesions. Conclusions and Relevance: This study delineated the clinical, histologic, and laboratory features of chilblain-like lesions that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its findings do not support their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lesions occurred in otherwise healthy adolescents, had a long but benign course to self-resolution, and were characterized by a microvascular remodeling with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate but no other signs of vasculitis. These results suggest that chilblain-like lesions do not imply a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, chemotherapy is often omitted either because of physician bias or because of its underlying comorbidity, thus compromising their survival. The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is compounding this issue because of the fear of immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy on the elderly which makes them more vulnerable to the virus. SUMMARY: Immunotherapy has less effect on the patient bone marrow compared to chemotherapy. The potential synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy may improve local control and survival for older patients with selected cancer. Preliminary data are encouraging because of better survival and local control in diseases which are traditionally resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.

However, we do not yet know how loneliness gets \\"under the skin\\" in ways that may impact the long-term health and development of early adolescents. In particular, loneliness may influence youths' patterns of diurnal cortisol, an index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning and a central predictor of health across the lifespan. The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19) pandemic represents a salient period in which to study the consequences of loneliness, as recent work has provided evidence that the physical-distancing measures put in place to contain the virus have resulted in greater loneliness, particularly among youth. Thus, the current study aimed to examine the prospective association between loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and diurnal cortisol in early adolescents. We found that greater loneliness was associated with higher levels of cortisol at waking and a blunted cortisol awakening response (CAR). These results held even when controlling for covariates that can influence diurnal trajectories of cortisol. Critically, this pattern of HPA-axis functioning increases risk for adverse mental and physical health outcomes across adolescence and into adulthood. This study is the first to examine the prospective association between loneliness and diurnal cortisol in early adolescence, and the first to identify mechanisms that contribute to biological markers of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To date, there is a lack of findings on the role of rehabilitation in postacute COVID-19 patients. AIM: Thus, we aimed at describing the role of a patient-tailored rehabilitation plan on functional outcome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Real-practice retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatients Rehabilitation Unit. POPULATION: Postacute COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Medical records of patients referred to an Italian COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit from March 10th, 2020 to April 30th, 2020 were collected. All patients underwent a rehabilitative (30 minutes/set, 2 times/day), aimed to improve gas exchanges, reducing dyspnoea, and improving muscle function. At the admission (T0) and at the discharge (T1), we evaluated as outcome measures: Barthel Index (BI), modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, 6-Minute Walking Test (6-MWT) and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. We also assessed: type of respiratory supports needed, pulmonary function, coagulation and inflammation markers and length of stay (LOS) in Rehabilitation Unit. RESULTS: We included 41 postacute COVID-19 patients (25 male and 19 female), mean aged 72.1511.07 years. Their mean LOS in the Rehabilitation Unit was 31.979.06 days, as 39 successfully completed the rehabilitation treatment and 2 deceased. We found statistically significant improvement in BI (84.8715.56 vs. 43.3726.00; P<0.0001), 6-MWT (303.37112.18 vs. 240.081.31 meters; P=0.028), Borg RPE scale (12.232.51 vs. 16.032.28; P<0.0001).

Poor glycemic control including hypoglycemia enhances complication rates and associated morbidity, mortality and costs. Consequently, this needs to be addressed. Whilst the majority of patients with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, a considerable number of patients with diabetes require insulin to help control their diabetes. Long-acting insulin analogues were developed to reduce hypoglycemia associated with insulin and help improve adherence, which can be a concern. However, their considerably higher costs have impacted on their funding and use, especially in countries with affordability issues. Biosimilars can help reduce the costs of long-acting insulin analogues thereby increasing available choices. However, the availability and use of long-acting insulin analogues can be affected by limited price reductions versus originators and limited demand-side initiatives to encourage their use. Consequently, we wanted to assess current utilisation rates for long-acting insulin analogues, especially biosimilars, and the rationale for patterns seen, across multiple Asian countries ranging from Japan (high-income) to Pakistan (lower-income) to inform future strategies. METHODOLOGY Multiple approaches including assessing utilization and prices of insulins including biosimilars among six Asian countries and comparing the findings especially with other middle-income countries. RESULTS Typically, there was increasing use of long-acting insulin analogues among the selected Asian countries. This was especially the case enhanced by biosimilars in Bangladesh, India, and Malaysia reflecting their perceived benefits. However, there was limited use in Pakistan due to issues of affordability similar to a number of African countries. The high use of biosimilars in Bangladesh, India and Malaysia was helped by issues of affordability and local production. The limited use of biosimilars in Japan and Korea reflects limited price reductions and demand-side initiatives similar to a number of European countries. CONCLUSIONS Increasing use of long-acting insulin analogues across countries is welcomed, adding to the range of insulins available, which increasingly includes biosimilars. A number of activities are needed to enhance the use of long-acting insulin analogue biosimilars in Japan, Korea and Pakistan.","output":"Current utilisation patterns for long-acting insulin analogues including biosimilars among selected Asian countries and the implications for the future."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and concern about pandemic influenza prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop guidelines to prevent the transmission of all respiratory infections in health care settings during first contact with a potentially infected person. The extent to which health care workers and institutions use these CDC recommended practices is uncertain. METHODS: The study examined health care worker adherence to CDC recommended respiratory infection control practices in primary care clinics and emergency departments of 5 medical centers in King County, Washington, using a self-administered questionnaire. All clinical, allied, and administrative health care workers in study settings were invited to participate: 653 (53%) responded, and 630 were included. RESULTS: The survey revealed important shortcomings in overall personal and institutional use of CDC recommended practices, including deficiencies in posted alerts, patient masking and separation, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, staff training, and written procedures. Use of recommended measures was generally higher among nursing staff than medical practitioners. CONCLUSION: This study found significant gaps in adherence to CDC recommendations for the control of respiratory infections in ambulatory care clinical settings.

We find in total six candidate taxon levels two of which correspond to the species and genus ranks of the family. At these two levels, the six filovirus species and two genera officially recognized by ICTV, as well as a seventh tentative species for Lloviu virus and prototyping a third genus, are reproduced. DEmARC lends the highest possible support for these two as well as the four other levels, implying that the actual number of valid taxon levels remains uncertain and the choice of levels for filovirus species and genera is arbitrary.

T. gondii infection of the feline small intestine is critical for the completion of the life cycle and transmission of T. gondii. Protein acetylation is an important posttranslational modification, which plays roles in the regulation of various cellular processes. Therefore, understanding of how T. gondii reprograms the protein acetylation status of feline definitive host can help to thwart the production and spread of T. gondii. Here, we used affinity enrichment and high-resolution liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to profile the alterations of the acetylome in cat small intestine 10 days after infection by T. gondii Prugniuad (Pru) strain. Our analysis showed that T. gondii induced significant changes in the acetylation of proteins in the cat intestine. We identified 2606 unique lysine acetylation sites in 1357 acetylated proteins. The levels of 334 acetylated peptides were downregulated, while the levels of 82 acetylated peptides were increased in the infected small intestine. The proteins with differentially acetylated peptides were particularly enriched in the bioenergetics-related processes, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and oxidation-reduction. These results provide the first baseline of the global acetylome of feline small intestine following T. gondii infection and should facilitate further analysis of the role of acetylated protein in the pathogenesis of T. gondii infection in its definitive host.

In order to ensure nursing students' preparedness for entry into anaesthesia nursing practice, it is necessary to measure whether nursing students have achieved the required competence to practice as anaesthesia care providers. OBJECTIVES To assess the anaesthesia nursing competence of nursing students and to describe factors related to their anaesthesia nursing competence. This study will provide new knowledge to support the curricula of nursing education and new nurses' practice in anaesthesia care. DESIGN Cross-sectional survey design. METHODS Data from a sample of Finnish nursing students (n = 205) were collected by using an on-line/paper and pencil survey (the Anaesthesia Nursing Competence Scale, 7 categories) in 2017. The assessment was based on self-assessment and used a Visual Analogue Scale (0-100). Descriptive statistics, a Pearson correlation coefficient, independent sample t-tests and a multivariable regression were used to analyse the data. RESULTS The self-assessed overall competence of graduating nursing students was 59 (range 43-73). Approximately half of the students reached an acceptable level (60) and half did not. The highest self-assessed category was collaboration within patient care, and the lowest was knowledge of anaesthesia patient care. The number of credits, anaesthesia courses, and experience of clinical practice in anaesthesia nursing were significantly related to anaesthesia nursing competence. CONCLUSIONS Competence development in the knowledge of anaesthesia patient care should be considered in general nursing education. Student nurses' competence could be developed by providing more opportunities for theoretical studies and clinical practice in anaesthesia nursing. A specialised post-registration education in anaesthesia nursing might be one solution to overcome the limitations in the competence that general nursing education is not fully able to cover for anaesthesia nursing.","output":"Anaesthesia nursing competence: Self-assessment of nursing students."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breakdown of the inert and constitutive membrane building block sphingomyelin to the highly active lipid mediator ceramide by extracellularly active acid sphingomyelinase is tightly regulated during stress response and opens the gate for invading pathogens, triggering the immune response, development of remote organ failure, and tissue repair following severe infection. How do one enzyme and one mediator manage all of these affairs? Under physiological conditions, the enzyme is located in the lysosomes and takes part in the noiseless metabolism of sphingolipids, but following stress the protein is secreted into circulation. When secreted, acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is able to hydrolyze sphingomyelin present at the outer leaflet of membranes to ceramide. Its generation troubles the biophysical context of cellular membranes resulting in functional assembly and reorganization of proteins and receptors, also embedded in highly conserved response mechanisms. As a consequence of cellular signaling, not only induction of cell death but also proliferation, differentiation, and fibrogenesis are affected.

This study aims to investigate student feelings and perceptions around the transition from the pre-clinical to clinical part of the curriculum to inform interventions for helping them better manage the experience. METHOD A cross-sectional study of all students starting their first clinical placement was undertaken. Questionnaires were administered online. Ordinal data were collected via Likert-scale responses. Free text responses were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS Likert-scale responses showed that most students (69%) agreed or strongly agreed that they looked forward to the range of wards they would spend time on. Respectively, 41% and 43% of students agreed they would be supported in taking histories or carrying out clinical. The majority of students disagreed (28%) or were not sure (27%) that they would have a clear role on the ward. Free text responses identified that students looked forward to patient contact and new ways of learning but were apprehensive about making mistakes, poor staff attitude, personal wellbeing and a lack of purpose in the clinical environment.

However, urgent suspected colorectal cancer (CRC) referrals continued. Serendipitously, a national study suggested that a new faecal immunochemical test (FIT) might be helpful in triaging patients with colorectal alarm symptoms. METHODS: This was a single centre observational study of patients referred using NG12 criteria between March and August 2020. Patients were triaged to the urgent cancer pathway for FIT  10 g/g and investigated using the latest National Health Service England guidance. Demographic data, method of investigations, cancer and polyp detection rates were compared to patients referred in the 6 months prior to the use of FIT as a triage tool. RESULTS: In all, 1192 patients (median age 70) were referred using NG12 guidelines during the pandemic period, compared with 1592 patients (median age 72) in the previous 6 months. CRC detection was similar in both groups (n = 45, 2.8% vs. n = 38, 3.5%; P = 0.248). Two patients with a negative FIT (0.36%) had CRC. Using FIT as a triage tool resulted in a significant reduction in the use of endoscopy (n = 477, 43.6% vs. n = 1186, 74.5%; P > 0.001) with a significant increase in CT scanning (n = 696, 63.6% vs. n = 750, 47.1%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of FIT in NG12 patients triaged during the first wave of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic reduced endoscopy but not CT scanning and did not compromise CRC detection rates. It is a safe method that aids in reducing the burden on services greatly.

One proposed mechanism, leader-primed transcription, predicts the formation of free 5'-leader in infected cells which then primes reinitiation of transcription at specific complementary sites on the antigenomic template. No free LDV 5'-leader of 156 nucleotides was detected in LDV-infected macrophages. Another mechanism, independent replication of the subgenomic mRNAs, predicts the presence of negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs in infected cells which might be generated from subgenomic mRNAs in virions. Full-length antigenomic RNA was detected in LDV-infected macrophages by Northern hybridization at a level of < 1% of that of genomic RNA, but no negative polarity subgenomic RNAs. Negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs, however, were detected by reverse transcription of total RNA from infected macrophages using as primer an oligonucleotide complementary to the antileader followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using this sense primer in combination with various oligonucleotide primers complementary to a segment downstream of the junction between the 5' leader and the body of each subgenomic RNA. It is unclear whether these minute amounts of negative subgenomic RNAs function in the replication of the subgenomic mRNAs. They could also be by-products of the RNA replication process.

Overall, about 57.3% (1640), 41.1% (1176), and 1.6% (46) of respondents were categorized as low (score <50%), moderate (score: 50%C80%), and high (score > 80%) proper practice, respectively. Eighty-five individuals with COVID-19 experience (3.0%) had lower knowledge score (79.91  17.93 vs. 83.81  13.88, P < 0.001) and lower proper practice score (40.22  16.57 vs. 47.96  16.15, respectively, P < 0.001) compared to those who were not infected. A higher level of knowledge was associated with appropriate practice in both groups of positive attitudes ((2) = 32.23, P < 0.001) and negative attitudes ((2) = 31.49, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This survey recorded good knowledge and relatively good attitudes among women.

Although the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multi-organ involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials. The framework presented herein offers an approach to decision-making regarding immunomodulatory therapy for severe or critical pediatric COVID-19 and is informed by currently available data, while awaiting results of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.","output":"Multidisciplinary Guidance Regarding the Use of Immunomodulatory Therapies for Acute COVID-19 in Pediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to improve the effect of ballet training, this paper combines digital technology to improve the motion recognition process, analyzes the imaging process, analyzes the system process combined with the human node model, and combines digital feature recognition technology to construct a ballet training motion correction system.

However, unwarranted variation in processes and outcomes has been reported in the treatment of IBD. A care pathway for the treatment of IBD has the potential to reduce practice variation and improve outcomes. This study aims to compare the effect of a uniform care pathway for the treatment of patients with IBD with biologics to the current situation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: IBD Value is a longitudinal multicentre non-randomised parallel cluster trial with a baseline period. The study takes place in eight centres in the Netherlands. The baseline period will run for 12 months, after which the care pathway will be implemented in 6 of the 8 participating hospitals during the implementation phase of 3 months. Hereafter, the effect of the care pathway will be assessed for 12 months. Total study period is 27 months. The primary outcome is the effect of the care pathway on disease control (IBD-Control questionnaire). Secondary outcomes are the effect of the care pathway on the other outcomes of the International Consortium of Health Outcomes Measurement IBD standard set, health-related generic quality of life, patient experiences and degree of variation; cost effectiveness of the care pathway; and the variation between hospitals in the aforementioned outcomes in the baseline period. Outcomes will be measured every 6 months. The study started on 1 December 2020 and a minimum of 200 patients will be included.

The causes of severe COVID-19 are of profound public health importance. Severe COVID-19 is marked by an exacerbated innate immune response leading to hyperinflammation which damages host tissues. Broad inhibition of hyperinflammation by dexamethasone is a mainstay of severe COVID-19 treatment. However, more targeted therapeutic approaches to dampen hyperinflammation are lacking. Patients typically exhibit increased neutrophil numbers in the blood and lung, and increased formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Previous work profiled the metabolome of plasma in severe COVID-19 patients and found several metabolic aberrations as compared to mild COVID-19 patients or healthy controls. However, the metabolome of immune cell populations in COVID-19 has not been characterized to our knowledge. In addition, it is not known if metabolic changes observed in severe COVID-19 mechanistically contribute to hyperinflammation and host tissue damage or if they are simply markers of pathology. To understand how metabolism can regulate the innate immune system in COVID-19 and to explore possible therapeutic targets, we carried out a comprehensive metabolomic study of neutrophils purified from healthy controls, mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, and severe COVID-19 patients. Severe COVID-19 patients were defined as having Acute Respiratory Distress and being treated in the intensive care unit. Plasma from the same patients and healthy controls was also collected and metabolomics was performed to study how COVID-19 impacts the neutrophil and plasma metabolome in tandem. Several metabolic pathways were significantly different between mild COVID-19 patients, severe COVID-19 patients, and healthy controls, consistent with rewired neutrophil and plasma metabolome in severe COVID-19. Differentially abundant metabolites belonged to central carbon metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism and other pathways. Variation in the PMN metabolome was largely independent from variation in the plasma metabolome. This suggests that processes internal to neutrophils drive changes in neutrophil metabolism. Metabolomics in 3 mouse models of hyperinflammation showed common or distinct metabolic features that change in inflammation compared to metabolomics of severe COVID-19 patients. Therefore changes in some metabolites comprise a general hyperinflammatory metabolic signature while others are more specific to severe COVID-19. Isotope tracing experiments were carried out to understand how nutrients were utilized in neutrophils in context of inflammation. We will describe mechanistic work testing whether metabolic features we observe in severe COVID-19 patients regulate the inflammatory response of human neutrophils.

METHODS: We searched six electronic academic databases for studies published between January 1990 and September 2019: Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Scopus, CINAHL and Cochrane. For intervention description and data extraction we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist and Template for Intervention Description and Replication guide. Quality was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tools. Grey literature results were deemed beyond the scope of this review due to the large number of interventions and lack of available outcomes data. RESULTS: Of 4501 studies, 7 met the eligibility criteria of UK-based community interventions targeting mental health in adults from ethnic minority populations: four randomised controlled trials, one pre/post-pilot study, one cross-sectional study and one ethnographic study. Interventions included therapy-style sessions, peer-support groups, educational materials, gym access and a family services programme. Common components included a focus on tackling social isolation, using lay health workers from within the community, signposting and overcoming structural barriers to access. Four studies reported a statistically significant positive effect on mental health outcomes and six were appraised as having a high risk of bias. Study populations were ethnically heterogeneous and targeted people mainly from South Asia. No studies examined interventions targeting men. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding community-centred interventions focused on improving public mental health among ethnic minority groups. Decision makers need scientific evidence to inform effective approaches to mitigating health disparities.

Curcumin has been indicated to be neuroprotective against neurological and psychological disorders. However, the role of curcumin in autistic phenotypes remains unclear. OBJECTIVES In the current study, we evaluated the effects of neonatal curcumin treatment on behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis in BTBRT+ltpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, a model of autism. METHODS C57BL/6J (C57) and BTBR mouse pups were treated with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or curcumin (20 mg/kg) from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P8. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) were evaluated on P8, and neurogenesis was measured on P24 by immunofluorescence. A battery of behavioral tests was carried out when the mice were 8 weeks of age. RESULTS Neonatal curcumin treatment improved autism-related symptoms in BTBR mice, enhancing sociability, reducing repetitive behaviors, and ameliorating cognitive impairments. Furthermore, the suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis in BTBR mice was greatly rescued after neonatal curcumin treatment, leading to an increase in neurogenic processes and an increase in NPC proliferation concomitant with an expansion of the NPC pool on P8, and NPC differentiation towards the neuronal lineage was promoted in the DG of BTBR mice on P24. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that neonatal curcumin treatment elicits a therapeutic response through the restoration of hippocampal neurogenesis in BTBR mice and thus may represent a promising novel pharmacological strategy for ASD treatment.","output":"Neonatal curcumin treatment restores hippocampal neurogenesis and improves autism-related behaviors in a mouse model of autism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor, is unarguably the leading cause of honeybee (Apis mellifera) mortality worldwide through its role as a vector for lethal viruses, in particular, strains of the Deformed wing virus (DWV) and Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) complexes. Several honeybee populations across Europe have well-documented adaptations of mite-resistant traits but little is known about host adaptations towards the virus infections vectored by the mite. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the possible contribution of adapted virus tolerance and/or resistance to the enhanced survival of four well-documented mite-resistant honeybee populations from Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands and France, in relation to unselected mite-susceptible honeybees. Caged adult bees and laboratory reared larvae, from colonies of these four populations, were inoculated with DWV and ABPV in a series of feeding infection experiments, while control groups received virus-free food. Virus infections were monitored using RT-qPCR assays in individuals sampled over a time course. In both adults and larvae the DWV and ABPV infection dynamics were nearly identical in all groups, but all mite-resistant honeybee populations had significantly higher survival rates compared to the mite-susceptible honeybees.

METHODS: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N = 2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N = 1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N = 1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress ('resilient' class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Monitoring these trajectories is necessary moving forward, in particular for the ~30% of individuals with increasing anxiety-depression levels.","output":"Refuting the myth of a 'tsunami' of mental ill-health in populations affected by COVID-19: evidence that response to the pandemic is heterogeneous, not homogeneous"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The sound viability of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) positively influences nations economic growth.

Hence, this study aims to investigate the perceived negative impact of Covid-19 on SMEs and suggests policy solutions to improve access to finance and investment sustainability for the SMEs owners in the post-Covid-19 recovery via the stakeholders perception in KSA. Design/methodology/approach: The paper sourced data from Medina, Riyadh and Alqassim via virtual interviews. The study engaged SMEs owners, government agencies and banks within the covered regions in KSA. The sourced data were analysed via a thematic, and the results were presented in themes. Findings: The findings show that the SMEs sector plays a pertinent role in KSA gross domestic product growth. But, the recent ravaging of the SME sector by the Covid-19 pandemic was adversely unprecedented, and stakeholders were caught unaware. The paper categorised the perceived impacts into most severe, severe and fairly severe. The findings show that SMEs sector post-Covid-19 recovery will require access to finance-friendly policies to revive the unique sector. This should be supported with an enabling business environment via policies that encourage investment and sustainability to achieve KSA Vision 2030. Research limitations/implications: The study is restricted to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on SMEs and data collected via virtual interviews across three cities in KSA.

SOGIECE are associated with significant adverse health and social outcomes. SOGIECE continue to be practiced around the world, despite denouncements from professional bodies and survivors, as well as calls for legislative advocacy to prohibit SOGIECE and protect SGM. There are substantial gaps in the availability of consolidated international research to support and refine legislative proposals related to SOGIECE, including those currently underway to enforce bans in Canada and elsewhere. We therefore propose the first systematic review of international data on SOGIECE that will outline the scope and nature of these practices worldwide. Specifically, we aim to estimate how many SGM have been exposed to SOGIECE, which sub-groups of SGM experience higher rates of SOGIECE, and how estimates of SOGIECE vary over time and place. In addition, we aim to describe when, where, how, and under what circumstances SGM are exposed to SOGIECE.

DESIGN Cross-sectional correlational (observational) design. METHODS Data were collected via electronic online survey distributed to registered critical care nurses working in King Khalid Hospital (KKH), Ha'il, KSA, between July and August 2020. Participant demographics and key variables data related to NPE, job satisfaction and ITL respectively were collected from the participants using existing and validated questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and correlational analysis and multivariable analyses were conducted. RESULTS A response rate of 98% was achieved (152/160) for the study. Findings showed that the NPE was largely favourable (M = 2.89, SD = 0.44); however, nurse participation in hospital affairs (M = 2.83, SD = 0.47) and staffing and resource adequacy (M = 2.88, SD = 0.47) scored lowest.

The reporting of a locally validated kidney donor profile index (KDPI) began in Australia in 2016. Across diverse populations, KDPI has demonstrated utility in predicting allograft survival and function. A metric that incorporates both elements may provide a more comprehensive picture of suboptimal recipient outcomes. METHODS. A retrospective cohort study of adult kidney transplant recipients in Australia (January 2009 to December 2014) was conducted. Conventional recipient outcomes and a composite measure of suboptimal outcome (1-y allograft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 mL/min) were evaluated across KDPI intervals (KDPI quintiles and 5-point increments in the KDPI 81C100 cohort). The impact of increasing KDPI on allograft function (1-y eGFR) and a suboptimal outcome was explored using multivariable regression models, adjusting for potential confounding factors. RESULTS. In 2923 donor kidneys eligible for analysis, median KDPI was 54 (interquartile range [IQR], 31C77), and Kidney Donor Risk Index was 1.39 (IQR, 1.03C1.67). The median 1-y eGFR was 52.74 mL/min (IQR, 40.79C66.41 mL/min). Compared with the first quintile reference group, progressive reductions in eGFR were observed with increasing KDPI and were maximal in the fifth quintile (adjusted -coefficient: ?27.43 mL/min; 95% confidence interval, C29.44 to C25.42; P < 0.001).

Therefore, this study aimed to collect qualitative and quantitative evidence of malaria and chikungunya co-infection among febrile patients. Methods: Potentially relevant studies were identified using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. The bias risk of the included studies was assessed using the checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. The pooled prevalence of malaria and chikungunya co-infection among febrile patients and the pooled prevalence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection among malaria patients were estimated with the random effect model. The odds of malaria and chikungunya co-infection among febrile patients were also estimated using a random effect model that presumed the heterogeneity of the outcomes of the included studies. The heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I(2) statistics. Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot and Eggers test. Results: Of the 1924 studies that were identified from the three databases, 10 fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in our study. The pooled prevalence of malaria and chikungunya co-infection (182 cases) among febrile patients (16,787 cases), stratified by diagnostic tests for CHIKV infection, was 10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8C11%, I(2): 99.5%) using RDT (IgM), 7% (95% CI: 4C10%) using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), 1% (95% CI: 0C2%, I(2): 41.5%) using IgM and IgG ELISA, and 4% (95% CI: 2C6%) using real-time RT-PCR. When the prevalence was stratified by country, the prevalence of co-infection was 7% (95% CI: 5C10%, I(2): 99.5%) in Nigeria, 1% (95% CI: 0C2%, I(2): 99.5%) in Tanzania, 10% (95% CI: 8C11%) in Sierra Leone, 1% (95% CI: 0C4%) in Mozambique, and 4% (95% CI: 2C6%) in Kenya. The pooled prevalence of CHIKV infection (182 cases) among malaria patients (8317 cases), stratified by diagnostic tests for CHIKV infection, was 39% (95% CI: 34C44%, I(2): 99.7%) using RDT (IgM), 43% (95% CI: 30C57%) using PRNT, 5% (95% CI: 3C7%, I(2): 5.18%) using IgM and IgG ELISA, and 9% (95% CI: 6C15%) using real-time RT-PCR. The meta-analysis showed that malaria and chikungunya co-infection occurred by chance (p: 0.59, OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.6C1.07, I(2): 78.5%). Conclusions: The prevalence of malaria and chikungunya co-infection varied from 0% to 10% as per the diagnostic test for CHIKV infection or the country where the co-infection was reported. Hence, the clinicians who diagnose patients with malaria infections in areas where two diseases are endemic should further investigate for chikungunya co-infection to prevent misdiagnosis or delayed treatment of concurrent infection.","output":"Prevalence of Malaria and Chikungunya Co-Infection in Febrile Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Dual Implicit Process Model (March et al., 2018b) distinguishes the implicit processing of physical threat (i.e., \\"Can it hurt or kill me?\\") from valence (i.e., \\"Do I dislike/like it?\\").

The condition is common, but also over-diagnosed, in part due to relatively poor laboratory and radiographic diagnostics. Indeed, we continue to rely on antiquated tools such as sputum culture and chest X-ray C the former of which lacks speed and sensitivity, and the latter specificity (Albaum et al. Chest 110:343C50, 1996). The resulting presumptive diagnoses of pneumonia lead to excessive use of empiric broad spectrum antibiotics; indeed, by some estimates, 30C70% of antibiotic prescriptions for lower respiratory tract infection are inappropriate (Kraus, PLoS One 12(3): e0174584, 2017). This approach begets microbial resistance, exposes patients to medication side effects, and puts patients at risk of potentially life-threatening complications including Clostridium difficile colitis. To improve diagnostic certainty in patients with suspected pneumonia, we must begin to consider and implement emerging technologies for efficient and accurate characterization of host responses to infection and identification of pathogens.

Using primary data from a pilot survey conducted online during the pandemic and applying Probit and Heckman selection models, the study analyzes levels of happiness and propensity to help others. The results suggest that past consumption of culture is associated with higher happiness levels during crises.

Many U.S. health-insurance plans will not authorize second- and third-stage surgeries or revision surgeries without two referral letters. Such requirements are not supported by WPATH guidelines. OBJECTIVES This study investigates insurance requirements for referral letters and their negative impact on care. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all gGAS cases over a 4-year period at our tertiary care medical center. Referral-letter requirements for insurance authorization were documented. The nation's largest insurance companies, including commercial, state-, and federally funded plans, were contacted to confirm requirements. We prospectively recorded time needed to complete insurance authorization for a patient subset. WPATH publications were reviewed. RESULTS Nearly all reviewed U.S. health-insurance plans required annually updated referral letters for each gGAS procedure, including staged and revision surgeries. No updated letters changed clinical management. Referral-letter requirements delayed care. WPATH states that letters should not be needed for staged surgeries. Some plans required letters even for initial surgical consultation, a practice not supported by WPATH. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Insurance companies' requirements for referral letters impede care and contradict WPATH guidelines. We advocate that, at minimum, referral letters should not be required for surgical consultations or for staged or revision surgeries after a patient has already had first-stage primary gGAS. Universal referral-letter requirements provide minimal clinical value, delay care, increase costs, and exacerbate gender dysphoria by invalidating gender transition. As with all procedures, surgeons themselves should be responsible for assessing patients' surgical readiness. Significant changes in mental-health status or social situation should prompt surgeons to seek reassessment. WPATH recommendations regarding referral letters should be clarified and consolidated into a single document.","output":"Requirement of Mental-Health Referral Letters for Staged and Revision Genital Gender-Affirming Surgeries: An Unsanctioned Barrier to Care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Yellow head virus (YHV) is one of the most serious pathogens that causes worldwide shrimp production loss. It enters the cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and utilizes small GTPase Rab proteins such as PmRab5 and PmRab7 for intracellular trafficking. In this study, molecular cloning and functional analysis of Rab11 during YHV infection were investigated. PmRab11 cDNA was cloned by Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACEs). It contained two forms of sizes 1200 and 1050 bp distinct at the 5? UTR. The coding region of PmRab11 was 645 bp, encoding 214 amino acids. It also demonstrated the characteristics of Rab11 proteins containing five GTP-binding domains, five Rab family domains, four Rab subfamily domains and a prenylation site at the C-terminus. Suppression of PmRab11 using dsRNA-PmRab11 either before or after YHV-challenge resulted in significant inhibition of YHV levels in the hemocytes and viral release in the supernatant in both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, the silencing effect of PmRab11 in YHV-infected shrimps resulted in a delay in shrimp mortality for at least 2 days. Immunofluorescence study showed co-localization between PmRab11 and YHV at 24C72 h post YHV-challenge. In contrast, the co-localization signals were absence in the PmRab11 knockdown hemocytes and the YHV signals accumulated at the perinuclear region at 24 h post YHV-challenge. Then, accumulation of YHV was hardly observed after 48C72 h.

Recent identification in mammalian and teleost fish of cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and their mitochondrial adaptor: the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, also called IPS-1, highlight their important role in the induction of IFN at the early stage of a virus infection. More recently, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adaptor: the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, also called MITA, ERIS and MPYS, has been shown to play a pivotal role in response to both non-self-cytosolic RNA and dsDNA. In this study, we cloned STING cDNAs from zebrafish and showed that it was an ortholog to mammalian STING. We demonstrated that overexpression of this ER protein in fish cells led to a constitutive induction of IFN and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). STING-overexpressing cells were almost fully protected against RNA virus infection with a strong inhibition of both DNA and RNA virus replication. In addition, we found that together with MAVS, STING was an important player in the RIG-I IFN-inducing pathway. This report provides the demonstration that teleost fish possess a functional RLR pathway in which MAVS and STING are downstream signaling molecules of RIG-I.

Finally, we apply the proposed design and testing procedures to investigate the effect of social distancing during the phased reopening in the United States on public health outcomes using data compiled from sources including Unacast, the United States Census Bureau, and the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Program.

METHODS Twelve mothers, aged between 22 and 43, participated in the semi-structured interviews. The mean age of infants was 19 months. Interviews comprised open-ended questions and visual stimuli consisting of photographs brought by participants, word selection, and card sorting techniques. Data were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2013). RESULTS Three themes arose from a clustering of 10 subthemes: (a) Emotional Impact, (b) Searching for Parent Identity, and (c) Moving Beyond Adversity. Participants expressed experiencing heightened emotional distress during the time of their infants' birth and hospitalization and initially not feeling like parents. Their parental identity strengthened as they became more involved in the care of their infant and began to accept the situation. Participants described parenting their premature infants differently compared with parents of full-term infants, and described adjusting to this difference over time.

This article describes the different approaches taken towards optimal fallow periods in Canadian jurisdictions. METHODS: We searched publicly available information from dentist and dental hygiene regulator websites across the 10 provinces and 3 territories in Canada. We also searched for guidance documents on dental associations websites or through personal communication with government officials. We extracted and tabulated information on fallow period recommendations or guidance, when available. RESULTS: Nine jurisdictions (6 provinces and all 3 territories) acknowledge or provide guidance on fallow periods following aerosol-generating procedures. Among those who have provided guidance regarding a fallow period, recommendations follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance if the air changes per hour (ACH) in the dental operatory is known. CONCLUSION: The evidence for deciding on optimal fallow period is limited and still being explored, resulting in substantial variation across Canadian jurisdictions. A focus on developing scientific evidence relevant to dentistry and assimilating existing science is crucial to establishing consistency and uniformity in information to deliver safe oral health care services.","output":"A Review of Optimal Fallow Period Guidance Across Canadian Jurisdictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic offers the opportunity to assess how hospitals managed the care of hospitalized patients with varying demographics and clinical presentation. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the impact of densely populated residential areas on hospitalization and to identify predictors of length of stay and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in one of the hardest hit counties internationally. METHODS: This is a single-center cohort study of 1325 sequentially hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in New York between March 2, 2020 to May 11, 2020. Geospatial distribution of study patients residence relative to population density in the region were mapped and data analysis included hospital length of stay, need and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. Logistic regression models were constructed to predict discharge dispositions in the remaining active study patients. RESULTS: The median age of the study cohort was 62 years (IQR - 49-75), and more than half were male (57%) with history of hypertension (60%), obesity (41%), and diabetes (42%). Geographic residence of the study patients was disproportionately associated with areas of higher population density (r(s)=0.235, p=0.004), with noted hot spots in the region. Study patients were predominantly hypertensive (MAP>90mmHg (670, 51%)) on presentation with lymphopenia (590, 55%), hyponatremia (411, 31%), and kidney dysfunction (eGFR&60ml/min/1.73m (2) (381, 29%)). Of the patients with a disposition (1188/1325), 15% (182/1188) required IMV and 21% (250/1188) developed acute kidney injury. In patients on IMV, median hospital length of stay in survivors (22 days; 16.5-29.5) was significantly longer than non-survivors (15 days; 10-23.75), but this was not due to prolonged time on the ventilator. The overall mortality in all hospitalized patients was 15% and in patients receiving IMV was 48%, which is predicted to minimally rise from 48% to 49% based on logistic regression models constructed to project the disposition in the remaining patients on the ventilator. Acute kidney injury during hospitalization (OR(E)=3.23) was the strongest predictor of mortality in patients requiring IMV. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to collectively utilize the demographics, clinical characteristics and hospital course of COVID-19 patients to identify predictors of poor outcomes that can be used for resource allocation in future waves of the pandemic.","output":"Geospatial Distribution and Predictors of Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccines are considered the path out of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government of Kenya is implementing a phased strategy to vaccinate the Kenyan population, initially targeting populations at high risk of severe disease and infection. We estimated the financial and economic unit costs of procuring and delivering the COVID-19 vaccine in Kenya across various vaccination strategies. METHODS: We used an activity-based costing approach to estimate the incremental costs of COVID-19 vaccine delivery, from a health systems perspective. Document reviews and key informant interviews(n = 12) were done to inform the activities, assumptions and the resources required. Unit prices were derived from document reviews or from market prices. Both financial and economic vaccine procurement costs per person vaccinated with 2-doses, and the vaccine delivery costs per person vaccinated with 2-doses were estimated and reported in 2021USD. RESULTS: The financial costs of vaccine procurement per person vaccinated with 2-doses ranged from $2.89-$13.09 in the 30% and 100% coverage levels respectively, however, the economic cost was $17.34 across all strategies. Financial vaccine delivery costs per person vaccinated with 2-doses, ranged from $4.28-$3.29 in the 30% and 100% coverage strategies: While the economic delivery costs were two to three times higher than the financial costs. The total procurement and delivery costs per person vaccinated with 2-doses ranged from $7.34-$16.47 for the financial costs and $29.7-$24.68 for the economic costs for the 30% and 100% coverage respectively. With the exception of procurement costs, the main cost driver of financial and economic delivery costs was supply chain costs (47C59%) and advocacy, communication and social mobilization (29C35%) respectively. CONCLUSION: This analysis presents cost estimates that can be used to inform local policy and may further inform parameters used in cost-effectiveness models. The results could potentially be adapted and adjusted to country-specific assumptions to enhance applicability in similar low-and middle-income settings.","output":"Examining the unit costs of COVID-19 vaccine delivery in Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the need for observing health protocols, the experience of the loss and the grieving process has changed in nature during this disease.

The addition of a serological testing could reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for colleges/universities in the United States, without compromising the efficacy of the testing plan. Objectives. To determine whether a college/university reopening SARS-CoV-2 testing plan that includes serological testing can be cost-saving compared to a PCR-only testing. Design, Setting, and Participants: We assessed costs of serological testing in addition to PCR testing under various scenarios of university sizes (2000, 10,000, and 40,000) and epidemic conditions (initial antibody prevalence 2.5-15%; cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the school year 5-30%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. We estimated total testing costs and relative percentage of cost-savings of different screening (i.e. targeted/ universal) and testing (i.e. in-sourcing/out-sourcing) scenarios between September 2020-May 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Testing costs of serological testing and PCR testing, Relative percentage of cost saving by including serology testing in addition to PCR testing. Results: Including baseline serology testing alongside routine regular PCR testing can reduce total test volumes and related costs throughout the school year. While the total testing cost is likely much lower if regular PCR testing is insourced compared to outsourced ($5 million vs $34 million for university size 10,000), including serologic testing could achieve the up to 20% cost-savings relative to PCR testing alone. The insourcing of serological testing when PCR testing is insourced can achieve greater cost-savings under high initial antibody prevalence (>5%) and cumulative incidence throughout the school year (>10%) at medium and large sized universities. If PCR testing is outsourced, however, the inclusion of serological testing becomes always preferred in most university sizes and epidemic conditions. Conclusions and Relevance: While regular PCR testing alone is the preferred strategy for containing epidemics, including serology testing may help achieve cost-savings if outbreaks are anticipated, or if baseline seropositivity is high.","output":"Serological testing in addition to PCR screening for the re-opening of American colleges and universities: potential for cost-savings without compromising pandemic mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Countries dealing with tourism crises use a variety of crisis communication strategies, as found in various studies.

Infection of specific cells which contain the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor results in a loss of protection of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR). Local activation by cortisol stimulates the release of ATP initially into the basolateral compartment and then by lysosomal exocytosis from the cell surface. This then acts on adjacent cells. In the nose ATP acts as a nociceptive stimulus which results in anosmia. It is suggested that a similar paracrine mechanism is responsible for the loss of taste. In the lung ATP release from type 2 alveolar cells produces the non-productive cough by acting on purinergic receptors on adjacent neuroepithelial cells and activating, via the vagus, the cough reflex. Infection of endothelial cells results in the exocytosis of WeibelPalade bodies. These contain the Von Willebrand Factor responsible for micro-clotting and angiopoietin-2 which increases vascular permeability and plays a key role in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. To test this hypothesis this paper reports proof of concept studies in which MR blockade using spironolactone and low dose dexamethasone (SpiDex) was given to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. In 80 patients with moderate to severe respiratory failure 40 were given SpiDex and 40 conventional treatment with high dose dexamethasone (HiDex). There was 1 death in the HiDex group and none in the SpiDex. As judged by clinical, biochemical and radiological parameters there were clear statistically significant benefits of SpiDex in comparison to HiDex. A further 20 outpatients with COVID-19 were given SpiDex. There was no control group and the aim was to demonstrate safety. No adverse effects were noted and no patient became hyperkalaemic. 90% were asymptomatic at 10 days. The very positive results suggest that blockade of the MR can produce major benefit in COVID19 patients. Further larger controlled studies of inpatients and outpatients are required not only for SARS-CoV-2 infection per se but also to determine if this treatment affects the incidence of Long COVID.","output":"Follow Your Nose: A Key Clue to Understanding and Treating COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reducing Risk through Interpersonal Development, Empowerment, Resiliency, and Self-Determination (RezRIDERS) is a tribally-driven youth empowerment program designed to deter substance abuse and depression symptomology among high-risk American Indian youth while increasing hope/optimism, self-efficacy, and pro-social bonding.

We used mixed models to investigate the main effects and potential interactions between occupation and time for: workplace attendance, number of people in shared workspace, time spent sharing workspace, number of close contacts, and usage of face coverings. FindingsWorkplace attendance and contact patterns varied across occupations and time. The predicted probability of intense space sharing during the day was highest for healthcare (78% [95% CI: 75-81%]) and education workers (64% [59%-69%]), who also had the highest probabilities for larger numbers of close contacts (36% [32%-40%] and 38% [33%-43%] respectively).

The delay-resolved deep Q-network (DRDQN) algorithm is bench-marked on a variety of environments comprising of multi-step and stochastic delays and results in better performance, both in terms of achieving near-optimal rewards and minimizing the computational overhead thereof, with respect to the currently established algorithms.","output":"Revisiting State Augmentation methods for Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Delays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mamastrovirus 5 (MAstV5), belonging to the Astroviridae (AstV) family, previously known as canine astrovirus or astrovirus-like particles, has been reported in several countries to be associated with viral enteric disease in dogs since the 1980s.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in communities. However, few data are available in asymptomatic persons regarding the accuracy of PCR testing. Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined. Methods We conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using NPS and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort. Results In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence, 0.3%.

Methods: This was a retrospective study. A deep learning segmentation model was applied to segment lungs and infections in CT. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was used to create 3D models of the patients lungs and infections. A stereoscopic segmentation method was proposed, which can subdivide the 3D lung into five lobes and 18 segments. An expert-based CT scoring system was improved and artificial intelligence was used to automatically score instead of visual score. Non-linear regression and quantitative analysis were used to analyze the dynamic changes in the percentages of infection (POI). Results: The POI in the five lung lobes of all patients were calculated and converted into CT scores. The CT scores of Original COVID-19 patients and Delta Variant patients since the onset of initial symptoms were fitted over time, respectively. The peak was found to occur on day 11 in Original COVID-19 patients and on day 15 in Delta Variant patients. The time course of lung changes in CT of Delta Variant patients was redetermined as early stage (0C3 days), progressive and peak stage (4C16 days), and absorption stage (17C42 days). The first RT-PCR negative time in Original COVID-19 patients appeared earlier than in Delta Variant patients (22 [17C30] vs. 39 [31C44], p < 0.001). Delta Variant patients had more re-detectable positive RT-PCR test results than Original COVID-19 patients after the first negative RT-PCR time (30.5% vs. 17.1%). In the early stage, CT scores in the right lower lobe were significantly different (Delta Variant vs. Original COVID-19, 0.8  0.6 vs. 1.3  0.6, p = 0.039). In the absorption stage, CT scores of the right middle lobes were significantly different (Delta Variant vs. Original COVID-19, 0.6  0.7 vs. 0.3  0.4, p = 0.012). The left and the right lower lobes contributed most to lung involvement at any given time. Conclusion: Compared with the Original COVID-19, the Delta Variant has a longer lung change duration, more re-detectable positive RT-PCR test results, different locations of pneumonia, and more lesions in the early stage, and the peak of infection occurred later.","output":"Exploring New Characteristics: Using Deep Learning and 3D Reconstruction to Compare the Original COVID-19 and Its Delta Variant Based on Chest CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of March 2020, South Africa (59 million inhabitants) was hit by the pandemic of COVID-19 and soon became the most affected country in Africa by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The plasticity of these cellular organelles is an essential requisite for the cells to cope with different stimuli and stress conditions. Cancer cells are characterized by changes in energy metabolism, mitochondrial signaling, and dynamics. These changes are driven by alterations in the mitochondrial proteome. For this reason, in the last years a focus of basic and cancer research has been the implementation and optimization of technologies to investigate changes in the mitochondrial proteome during cancer initiation and progression. This review presents an overview of the most used technologies to investigate the mitochondrial proteome and recent evidence on changes in the expression levels and delocalization of certain proteins in and out the mitochondria for shaping the functional properties of tumor cells. ABSTRACT: Mitochondria are highly dynamic and regulated organelles implicated in a variety of important functions in the cell, including energy production, fatty acid metabolism, iron homeostasis, programmed cell death, and cell signaling. Changes in mitochondrial metabolism, signaling and dynamics are hallmarks of cancer. Understanding whether these modifications are associated with alterations of the mitochondrial proteome is particularly relevant from a translational point of view because it may contribute to better understanding the molecular bases of cancer development and progression and may provide new potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers as well as novel molecular targets for anti-cancer treatment. Making an inventory of the mitochondrial proteins has been particularly challenging given that there is no unique consensus targeting sequence that directs protein import into mitochondria, some proteins are present at very low levels, while other proteins are expressed only in some cell types, in a particular developmental stage or under specific stress conditions. This review aims at providing the state-of-the-art on methodologies used to characterize the mitochondrial proteome in tumors and highlighting the biological relevance of changes in expression and delocalization of proteins in and out the mitochondria in cancer biology.","output":"The Mitochondrial Proteome of Tumor Cells: A SnapShot on Methodological Approaches and New Biomarkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the major environmental challenges faced by the aviation industry is the sustainable management of solid waste at airports Rising passenger volumes and expansion of airport activities have considerably increased the types and quantities of waste generated at airports With many regional and national governments emphasizing on waste diversion from landfills, numerous airports are gradually transitioning to sustainable alternatives Despite being a pressing issue, there is limited literature on waste management initiatives and their efficiency at airports This has become more vital since the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has had a significant impact on the generation and management of wastes, especially at airports This article conducts a systematic review of the various aspects of airport waste management, viz the types and sources of wastes generated, the management practices adopted for the different waste streams, and the associated challenges The waste generation trends and management models at different airports have been explored to develop a knowledge base for decision-makers and policy analysts The article also identifies potential challenges lying ahead for the aviation industry with respect to waste management post-COVID-19","output":"Understanding waste management at airports: A study on current practices and challenges based on literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

In recent years, healthcare systems have experienced shortages of RPDs during outbreaks of infectious diseases, in part due to a lack of information about their availability. New tools to track RPD inventories may improve accessibility during an emergency. Investigators at Vanderbilt University have identified four major themes that influence RPD use for infection prevention: hospital preparedness, responsiveness to airborne pathogens, potential exposure outcomes, and infection control practices related to respirator effectiveness. Based on these findings, an RPD surveillance tool (RST) was developed to collect and share near real-time data about RPD supplies in healthcare facilities. The objective of this study was to conduct a feasibility assessment of this RST. Methods The new online surveillance tool was implemented at four large, urban, acute care U.S. hospitals in January 2014; data was collected about RPD inventory, tracking systems, hospital characteristics, and utility of gathered information. Results The RST was implemented successfully and without difficulty at hospitals that had 78 to 90 percent occupancy rates. Participating hospitals reported that the RST (1) provided value for benchmarking their RPD supply, (2) promoted understanding about RPD accessibility among hospital systems engaged in infection control, and (3) served as a means to assess RPD program quality.

Any information of the SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged through as time being will be evaluated for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. METHODS We extracted more than two million data of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from the open COVID-19 dashboard. The sequences of the 38-aminoi acid putative Orf10 protein within infected patients were gather output through from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the mutation rates in each position were analyzed and presented in each month of 2020. The mutation rates of A8 and V30 within orf10 are displayed in selected counties: America, India, German and Japan. RESULTS The numbers of COVID-19 patients are correlated to the death numbers, but not with the death rates (stable and lower than 3%).

During the first wave of the pandemic (March-June 2020), following a national health decree demanding that no visitors or family members be allowed in health institutions, our geriatric rehabilitation center closed gates to all visitors from the outside. We aimed to assess the rehabilitation outcomes of older patients with hip fractures in the first pandemic wave, who underwent rehabilitation under complete social isolation from primary care givers and family members. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. It took place at a university-affiliated, major postacute geriatric rehabilitation center. Rehabilitation outcomes measured were discharge functional independence measure (FIM) score and motor FIM score, FIM score change, motor FIM score change, favorable motor FIM effectiveness, length of stay, discharge destination, and home aid at discharge. RESULTS: The study group included 36 patients who were admitted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020).

METHODS: Blood samples were collected from healthcare workers (HCW) receiving their first BNT162b2 vaccine dose between January and February 2021. Antibody (Ab) production was measured, prior to and weekly for 4 weeks post immunization, and a final measurement was performed at 8 weeks. Serum vitamin D concentrations were also measured at baseline. FINDINGS: Immunization of 97 HCW induced an Ab response that peaked 3?2 weeks post immunization to decrease thereafter. Ab levels remained positive at 8 weeks. IgG peak concentration was negatively associated with age (=-0?440, p<0.001). Response to immunization was also significantly affected by vitamin D status (p=0?022), on average 29?3% greater peak value in individuals with 25(OH)D>50nmol/L.

Transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) has been shown to augment locomotor activity after iSCI, presumably due to modulation of spinal excitability. However, the effects of possible excitability modulations induced by tSCS on ankle control have not yet been assessed. This study investigated the immediate (i.e., without training) effects during single-sessions of tonic tSCS on ankle control, spinal excitability, and locomotion in ten individuals with chronic, sensorimotor iSCI (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale D). Participants performed rhythmic ankle movements (dorsi- and plantar flexion) at a given rate, and irregular ankle movements following a predetermined trajectory with and without tonic tSCS at 15 Hz, 30 Hz, and 50 Hz. In a subgroup of eight participants, the effects of tSCS on assisted over-ground walking were studied. Furthermore, the activity of a polysynaptic spinal reflex, associated with spinal locomotor networks, was investigated to study the effect of the stimulation on the dedicated spinal circuitry associated with locomotor function. Tonic tSCS at 30 Hz immediately improved maximum dorsiflexion by +4.6  0.9 in the more affected lower limb during the rhythmic ankle movement task, resulting in an increase of +2.9  0.9 in active range of motion. Coordination of ankle movements, assessed by the ability to perform rhythmic ankle movements at a given target rate and to perform irregular movements according to a trajectory, was unchanged during stimulation. tSCS at 30 Hz modulated spinal reflex activity, reflected by a significant suppression of pathological activity specific to SCI in the assessed polysynaptic spinal reflex. During walking, there was no statistical group effect of tSCS. In the subgroup of eight assessed participants, the three with the lowest as well as the one with the highest walking function scores showed positive stimulation effects, including increased maximum walking speed, or more continuous and faster stepping at a self-selected speed. Future studies need to investigate if multiple applications and individual optimization of the stimulation parameters can increase the effects of tSCS, and if the technique can improve the outcome of locomotor rehabilitation after iSCI.","output":"Immediate Effects of Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation on Motor Function in Chronic, Sensorimotor Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant psychological consequences among the public, especially for people in the epicenter.

This paper investigates the causal relationship between inflation and infant mortality using a mixed frequency vector autoregressive model (MF-VAR) without any filtering procedure, along with impulse response analysis and forecast misspecification variance decomposition, and compares it with a low frequency vector autoregressive model (LF-VAR). We find that there is a causal relationship between inflation and infant mortality, specifically, that is inflation increases infant mortality. Moreover, the contribution of CPI to IMR is greater in the forecast error variance decomposition in the MF-VAR model compared to the LF-VAR model, indicating that CPI has stronger explanatory power for IMR in mixed-frequency data. The results of the study have important implications for China and other developing countries in reducing infant mortality and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

OBJECTIVES The primary objectives of this study were to determine the knowledge and attitude of patients in a primary care setting in Lebanon toward Western medical acupuncture and to determine factors that may affect their attitudes toward acupuncture use. The secondary objective was to compare the attitudes and knowledge of patients who had tried acupuncture with those who had not. METHODS This was a cross-sectional descriptive study about the perspectives of patients in a primary care setting in Lebanon on medical acupuncture. RESULTS A total of 212 surveys were completed (78.5% response rate). 24% of participants had not tried and were unwilling to try acupuncture (group 1), 63.5% of participants had not tried but indicated they would be willing to try acupuncture (group 2), and 12.5% of participants had previously tried acupuncture (group 3). Most participants in group 1 (55.6%) stated they would be unwilling to try acupuncture even if referred for it by a physician. Participants who had tried acupuncture (12.5%) had done so for pain conditions. DISCUSSION Group 3 scored higher on knowledge questions and had a more positive attitude toward the acupuncture procedure. Most patients who had tried it had done so to treat pain complaints. CONCLUSION Patients in groups 2 and 3 were more knowledgeable about acupuncture, had tried more complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities, and were more likely to try acupuncture as an add-on or last resort treatment, compared to group 1.","output":"Perspectives of patients on medical acupuncture in a primary care setting in Lebanon: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Researchers are working at unprecedented speed to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We aimed to assess the value of a hypothetical vaccine and its potential public health impact when prioritization is required due to supply constraints. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was used to estimate COVID-19 related direct medical costs and deaths in the United States (US), with and without implementation of a 60% efficacious vaccine. To prioritize the vaccine under constrained supply, the population was divided into tiers based on age; risk and age; and occupation and age; and outcomes were compared across one year under various supply assumptions. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus no vaccine was calculated for the entire adult population and for each tier in the three prioritization schemes. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained for the US adult population was $8,200 versus no vaccination. For the tiers at highest risk of complications from COVID-19, such as those ages 65 years and older, vaccination was cost-saving compared to no vaccination. The cost per QALY gained increased to over $94,000 for those with a low risk of hospitalization and death following infection. Results were most sensitive to infection incidence, vaccine price, the cost of treating COVID-19, and vaccine efficacy. Under the most optimistic supply scenario, the hypothetical vaccine may prevent 31% of expected deaths. As supply becomes more constrained, only 23% of deaths may be prevented. In lower supply scenarios, prioritization becomes more important to maximize the number of deaths prevented. CONCLUSIONS: A COVID-19 vaccine is predicted to be good value for money (cost per QALY gained <$50,000). The speed at which an effective vaccine can be made available will determine how much morbidity and mortality may be prevented in the US.","output":"The potential public health and economic value of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in the United States: Use of cost-effectiveness modeling to inform vaccination prioritization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies show that stress levels are higher among teachers than in many other occupational groups. Semi-structured interviews with 14 teachers from various regions of Russia were conducted to investigate the characteristics of psychological stress and coping strategies in the context of the abrupt transition to distance learning imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In remote schooling, teachers have to implement education programs despite their own pandemic anxiety, provide emotional support to students, and stimulate their motivation for learning. It appears from the interview data that teacher stress is elevated by the absence or lack of support from school administrators and a substantial increase in teacher workload caused by the need to search for new techniques of teaching and preparing for classes from a distance, intensified communication with students and their parents, and the growing amount of homework assignments to review. The stress factors specific to the pandemic include the new work-from-home setup and changes in the work-life balance.

Alendronate (ALN) is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption and results in reduced bone remodeling. This study investigated the effects of pre-emptive use of ALN on OA related osteoclastic subchondral bone resorption in an in vivo rat model for severe OA. Using multi-modality imaging we measured effects of ALN treatment within cartilage and synovium. Severe osteoarthritis was induced in left rat knees using papain injections in combination with a moderate running protocol. Twenty rats were treated with subcutaneous ALN injections and compared to twenty untreated controls. Animals were longitudinally monitored for 12weeks with in vivo CT to measure subchondral bone changes and SPECT/CT to determine synovial macrophage activation using a folate-based radiotracer. Articular cartilage was analyzed at 6 and 12weeks with ex vivo contrast enhanced CT and histology to measure sulfated-glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content and cartilage thickness. ALN treatment successfully inhibited subchondral bone remodeling. As a result we found less subchondral plate porosity and reduced osteophytosis. ALN treatment did not reduce subchondral sclerosis. However, after the OA induction phase, ALN treatment protected cartilage ECM from degradation and reduced synovial macrophage activation. Surprisingly, ALN treatment also improved sGAG content of tibia cartilage in healthy joints. Our data was consistent with the hypothesis that osteoclastic bone resorption might play an important role in OA and may be a driving force for progression of the disease. However, our study suggest that this effect might not solely be effects on osteoclastic activity, since ALN treatment also influenced macrophage functioning. Additionally, ALN treatment and physical activity exercised a positive effect in healthy control joints, which increased cartilage sGAG content. More research on this topic might lead to novel insights as to improve cartilage quality.","output":"Inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption through alendronate treatment in rats reduces severe osteoarthritis progression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effect of Inhaled Azodicarbonamide on F344/N Rats and B6C3F, Mice with 2-Week and 13-Week Inhalation Exposures.

Azodicarbonamide (ADA), a compound used in the baking and plastics industries, has been reported to cause pulmonary sensiti-zation and dermatitis in people. Two-week repeated and 13-week subchronic inhalation exposures of F344/N rats and B6C3F, mice to ADA were conducted to determine the toxicity of inhaled ADA. The mean air concentrations of ADA in the 2-week studies were 207, 102, 52, 9.4, or 2.0 mg/m3. No exposure-related mortality nor abnormal clinical signs were observed in rats or mice during or after exposure. The terminal body weights were slightly depressed in the highest exposure group. Liver weights were lower in male rats exposed to 200 mg ADA/m3. No significant lesions were noted on either gross or histologic evaluation of rats or mice. In the 13-week subchronic study, the mean air concentrations of ADA were 204, 100, or 50 mg/m3. No mortality or clinical signs related to exposure were observed. The terminal body weights of exposed rats were not significantly different from those of control rats but were significantly depressed in mice exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. No histopathological lesions were noted in mice. Lung weights were increased and enlarged mediastinal and/or tracheobronchial lymph nodes were noted in rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3. No exposure-related lesions were observed microscopically in rats exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. All rats in the 50 mg ADA/m3 exposure group only had lung lesions that consisted of perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and a multifocal type II cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible immune reaction to an antigen in the lung. Viral titers for rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3 were negative for Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice, which produce similar lesions. The possibility of an unknown viral antigen causing this lesion cannot be eliminated. Lung tissue from male rats was analyzed for ADA and biurea, the major metabolite of ADA. No ADA was detected. The amount of biurea in the lungs increased nonlinearly with increasing exposure concentration, suggesting that clearance was somewhat impaired with repeated exposures. However, even at the highest exposure concentration, this amount of biurea was less than 1 % of the estimated total ADA deposited over the exposure period. In summary, ADA is rapidly cleared from the lungs, even when inhaled at concentrations up to 200 mg/m3.

The theory thus identifies a trade off between (i) the swiftness of the intervention and (ii) the scope for crowding out.

Thus, we tested the hypothesis that intrinsic negative regulators of leptin signaling, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) underlie dysfunctional leptin-mediated vagal afferent satiety signaling during obesity. METHODS Experiments were performed on standard chow-fed control mice, high-fat fed (HFF), or low-fat fed (LFF) mice. SOCS3 and PTP1B expression were quantified using western blot and quantitative PCR. Nodose ganglion neuronal excitability and jejunal afferent sensitivity were measured by patch clamp and extracellular afferent recordings, respectively. RESULTS Increased expression of SOCS3 and PTP1B were observed in the jejunum of HFF mice. Prolonged incubation with leptin attenuated nodose ganglion neuronal excitability, and this effect was reversed by inhibition of SOCS3. Leptin potentiated jejunal afferent nerve responses to CCK in LFF mice but decreased them in HFF mice. Inhibition of SOCS3 restored impaired vagal afferent neuronal excitability and afferent nerve responses to satiety mediators during obesity. Two-pore domain K+ channel (K2P) conductance and nitric oxide (NO) production that we previously demonstrated were elevated during obesity were decreased by inhibitions of SOCS3 or PTP1B. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that obesity impairs vagal afferent sensitivity via SOCS3 and PTP1B, likely as a consequence of obesity-induced hyperleptinemia.

The primary objective of this study is to validate the efficacy of an adapted nurse-driven DKA protocol compared to a physician-driven DKA protocol across the continuum of three hospital settings: the University of Colorado upon which the physician-driven protocol is based, Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center (NLEMMC), and Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital (NLSVH). The secondary objective is to assess the safety of the adapted nurse-driven DKA protocol adapted at NLEMMC and NLSVH through determining the incidence of hypoglycemia and anion gap reopening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, IRB-approved, multi-center study that included: patients 18 years or older who were treated with the DKA protocol at NLEMMC or NLSVH, and admitted to the emergency department between July 2015 and October 2020 with a primary diagnosis of DKA and an elevated anion gap greater than or equal to 13 mEq/L. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients from NLEMMC and 64 patients from NLSVH were included and compared to 111 patients from the University of Colorado who were included in the post protocol implementation group. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome, time to anion gap closure, between the original University of Colorado study (10.3 hours) and the NLEMMC (10.9 hours, p = 0.420) and NLSVH (8.8 hours, p = 0.115) results presented in this study. CONCLUSION: The standardized nurse-driven DKA treatment protocol at NLEMMC and NLSVH showed no statistical difference in time to anion gap closure compared to the University of Colorado study upon which it was based.

Concerns regarding risks of infection to healthcare providers have led many experts to recommend the use of video laryngoscopy for intubation of patients with COVID-19. This recommendation is based on the belief that using video laryngoscopy allows more physical distance between the operator and the patient, potentially decreasing the risk to providers. Information on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on intubation practices is currently limited. Methods: We conducted a survey of intubation practices in 21 emergency departments and intensive care units participating in either of two randomized trials (clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: NCT03928925 and NCT03787732) within the Pragmatic Critical Care Research Group. At each site, the site investigator estimated the prevalence of various airway practices among 3 groups of patients: 1) patients intubated prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) patients intubated with known or suspected COVID-19, and 3) patients intubated during the pandemic without known or suspected COVID-19. The site investigator provided information on use of personal protective equipment, preintubation fluid bolus administration, preoxygenation, sedative choice, paralytic choice, approach to oxygenation from induction to intubation, approach to laryngoscopy, bougie use, primary operator, and ancillary staff present. The primary outcome was the proportion of intubations at a study site that was estimated to be performed using video laryngoscopy. Results: We received responses from 19 of 21 sites (90%). Investigators reported that video laryngoscopy was used in a median of 65% of intubations [IQR: 50-76%] at their site prior to the pandemic compared with a median of 100% of intubations [IQR: 76-100%] for patients with known or suspected COVID-19 (p= 0.0002). Prior to the pandemic only 2 sites (10.5%) reported using exclusively video laryngoscopy, compared to 10 sites (52.6%) that reported using exclusively video laryngoscopy for COVID-19 patients. For patients without known or suspected COVID-19, use of video versus direct laryngoscopy did not differ significantly between patients intubated before the pandemic and patients intubated during the pandemic. Conclusions: Among patients intubated at 19 emergency departments and intensive care units participating in two ongoing clinical trials, we found that the perceived use of video laryngoscopy was greater for patients with known or suspected COVID-19 compared to patients intubated prior to the pandemic, whereas perceived use of video laryngoscopy for patients without COVID-19 during the pandemic was similar to use prior to the pandemic.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the use of video laryngoscopy during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a zoonotic viral infection that originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

To deal with this unprecedented situation, various national and international guidelines have been put forward outlining the precautions to be taken during sample processing from a potentially infectious patient. Purpose Most of these guidelines are centered around laboratories that are a part of designated COVID 19 hospitals. However, proper protocols need to be in place in all laboratories, irrespective of whether they are a part of COVID 19 hospital or not as this would greatly reduce the risk of exposure of laboratory/hospital personnel. As part of a laboratory associated with a rural cancer hospital which is not a dedicated COVID 19 hospital, we aim to present our institute's experience in handling pathology specimens during the COVID 19 era.

Aerosolized epoprostenol (aEPO) has been evaluated in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and refractory hypoxemia. A paucity of literature has assessed the impact of aEPO in patients with SARS-CoV-2 receiving oxygen support with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). The objective of this study was to evaluate whether aEPO added to HFNC prevents intubation and/or prolong time to intubation compared to controls only treated with HFNC, guided by oxygen saturation goals. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients infected with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and admitted to the medical intensive care unit. A total of 60 patients were included. Thirty patients were included in the treatment, and 30 in the control group, respectively. Among patients included in the treatment group, response to therapy was assessed. The need for mechanical ventilation and hospital mortality between responders vs. non-responders was evaluated. RESULTS: The primary outcome of mechanical ventilation was not statistically different between groups. Time from HFNC initiation to intubation was significantly prolonged in the treatment group compared to the control group (5.7 days vs. 2.3 days, P = 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in mortality or length of stay. Patients deemed responders to aEPO had a lower rate of mechanical ventilation (50% vs 88%, P = 0.025) and mortality (21% vs 63%, P = 0.024), compared with non-responders.

Prostate cancer is a common malignancy, and accurate diagnosis typically requires histologic review of multiple prostate core biopsies per patient. As pathology volumes and complexity increase, new tools to improve the efficiency of everyday practice are keenly needed. Deep learning has shown promise in pathology diagnostics, but most studies silo the efforts of pathologists from the application of deep learning algorithms. Very few hybrid pathologist-deep learning approaches have been explored, and these typically require complete review of histologic slides by both the pathologist and the deep learning system. OBJECTIVE. To develop a novel and efficient hybrid human-machine learning approach to screen prostate biopsies. DESIGN. We developed an algorithm to determine the 20 regions of interest with the highest probability of malignancy for each prostate biopsy; presenting these regions to a pathologist for manual screening limited the initial review by a pathologist to approximately 2% of the tissue area of each sample. We evaluated this approach by using 100 biopsies (29 malignant, 60 benign, 11 other) that were reviewed by 4 pathologists (3 urologic pathologists, 1 general pathologist) using a custom-designed graphical user interface. RESULTS. Malignant biopsies were correctly identified as needing comprehensive review with high sensitivity (mean, 99.2% among all pathologists); conversely, most benign prostate biopsies (mean, 72.1%) were correctly identified as needing no further review. CONCLUSIONS. This novel hybrid system has the potential to efficiently triage out most benign prostate core biopsies, conserving time for the pathologist to dedicate to detailed evaluation of malignant biopsies.","output":"A Hybrid Human-Machine Learning Approach for Screening Prostate Biopsies Can Improve Clinical Efficiency Without Compromising Diagnostic Accuracy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events in the acute setting.

The response to COVID-19 in the United States has been hampered by an overall lack of diagnostic testing capacity. To address uncertainty about ongoing levels of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission early in the pandemic, we aimed to develop a surveillance tool using readily available emergency department (ED) operations data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). This involved optimizing the identification of acute respiratory infection (ARI)-related encounters and then comparing metrics for these encounters before and after the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. METHODS: We performed an observational study using operational EHR data from two Midwest EDs with a combined annual census of over 80,000. Data were collected three weeks before and after the first confirmed case of local SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. To optimize capture of ARI cases, we compared various metrics including chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and ARI-related orders. Operational metrics for ARI cases, including volume, pathogen identification, and illness severity, were compared between the preand post-community transmission timeframes using chi-square tests of independence. RESULTS: Compared to our combined definition of ARI, chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and isolation orders individually identified less than half of the cases. Respiratory pathogen testing was the top performing individual ARI definition but still only identified 72.2% of cases. From the pre to post periods, we observed significant increases in ED volumes due to ARI and ARI cases without identified pathogen. CONCLUSION: Certain methods for identifying ARI cases in the ED may be inadequate and multiple criteria should be used to optimize capture. In the absence of widely available SARS-CoV-2 testing, operational metrics for ARI-related encounters, especially the proportion of cases involving negative pathogen testing, are useful indicators for active surveillance of potential COVID-19 related ED visits.","output":"Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance for Community Transmitted COVID-19 in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin and was transmitted to humans via an undetermined intermediate host, leading to infections in humans and other mammals.

Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species, relative to human ACE2, and correlated these changes with COVID-19 infection data. We also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity. We predict that mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2.

This study investigates the relationship between general and specific stressors and various dimensions of sleep health. METHODS: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants were asked whether they experienced increased general, financial, food, housing, family and relationship stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They were also asked whether they experienced a more regular schedule, improved sleep, worsened sleep, more early insomnia, more middle-of-the-night insomnia, more daytime sleepiness, and more naps due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ordinal logistic regressions with sleep change as outcome and stress variable as predictor were adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: COVID-19-related general, financial, food, housing, family, and relationship stress were all associated with a decreased likelihood of maintaining a more regular schedule (oOR=0.52-0.67, all p<0.001) and improved sleep (oOR=0.56-0.67, all p<0.001). They were also all associated with a greater likelihood of worsened sleep (oOR=1.48-2.41, all p<0.001), early insomnia (oOR=1.63-1.85, all p<0.001), middle-of-the-night insomnia (oOR=1.40-2.00, all p<0.001), and daytime sleepiness (oOR=1.58-2.07, all p<0.001). Increased napping was also associated with more COVID-related financial, food, and housing stress (oOR=1.33-1.55, all p<0.005). CONCLUSION: Regular sleep schedules can be disrupted by stressors directly, or by the anxiety that so often accompanies stress. Stressed individuals may experience increased difficulty falling asleep, or more nighttime arousals, or find themselves waking up earlier than usual, all as a result of ruminating thoughts, stress-induced nightmares, or outside disturbances. Disruption to sleep at night often results in increased daytime sleepiness and fatigue, with a higher chance of napping.

We analyzed CSPG4 mRNA expression data of 309 clinical GIST samples profiled using DNA microarrays and searched for correlations with clinicopathological and immune features. CSPG4 expression, higher in tumors than normal digestive tissues, was heterogeneous across tumors. High expression was associated with AFIP low-risk, gastric site, and localized stage, and independently with longer postoperative disease-free survival (DFS) in localized stage. The correlations between CSPG4 expression and immune signatures highlighted a higher anti-tumor immune response in \\"CSPG4-high\\" tumors, relying on both the adaptive and innate immune system, in which the boost of NK cells by CSPG4-CAR.CIKs might be instrumental, eventually combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

We identified 27 cases of healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections (4 inpatients and 23 HCWs) who had contact with patients and/or HCWs without the use of adequate PPE. The contacts of these index cases were followed up for SARS-CoV-2 infection after unprotected exposure and a quantitative measure of probability of becoming infected, the attack rate, was calculated. In addition, transmission was evaluated in the context of infection control measures established during the pandemic and we compared the epidemiological data of all index cases, including symptoms and C(t) values of virology test results. The overall attack rate in the hospital setting was 1.3% (inpatients 0.9%, HCWs 1.6%). However, during an outbreak, the attack rate was 25.5% (inpatients 20.0%, HCWs 29.6%).

Eligible patients had untreated, unresectable, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic GC or GEJC. Patients without progressive disease after 12 weeks of first-line chemotherapy with oxaliplatin plus a fluoropyrimidine were randomly assigned 1:1 to avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or continued chemotherapy, stratified by region (Asia v non-Asia). The primary end point was overall survival (OS) after induction chemotherapy in all randomly assigned patients or the PD-L1-positive randomly assigned population ( 1% of tumor cells; 73-10 assay). RESULTS A total of 805 patients received induction; 499 were randomly assigned to avelumab (n = 249) or continued chemotherapy (n = 250). Median OS was 10.4 months (95% CI, 9.1 to 12.0 months) versus 10.9 months (95% CI, 9.6 to 12.4 months) and 24-month OS rate was 22.1% versus 15.5% with avelumab versus chemotherapy, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.11; P = .1779). In the PD-L1-positive population (n = 54), the HR for OS was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.57 to 2.23; P = .6352). In an exploratory analysis of the PD-L1-positive population, defined as combined positive score  1 (22C3 assay; n = 137), median OS was 14.9 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 17.3 months) with avelumab versus 11.6 months (95% CI, 8.4 to 12.6 months) with chemotherapy (unstratified HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.05).

CASE PRESENTATION: 25-year old woman diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency in 2013, developed severe COVID-19 that rapidly progressed to pneumonia presenting with multiple bilateral lung opacities that were both central and peripheral and presented as ground-glass and consolidation types involving all lobes, bilaterally. As blood oxygen saturation decayed and lung abnormalities were not responsive to large spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids, patient was placed on mechanical ventilation and compassionate-use of approved COVID-19 convalescent donor plasma was introduced. The patient presented a rapid response to the approach and mechanical ventilation could be interrupted 24 h after first dose of COVID-19 convalescent donor plasma. As a whole, the patient received four doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma during a period of 6 days. There was rapid improvement of clinical status, with interruption of supplemental oxygen therapy after 6 days and reduction of lung abnormalities as evidence by sequential computed tomography scans.

To exert their function, B cells and T cells differentiate into effector and memory cells. Tight regulation of these differentiation processes is key to prevent their malfunction, which can result in life-threatening disease. Lymphocyte differentiation relies on the appropriate timing and dosage of regulatory molecules, and post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTR) is a key player herein. PTR includes the regulation through RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which control the fate of RNA and its translation into proteins. To date, a comprehensive overview of the RBP expression throughout lymphocyte differentiation is lacking. Using transcriptome and proteome analyses, we here catalogued the RBP expression for human B cells and T cells. We observed that even though the overall RBP expression is conserved, the relative RBP expression is distinct between B cells and T cells. Differentiation into effector and memory cells alters the RBP expression, resulting into preferential expression of different classes of RBPs. For instance, whereas naive T cells express high levels of translation-regulating RBPs, effector T cells preferentially express RBPs that modulate mRNA stability. Lastly, we found that cytotoxic CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells express a common RBP repertoire. Combined, our study reveals a cell type-specific and differentiation-dependent RBP expression landscape in human lymphocytes, which will help unravel the role of RBPs in lymphocyte function.","output":"RNA-Binding Protein Expression Alters Upon Differentiation of Human B Cells and T Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the number of passengers on international ro-pax ferries collapsed due to the pandemic caused by the Covid-19 virus and subsequent travel restrictions. At the same time, both the International Maritime Organisation and the European Union are setting stringent regulations on carbon dioxide emissions from ships. In this research, we look at what options companies offering ro-pax services have to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic under-tightening environmental regulations and the future options for the industry. The case under study is ro-pax ferry traffic between Helsinki and Tallinn. It is one of the busiest international passenger ferry connections in the world. The economics of transport are based on large high-speed vessels, the combination of passengers and cargo, and sales onboard. We created four scenarios for the traffic: to continue the same high-speed ro-pax system as in 2019, to reduce the number of vessels, to switch to new types of ships, to slow down the speed of the vessels or to divide traffic into faster and slower ships. The research contributes to discussion of competitive strengths of ro-pax transport.","output":"Recovery of ro-pax ferry traffic from covid-19 under tightening environmental regulations: case Helsinki-Tallinn"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Cancer Institutes Small Business Innovation Research Development Center (NCI SBIR) provides federal research and development funding and commercialization resources to more than 400 small businesses each year developing novel technologies to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer.

In the spinotrapezius muscle (which is not recruited during incline treadmill running) of aged rats, we tested the hypotheses that exercise training will 1) improve the matching of O(2) delivery to O(2) uptake, evidenced through improved microvascular Po(2) (Pm(O(2))), at rest and throughout the contractions transient; and 2) enhance endothelium-dependent vasodilation in first-order arterioles. Young (Y, 6 mo) and aged (O, >24 mo) Fischer 344 rats were assigned to control sedentary (YSED; n = 16, and OSED; n = 15) or exercise-trained (YET; n = 14, and OET; n = 13) groups. Spinotrapezius blood flow (via radiolabeled microspheres) was measured at rest and during exercise. Phosphorescence quenching was used to quantify Pm(O(2)) in vivo at rest and across the rest-to-twitch contraction (1 Hz, 5 min) transition in the spinotrapezius muscle. In a follow-up study, vasomotor responses to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside) stimuli were investigated in vitro. Blood flow to the spinotrapezius did not increase above resting values during exercise in either young or aged groups. Exercise training increased the precontraction baseline Pm(O(2)) (OET 37.5  3.9 vs. OSED 24.7  3.6 Torr, P < 0.05); the end-contracting Pm(O(2)) and the time-delay before Pm(O(2)) fell in the aged group but did not affect these values in the young. Exercise training improved maximal vasodilation in aged rats to acetylcholine (OET 62  16 vs. OSED 27  16%) and to sodium nitroprusside in both young and aged rats. Endurance training of aged rats enhances the Pm(O(2)) in a nonrecruited skeletal muscle and is associated with improved vascular smooth muscle function.

The study aims to measure the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) volume in Scotland. Secondary objectives are to measure the success of restarting elective services and model the time required to bridge the gap left by the first period of suspension. METHODS: A retrospective observational study using the Scottish Arthroplasty Project dataset. All patients undergoing elective THAs and TKAs during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020 were included. A negative binomial regression model using historical case-volume and mid-year population estimates was built to project the future case-volume of THA and TKA in Scotland. The median monthly case volume was calculated for the period 2008 to 2019 (baseline) and compared to the actual monthly case volume for 2020. The time taken to eliminate the deficit was calculated based upon the projected monthly workload and with a potential workload between 100% to 120% of baseline. RESULTS: Compared to the period 2008 to 2019, primary TKA and THA volume fell by 61.1% and 53.6%, respectively. Since restarting elective services, Scottish hospitals have achieved approximately 40% to 50% of baseline monthly activity. With no changes in current workload, by 2021 there would be a reduction of 9,180 and 10,170 for THA and TKA, respectively. Conversely, working at 120% baseline monthly output, it would take over four years to eliminate the deficit for both TKA and THA. CONCLUSION: This national study demonstrates the significant impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had on overall THA and TKA volume. In the six months after resuming elective services, Scottish hospitals averaged less than 50% normal monthly output. Loss of operating capacity will increase treatment delays and likely worsen overall morbidity.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and various speculations about the origin of this virus have attracted more attention on bio-risk concerns of synthetic biology because of its potential power and uncertainty in the synthesis and engineering of living organisms. Therefore, it is crucial to scrutinize the control measures put in place to ensure appropriate use, promote the development of synthetic biology, and strengthen the governance of pathogen-related research, although the true origin of coronavirus remains hotly debated and unresolved.

Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological effects of COVID-19 public health measures, because they represent a demographic that is most affected by disasters and because pregnancy itself entails significant life changes that require major psychosocial and emotional adjustments. The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study was designed to investigate the associations between exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals, and developmental outcomes in their offspring. OBJECTIVE: The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study was designed to investigate the associations between exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals and developmental outcomes in their offspring. Findings of the study are intended to generate knowledge about the psychological consequences of pandemics on pregnant individuals and their offspring and point toward prevention and intervention targets. METHODS: The PdP study comprises a prospective longitudinal cohort of pregnant individuals (at enrollment) with repeated follow-ups during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Participants were eligible if they were: pregnant, &#8805;17 years, &#8804;35 weeks gestation at study enrollment, living in Canada, and able to read and write in English or French. At enrollment, participants completed an initial survey that assessed demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, previous pregnancies and births, pre-pregnancy health, health conditions during pregnancy, medications, psychological distress, social support, and hardships experienced because of COVID-19 (e.g., lost employment, loved one dying). For the first three months following the initial survey, participants received a monthly email link to complete a follow-up survey that asked about experiences since the previous survey. After three months, follow-up surveys were sent every other month to reduce participant burden. For each of these surveys, participants were first asked if they were still pregnant and then routed either to the next prenatal survey or to the delivery survey. In the postpartum, surveys were sent at 3-, 6-, and 12-months of infant age to assess maternal stress, psychological distress and infant development. RESULTS: Participant recruitment via social media (Facebook, Instagram) began on April 5, 2020 and is ongoing. As of October 2019, more than 8200 individuals completed the initial survey.

METHODS: This update was performed using the methodology reported by the second edition conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER Action. We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro databases. Papers related to COVID-19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarised descriptively. RESULTS: The search retrieved 4441 studies. After the removal of duplicates and the screening for title and abstract, we retained 105 studies. Of these, we included 54 in the qualitative synthesis of this update. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence Table, most studies (64.8%) fall within the category of Level 4 evidence. Up to 40.7% of papers included COVID-19 patients in the post-acute phase. In 2020, our rapid living systematic review included 230 studies; most of these (73.9%) were Level 4 studies, 25.7% were Level 3, and only one study was Level 2.

In this study, the incidence rate of severe RVGE was significantly lower in the plateau era than in the pre-vaccine introduction and transitional eras. Furthermore, the hospitalization rate due to RVGE in Shibata City was lower in the plateau era than in the pre-vaccination introduction and transitional eras. The number of hospitalizations due to RVGE in subjects who required or did not require intravenous rehydration at the pediatric clinics significantly decreased with the increase in vaccine coverage rates by more than 70% in the plateau era.","output":"Occurrence of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in children younger than three years of age before and after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine: a prospective observational study in four pediatric clinics in Shibata City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic altered the way many consumers and businesses transacted business. Concerning the green industry, many households began gardening and/or purchased more green industry products. As the pandemic ends and households begin to return to normal, green industry firms need to understand this new normal. Using an online national survey of households, we assessed which households were more likely to remain in the market after entering during the height of the pandemic (2020). Findings indicated that younger consumers (i.e., Millennials and younger individuals who were born in 1985 or after) were less likely to indicate they always garden (before the pandemic) but more likely to have started gardening during the pandemic and perceived that they would not continue to garden as states returned to normal (2021). This age group was also more likely to not have gardened in 2020, but they intended to garden in 2021. This finding shows a dichotomy in gardening preferences in this young age group. Further findings indicated that race, household income, number of children in the household, and the impact of the pandemic on the household also help explain the household's decision to garden or not.","output":"p Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Gardening in the United States: Postpandemic Expectations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Therapy of patients with relapsed and refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r cHL) after PD-1 inhibitors failure remains an unresolved issue.

Relying on the hydrocarbon sector generates a significant trade-off between economic development and the environment. The GCC governments have an essential role in this process and can affect the outcomes. The policies that have been implemented in the GCC countries to protect the environment and empower sustainable consumption and production were explored and identified. Moreover, the success of these policies in achieving their goals was assessed. The analytical approach and utilizing the previous studies findings were used by the current study. This study finds that the institutional actions of the Gulf countries are not enough to generate sustainable consumption and production. These countries remain strongly affected by the hydrocarbon sector, and the diversification achievements are weak. Further, the energy price reforms have many problems as a tool to enhance sustainable consumption and production. Additionally, these countries work under the concept of entrepreneurial state capitalist. The government controls all the sectors, including the private sector, to secure the regime. The policy implication of the current paper is that the GCC countries should recover the process of diversifying the economy, enhancing the movements toward the free market economy, and adopting an efficient energy-environmental policy by enhancing more concrete actions toward new technologies.

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: 3 secondary-level hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Invasively ventilated patients (n=28), hospitalized with severe COVID-19 who were referred to the Speech and Language Pathology (SLP) departments post mechanical ventilation between March 5 and July 5 2020 for an evaluation of swallowing function before commencing oral diet. INTERVENTIONS: SLP assessment, advice and therapy for dysphagia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Oral intake levels at baseline and hospital discharge according to the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). Patients were stratified according to FOIS (1-5=dysphagia, 6-7= functional oral intake). Data regarding comorbidities, frailty, intubation and tracheostomy, proning and SLP evaluation were collected. RESULTS: Dysphagia was found in 71% of the patients at baseline (in total 79% male, age 61 12 years, BMI 30 8 kg/m(2)). Median FOIS score at baseline was 2 (IQR 1) vs 5 (IQR 2.5) at hospital discharge. Patients with dysphagia were older (64 8.5 vs 53 16 years; p= 0.019), had a higher incidence of hypertension (70% vs 12%; p=0.006) were ventilated invasively longer (16 7 vs 10 2 days; p=0.017) or with tracheostomy (9 9 vs 1 2 days; p=0.03) longer. A negative association was found between swallowing dysfunction at bedside and days hospitalized (r=-0.471, p=0.01), and number of days at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (r=-0.48, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Dysphagia is prevalent in COVID-19 patients post invasive mechanical ventilation and is associated with number of days in hospital and number of days in the ICU.

Even though for effective protection effective alcohol-based hand sanitizers are mandatory. Their efficacy was not evaluated. This is the reason why this research was designed to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of hand sanitizers that have been sold in southern parts of Ethiopia. METHODS: Six test organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella boydii) were selected from different clinical specimens. Then seven locally made products of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (MTU, Folium Fine, Epharm, Harego, Taflen and Sheba) were purchased and the disc diffusion, minimum inhibition concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration test were done against selected test organisms. Quality control measures throughout the whole process of the laboratory work were implemented and descriptive parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: The zones of inhibition of the hand sanitizers at their claim concentration were ranged from noninhibition zone (Folium) to 27mm (Sheba). The minimum inhibitory concentration against all selected test organisms was observed at 45%, 55%, 65% and Taflen on undiluted form. The growth of test organisms was decreased across increasing the concentration gradient of different hand sanitizers. MTU except against E. coli, Fine, Hargo, Ephra and Sheba hand sanitizers were showed growth below 60% concentrations for all test micro-organisms. But a Folium product against all selected test micro-organisms and MTU product against E. coli were not bactericidal. CONCLUSION: Fine, Hargo, Ephra, Sheba and Taflen sanitizers were the products that were effective in inhibiting the growth of all the selected test organisms, and they were having effective bactericidal activity in vitro at their claim concentration. But MTU product against E. coli and Folium product against all test microorganisms were not having an effective bactericidal activity. So, regulatory authorities and manufacturers should implement strict quality control measures and regular observations throughout the production to ensure the efficacy of hand sanitizers.","output":"Evaluation of the Efficacy of Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers Sold in Southwest Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Generally, children and teenagers do not become seriously ill with COVID-19.

In particular, we run a survey experiment in the US by exposing subjects to two media-based popular explanations on the causes of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We find evidence that subjects beliefs on the origins of the disease are influenced by the narrative they are presented with. Moreover, the Lab narrative leads subjects living in Republican leaning states to express less favorable opinions about trade openness and the relevance of climate change relative to those living in Democratic leaning states. Thus, our findings provide support for the idea that recalling stories that are part of larger narratives can lead to divergence of opinions on crucial issues leading to an increase in policy polarization.

Hypoglycemia in malignancy has several etiologies; an extremely rare mechanism is the Warburg effect causing excess lactate production and avid glucose consumption. We describe the clinical course of a 52-year-old man admitted for chest wall mass and severe but asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Laboratory workup was obtained for insulin vs noninsulin-mediated hypoglycemia, and biopsy of the chest wall mass and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) scan were performed. D10 infusion and intravenous/oral steroids started for severe hypoglycemia. Chemotherapy was initiated after biopsy, and blood glucose (BG) and lactate levels followed with clinical response in tumor size and changes in PET/CT. Investigations were significant for venous BG in the 40s (Ademolus Classification of Hypoglycemia grade 2 hypoglycemia), plasma insulin of less than 2 U/mL (2-20 U/mL), C-peptide of 0.2 ng/mL (0.8-6.0 ng/mL), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) of 113 ng/mL (333-967 ng/mL), serum lactate of 16 mmol/L (0.5-2 mmol/L), and albumin of 2.3 g/dL (3.4-5.4 g/dL). Biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and PET revealed highly FDG-avid disease in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, but no FDG uptake was seen in the brain. Hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis improved remarkably after chemotherapy. PET/CT at 4 weeks showed complete metabolic response with reappearance of physiological FDG uptake in the brain. Noninsulin-mediated hypoglycemia was likely due to the combination of profound malnutrition and rapid glucose use by cancer cells. The patient presented with exaggerated Warburg effect (hyper-Warburgism), evident by extreme glucose consumption, severe lactic acidosis, and large tumor burden on PET/CT.

HO-1 induction was recently shown to result in anti-HCV activity by inducing type I interferon and inhibiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease activity. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the anti-HCV activity of celastrol and characterize its mechanism of inhibition. METHODS: The anti-HCV activity of celastrol was evaluated using the HCV subgenomic replicon and HCVcc infection systems. The anti-HCV mechanism of celastrol targeting HO-1 expression was clarified using specific inhibitors against several signaling pathways. The transcriptional regulation of celastrol on target gene expression was determined using promoter-based reporter activity assay. The synergistic effect of celastrol and a numbers of clinically used anti-HCV drugs was determined via a drug combination assay. RESULTS: Celastrol inhibited HCV replication in both the HCV subgenomic and HCVcc infection systems with EC50 values of 0.37  0.022 and 0.43  0.019 M, respectively. Celastrol-induced heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression promoted antiviral interferon responses and inhibition of NS3/4A protease activity, thereby blocking HCV replication. These antiviral effects were abrogated by treatment with the HO-1-specific inhibitor SnMP or silencing of HO-1 expression by transfection of shRNA, which indicates that HO-1 induction contributes to the anti-HCV activity of celastrol. JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were confirmed to be involved in the inductive effect of celastrol on HO-1 expression. Celastrol exhibited synergistic effects in combination with interferon-alpha, the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir, and the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir. CONCLUSION: Celastrol can serve as a potential supplement for blocking HCV replication. Targeting the JNK/Nrf2/HO-1 axis presents a promising strategy against HCV infection.","output":"Celastrol inhibits hepatitis C virus replication by upregulating heme oxygenase-1 via the JNK MAPK/Nrf2 pathway in human hepatoma cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research has shown that sending personalized messages consistent with the recipient's psychological profile is essential to activate the change toward a healthy lifestyle. In this paper we present an example of how artificial intelligence can support psychology in this process, illustrating the development of a probabilistic predictor in the form of a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). The predictor regards the change in the intention to do home-based physical activity after message exposure. The data used to construct the predictor are those of a study on the effects of framing in communication to promote physical activity at home during the Covid-19 lockdown. The theoretical reference is that of psychosocial research on the effects of framing, according to which similar communicative contents formulated in different ways can be differently effective depending on the characteristics of the recipient. Study participants completed a first questionnaire aimed at measuring the psychosocial dimensions involved in doing physical activity at home. Next, they read recommendation messages formulated with one of four different frames (gain, non-loss, non-gain, and loss). Finally, they completed a second questionnaire measuring their perception of the messages and again the intention to exercise at home. The collected data were analyzed to elicit a DBN, i.e., a probabilistic structure representing the interrelationships between all the dimensions considered in the study. The adopted procedure was aimed to achieve a good balance between explainability and predictivity. The elicited DBN was found to be consistent with the psychosocial theories assumed as reference and able to predict the effectiveness of the different messages starting from the relevant psychosocial dimensions of the recipients. In the next steps of our project, the DBN will form the basis for the training of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system for the synthesis of automatic interaction strategies. In turn, the DRL system will train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that will guide the online interaction process.

Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2. To determine the expression and in situ localisation of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analysed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, proteomic datasets, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples. We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung, confirmed with proteomics. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 and GRP78 in the respiratory mucosa.

In this study, we aimed to explore the risk of maternal-fetal transmission before 24 weeks of gestation, through analysis of abortion materials collected from PCR-positive women with pregnancy loss. To the best of our knowledge, apart from case reports, this study is the first prospective work on the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy. METHODS: The patients who had attended our clinic with the diagnosis of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks of gestation were screened for COVID-19. Vertical transmission in PCR-positive women was assessed through the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fetal-placental tissues by rt-PCR test. RESULTS: 24 of 210 (%11,4) pregnant women participating in the study had positive rt-PCR results. Placenta and curettage material samples of these PCR-positive patients were analyzed and all valid test results (21 samples) were negative for SARS CoV-2 RNA. In three cases, the rt-PCR results were invalid due to failed internal controls. DISCUSSION: In the literature, the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. The findings of the present study did not reveal any evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy.","output":"Investigating the risk of maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Required mechanical ventilation (MV) may contribute to bacterial dissemination in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. Significant variations in plasma mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been reported in sepsis according to the outcome. The impact of lung stretch during MV was addressed in a model of pneumonia. Healthy or S. pneumoniae infected rabbits were submitted to MV or kept spontaneously breathing (SB). Bacterial burden, cytokines release, mitochondrial DNA levels, integrity and transcription were assessed along with 48-hour mortality. Compared with infected SB rabbits, MV rabbits developed more severe pneumonia with greater concentrations of bacteria in the lungs, higher rates of systemic dissemination, higher levels of circulating inflammatory mediators and decreased survival. Pulmonary mtDNA levels were significantly lower in infected animals as compared to non-infected ones, whenever they were SB or MV. After a significant early drop, circulating mtDNA levels returned to baseline values in the infected SB rabbits, but remained low until death in the MV ones. Whole blood ex-vivo stimulation with Streptococcus pneumoniae resulted in a reduction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes mitochondrial density and plasma mtDNA concentrations. Thus, persistent mitochondrial depletion and dysfunction in the infected animals submitted to MV could account for their less efficient immune response against S. pneumoniae.","output":"Mechanical ventilation and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia alter mitochondrial homeostasis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Holy Communion is the oldest Christian practice, through which a gathered group of people partake bread and wine with a shared spoon.

Ferritin, an acute phase reactant which can also protect the host cell from oxidative stress and has in previous studies increased the cell tolerability to infection and sepsis, could be a marker of response to corticosteroids. We sought to examine whether response to methylprednisolone differed according to admission ferritin levels in severe COVID-19. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia on high-flow oxygen (FiO2 50%) admitted to an academic center from March 1 to April 15, 2020, i.e., before incorporation of corticosteroids in the guidelines for severe COVID-19. We used inverse probability of treatment weights to balance patient characteristics according to methylprednisolone use and Cox proportional hazards models to examine for significant interaction of admission serum ferritin levels with methylprednisolone for outcomes. The outcomes of interest were mortality and the composite of death or mechanical ventilation. Results: Ferritin was available in 380 of 447 (85.0%) patients (age, 6017 years;34.2% female;13.4% Black;34.5% Hispanic;body mass index, 30.46.4 kg/m2;O2 saturation, 897%;respiratory rate, 248 breaths/min). Of these, 142/380 (37.4%) received methylprednisolone (median dose, 160mg/day). Ferritin did not differ between patients who received methylprednisolone vs. those who did not (median [25th-75th percentile], 992 g/L [509, 1610] vs. 893 g/L [474, 1467];P=0.32). Patients with elevated (&gt;1000 g/L) ferritin had higher procalcitonin, creatinine, and transaminase, but lower Creactive protein on admission. At 28 days, 80 patients (21.1%) had died and 102 (26.8%) were intubated. Ferritin was not associated with mortality or the composite endpoint. However, in weighted analyses, methylprednisolone use was associated with significantly lower mortality in patients with ferritin &gt;1000 g/L (HR 0.29;95%CI 0.12-0.67;P=0.004) and significantly higher mortality in patients with ferritin 1000 g/L (HR 2.88;95%CI 1.59-5.20;P&lt;0.001);P&lt;0.001 for interaction (Figure 1A). The composite endpoint rates were lower with methylprednisolone in patients with ferritin &gt;1000 g/L (HR 0.47;95%CI 0.30-0.74;P=0.001) but not in patients with ferritin 1000 g/L (HR 1.09;95%CI 0.72-1.63;P=0.69);P=0.006 for interaction (Figure 1B). Conclusions: In nonintubated patients with severe COVID-19, methylprednisolone use was associated with reduced mortality and intubation only in patients with elevated admission ferritin levels. In contrast, there was a strong signal for higher mortality with methylprednisolone in patients with low baseline ferritin.

The development of novel therapies specifically targeting EAT could revolutionize the prognosis in CVDs. ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of death worldwide. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is defined as a fat depot localized between the myocardial surface and the visceral layer of the pericardium and is a type of visceral fat. EAT is one of the most important risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events and a promising new therapeutic target in CVDs. In health conditions, EAT has a protective function, including protection against hypothermia or mechanical stress, providing myocardial energy supply from free fatty acid and release of adiponectin. In patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, or diabetes mellitus, EAT becomes a deleterious tissue promoting the development of CVDs. Previously, we showed an adverse modulation of gene expression in pericoronary adipose tissue in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Here, we summarize the currently available evidence regarding the role of EAT in the development of CVDs, including CAD, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Due to the rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also discuss data regarding the association between EAT and the course of COVID-19. Finally, we present the potential therapeutic possibilities aiming at modifying EATs function.

The optimal investigation of NVH is unclear, given the incidence of cancer and the public health implications of testing all individuals with this finding. OBJECTIVE We review contemporary literature to determine the association of NVH with the diagnosis of bladder cancer (BC), upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), and kidney cancer (KC). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A systematic review of original articles in English was completed in May 2019. Meta-analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of NVH and urine cytology were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS We screened 1529 articles and selected 78 manuscripts that fulfilled our inclusion criteria for narrative synthesis. Forty manuscripts were eligible for a meta-analysis (reporting 19 193 persons). The likelihood of a urological cancer in patients with NVH increased with age (<1% in those aged <40yr), male sex, and cigarette smoking. Less than 1% of patients are found to have a urological cancer after a negative NVH evaluation. Cancer detection rates in individuals evaluated for NVH ranged from 0% to 16% for BC in 37 studies, 0% to 3.5% for UTUC in 30 studies, and 0% to 9.7% for KC in 29 studies. Substantial statistical heterogeneity was present for the meta-analysis of detection rates. CONCLUSIONS We present an up-to-date review of the association of NVH with the diagnosis of BC, UTUC, and KC. Individuals with dipstick positive haematuria aged 40yr, who have had potential precipitating causes excluded, should undergo an evaluation. Re-evaluation of patients with unremarkable initial investigations should be performed in high-risk patients or if new symptoms occur.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We included all original articles investigating patients treated with radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer and reporting data on inguinal hernia incidence. PubMed and EMBASE were searched on 28 February 2018. A meta-analysis was conducted as a weighted and pooled estimate of the incidence of inguinal hernia. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for randomized clinical trials. RESULTS We included 54 studies with a total of 101,687 patients. The estimated incidence of inguinal hernia after open retropubic radical prostatectomy was 13.7% (95% CI = 12.0-15.4%), 7.5% (5.2-9.8%) after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, and 7.9% (5.0-10.9%) after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. In studies comparing incidence of inguinal hernia after open prostatectomy versus no treatment, the incidence was significantly higher in the radical prostatectomy group 11.7% (95% CI = 9.2-14.2%) vs. 3.3% (2.0-4.6%). Two out of three studies reported a significantly higher incidence after laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, when compared with a control group. Most studies exploring intraoperative inguinal hernia prevention techniques found a significantly lower inguinal hernia incidence in the experimental group. The inguinal hernias that developed after radical prostatectomy were primarily indirect 81.9% (95% CI = 75.3-88.4%). CONCLUSION We found a high incidence of inguinal hernia following radical prostatectomy, and hernias were primarily of the indirect type. The highest incidence of inguinal hernia was found after open radical prostatectomy, followed by laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. There was no significant difference between the laparoscopic and robot-assisted groups. The incidence of inguinal hernia was significantly higher after open radical prostatectomy compared with control groups, with some evidence to support the same for the laparoscopic and robot-assisted approaches.

In patients at-risk for developing HCC, screening is recommended with ultrasound imaging and alpha fetoprotein laboratory tests. In socioeconomically vulnerable patients, however, individual-level barriers (eg, insurance status) and contextual-level disparities (eg, health facilities) may not be readily available, thus limiting screening. Additional challenges faced by racial/ethnic minorities can further challenge the spectrum of HCC care and lead to inadequate screening, delayed diagnosis, and unequal access to treatment. Efforts to improve these multilevel factors that lead to screening and treatment disparities are critical to overcoming challenges.

A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is applied for three COVID-19 scenarios (moderate, aggressive and extreme) to study the effects of different stages of the pandemic in terms of percentage of infected population on the probability of infection to WWTP workers. A dose-response model for SARS-CoV-1 (as a surrogate pathogen) is assumed in the QMRA for SARS-CoV-2 using an exponential model with k = 4.1  102.

RESULTS: IL-8 response of HT29 cells was greater with Crohn's disease (689  298 [mean  SD] pg IL-8/mL at 4 hours, n = 7) and colon cancer isolates (532  415 pg/mL, n = 14) than with ulcerative colitis (236  58 pg/mL, n = 6) or control isolates (236  100 pg/mL, n = 6, P < 0.0001). Bacterial supernatants contained shed flagellin that triggered IL-8 release. For whole bacteria the IL-8 response to E. coli that agglutinate red blood cells (548  428 pg IL-8/mL, n = 16), a function that correlates with epithelial invasion, was greater than for nonhemagglutinators (281  253 pg/mL, n = 17; P < 0.0001). This was particularly marked among E. coli that, although flagellate, could not release IL-8 from TLR5-transfected HEK293 cells. IL-8 release was mediated by extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibited by mesalamine, but not hydrocortisone, at therapeutic concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosa-associated E. coli shed flagellin that elicits epithelial IL-8 release but this may only become relevant when the mucosal barrier is weakened to expose basolateral TLR5. Adherent and invasive IBD and colon cancer E. coli isolates also elicit a flagellin-independent IL-8 response that may be relevant when the mucosal barrier is intact. The IL-8 release is MAPK-dependent and inhibited by mesalamine.","output":"Characterization of epithelial IL-8 response to inflammatory bowel disease mucosal E. coli and its inhibition by mesalamine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak The highly contagious COVID-19 disease has spread to 216 countries in less than six months Though several vaccine candidates are being claimed, an effective vaccine is yet to come A novel reverse epitomics approach, 'overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches' method is utilized to identify the antigenic regions from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome These antigenic regions are named as 'Ag-Patch or Ag-Patches', for Antigenic Patch or Patches The identification of Ag-Patches is based on the clusters of overlapping epitopes rising from SARS-CoV-2 proteins Further, we have utilized the identified Ag-Patches to design Multi-Patch Vaccines (MPVs), proposing a novel method for the vaccine design The designed MPVs were analyzed for immunologically crucial parameters, physiochemical properties and cDNA constructs We identified 73 CTL (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte) and 49 HTL (Helper T-Lymphocyte) novel Ag-Patches from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 The identified Ag-Patches utilized to design MPVs cover 768 overlapping epitopes targeting 55 different HLA alleles leading to 99 98% of world human population coverage The MPVs and Toll-Like Receptor ectodomain complex shows stable complex formation tendency Further, the cDNA analysis favors high expression of the MPVs constructs in a human cell line We identified highly immunogenic novel Ag-Patches from the entire proteome of SARS CoV-2 by a novel reverse epitomics approach and utilized them to design MPVs We conclude that the novel MPVs could be a highly potential novel approach to combat SARS-CoV-2, with greater effectiveness, high specificity and large human population coverage worldwide","output":"Computationally validated SARS-CoV-2 CTL and HTL Multi-Patch vaccines, designed by reverse epitomics approach, show potential to cover large ethnically distributed human population worldwide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the indicators (the rates of diagnosis, need for treatment, treatment initiation, and treatment completion) of management of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in contacts and to identify the impact of active tuberculosis (TB) index case characteristics on the exposed population in congregated settings, such as schools, workplaces, and medical institutes.

Histopathologically confirmed tumor and adjacent normal tissue were acquired from patients. Molecular expression and tissue localization of autophagy-associated molecules (HMGB-1, RAGE, beclin, LC-3, and p62) were investigated. Serum HMGB-1 concentration was measured in UBC patients and healthy controls. ROC curves were plotted to evaluate diagnostic potential. Transcript, protein, and IHC expression of HMGB-1, RAGE, beclin, and LC-3 displayed upregulated expression, while p62 was downregulated in bladder tumor tissue. Serum HMGB-1 levels were elevated in UBC patients. Transcript and circulatory levels of HMGB-1 showed positive correlation and displayed a positive trend with disease severity. Upon comparison with clinicopathological parameters, HMGB-1 emerged as molecule of statistical significance to exhibit association. HMGB-1 exhibited optimum sensitivity and specificity in serum. The positive correlation between tissue and serum levels of HMGB-1 showcases serum as a representation of in situ scenario, suggesting its clinical applicability for non-invasive testing. Moreover, optimum sensitivity and specificity displayed by HMGB-1 along with significant association with clinicopathological parameters makes it a potential candidate to be used as diagnostic marker for early detection of UBC but requires further validation in larger cohort.

It is known that during past influenza pandemics developing countries have experienced considerably higher death rates compared with developed countries. Furthermore, many developing countries lack appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. Mathematical modelling studies to guide the development of such plans are largely focused on predicting pandemic influenza spread in developed nations. However, intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a Papua New Guinean (PNG) community was created and used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain. The results were compared with those obtained from a comparable Australian model. DESIGN: A modelling study. SETTING: The towns of Madang in PNG (population 35 000) and Albany (population 30 000) in Australia. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily and cumulative illness attack rates in both models following introduction of a novel influenza strain into a naive population, for an unmitigated scenario and two social distancing intervention scenarios. RESULTS: The unmitigated scenario indicated an approximately 50% higher attack rate in PNG compared with the Australian model. The two social distancing-based interventions strategies were 60C70% less effective in a PNG setting compared with an Australian setting. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that an influenza pandemic occurring in a low-income country such as PNG may have a greater impact than one occurring in a developed country, and that PNG-feasible interventions may be substantially less effective. The larger average household size in PNG, the larger proportion of the population under 18 and greater community-wide contact all contribute to this feature.","output":"Pandemic influenza in Papua New Guinea: a modelling study comparison with pandemic spread in a developed country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by severe cytokine storm syndrome following inflammation.

The generated tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate -ketoglutarate, in turn, serves as the cofactor for the epigenetic regulator TET2 to catalyze DNA hydroxymethylation. Notably, endothelial-specific deletion of Rspondin3 prevented the formation of anti-inflammatory interstitial macrophages in endotoxemic mice and induced unchecked severe inflammatory injury.

We undertook a single-centre cross-sectional study in order to understand the variations in vaccine-induced immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strain (B.1) and three major VOCs (B.1.1.7, B.1351 and P.1). We studied a cohort of outpatients with immunodeficiencies (IDPs) and health care workers (HCWs) based at the same critical care tertiary NHS Trust, following a single dose of either BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccines. Our serological data revealed either undetectable antibodies or low neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in IDPs, with only 5% and 3% showing detectable neutralisation of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively. Healthy HCWs without a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated a wide range of nAb titres post-vaccination. However, their responses are significantly lower than HCWs with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralisation of VOCs with the E484K mutation (B.1.351 and P.1) were consistently lower in HCWs in the absence of evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (p<0.001). Notably, in HCWs with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is a significant increase of neutralising titres post-vaccination to all four strains, compared to their pre-vaccination neutralisation titres. This underscores the importance of vaccination even in populations that have been previously exposed, and also provides support for the hypothesis that a second-dose of vaccination will similarly boost immunity to greater protective levels in individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, this serological nAb analysis after a single-dose of BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccination demonstrates a wide variety of responses, particularly against the VOCs, and suggests limited neutralisation-based protection in individuals with immunodeficiencies.","output":"Breadth of neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern is augmented by vaccination following prior infection: studies in UK healthcare workers and immunodeficient patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Flexor tendon injuries most commonly occur following a penetrating injury to the hand or wrist These are challenging injuries and the standard treatment is surgical repair under general or regional anaesthesia 'Wide-awake' surgery is an emerging technique in hand surgery where a conscious patient is operated on under local anaesthetic The vasoconstrictive effect of adrenaline (epinephrine) creates a 'bloodless' operating field and a tourniquet is not required The potential advantages include intra-operative testing of the repair;removal of the risks of general anaesthesia;reduced costs;no aerosol generation from intubation therefore reduced risk of COVID-19 spread to healthcare professionals The aim of this study will be to systematically evaluate the evidence to determine if wide-awake surgery is superior to general/regional anaesthetic in adults who undergo flexor tendon repair METHODS: We designed and registered a study protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative and non-comparative studies The primary outcome will be functional active range of motion Secondary outcomes will be complications, resource use (operative time) and patient-reported outcome measures A comprehensive literature search will be conducted (from 1946 to present) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library Grey literature will be identified through Open Grey, dissertation databases and clinical trials registers All studies on wide-awake surgery for flexor tendon repair will be included The comparator will be general or regional anaesthesia No limitations will be imposed on peer review status or language of publication Two investigators will independently screen all citations, full-text articles and abstract data Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion or referral to a third author when necessary The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using an appropriate tool If feasible, we will conduct a random effects meta-analysis DISCUSSION: This systematic review will summarise the best available evidence and definitively establish if function, complications, cost, or patient-reported outcomes are improved when flexor tendons are repaired using wide-awake technique It will determine if this novel approach is superior to general or regional anaesthesia This knowledge will help guide hand surgeons by continuing to improve outcomes from flexor tendon injuries SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020182196","output":"Wide-awake local anaesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) vs regional or general anaesthesia for flexor tendon repair in adults: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus responsible for the ongoing 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The highly contagious COVID-19 disease has spread to 216 countries in less than six months. Though several vaccine candidates are being claimed, an effective vaccine is yet to come. In present study we have designed and theoretically validated novel Multi-Patch Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Methodology A novel reverse epitomics approach, overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches method is utilized to identify multiple antigenic regions from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These antigenic regions are here termed as Ag-Patch or Ag-Patches, for Antigenic Patch or Patches. The identification of Ag-Patches is based on clusters of overlapping epitopes rising from a particular region of SARS-CoV-2 protein. Further, we have utilized the identified Ag-Patches to design Multi-Patch Vaccines (MPVs), proposing a novel methodology for vaccine design and development. The designed MPVs were analyzed for immunologically crucial parameters, physiochemical properties and cDNA constructs. Results We identified 73 CTL (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte), 49 HTL (Helper T-Lymphocyte) novel Ag-Patches from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. The identified Ag-Patches utilized to design MPVs cover 768 (518 CTL and 250 HTL) overlapping epitopes targeting different HLA alleles. Such large number of epitope coverage is not possible for multi-epitope vaccines. The large number of epitopes covered implies large number of HLA alleles targeted, and hence large ethnically distributed human population coverage. The MPVs:Toll-Like Receptor ectodomain complex shows stable nature with numerous hydrogen bond formation and acceptable root mean square deviation and fluctuation. Further, the cDNA analysis favors high expression of the MPVs constructs in human cell line. Conclusion Highly immunogenic novel Ag-Patches are identified from the entire proteome of SARS CoV-2 by a novel reverse epitomics approach.

Methods This open label, crossover, noninferiority trial compared the efficacy and safety of AM-301 to that of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC; Nasaleze Allergy Blocker), an established barrier method. Adults with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to Dactylis glomerata pollen, in the Fraunhofer Allergen Challenge Chamber, first without protection and then protected by HPMC or AM-301 (7 days apart). Efficacy was assessed from total nasal symptom score (TNSS), nasal secretion weight, and subjective rating. The primary endpoint was the difference, between AM-301 and HPMC, in least square mean change in TNSS over a 4-hour exposure to allergen. Results The study enrolled 36 persons, and 35 completed all study visits. The mean TNSS was 5.91 during unprotected exposure, 5.20 during protection with HPMC, and 4.82 during protection with AM-301. The difference in least square means between the two treatments was -0.39 (95% CI, -0.89 to 0.10), establishing the noninferiority of AM-301. No difference in mean weight of nasal secretions was observed between the treatments. Efficacy was rated as good or very good for AM-301 by 31% and for HPMC by 14% of subjects. 16 subjects reported adverse events with a relationship to AM-301 or HPMC; most adverse events were mild and none was serious.

We aimed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay, and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong before and after the pandemic, as well as in Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China. Methods: We did a multicohort study in a hospital and university in Hong Kong. We evaluated the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with RT-PCR data from patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 and the specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with archived serum samples collected before 2019. We compared the seropositivity of the general population of Hong Kong before and after the pandemic had begun, and determined the seropositivity of Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China, in March, 2020. Findings: Between Feb 26 and March 18, 2020, we assessed RT-PCR samples from 45 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 to establish the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. To establish the specificity of these assays, we retrieved archived serum. The sensitivity was 911% (41 of 45 [95% CI 788-975]) for the microneutralisation assay, 578% (26 of 45 [422-723]) for anti-nucleoprotein IgG, 667% (30 of 45 [511-800]) for anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and 733% (33 of 45 [581-854]) for enzyme immunoassay (either positive for anti-nucleoprotein or anti-RBD IgG). The specificity was 100% (152 of 152 [95% CI 976-1000]) for both the enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. Among the Hong Kong general population, 53 (27%) of 1938 were enzyme immunoassay positive, but of those who were positive, all 53 were microneutralisation negative, and no significant increase was seen in the seroprevalence between April 12, 2018, and Feb 13, 2020. Among asymptomatic Hubei returnees, 17 (4%) of 452 were seropositive with the enzyme immunoassay or the microneutralisation assay, with 15 (88%) of 17 seropositive with the microneutralisation assay, and two familial clusters were identified. Interpretation: Our serological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerging virus. The seropositivity rate in Hubei returnees indicates that RT-PCR-confirmed patients only represent a small proportion of the total number of cases. The low seroprevalence suggests that most of the Hong Kong and Hubei population remain susceptible to COVID-19. Future waves of the outbreak are inevitable without a vaccine or antiviral prophylaxis. The role of age-related cross reactive non-neutralising antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 warrants further investigation.

METHODS: A multidisciplinary group representing all ICUs in our health system was convened to develop a clinical pathway to address unnecessary variations in care and to articulate and standardize best practice for ventilation and analgosedation. The group: 1) reviewed relevant literature and guidelines;2) reviewed current internal and national data;3) mapped all clinical steps in care to identify clinical decisions for which consensus was lacking, due to absence of evidence or variable application of the evidence, and/or process gaps;4) developed consensus statements to guide clinical decisions for areas without consensus;5) harnessed evidence, consensus, and clinical decision support into clinical pathways seamlessly integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR). We compared benzodiazepine use and lung-protective ventilation before and after pathway launch. RESULTS: Since implementation of the initial pathways in February 2021, pathways have been accessed over 600 times. Pathways have been utilized in all seven of our hospitals, nineteen ICUs, non-traditional ICU space like procedural areas, emergency departments, and general medical/surgical floors.

This review outlines the worldwide epidemiology of neurologic manifestations of different SARS-CoV-2 clinical pediatric phenotypes, including acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). We discuss strategies to develop adaptive global research platforms for future investigation into emerging pediatric neurologic conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Multicenter, multinational studies show that neurological manifestations of acute COVID-19, such as smell/taste disorders, headache, and stroke, are common in hospitalized adults (82%) and children (22%), associated with increased mortality in adults. Neurological manifestations of MIS-C are reported in up to 20% of children, including headache, irritability, and encephalopathy. Data on PASC are emerging and include fatigue, cognitive changes, and headache. Reports of neurological manifestations in each phenotype are limited by lack of pediatric-informed case definitions, common data elements, and resources. SUMMARY: Coordinated, well resourced, multinational investigation into SARS-CoV-2-related neurological manifestations in children is critical to rapid identification of global and region-specific risk factors, and developing treatment and mitigation strategies for the current pandemic and future health neurologic emergencies.","output":"Worldwide epidemiology of neuro-coronavirus disease in children: lessons for the next pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China's Supreme Peoples Court and other Chinese courts have commonalities and & differences with courts and supreme courts elsewhere in the world.

It is widely used in clinical practice as an outcome measure. This paper demonstrates the measurement characteristics of GripAble, a wireless mobile handgrip device that measures grip force both isometrically and elastically-resisted for assessment and training of hand function. METHODS: A series of bench tests were performed to evaluate GripAble's grip force measurement accuracy and sensitivity. Measurement robustness was evaluated through repeated drop tests interwoven with error verification test phases. RESULTS: GripAble's absolute measurement error at the central position was under 0.81 and 1.67 kg (95(th) percentiles; N = 47) when measuring elastically and isometrically, respectively, providing similar or better accuracy than the industry-standard Jamar device. Sensitivity was measured as 0.062  0.015 kg (mean  std; 95(th) percentiles: [0.036, 0.089] kg; N = 47), independent of the applied force. There was no significant performance degradation following impact from 30 drops from a height >1.5 m. CONCLUSION: GripAble is an accurate and reliable grip strength dynamometer.

This study sought to investigate whether blood glucose (BG) levels or comorbid diabetes are associated with inflammatory status and disease severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes were compared. The relationship among severity of COVID-19, inflammatory status, and diabetes or hyperglycemia was analyzed. The severity of COVID-19 in all patients was determined according to the diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the Chinese National Health Committee (7th edition). RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-one patients were enrolled in our study, and 71.58% of patients with diabetes and 13.03% of patients without diabetes had hyperglycemia. Compared with patients without diabetes (n = 366), patients with diabetes (n = 95) had a higher leucocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). There was no association between severity of COVID-19 and known diabetes adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), known hypertension, and coronary heart disease. The leucocyte count, NLR, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level increased with increasing BG level. Hyperglycemia was an independent predictor of critical (OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.72-9.30) or severe (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.47-8.58) COVID-19, and of increased inflammatory levels (high leucocyte count (OR 4.26, 95% CI 1.65-10.97), NLR (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.24-6.10), and CRP level (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.19-5.23)), after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, severity of illness, and known diabetes. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia was positively correlated with higher inflammation levels and more severe illness, and it is a risk factor for the increased severity of COVID-19.

Novel drug development does not always account for orphan diseases, which have low demand and hence low-profit margins for drug developers. Recently, drug repositioning has gained recognition as an alternative approach that explores new avenues for pre-existing commercially approved or rejected drugs to treat diseases aside from the intended ones. Drug repositioning results in lower overall developmental expenses and risk assessments, as the efficacy and safety of the original drug have already been well accessed and approved by regulatory authorities. The greatest advantage of drug repositioning is that it breathes new life into the novel, rare, orphan, and resistant diseases, such as Cushing's syndrome, HIV infection, and pandemic outbreaks such as COVID-19. Repositioning existing drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Ivermectin and Baricitinib shows good potential for COVID-19 treatment. This can crucially aid in resolving outbreaks in urgent times of need.

PARTICIPANTS: HCP with a high or medium risk occupational exposure to a patient or other HCP with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We reviewed the records of HCP with significant occupational exposures from March 20, 2020, through December 31, 2020. We then performed regression analysis to assess the impact of demographic and occupational variables to assess their impact on the likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In total, 2,253 confirmed occupational exposures occurred during the study period. Employees were the source for 57.1% of exposures. Overall, 101 HCP (4.5%) tested positive in the postexposure period. Of these, 80 had employee sources of exposure and 21 had patient sources of exposure. The postexposure infection rate was 6.2% when employees were the source, compared to 2.2% with patient sources.

Clinical and laboratory characteristics at admission that were associated with clinical deterioration included senior age, diabetes, hypertension, myalgia, higher temperature, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, activated partial thromboplastin time, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, direct bilirubin, plasma creatinine, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, decreased albumin and bicarbonate concentration. Medical history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers and metformin were also risk factors. CONCLUSION: The four best predictors for clinical deterioration were CRP, procalcitonin, age and albumin. A \\"best\\" multivariable prediction model, resulting from using a variable selection procedure, included senior age, presentation with myalgia, and higher level of CRP and serum creatinine (bias-corrected c-statistic = 0.909). Sensitivity and specificity corresponding to a cut point of CRP &#8805;18.45 mg/L for predicting clinical deterioration were 85% and 74%, respectively.","output":"Predictors of clinical deterioration in non-severe patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The zoonotic transmissions of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype that have occurred since 1997 have sparked the development of novel influenza vaccines. The advent of reverse genetics technology, cell-culture production techniques and novel adjuvants has improved the vaccine strain preparation, production process and immunogenicity of the vaccines, respectively, and has accelerated the availability of pandemic influenza vaccines. However, there is still room for improvement, and alternative vaccine preparations can be explored, such as viral vectors. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), originally developed as a safe smallpox vaccine, can be exploited as a viral vector and has many favourable properties. Recently, we have demonstrated that an MVA-based vaccine could protect mice and macaques against infection with highly pathogenic influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype. In the present study, recombinant MVA expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) gene of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus was evaluated in the ferret model. A single immunization induced modest antibody responses and afforded only modest protection against the development of severe disease upon infection with a 2009(H1N1) strain. In contrast, two immunizations induced robust antibody responses and protected ferrets from developing severe disease, confirming that MVA is an attractive influenza vaccine production platform.","output":"Evaluation of a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based candidate pandemic influenza A/H1N1 vaccine in the ferret model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infection accompanied by pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has affected millions of people globally. To date, there are no highly efficient therapies for this infection. Probiotic bacteria can interact with the gut microbiome to strengthen the immune system, enhance immune responses, and induce appropriate immune signaling pathways. Several probiotics have been confirmed to reduce the duration of bacterial or viral infections. Immune fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections can be reinforced. In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in fighting viral infections. Thus, probiotics have emerged as suitable candidates for controlling these infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, any approach with the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic reactions could potentially be useful. Here, we summarize findings regarding the effectiveness of various probiotics for preventing virus-induced respiratory infectious diseases, especially those that could be employed for COVID-19 patients.

Dialysis at home was associated with a lower probability of being infected as was being a smoker, a former smoker, having an active malignancy, or peripheral vascular disease. Mortality in diagnosed cases (21%) was associated with the same causes as in the general population. Higher age, hypoalbuminemia and the presence of an ischemic heart disease were statistically independently associated with a higher risk of death.

Deletion analysis showed that efficient internal initiation required a segment of the HCV genome extending from about nucleotides 40-370 and that deletions from the 3'-end of this element were highly deleterious. As the authentic initiation codon for HCV polyprotein synthesis is at nucleotide 342, this demonstrates that, besides 5'-UTR sequences, a short length of HCV coding sequences is required for internal initiation. This finding was confirmed in transfection assays of BT7-H cells and was shown to be independent of the nature of the downstream reporter cistron. The strong requirement for coding sequences is in sharp contrast to internal initiation of picornavirus RNA translation. As a probable correlate with this, it was also found that the efficiency of internal initiation was only marginally compromised when the authentic initiation codon was mutated to a non-AUG codon, again in sharp contrast with the picornaviruses.

We identify the welfare-improving and risk-sharing-improving designs of the regional tax systems and borrowing limits. We find that the choice of public borrowing limits is more consequential than is the choice of a tax regime for union welfare. It also serves as an argument for the harmonization of fiscal policies adopted in the fiscal union, as it would internalize fiscal externalities and improve consumption risk-sharing across the union regions. The key parameter determining the merits of alternative regional tax systems and possible limits to public borrowing in the fiscal union is the productivity of public good. Other aspects of the economy, such as the type of technology process, or the nature of the productivity shock do not affect the union public finance system design significantly. Extensive simulations suggest that if the productivity of public capital lies within the range of plausible empirical estimates, allowing both regions to have flexible borrowing limits and to choose whatever tax system they prefer will reduce the overall welfare costs of business fluctuations. However, for very low productivity of public capital, the welfare-improving regional public finance reforms that would prohibit public borrowing and tax labor income can produce limited benefits.","output":"Tax systems and public borrowing limits in a fiscal union"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biological systems have evolved to amazingly complex states, yet we do not understand in general how evolution operates to generate increasing genetic and functional complexity. Molecular recognition sites are short genome segments or peptides binding a cognate recognition target of sufficient sequence similarity. Such sites are simple, ubiquitous modules of sequence information, cellular function, and evolution. Here we show that recognition sites, if coupled to a time-dependent target, can rapidly evolve to complex states with larger code length and smaller coding density than sites recognising a static target. The underlying fitness model contains selection for recognition, which depends on the sequence similarity between site and target, and a uniform cost per unit of code length. Site sequences are shown to evolve in a specific adaptive ratchet, which produces selection of different strength for code extensions and compressions. Ratchet evolution increases the adaptive width of evolved sites, accelerating the adaptation to moving targets and facilitating refinement and innovation of recognition functions. We apply these results to the recognition of fast-evolving antigens by the human immune system.

However, aglycosylated Atezolizumab is very unstable and easy to form aggregation, which causes quick development of anti-drug antibody (ADA) in 41% of Atezolizumab-treated cancer patients, eventually leading to loss of efficacy.

Using Atezolizumab as the starting template, we back-mutated A297N to re-install the glycosylation, and inserted a short, flexible amino acid sequence (GGGS) between G237 and G238 in the hinge region of the IgG1 heavy chain. Our data shows that insertion of GGGS, does not alter the anti-PD-L1s affinity and inhibitory activity, while completely abolishing ADCC activity.

For the wider public and health authorities, CKD evokes kidney replacement therapy (KRT). In Spain, the prevalence of KRT is 0.13%. A prevalent view is that for those in whom kidneys fail, the problem is solved by dialysis or kidney transplantation. However, the main burden of CKD is accelerated aging and all-cause and cardiovascular premature death. CKD is the most prevalent risk factor for lethal COVID-19 and the factor that most increases the risk of death in COVID-19, after old age. Moreover, men and women undergoing KRT still have an annual mortality which is 10C100-fold higher than similar age peers, and life expectancy is shortened by around 40 years for young persons on dialysis and by 15 years for young persons with a functioning kidney graft.

This scenario has led to reduced public transportation ridership and increased shares of private cars, cycling and walking in urban areas. In the international literature, predictive models for this scenario of changed travel behavior and imminent needs for operations and planning adjustments, however, are still scarce or limited in scope. Holt-Winters multiplicative method was used to extrapolate pre-pandemic datasets as a means to evaluate the impacts of the pandemic in transportation activities in Budapest. Data from March 2020 indicate that stay-at-home orders have resulted in intra-city and commuter traffic reductions of about 35%, while public transportation ticket sales decreased by 90%. Bicycle traffic, on the other hand, increased by about 13% in the same period. These observations suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has driven significant changes in trip generation and mode choice in Budapest. This study proposes the adjustment of a pre-existing four-step transportation model of Budapest based on the introduction of contextual explanatory variables and on the recalibration of model parameters in order to reflect pandemic-related trends in trip generation and trip distribution. The recalibration and validation of the model were based on data from the first wave of the pandemic in Hungary. Validation results, although limited, suggest that the traditional four-step models are able to capture the impacts on transportation of the atypical scenario of a pandemic with relatively simple adjustments and few data requirements.","output":"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the demand for urban transportation in Budapest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Statistical multiword extraction methods can benefit from the knowledge on the n-gram ([Formula: see text]) frequency distribution in natural language corpora, for indexing and time/space optimization purposes. The appearance of increasingly large corpora raises new challenges on the investigation of the large scale behavior of the n-gram frequency distributions, not typically emerging on small scale corpora. We propose an empirical model, based on the assumption of finite n-gram language vocabularies, to estimate the number of distinct n-grams in large corpora, as well as the sizes of the equal-frequency n-gram groups, which occur in the lower frequencies starting from 1. The model was validated for n-grams with [Formula: see text], by a wide range of real corpora in English and French, from 60 million up to 8 billion words. These are full non-truncated corpora data, that is, their associated frequency data include the entire range of observed n-gram frequencies, from 1 up to the maximum. The model predicts the monotonic growth of the numbers of distinct n-grams until reaching asymptotic plateaux when the corpus size grows to infinity.

The fear of infection or new, unknown tasks in an unfamiliar setting, for example, may complicate outbreak management. AIM: To gain insight into how healthcare organizations can prepare to meet the needs of their HCWs by capturing the experiences of HCWs with patients with suspected Ebola virus disease. METHODS: We conducted 23 in-depth interviews with HCWs, of whom 20 worked in a Dutch university hospital and three worked in a regional ambulance service. We invited HCWs who cared for patients with suspected Ebola or who were on the team preparing for admission of such patients in the period 2014C2015. FINDINGS: The HCWs were stressed and anxious, but most rated their overall experience as positive. We categorized the reported experiences in three main themes, namely, experiences related to: (i) the novelty of the threat, (ii) the risk of infection and fear of transmission, and (iii) the excessive attention. Our results underline the importance of a supportive working environment suitable for crises.

By this time (February 28, 2020) 58 countries or territories and one international conveyance (Diamond Princess Cruise Ship) were affected. As a part of the global response to manage and contain the pandemic, major emphasis was placed on generating research intelligence to guide evidence-based responses to contain the virus, which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), owing to its genetic similarities with the SARS virus. This review summarizes the emerging evidence which can help guide the public health response, particularly in India. Key areas have been identified in which research needs to be conducted to generate critical intelligence for advising prevention and control efforts. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has once again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness, ability to respond to an infectious threat, the rapidity of transmission of infections across international borders and the ineffectiveness of knee-jerk policy responses to emerging/re-emerging infectious disease threats. The review concludes with the key learning points from the ongoing efforts to prevent and contain COVID-19 and identifies the need to invest in health systems, community-led response mechanisms and the need for preparedness and global health security.","output":"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic: A review of the current evidence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Medical school curricular hours dedicated to ophthalmology are low and declining. Extracurricular ophthalmology activities, such as participation in community vision screenings, may serve an important adjunctive role in medical school curricula. The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Vision Screening In Our Neighborhoods (ViSION) Program is an example of a voluntary medical student-directed community service-learning program. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods cross-sectional approach, including an online survey and semi-structured interviews. JHU School of Medicine students enrolled in MD or MD/PhD programs during the 2019C2020 academic year were surveyed regarding demographics, career and service interests, involvement in ophthalmology-related activities, and confidence in their ophthalmology-related skills. Survey responses were compared between ViSION volunteers and non-volunteers using Fishers exact chi-square tests. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via webconference with 8 prior or current ViSION volunteers and responses analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Data were collected when ViSION volunteers were in variable stages of their medical education and involvement with the ViSION program. RESULTS: A total of 118 medical students were included, representing an overall response rate of 24.6% of JHU medical students. ViSION volunteers reported greater involvement in ophthalmology-related research (42% vs. 4%, p < 0.001), intent to apply to ophthalmology residency programs (35% vs. 1%, p = 0.001), and confidence with multiple ophthalmology knowledge and clinical skill domains. In particular, ViSION volunteers were more likely to feel confident estimating cup-to-disc ratio using direct ophthalmoscopy (20% vs. 0%, p < 0.001). In open-ended survey and interview questions, most volunteers attributed at least some degree of their ophthalmology skill development and desire to pursue ophthalmology and public health careers to their ViSION experience. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students who volunteered with a student-led community vision screening program were more likely to have a prior interest in ophthalmology than those who did not volunteer, but only 1/3 of volunteers planned to pursue a career in ophthalmology. Overall, volunteers reported higher confidence performing ophthalmology-related clinical skills, suggesting that student-led community vision screening programs may provide an important avenue for medical students to explore public health aspects of ophthalmology, while practicing ophthalmology exam skills and learning about common ophthalmic pathologies, regardless of their career intentions.

Thus, this study delves into the determinants of CO(2) emissions along the ECOWAS community, taking into consideration if countries are energy exporters or energy importers. The analytical procedure applied indicated the presence of heterogeneity in the slope coefficient and cross-sectional dependencies across the various panels.

Finally, the causality results unveil a bidirectional causation in all panels between urbanization and CO(2) emissions, whereas foreign direct investment and CO(2) emissions have a bidirectional effect in energy importers and the main panel. These results obtained indicate that foreign direct investment, urbanization, energy consumption, trade openness, and gross domestic product are the determinants of CO(2) emissions along the community. Based on the outcome, the suggested policy implications indicate that (a) the need for a paradigm shift from fossil fuel sources to renewables be encouraged in the community and (b) again, the awareness of spillover of economic growth and energy transition on CO(2) emissions from foreign companies to local businesses must be promoted.","output":"The nexus amid foreign direct investment, urbanization, and CO(2) emissions: Evidence from energy grouping along the ECOWAS community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus detection methods are important to cope with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.

As this has continuing relevance including regarding operating room pollution, we empirically quantified carbon dioxide (CO(2)) leak jet velocity (important for particle propulsion) occurring with different instruments inserted into differing trocars repeated across a range of intra-abdominal pressures (IAPs) and modern insufflators in an experimental model. METHOD: Laparoscopic gas plume leak velocity (metres/second) was computationally enumerated from schlieren optical flow videography on a porcine cadaveric laparoscopic model with IAPs of 4C5, 7C8, 12C15 and 24C25 mmHg (repeated with 5 different insufflators) during simulated operative use of laparoscopic clip appliers, scissors, energy device, camera and staplers as well as Veres needle (positive control) and trocar obturator (negative control) in fresh 5 mm and 12 mm ports. RESULTS: Close-fitting solid instruments (i.e. cameras and obturators) demonstrated slower gas leak velocities in both the 5 mm and 12 mm ports (p = 0.02 and less than 0.001) when compared to slimmer instruments, however, hollow instrument designs were seen to defy this pattern with the endoscopic linear stapler visibly inducing multiple rapid jests even when compared to similarly sized clip appliers (p = 0.03). However, on a per device basis the operating instrumentation displayed plume speeds which did not vary significantly when challenged with varying post size, IAP and a range of insufflators. CONCLUSION: In general, surgeon's selection of instrument, port or pressure does not usefully mitigate trocar CO(2) leak velocity. Instead better trocar design is needed, helped by a fuller understanding of trocar valve mechanics via computational fluid dynamics informed by relevant surgical modelling.

Due to the movement restrictions while battling with COVID-19, businesses are forced to switch from conventional brick-and-mortar business to digital business application involving developing their own e-commerce sites. The emerging social media in society provides opportunity for the micro-enterprises to virtually engage with their customers. The social media has now become one of the important business tools for marketing, branding, networking and developing the business strategy. Despite of the active social media involvement among the micro-entrepreneurs, the outcome of the social media activities is still at its infancy. Micro-entrepreneurs especially the Bumiputeras have still not fully utilized the social media as their business tool. Micro-entrepreneurs lack the knowledge on how to interpret the social media platform analysis tools such as site traffic, post engagement, post impressions and others. Therefore, it is necessary to further study of degree social media adoption among the Bumiputera micro-entrepreneurs and how it affects the business performance. A quantitative method is proposed for this study by considering the existing UTAUT variables like performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions. This paper proposes a conceptual research model based on the underpinning theory and aim to measure the outcome from adoption of social media on Bumiputera micro-entrepreneurs' business performance. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"An Initiative to Measure the impact of Social Media Adoption on Bumiputera Micro-Entrepreneurs' Business Performance: A Conceptual Paper"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) surges worldwide. However, massive imported patients especially into Heilongjiang Province in China recently have been an alert for local COVID-19 outbreak. We collected data from January 23 to March 25 from Heilongjiang province and trained an ordinary differential equation model to fit the epidemic data. We extended the simulation using this trained model to characterize the effect of an imported escaper. We showed that an imported escaper was responsible for the newly confirmed COVID-19 infections from Apr 9 to Apr 19 in Heilongjiang province. Stochastic simulations further showed that significantly increased local contacts among imported escaper, its epidemiologically associated cases and susceptible populations greatly contributed to the local outbreak of COVID-19. Meanwhile, we further found that the reported number of asymptomatic patients was markedly lower than model predictions implying a large asymptomatic pool which was not identified. We further forecasted the effect of implementing strong interventions immediately to impede COVID-19 outbreak for Heilongjiang province. Implementation of stronger interventions to lower mutual contacts could accelerate the complete recovery from coronavirus infections in Heilongjiang province.

COPD is characterized by acute pulmonary exacerbations and associated accelerated lung function decline, hospitalization, readmission and an increased risk of mortality, leading to huge social-economic burdens. Recent evidence suggests ~50% of COPD acute exacerbations are connected with a range of respiratory viral infections. Nevertheless, respiratory viral infections have been linked to the severity and frequency of exacerbations and virus-induced secondary bacterial infections often result in a synergistic decline of lung function and longer hospitalization. Here, we review current advances in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COPD and the increased susceptibility to virus-induced exacerbations and associated immune dysfunction in patients with COPD. The multiple immune regulators and inflammatory signaling pathways known to be involved in host-virus responses are discussed. As respiratory viruses primarily target airway epithelial cells, virus-induced inflammatory responses in airway epithelium are of particular focus. Targeting virus-induced inflammatory pathways in airway epithelial cells such as Toll like receptors (TLRs), interferons, inflammasomes, or direct blockade of virus entry and replication may represent attractive future therapeutic targets with improved efficacy. Elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of virus infections in COPD pathogenesis will undoubtedly facilitate the development of these potential novel therapies that may attenuate the relentless progression of this heterogeneous and complex disease and reduce morbidity and mortality.","output":"Mechanisms of Virus-Induced Airway Immunity Dysfunction in the Pathogenesis of COPD Disease, Progression, and Exacerbation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter provides the tools for using cell culture as an adjunct to the cell biology and molecular biology methods that break down the traditional borders between the disciplines of biology and virology.

DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic literature review using the search terms of lefamulin and BC-3781 in the PubMed and EMBASE databases. We also cross-referenced the pertinent articles and searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing and nonpublished studies. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Published data from 2005 to 2019 evaluating the clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety studies of lefamulin were analyzed. DATA SYNTHESIS: In phase 3 clinical trials, two multicenter, randomized double-blinded studiesLefamulin Evaluation Against Pneumonia 1 and 2 (LEAP 1 and 2)compared the efficacy and safety of lemafulin with moxifloxacin in patients diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Lemafulin given in doses of 600 mg orally or 150 mg intravenously were reported to have comparable efficacy to those of moxifloxacin with or without linezolid in patients with CABP. After the trial, the lefamulin group had an early clinical response (ECR) of 87.3% and the moxifloxacin group had an ECR of 90.2%. The difference of ? 2.9% in the ECR was non-significant (CI ? 8.5, 2.8). RELEVANCE TO PATIENTS AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Lemafulin exhibits a unique binding property; therefore, it possess a potentially lower predisposition for the development of bacterial resistance and cross-resistance to other antimicrobial classes. Lefamulin is active against gram-positive including methicillin-resistant strains and atypical organisms which are often implicated in CABP. Lefamulin may be a safe alternative for adult patients with CABP who may not be candidates for respiratory fluoroquinolones. Lefamulin demonstrates both bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negatives, atypical pathogens, and some gram-negative anaerobes. It is bactericidal in vitro against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (including macrolide-resistant strains) at concentrations of 0.06, 0.5, and 0.008 g/ml respectively, and bacteriostatic against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The agent also demonstrates both time- and concentration-dependent killing against the pathogens S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. In vitro susceptibility testing demonstrated an MIC(50/90) of 0.06/0.12 g/ml against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program found that at a concentration  1 g/ml, lefamulin inhibited 100% S. pneumoniae isolates, 99.8% of S. aureus isolates, and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates.

To add to this, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened delivery of TB care across the globe. As a global community, we have committed to end the TB epidemic by 2030. The World Health Organization has framed a strategy to achieve this goal which consists of three pillars namely i) integrated patient-centred care and prevention, ii) bold policies and systems and iii) intensified research and innovation. An analysis of the performance of national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) across the globe against the ten priority indicators recommended for monitoring the end TB strategy show that there are huge gaps at every step in the cascade of care of TB patients. In our view, these gaps reflect suboptimal implementation of existing strategies known to be efficacious and operational research (OR) is one of the best available tools to plug the gaps. In this paper, we define what operational research is and how it differs from other kinds of research. We also share our views and experiences about how operational research can be used by NTPs to identify implementation gaps and their reasons, and develop and test possible solutions - which are then integrated to make changes to policy and practice and eventually improve programme outcomes. OR can be defined as research into interventions, strategies and tools which produces practical useable knowledge that can be used to enhance the quality, coverage, effectiveness and efficiency of disease control programmes, health services or health systems in which the research is conducted. The key steps in integrating operational research in the NTPs include: i) securing political commitment reflected by inclusion of OR in the national strategic plans of NTPs and earmarked funding, ii) having a critical mass of dedicated and trained human resources in OR within the NTP, iii) setting research priorities and steering the direction of research in the country, iv) using output-oriented models of capacity building such as the Structured Operational Research Training Initiative (SORT IT) model and building communities of practice, v) harnessing existing capacity in the country by forging partnerships with academia, vi) NTP-led nationwide, multicentre OR studies, vii) providing access to anonymized patient and programme surveillance data, vii) creating a forum for evidence dissemination and fostering policy change and ix) monitoring and accountability. In conclusion, ending the TB epidemic will not be possible without new tools (diagnostics, drugs, vaccines) and a multi-sectoral response involving stakeholders beyond the health ministry, including private providers, patients and communities. However, timely conduct of operational research to fine-tune programme implementation and ensuring proper deployment of new tools will be equally crucial to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions and ultimately contribute towards ending TB.","output":"What is operational research and how can national tuberculosis programmes in low- and middle-income countries use it to end TB?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Antibiotic Use aimed to improve antibiotic use by engaging clinicians and staff to incorporate antibiotic stewardship (AS) into practice culture, communication, and decision making. We report on changes in visits and antibiotic prescribing in AHRQ Safety Program ambulatory practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Safety Program used webinars, audio presentations, educational tools, and office hours to engage clinician champions and staff leaders to: (a) address attitudes and culture that pose challenges to judicious antibiotic prescribing and (b) incorporate best practices for the management of common infections into their workflow using the Four Moments of Antibiotic Decision Making framework. Total visits (in-person and virtual), acute respiratory infection (ARI) visits, and antibiotic prescribing data were collected. Using linear mixed models to account for random effects of participating practices and repeated measurements of outcomes within practices over time, data from the pre-intervention period (September-November 2019) and the Ambulatory Care Safety Program (December 2019-November 2020) were compared. RESULTS: Of 467 practices enrolled, 389 (83%) completed the program, including 162 primary care practices (42%; 23 [6%] pediatric), 160 urgent care practices (41%; 40 [10%] pediatric), and 49 federally-supported practices (13%). 292 practices submitted complete data for analysis, including 6,590,485 visits. Visits/practice-month declined March-May 2020 but gradually returned to baseline by program end (Figure 1). Total antibiotic prescribing declined by 9 prescriptions/100 visits (95% CI: -10 to -8). ARI visits/practice-month declined significantly in March-May 2020, then increased but remained below baseline by program end (Figure 2). ARI-related antibiotic prescriptions decreased by 15/100 ARI visits by program end (95% CI: -17 to -12). The greatest reduction was in penicillin class prescriptions with a reduction of 7/100 ARI visits by program end (95% CI: -9 to -6).

Whether this Spike/DPP4 association affects macrophage responses remains unknown. Herein we demonstrated that infection of macrophages with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S glycoprotein results in suppression of macrophage responses since it reduced the capacity of macrophages to produce TNFa and IL-6 in naive and LPS-activated THP-1 macrophages and augmented LPS-induced production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. MERS-CoV S glycoprotein induced the expression of the negative regulator of TLR signaling IRAK-M as well as of the transcriptional repressor PPAR. Inhibition of DPP4 by its inhibitor sitagliptin or siRNA abrogated the effects of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein on IRAK-M, PPAR and IL-10, confirming that its immunosuppressive effects were mediated by DPP4 receptor. The effect was observed both in THP-1 macrophages and human primary peripheral blood monocytes. These findings support a DPP4-mediated suppressive action of MERS-CoV in macrophages and suggest a potential target for effective elimination of its pathogenicity.","output":"Middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus spike glycoprotein suppresses macrophage responses via DPP4-mediated induction of IRAK-M and PPAR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to rise, and pose a significant public health problem Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 The pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is close to Amraz-e-Wabai (epidemic diseases) which was described by Hippocrates, Galen, Aristotle, Razes, Haly Abbas, Avicenna, Jurjani etc Presently, there is no specific or challenging treatment available for COVID-19 Renowned Unani Scholars recommended during epidemic situation to stay at home, and fumigate the shelters with aromatics herbs like Ood kham (Aquilaria agallocha Roxb ), Kundur (Boswellia serrata Roxb), Kafoor (Cinnamomum camphora L ), Sandal (Santalum album L), Hing (Ferula foetida L ) etc Use of specific Unani formulations are claimed effective for the management of such epidemic or pandemic situation like antidotes (Tiryaqe Wabai, Tiryaqe Arba, Tiryaqe Azam, Gile Armani), Herbal Decoction (Joshandah), along with Sharbate Khaksi, Habbe Bukhar, Sharbate Zanjabeel, Khamira Marwareed, Jawarish Jalinus, and Sirka (vinegar) Such drugs are claimed for use as antioxidant, immunomodulatory, cardiotonic, and general tonic actions The study enumerates the literature regarding management of epidemics in Unani medicine and attempts to look the same in the perspective of COVID-19 prevention and management","output":"Possible role of Unani Pharmacology in COVID-19 - a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are a large viral family that attacks key organs, particularly the lungs.

Dedicated to damage control surgery close to combat, GHOST made the FST aero-mobile again, with a light logistical footprint and a fast setting. On 19 and 25 March 2020, Niger and Mali confirmed their first COVID-19 cases, respectively. The pandemic was ongoing in Sahel, where 5,100 French soldiers were deployed in the Barkhane Operation. RESULTS: For the first time, the FST had to provide, continuously, both COVID critical care and surgical support to the ongoing operation in Liptako. Its deployment on a Main Operating Base had to be rethought on Niamey, to face the COVID crisis and support ongoing operations. This far-forward surgical asset, embedded with a doctrinal Role-1, sat up a 4-bed COVID intensive care unit while maintaining a casualty surgical care capacity.

METHODS A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. RESULTS This abscess usually originates in the proctodeal glands of the intersphincteric space. A distinction is made between subanodermal, intersphincteric, ischioanal, and supralevator abscesses. The patient history and clinical examination are diagnostically sufficient to establish the indication for surgery. Further examinations (endosonography, MRI) should be considered in recurrent abscesses or supralevator abscesses. The timing of the surgical intervention is primarily determined by the patient's symptoms, and acute abscess is generally an indication for emergency treatment. Anal abscesses are treated surgically. The type of access (transrectal or perianal) depends on the abscess location. The goal of surgery is thorough drainage of the focus of infection while preserving the sphincter muscles. The wound should be rinsed regularly (using tap water). The use of local antiseptics is associated with a risk of cytotoxicity. Antibiotic treatment is only necessary in exceptional cases. Intraoperative fistula exploration should be conducted with extreme care if at all; no requirement to detect fistula should be imposed. The risk of abscess recurrence or secondary fistula formation is low overall, but they can result from insufficient drainage. Primary fistulotomy should only be performed in case of superficial fistulas and by experienced surgeons. In case of unclear findings or high fistulas, repair should take place in a second procedure.

Additionally, a Visual Analogue Scale was used to measure pain severity. RESULTS Of the 2555 girls, 1306 had experienced PD, representing a 51.1% prevalence. In addition, the prevalence rates of mild, moderate and severe pain in PD were 18.1%, 27.7% and 5.4%, respectively. The most common symptoms associated with PD were cramps (96.9%), weakness (70.0%), backache (65.1%), facial blemishes (55.3%) and irritability (55.3%). Commonly used self-care strategies for managing PD comprised reducing physical activity (94.6%), keeping warm (84.6%), communicating dysmenorrhea with friends or classmates (79.0%), drinking warm beverages (75.7%) and avoiding cold drinks and foods (74.2%). In addition, only 34.8% self-medicated with Western medicine (15.6%), traditional Chinese medicine (8.6%), or both (10.6%). Medical advice was sought by 27.4% of subjects from a Western medical doctor (10.3%), a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine (13.6%), or both (3.5%). Girls who had greater pain severity were more likely to be self-medicated (OR=7.01; 95% CI 4.50 to 10.91), use complementary therapies (OR=2.64; 95% CI 1.70 to 4.10) and seek medical advice (OR=5.93; 95% CI 3.80 to 9.24). CONCLUSIONS PD is highly prevalent among Chinese college girls, with a high burden of symptoms. In addition, these girls are most likely to change their lifestyle, communicate dysmenorrhea with friends or mothers, use heat therapy and engage in self-talk, but less likely to self-medicate or seek medical advice for managing PD.","output":"Primary dysmenorrhea and self-care strategies among Chinese college girls: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 has found significant levels of distress among the general population, and among those especially vulnerable due to chronic social or health challenges.

The health behaviors of healthcare professionals are even more critical, as healthcare providers who practice positive health behaviors are more likely to promote these healthy behaviors in their patients. AIMS: To assess the health status and health behaviors of medical students, faculty, and staff in an academic health center in the US, and examine the associations between behaviors, physical and mental health outcomes and burnout. METHODS: Students, faculty, residents and staff from a large university medical system completed an online survey between late-September and mid-November 2019. Associations were examined between health behaviors and health status including mental health outcomes with burnout. RESULTS: Participating in any leisure time physical activity and having a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score < 5 were associated with fewer physical health conditions and lower odds of reporting pain at any site (n = 2060; students n = 242, residents n = 32, staff n = 1425, faculty n = 361). Leisure physical activity and fewer sleep symptoms were associated with fewer reported depressive, anxiety and stress-related symptoms. Participating in leisure physical activity and good-quality sleep were associated with lower odds of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: The current study found high rates of physical inactivity and poor sleep among medical students, faculty and staff at an academic health center. These health behaviors were associated with poor mental health and high burnout. Programs and policies are needed improve these health behaviors to reduce burnout.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of inflammatory and coagulation parameters, including prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1.2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TATs), fibrin monomers, and D-dimer, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We compared the markers in patients with thrombosis, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and poor outcome. RESULTS: Of the 81 patients, 9 (11%) experienced an acute thrombotic event (4 with pulmonary embolism, 3 with venous thrombosis, and 2 with stroke). PF1.2 was elevated in 32 (39%) patients, TATs in 54 (67%), fibrin monomers in 49 (60%), and D-dimer in 76 (94%). Statistically significant elevation in PF1.2 and TATs was seen in patients admitted to the ICU, while D-dimer and fibrin monomers were significantly elevated in patients with poor outcomes. The presence of multiple abnormal coagulation parameters was associated with ICU admission. Other parameters with statistically significant results included abnormal WBC counts and elevated C-reactive protein, which were associated with ICU admission and poor outcomes.

The analytical performance of the C19-kodecyte assay was compared with a virus neutralizing assay and two commercial chemiluminescent antibody tests (Total assay and IgG assay, Ortho). The C19-kodecyte assay detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with a sensitivity of 92.8% and specificity of 96.3%, well within the minimum performance range required by FDA for EUA authorization of serologic tests. The Cohens kappa coefficient was 0.90 indicating an almost perfect agreement with the Total assay. The Spearmans correlation coefficient was 0.20 with the neutralizing assay (0.49 with IgG, and 0.41 with Total assays). The limited correlation in assay reaction strengths suggested that the assays may be influenced by different antibody specificities. The C19-kodecyte assay is easily scalable and may vastly improve test capacity in any blood typing laboratory using its routine column agglutination platforms. IMPORTANCE We recently developed a red cell based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human plasma. In the current study, we show the hands-on application of this assay in a group of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors and healthy individuals. We compared our assay against three published assays, including two that are widely used for patient care in the United States. Our assay compared well with all three assays.

More importantly, the research work also unveils a major problem restraining the NDV vector vaccines in poultry, i.e., the interference from maternally derived antibody (MDA). Although many efforts have been taken to overcome MDA interference, a lack of understanding of the mechanism of vaccination inhibition by MDA in poultry still hinders vaccine improvement. In this review, we outline the history of NDV as a vaccine vector by highlighting some milestones. The recent advances in the development of NDV-vectored vaccines or therapeutics for animals and humans are discussed. Particularly, we focus on the mechanisms and hypotheses of vaccination inhibition by MDA and the efforts to circumvent MDA interference with the NDV vector vaccines.

The N-terminal 25 amino-acid sequence of SPL, NVLGRDAYCGSQNPGATCPGLCCSK was determined and homology analysis suggested that SPL belongs to the family of chitin-binding plant lectins composed of hevein domains. The lectin exhibited strong hemagglutinating activity towards rabbit erythrocytes at 0.95g/ml and the activity could be reversed exclusively by chitin hydrolysate (oligomers of GlcNAc). Its hemagglutinating activity was stable in pH range of 2.0C9.0 and it showed excellent thermal tolerance. SPL showed antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Penicillium italicum and Helminthosporiun maydis. It also exhibited inhibitory effect on HIV-1 (IIIB) and HIV-2 (ROD), with an EC50 of 13.81.3 and 57.115g/ml, respectively. Subsequently, MTT method, cell morphological analysis and LDH activity-based cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that SPL was highly cytotoxic to CNE-1 cells and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.

Therefore, citizens active participation is required to reduce PM and prevent its risks. However, a theoretical model about public behavior against PM has not been established. Therefore, we suggest the public behavior model about individuals response against PM, in which response actions are classified into four types based on the combinations of the public-personal domains and mitigation-adaptation actions: Personal or public adaptations, and personal or public mitigations. We analyze how risk perception, risk communication, blame attribution factors influence the four types of responses against PM. The analysis results reveal that the receivers ability, negative emotion, trust in government, and age influence personal mitigation behavior, personal adaptation, public mitigation, and public adaptation, respectively.

METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv data and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials for published articles that reported the outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or its compounds was done. We identified 1071 published studies and 7 studies were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The study population consisted of a total of 4984 patients, of which 1721 (34.5%) received hydroxychloroquine or its congeners (HCQ group) while 3091 (62.01%) received standard of care or had included antiviral medication (control group). The pooled estimate of successful treatment in the hydroxychloroquine group and the control group was 77.45% and 77.87% respectively, which indicated similar clinical outcomes in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group. The odds ratio of a favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine was 1.11 (95 CI 0.72 to 1.69) (p = 0.20).

The urgency of producing and delivering face shields increased as the number of COVID-19 cases rapidly multiplied. This was the situation that we encountered in the city and province of Burgos (Spain). Since there was no time to wait for a large manufacturer to produce face shields, private citizens and small companies volunteered to make them using technologies such as 3D printers. Nonprofits, citizens, and governments agencies volunteered to deliver materials to the face shield makers and to pick up and deliver the face shields to health centers and other locations where they were needed.

Whether or not SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to liver damage per se remains unknown. Here we reported the clinical characteristics and liver pathological manifestations of COVID-19 patients with liver enzyme abnormality. METHODS: We received 156 patients diagnosed of COVID-19 from two designated centers in China, and compared clinical features between patients with elevated aminotransferase or not. Postmortem liver biopsies were obtained from two cases who had elevated aminotransferase. We investigated the patterns of liver impairment by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay, and pathological studies. RESULTS: 64 of 156 (41.0%) COVID-19 patients had elevated aminotransferase. The median levels of ALT were 50 U/L vs. 19 U/L, respectively, AST were 45.5 U/L vs. 24 U/L, respectively in abnormal and normal aminotransferase groups. The liver enzyme abnormality was associated with disease severity, as well as a series of laboratory tests including higher A-aDO2, higher GGT, lower albumin, decreased CD4+ T cells and B lymphocytes. Ultrastructural examination identified typical coronavirus particles characterized by spike structure in cytoplasm of hepatocytes in two COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 infected hepatocytes displayed conspicuous mitochondrial swelling, endoplasmic reticulum dilatation, and glycogen granule decrease. Histologically, massive hepatic apoptosis and a certain binuclear hepatocytes were observed.

Thereby, this article reviews the effects of Aloe vera prescription on streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus to provide a clear insight into the role of this medicinal plant in several biological functions, such as antioxidant, wound healing, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic, and anti-hyperlipidemic in diabetic models.

METHODS Nasal brushing samples of 55 children (28 male) were evaluated for ciliary motion and ultrastructural assessment, as well as for detection and quantification of TTV. Moreover, presence and load of TTV within ciliated cells, obtained from 5 patients by laser capture microdissection, were determined. RESULTS The nasal samples of 47 (85%) children with persistent or recurrent pneumonia resulted positive for TTV (loads = 2.1-7.3 log10 copies/microg total DNA). TTV were demonstrated also within microdissected ciliated cells. No significant difference between primary (11 subjects) and secondary ciliary dyskinesia (44 subjects) for TTV prevalence and mean loads were found. A significant correlation was observed between nasal TTV loads and ciliary beat frequency score (r = 0.305; P < 0.05), but not between TTV loads and presence of abnormal motion patterns, in patients with secondary ciliary abnormalities. As expected no correlations were found between nasal TTV loads and ciliary motion analysis in primary ciliary dyskinesia. CONCLUSIONS The presence of TTV in nasal samples demonstrates TTV ability to infect respiratory ciliated cells and suggests that these cells are potentially able to support virus replication. Moreover, TTV may behave in respiratory cells in a similar way to other viruses, that is, they disrupt the mucociliary escalator.","output":"Torquetenovirus infection and ciliary dysmotility in children with recurrent pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Central venous catheter-related blood stream infections (CR-BSIs) are a serious complication in patients with hematological malignancies. However, it remains unclear whether there is a difference in the rate of CR-BSI associated with the conventional type of central venous catheters (cCVCs) and peripherally inserted CVCs (PICCs) in such patients. To address this question, we retrospectively investigated the incidence of CR-BSIs associated with PICCs versus cCVCs in patients with hematological malignancies. We used PICCs in all consecutive patients requiring CVC placement between February 2009 and February 2013. We compared the CR-BSI rate in patients with PICCs with that in patients with cCVCs treated between September 2006 and January 2009 (control group). Eighty-four patients received PICCs and 85 received cCVCs. The most common reason for removal due to catheter-related complications was CR-BSI. The CR-BSI rate in the PICC group was significantly lower than that in the cCVC group (PICCs: 1.23/1000 catheter days; cCVCs: 5.30/1000 catheter days; P < 0.01). Catheter-related complications other than CR-BSIs occurred at an extremely low rate in the PICC group. The median catheter-related complication-free survival duration was significantly longer in the PICC group than in the cCVC group.

Through simulations and applications to GWAS and whole-genome sequencing data for multiple diseases and traits we show that the proposed test increases the power over state-of-the-art gene-based tests in the literature, identifies genes that replicate in larger studies, and can provide a more narrow focus on the possible causal genes at a locus by reducing the confounding effect of linkage disequilibrium. Furthermore, our results show that incorporating genetic variation in distal regulatory elements tends to improve power over conventional tests.

AIM: To examine the association between adherence to MD and AGEs in patients with DM type II. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 273 patients with DM type II. A survey questionnaire was composed of 3 separate sections. The first part of the questionnaire included general data and the habits of the participants. The second part aimed to assess the basic parameters of participants diseases and associated conditions. The third part of the questionnaire was the Croatian version of the 14-item MD service score (MDSS). AGEs levels and associated CV risk were measured using AGE Reader (DiagnOptics Technologies BV, Groningen, The Netherlands). RESULTS: A total of 27 (9.9%) patients fulfilled criteria for adherence to MD, with a median score of 8.0 (6.0-10.0). Patients with none/limited CV risk had significantly higher percentage of MD adherence in comparison to patients with increased/definite CV risk (15.2% vs 6.9%, P = 0.028), as well as better adherence to guidelines for nuts (23.2% vs 12.6%, P = 0.023) and legumes (40.4% vs 25.9%, P = 0.013) consumption. Higher number of patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) < 7% adhered to MD when compared to patients with HbA1c > 7% (14.9% vs 7.3%, P = 0.045). Moreover, those patients followed the MDSS guidelines for eggs (33.0% vs 46.8%, P = 0.025) and wine (15.6% vs 29.8%, P = 0.006) consumption more frequently. MDSS score had significant positive correlation with disease duration (r = 0.179, P = 0.003) and negative correlation with body mass index (BMI) values (r = -0.159, P = 0.008). In the multiple linear regression model, BMI (  SE, -0.09  0.04, P = 0.037) and disease duration (  SE, 0.07  0.02, P < 0.001) remained significant independent correlates of the MDSS score.

We aim to describe in detail technical and legal considerations regarding international teleproctoring, a tool that could waive the need for in-person supervision during procedures. METHODS: International teleproctoring was chosen to provide remote supervision during the first three intracranial aneurysm treatments with a new flow diverter (currently subject of a clinical trial) in the US. Real-time, high-resolution transmission software streamed audiovisual data to a proctor located in Canada. The software allowed the transmission of images in a de-identified, HIPAA-compliant manner. RESULTS: All three flow diverters were implanted as desired by operator and proctor and without complication. The proctor could swap between images from multiple sources and reported complete spatial and situational awareness, without any significant lag or delay in communication. Procedural times and radiologic dose were similar to those of uncomplicated, routine flow diversion cases at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: International teleproctoring was successfully implemented in our clinical practice. Its first use provided important insights for establishing this tool in our field. With no clear horizon for lifting the current travel restrictions, teleproctoring has the potential to remove the need for proctor presence in the angiography suite, thereby allowing the field to advance through the continuation of trials and the introduction of new devices in clinical practice. In order for this tool to be used safely and effectively, highly reliable connection and high-resolution equipment is necessary, and multiple legal nuances have to be considered.","output":"International teleproctoring in neurointerventional surgery and its potential impact on clinical trials in the era of COVID-19: legal and technical considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Documentation of the effects of the corona pandemic on people who compulsively use ?hard' drugs, as well as staff from outpatient drug services Methods : We used a special form of a qualitative online survey, in which drug service staff answer questions from a guideline by email, voice or text messages 50 responses from 26 German cities were examined for this paper Preliminary results: The atmosphere in the respective settings has mostly changed for the worse, one reason for which being less favorable conditions for drug services The general living conditions for users were primarily impaired by the increased lack of money The drug market was only partially affected by the corona restrictions: the increase in price of illegally traded medical drugs was often more pronounced than the price increase for illegal substances Drug services have severely restricted their offers due to the covid-19 measures Institutions often had to deal with a lack of protective materials at the beginning of the crisis Often, but not always, take-home regulations for opioid substitution treatment have been expanded Users often show problems to comply with distance and hygiene rules Conclusions: The current pandemic has brought about significant challenges and strains for both people who use drugs and drug service staff Further research is recommended, particularly with regard to practice and effects of opioid substitution treatment (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Zielsetzung: Erfassung der Auswirkungen der Corona-Pandemie auf Menschen, die kompulsiv ?harte' Drogen konsumieren sowie auf Mitarbeitende der Drogenhilfe Methodik: Es wurde eine Form der qualitativen Online-Erhebung angewandt, in deren Rahmen Mitarbeitende der Drogenhilfe Leitfragen mittels E-Mail, Sprach- oder Textnachrichten beantworteten Bisher konnten 50 Antworten aus 26 deutschen St?dten einbezogen werden Zwischenergebnisse: Die Stimmung der Konsumierenden von ?harten\\" Drogen hat sich nach Einsch?tzung der befragten Mitarbeitenden von Suchthilfeeinrichtungen berwiegend verschlechtert, u a durch ungnstigere Bedingungen fr Hilfsangebote Die generellen Lebensbedingungen fr Konsumierende sind in erster Linie durch versch?rften Geldmangel erschwert Der Drogenmarkt wurde nur teilweise durch die Corona-Einschr?nkungen beeinflusst, wobei sich illegal gehandelte Medikamente st?rker verteuert haben als illegale Substanzen Die Drogenhilfe hat ihre Angebote aufgrund der Ausgangsbeschr?nkungen, Abstands- und Hygieneregeln stark eingeschr?nkt und musste zu Beginn der Krise teils mit einem Mangel an Schutzmaterialien umgehen Oft, aber nicht immer, wurden Take-Home-Regelungen fr Substitution ausgeweitet Es wurde berichtet, dass Konsumierende teilweise Probleme hatten, Abstands- und Hygieneregeln einzuhalten Fazit: Die aktuelle Pandemie hat sowohl fr Konsumierende als auch Drogenhilfepersonal deutliche Herausforderungen und Belastungen mit sich gebracht Es wird deutlich, dass hier weiterer Forschungsbedarf besteht, u a was Praxis und Auswirkungen der Substitution betrifft (German) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Sucht is the property of Hogrefe AG and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Corona, ?harte' Szenen und Drogenhilfe C Zwischenergebnisse einer laufenden qualitativen Erhebung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coordinating breast cancer treatment is a complex task that can overwhelm patients and their support networks.

RECENT FINDINGS: A range of secondary IFDs complicating COVID-19 infection have been described and while COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was predicted, the presentation of significant numbers of COVID-19-associated candidosis and COVID-19-associated mucormycosis was somewhat unexpected. Given the range of IFDs and prolonged duration of risk, diagnostic strategies need to involve multiple tests for detecting and differentiating various causes of IFD. Although performance data for a range of tests to diagnose COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis is emerging, the performance of tests to diagnose other IFD is unknown or based on pre-COVID performance data. SUMMARY: Because of the vast numbers of COVID-19 infections, IFD in COVID-19 critical-care patients represents a significant burden of disease, even if incidences are less than 5%. Optimal diagnosis of COVID-19-associated IFD requires a strategic approach. The pandemic has highlighted the potential impact of IFD outside of the typical high-risk clinical cohorts, given the ever-increasing population at risk of IFD and enhanced surveillance of fungal infections is required.","output":"Diagnosis of invasive fungal disease in coronavirus disease 2019: approaches and pitfalls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an unprecedented pandemic threatening global health, and variants were discovered rapidly after the pandemic. The two variants, namely the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and P.1 (Gamma), were formed by the mutations in the receptor binding domain of spike glycoprotein (SGP). These two variants are known to possess a high binding affinity with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Amidst the rapid spread of these mutant strains, research and development of novel molecules become tedious and labour-intensive. Imidazole and benzimidazole scaffolds were selected in this study based on their unique structural features and electron-rich environment, resulting in increased affinity against a variety of therapeutic targets. In the current study, imidazole- and benzimidazole-based anti-parasitic drugs are repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Gamma variant spike glycoproteins using computational strategies. Out of the screened 15 molecules, flubendazole and mebendazole have exhibited promising binding features to the two receptors (PDB ID: 7NEH and 7NXC), as evidenced by their glide score and binding free energy. The results are compared with that of the two standard drugs, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine. Flubendazole and mebendazole have become convenient treatment options against mutant lineages of SARS-CoV-2. The edge of the flubendazole was further established by its stability in MD simulation conducted for 100 ns employing GROMACS software. Further, in vitro and in vivo studies are essential to understand, if flubendazole and mebendazole indeed hold the promise to manage SARS-CoV-2 mutant stains.

We included individuals who had received at least 2 COVID-19 vaccine doses (with at least 1 mRNA vaccine dose for the primary series) and used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness of two or three doses by time since the latest dose. Results We included 3,442 Omicron-positive cases, 9,201 Delta-positive cases, and 471,545 test-negative controls. After 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine, vaccine effectiveness against Delta infection declined steadily over time but recovered to 93% (95%CI, 92-94%) []7 days after receiving an mRNA vaccine for the third dose. In contrast, receipt of 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines was not protective against Omicron. Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron was 37% (95%CI, 19-50%) []7 days after receiving an mRNA vaccine for the third dose. Conclusions Two doses of COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to protect against infection by Omicron. A third dose provides some protection in the immediate term, but substantially less than against Delta. Our results may be confounded by behaviours that we were unable to account for in our analyses. Further research is needed to examine protection against severe outcomes.","output":"Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against Omicron or Delta infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Every year, millions of Americans get sick from foodborne illness and it is estimated half of all reported instances occur at restaurants. To protect the public, regulators are encouraged to conduct restaurant inspections and disclose reports to consumers. However, inspection reporting format is inconsistent and typically contains information unclear to most consumers who often misinterpret the inspection results. Additionally, consumers are increasingly searching for this information in a digital context. Limited research explores inspection reports as communication tools. Using affect-as-information and ELM as theoretical frameworks, this experiment investigated how discrete emotions (e.g., disgust) conveyed through pictorial cues (i.e., emojis) influenced consumers' processing of inspection reports. Participants, recruited from Amazon's MTurk, were randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions in a 3 (emoji: smiling vs. disgusted vs. none) x 2 (violation level: low vs. high) between-subjects design. Then, participants completed a questionnaire regarding perceptions and cognitive processing of the message. Results revealed that, compared to text, disgusted face emoji increased risk perceptions and avoidance behavior. In terms of emotion, smiling face emoji motivated participants to feel more emotions related to sanitation. In turn, positive feelings decreased elaboration likelihood. As predicted by ELM, involvement also predicted elaboration, such that participants who were highly involved with inspection reports elaborated more than those less involved. Involvement also moderated the relationship between emoji presented and elaboration. Practical implications are also discussed.","output":"Disgusting Face, Disease-ridden Place?: Emoji Influence on the Interpretation of Restaurant Inspection Reports."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of the study: To discuss selected aspects of our local and national experience in treating and vaccinating pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.Materials and methods: A comprehensive, retrospective review of COVID-19 parturients in our center as well as a detailed literature review of several aspects from the groundbreaking research done in Israel to investigate the direct obstetrical impact of COVID-19, indirect effect of the lockdown measures and the vaccination effort among pregnant women.Results: The study shows our local and national experience in treating COVID-19 in pregnancy and the maternal and neonatal impact of vaccination in nationwide scale. We treated our first COVID-19 pregnant patient on April 4th, 2020 reaching a total of 193 pregnant women, with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 by 8th March 2021. Several studies from Israel have evaluated pregnancy-related outcomes of COVID-19, be it maternal, obstetrical or neonatal complications. We suggest that only in a small subset of severely ill mothers, intubated and otherwise respiratory or hemodynamically unstable, an emergency cesarean delivery should be considered, factoring gestational age, in order to assist maternal ventilation and circulation, as well as to avoid possible secondary fetal compromise due the maternal deterioration.In addition, there is conflicting evidence as to the price of lockdown on obstetrical outcomes, i.e., not the direct medical impact of the virus, but rather the impact of the measures to contain its spread - mainly lockdowns, which has been a major tool in Israel to combat COVID-19.Finally, we demonstrate to overall safety and efficacy of vaccination pregnant women and the beneficial impact on pregnancy outcome and neonatal gain of protecting antibodies.Conclusion: The data emerging from Israel is overall reassuring, as for the association of COVID-19 with adverse pregnancy outcome and the possible protective effect of the vaccinations.

Several factors have been associated with severity of COVID-19 disease, but there remains a paucity of data surrounding whether the nature of exposure is impactful. Evidence demonstrating the correlation between initial viral exposure dose and disease severity exists for many viral infections. Observational studies have suggested that the exposure context, which can be considered a proxy for magnitude of viral inoculum, may influence severity of COVID-19 infection. We aimed to assess whether having a known exposure, as a proxy for higher inoculum dose to COVID-19, was associated with more severe outcomes for individuals hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods. We created a retrospective cohort of community-dwelling adults hospitalized for COVID-19 in south-central Ontario from April 1, 2020 - January 14, 2021. Individuals or next of kin were contacted to ascertain exposure history. The primary outcome was death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or mechanical ventilation (MV) within 30 days of admission. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine whether a known exposure was associated with worse outcomes. Results. 1097 individuals with community acquired COVID-19 required hospitalization;of these, 942 (86%) had available exposure data. In this group, the median age was 65, 44% were women, 84% lived in a private residence, 59% had a frailty score (FS) of 1 - 3 while 40% had a FS of 4 - 9, and 28% had a known exposure. Overall, the primary outcome occurred in 368/942 (39%) patients. Having a known exposure was not associated with worse outcome (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.84-1.54, p = 0.41). Male gender (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06-1.89;p = 0.018), age (OR 1.01/year, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, p = 0.03), frailty (OR 1.22/point, 95% CI 1.09-1.36, p = 0.001) and living with at least one other person (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.09-2.28, p = 0.017) were all associated with death, ICU admission, or MV within 30 days of admission. Conclusion. While having a known exposure to a person with COVID-19 was not associated with worse outcome, the identified increased severity of illness associated with cohabitation suggests context of exposure may have a role in disease severity. This data and future studies can be used to guide public health recommendations to not only minimize transmission, but severity of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Significance of a Known Epidemiological Link to a COVID-19 Index Case and Severity of COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The benefits of criterion-based laparoscopic training over time-oriented training are unclear. The purpose of this study is to compare these types of training based on training outcome and time efficiency. METHODS During four training sessions within 1 week (one session per day) 34 medical interns (no laparoscopic experience) practiced on two basic tasks on the Simbionix LAP Mentor virtual-reality (VR) simulator: 'clipping and grasping' and 'cutting'. Group C (criterion-based) (N = 17) trained to reach predefined criteria and stopped training in each session when these criteria were met, with a maximum training time of 1 h. Group T (time-based) (N = 17) trained for a fixed time of 1 h each session. Retention of skills was assessed 1 week after training. In addition, transferability of skills was established using the Haptica ProMIS augmented-reality simulator. RESULTS Both groups improved their performance significantly over the course of the training sessions (Wilcoxon signed ranks, P < 0.05). Both groups showed skill transferability and skill retention. When comparing the performance parameters of group C and group T, their performances in the first, the last and the retention training sessions did not differ significantly (Mann-Whitney U test, P > 0.05). The average number of repetitions needed to meet the criteria also did not differ between the groups. Overall, group C spent less time training on the simulator than did group T (74:48 and 120:10 min, respectively; P < 0.001). Group C performed significantly fewer repetitions of each task, overall and in session 2, 3 and 4. CONCLUSIONS Criterion-based training of basic laparoscopic skills can reduce the overall training time with no impact on training outcome, transferability or retention of skills. Criterion-based should be the training of choice in laparoscopic skills curricula.","output":"Criterion-based laparoscopic training reduces total training time."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess whether the role of neurologists in the emergency department changed during the coronavirus (COVID)-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data from an Italian national survey investigating the role of neurologists in the emergency room conducted in December 2020 were compared with those of the same survey of the previous year. These surveys involved a questionnaire being completed filled in for patients who received a neurological consultation following a visit to the emergency room. Information gathered included demographic characteristics, triage level according to both the emergency physician and neurologist, reason for the consultation, neurological evaluation, and discharge mode. RESULTS: In both years, approximately half of the patients were women, and the median age was 61 years. More patients in 2020 arrived by ambulance and had a greater need for assistance based on triage level than in 2019. During 2020, the proportion of consultancy requests judged by the neurologist was higher than that in 2019 (77% vs. 73%). Moreover, in 2020, fewer patients required consultation for headache, muscle pain, fever, and neurological signs, whereas coma was more prevalent. The diagnosis of ischemic stroke was the most prevalent in both years, followed by transient ischemic attack. In 2020, the status epilepticus increased and discopathy decreased. CONCLUSION: This study showed the significant role played by neurologists in emergency activities, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlighted the differences in patients admitted between the year of the epidemic and the year previous.","output":"Did the role of the neurologist in the emergency department change during the COVID-19 pandemic?

However, the data of predicting clinical outcome after thrombectomy with Solitaire retriever were limited. We attempt to identify prognostic factors of clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing thrombectomy with Solitaire retriever. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive acute ischemic strokes cases treated between December 2010 and December2013 where the Solitaire stent retriever was used for acute ischemic stroke. We assessed the effect of selected demographic characteristics, clinical factors on poor outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin score 3-6), mortality at 3 months, and hemorrhage within 24 h (symptomatic and asymptomatic). Clinical, imaging and logistic variables were analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables influencing clinical outcome, based on discharge NIHSS score change and mRS at 3 months. RESULTS Eighty nine consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke underwent mechanical thrombectomy. Multivariate analysis revealed that admission NIHSS score, Serum glucose and endovascular procedure duration were independently associated with clinical outcome. Sex, NIHSS score at admission, diabetes and time of operation were associated with sICH in 1 day. NIHSS score 20 (OR 9.38; 95% CI 2.41-36.50), onset to reperfusion >5 hours (OR 5.23; 95% CI1.34,20.41) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR 10.19; 95% CI1.80,57.83) were potential predictive factors of mortality at 3 months.

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 children with different severities and allergic status. METHODS: Data extracted from the electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results, and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID-19 children, were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male-female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground-glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without pneumonia (manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. There were no differences in treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing, and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID-19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with COVID-19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and asthma. Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B, and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels, and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subset numbers, and serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID-19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and nonallergic COVID-19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, and laboratory and immunological findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for developing and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hardly influenced the disease course of COVID-19 in children.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 182 pediatric COVID-19 patients with different severities and allergic status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Telephone-based telemedicine was temporarily permitted in Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to assess satisfaction with the telemedicine done during temporary hospital closing when in-person visits were not allowed due to in-hospital COVID-19 transmission. Methods: Survey questionnaires partially taken from a telehealth usability questionnaire (TUQ) were sent to 6,840 patients who used telephone-based telemedicine from February 24 to March 7, 2020. Questionnaires sent to patients and additionally created questionnaires to evaluate telemedicine were sent to medical staff (182 doctors and 138 nurses). Results: Response rates of patients and medical staff were 13.2% and 17.2%, respectively. Patients' satisfaction with telemedicine was significantly greater than medical staff's satisfaction for all five components taken from TUQ (all p = 0.000). In addition, created questionnaires showed good reliability, obtaining similar results between doctors and nurses (all p > 0.05). More than 85% of medical staff replied that telemedicine was needed in COVID-19, whereas more than 80% of them worried about incomplete assessment and communication of medical condition. Overall satisfaction with telemedicine by medical staff was 49.7%. The strength of telephone-based telemedicine was patients' convenience (53.4%). However, incomplete assessment of patients' condition (55.0%) was its weakness. Conclusion: Satisfaction with telephone-based telemedicine by patients was significantly greater than that by medical staff (doctors and nurses). Negative views for safety and inconvenience resulted in a greater proportion of dissatisfaction among medical staff.

It plays a central role in the cell under normal physiological conditions as well as during viral infections. On the one hand, the UPS can be used by the cell to degrade viral proteins, thereby restricting the viral infection. On the other hand, it can also be subverted by the virus to its own advantage, notably to induce degradation of cellular restriction factors. This makes the UPS a central player in viral restriction and counter-restriction. In this respect, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and 2) represent excellent examples. Indeed, many steps of the HIV life cycle are restricted by cellular proteins, some of which are themselves components of the UPS. However, HIV itself hijacks the UPS to mediate defense against several cellular restriction factors. For example, the HIV auxiliary proteins Vif, Vpx and Vpu counteract specific restriction factors by the recruitment of cellular UPS components.

This epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths, as of January 31, 2020. The World Health Organization declared it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Methods: : A scoping review of 65 research articles published until January 31, 2020 were analyzed and discussed for a better understanding of the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, publishing dates, journal language, and authors affiliations, as well as methodological characteristics were analyzed. All findings and statements that are mentioned regarding the outbreak in this review are based on published information as listed in the references. Results: : Most of the publications were in English language (89.23%). The largest proportion of articles were related to causes (38.46%) and majority (67.69%), and were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes while there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control over time. Studies thus far have shown origination in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal association has not been confirmed. The reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines are being discussed for reducing the transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment is proven effective, hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Conclusions: : There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies had relevance to the control of a public emergency, more high-quality research need to be conducted to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both short-and long-terms.","output":"A scoping review of 2019 Novel Coronavirus during the early outbreak period: Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Primary liver cancer (PLC) is a fatal disease that affects millions of lives worldwide.

Eligible studies included participants with or without PCOS diagnosed according to the 2003 Rotterdam or the 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria. We included studies that were published from the year 1990 to 2021 with data on cardiometabolic outcomes as per the PCOS core outcomes set. RESULTS There were 31 longitudinal studies with 28,316 participants from four continents. At the start of follow up, participants were aged between 1 year and 49 years with a follow-up period ranging from 2 to 32 years. Changes in BMI and the risk of coronary heart disease were similar in adult women with and without PCOS. Women with PCOS had a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes than their non-PCOS counterparts. Evidence for the majority of all other outcomes was conflicting and with inadequate data. CONCLUSION Understanding the natural history of PCOS and particularly changes in cardiometabolic features remains challenging. Existing literature is extensive but heterogeneous and inconsistent. Longitudinal studies in unselected populations are needed to provide high-quality data in this area.","output":"Natural history of polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review of cardiometabolic outcomes from longitudinal cohort studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Journalists have long covered outbreaks of infectious disease.

In this study, determination and discrimination of hand sanitisers was carried out by employing attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics. Fifty commercially available hand sanitisers were obtained from the market and analysed. ATR-FTIR profiles of each sanitiser were compared and decomposed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Physical observation enabled the discrimination of seven samples based on their respective colours, the presence of beads and their colours, and the physical forms of formulations. Subsequently, eight distinct patterns were observed through visual comparison of ATR-FTIR profiles of the remaining 43 samples. An initial unsupervised exploratory PCA model indicated the separation of two main groups with ATR-FTIR profiles similar to those of ethanol and isopropanol, respectively. The PCA score-LDA model provided good predictions, with a 100% correct classification into eight different groups.

The objectives of the study were: (i) to compare training and recovery conditions before and during the isolation period in handball players according to gender and competitive level, and (ii) to analyse the impact of psychological factors during the isolation period. A total of 187 participants (66 women and 121 men) answered a Google Forms questionnaire about demographics, training, moods, emotional intelligence, and resilience sent using the snowball sampling technique. T-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare sport level and gender differences. Linear regressions were used to analyse the psychological influence on training. Handball players reduced training intensity (in the whole sample; p = 0.44), training volume (especially in professional female handball players; p < 0.001), and sleep quality (especially in professional male handball players; p = 0.21) and increased sleep hours (especially in non-professional female players; p = 0.006) during the isolation period. Furthermore, psychological factors affected all evaluated training and recovery conditions during the quarantine, except for sleep quantity. Mood, emotional intelligence, and resilience have an influence on physical activity levels and recovery conditions.

We sought to investigate factors associated with the development of VAP in critically ill trauma patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of trauma patients admitted to our trauma intensive care unit between 2016 and 2018. Patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia were identified from the trauma database. Data collected from the trauma database included demographics (age, gender and race), mechanism of injury (blunt, penetrating), injury severity (injury severity score ISS), the presence of VAP, transfused blood products and presenting vital signs. RESULTS: A total of 1403 patients were admitted to the trauma intensive care unit (TICU) during the study period; of these, 45 had ventilator-associated pneumonia. Patients with VAP were older (p = 0.030), and they had a higher incidence of massive transfusion (p = 0.015) and received more packed cells in the first 24 h of admission (p = 0.028). They had a higher incidence of face injury (p = 0.001), injury to sternum (p = 0.011) and injury to spine (p = 0.024). Patients with VAP also had a higher incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (p < 0.001) and had a longer ICU (p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression models controlling for age and injury severity (ISS) showed massive transfusion (p = 0.017), AKI (p < 0.001), injury to face (p < 0.001), injury to sternum (p = 0.007), injury to spine (p = 0.047) and ICU length of stay (p < 0.001) to be independent predictors of VAP.

In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an involuntary delay in the surgical treatment of rotator cuff disease, creating a natural experiment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes and healing of patients who underwent delayed surgical treatment of chronic degenerative RCTs as compared with the nondelayed surgical treatment of RCTs. METHODS: This was a prospective study of two groups: patients planned to undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between March 16, 2020 and May 1, 2020the end of the ban on elective surgeryand patients who underwent rotator cuff repair starting six weeks after the ban on elective surgery had been lifted. Preoperatively and at six months postoperatively, we collected the Simple Shoulder Test, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and the visual analog scale for pain. We also obtained magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at six months postoperatively. A power analysis was conducted, and assuming a mean  standard deviation ASES score of 93.1  13.9 points and a minimum clinically important difference in the ASES score of 27.1 points, 7 patients per group (14 patients in total) would be necessary to have 90% chance of finding a difference. RESULTS: We included 15 patients within each group and obtained 100% follow-up at six months. In the delay group, the mean  standard deviation delay was 63  24 days. There were no significant preoperative differences between groups in demographics or tear characteristics. Intraoperatively, there were no differences between groups in repair characteristics. Using a repeated-measures analysis of variance, there were significant preoperative vs. postoperative differences in ASES scores (P < .001), visual analog scale scores (P < .001), and Simple Shoulder Test scores (P < .001), but no differences between groups (P = .910, .519, and 0.852, respectively). On MRI, within the delay group, 58% had healed, whereas within the control group, 85% had healed (P = .202). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 caused a two-month delay in the operative treatment of RCTs. This delay did not significantly alter patient-reported outcomes. This delay resulted in a 27% difference in MRI healing rates, which was not statistically significant in this small study. Larger studies should be conducted as our results suggest that a delay in treatment may negatively impact healing rates.","output":"COVID-19Crelated rotator cuff repair delay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND CONTEXT During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgeons found ways to provide appropriate care while conserving inpatient resources and limiting potential exposure. For patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD), spine surgery often requires extended LOS and non-routine discharge. Given resource limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic and caution regarding hospital stays, surgeons have modified standard postoperative protocols to minimize patient exposure. PURPOSE The primary aim of this study was to compare LOS and discharge disposition of ASD patients undergoing surgery before and during the pandemic. Secondary aims were to compare the rates of 30-day complications, readmissions, and ED visits. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Retrospective review of an institutional surgical registry. PATIENT SAMPLE A total of 117 patients with adult thoracolumbar deformity. OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome measures included LOS and discharge disposition (home vs non-home), as well as 30-day major complications, reoperations, readmissions and ED visits. METHODS We identified all patients who underwent elective thoracolumbar ASD surgery with 5 levels fusion at a tertiary care center during two distinct time intervals: Jul-Dec 2019 (Pre-COVID, N=60) and Jul-Dec 2020 (During-COVID, N=57). Outcome measures included LOS and discharge disposition (home vs non-home), as well as 30-day major complications, reoperations, readmissions, and ED visits. Regression analyses controlled for demographic and surgical factors. RESULTS Patients who underwent ASD surgery during the pandemic were younger (61 vs 67 years) and had longer fusion constructs (9 vs 8 levels) compared to before pandemic (p&lt;0.05 for both). On bivariate analysis, patients undergoing surgery during the pandemic had significantly lower LOS (6 vs 8 days) and were more likely to be discharged home (70% vs 28%) (p&lt;0.05 for both). After controlling for age and levels fused on multivariable regression, patients who had surgery during the pandemic continued to demonstrate a significantly lower LOS (IRR=0.83, p=0.015) and greater odds of home discharge (OR=7.2, p&lt;0.001). Notably, there were no significant differences in reoperations, readmissions, ED visits, or major complications between the two groups (p&gt;0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, the LOS for patients undergoing thoracolumbar ASD surgery decreased, and more patients were discharged home without adversely affecting complication or readmission rates. Lessons learned during the pandemic may help improve resource utilization without negatively influencing outcomes.

Few data are available evaluating an extended period of COVID-19 clinical progression. The RESPICOVID study has been designed to evaluate patients' pulmonary damage previously hospitalised for interstitial pneumonia due to COVID-19. We focused on the arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis variables due to the initial observation that some patients had hypocapnia (arterial partial carbon dioxide pressure-PaCO2 &#8804; 35 mmHg). Therefore, we aimed to characterise patients with hypocapnia compared to patients with normocapnia (PaCO2 > 35 mmHg).

Here, we review the recent development of trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) coupled to TOF mass analysis. In particular, the parallel accumulationCserial fragmentation (PASEF) operation mode offers unique advantages in terms of sequencing speed and sensitivity. Its defining feature is that it synchronizes the release of ions from the TIMS device with the downstream selection of precursors for fragmentation in a TIMS quadrupole TOF configuration. As ions are compressed into narrow ion mobility peaks, the number of peptide fragment ion spectra obtained in data-dependent or targeted analyses can be increased by an order of magnitude without compromising sensitivity. Taking advantage of the correlation between ion mobility and mass, the PASEF principle also multiplies the efficiency of data-independent acquisition. This makes the technology well suited for rapid proteome profiling, an increasingly important attribute in clinical proteomics, as well as for ultrasensitive measurements down to single cells. The speed and accuracy of TIMS and PASEF also enable precise measurements of collisional cross section values at the scale of more than a million data points and the development of neural networks capable of predicting them based only on peptide sequences. Peptide collisional cross section values can differ for isobaric sequences or positional isomers of post-translational modifications. This additional information may be leveraged in real time to direct data acquisition or in postprocessing to increase confidence in peptide identifications.

Specifically, knockdown of VPS4 (encoding vacuolar protein sorting 4), ALIX (encoding ALG-2-interacting protein X), and TSG101 (encoding tumor susceptibility 101) indicated that BFV uses ESCRT for budding. Mutational analysis of BFV Gag (BGag) showed that, in contrast to the classical L domain motifs, BGag contains two motifs, P56LPI and Y103GPL, with L domain functions. In addition, the two L domains are necessary for the cytoplasmic localization of BGag, which is important for effective budding. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the functional site of Alix is V498 in the V domain and the functional site of Tsg101 is N69 in the UBC-like domain for BFV budding.

Further detailed investigations in clinically relevant sepsis models are necessary.","output":"Effect of the Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 Polymorphism rs951818 on Mortality and Disease Progression in Patients with SepsisA Prospective Genetic Association Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Polls in the US and France found a concerning share of respondents (50% and 26%, respectively) stating that they are not committed to receiving or simply saying they would not accept vaccination against SARS-CoV-2[1][2]. In this context, it is worth revisiting machine-learning approaches to predicting vaccine hesitancy - such as the one developed for MMR vaccination at the individual level by Bell et al.[4] amid Europe's recent measles epidemic - as a first step of a proactive policy.

The compartmental and spatial models so far proposed use parametric descriptions of the contact rate, often assuming a time-invariant effect of the lockdown. In this paper we show that these assumptions may lead to erroneous evaluations on the ongoing pandemic. Thus, we develop a new class of nonparametric compartmental models able to describe how the impact of the lockdown varies in time. Exploiting regularization theory, hospitalized data are mapped into an infinite-dimensional space, hence obtaining a function which takes into account also how social distancing measures and people's growing awareness of infection's risk evolves as time progresses. This permits to reconstruct a continuous-time profile of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number with a resolution never reached before. When applied to data collected in Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, our model illustrates how people behaviour changed during the restrictions and its importance to contain the epidemic. Results also indicate that, at the end of the lockdown, around 12% of people in Lombardy and 5% in Italy was affected by SARS-CoV-2. Then, we discuss how the situation evolved after the end of the lockdown showing that the reproduction number is dangerously increasing in the last weeks due to holiday relax especially in the younger population and increased migrants arrival, reaching values larger than one on August 1, 2020. Since several countries still observe a growing epidemic, including Italy, and all could be subject to a second wave after the summer, the proposed reproduction number tracking methodology can be of great help to health care authorities to prevent another SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions to contain the spread.","output":"Tracking the time course of reproduction number and lockdown's effect during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic: nonparametric estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In many enterprises and the private sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) has spread globally. The growing number of different devices connected to the IoT and their various protocols have contributed to the increasing number of attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) and remote-to-local (R2L) ones. There are several approaches and techniques that can be used to construct attack detection models, such as machine learning, data mining, and statistical analysis. Nowadays, this technique is commonly used because it can provide precise analysis and results. Therefore, we decided to study the previous literature on the detection of IoT attacks and machine learning in order to understand the process of creating detection models. We also evaluated various datasets used for the models, IoT attack types, independent variables used for the models, evaluation metrics for assessment of models, and monitoring infrastructure using DevSecOps pipelines. We found 49 primary studies, and the detection models were developed using seven different types of machine learning techniques. Most primary studies used IoT device testbed datasets, and others used public datasets such as NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. When it comes to measuring the efficiency of models, both numerical and graphical measures are commonly used. Most IoT attacks occur at the network layer according to the literature. If the detection models applied DevSecOps pipelines in development processes for IoT devices, they were more secure. From the results of this paper, we found that machine learning techniques can detect IoT attacks, but there are a few issues in the design of detection models. We also recommend the continued use of hybrid frameworks for the improved detection of IoT attacks, advanced monitoring infrastructure configurations using methods based on software pipelines, and the use of machine learning techniques for advanced supervision and monitoring.","output":"Monitoring Real Time Security Attacks for IoT Systems Using DevSecOps: A Systematic Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mandatory vaccination, including for COVID-19, can be ethically justified if the threat to public health is grave, the confidence in safety and effectiveness is high, the expected utility of mandatory vaccination is greater than the alternatives, and the penalties or costs for non-compliance are proportionate.

The intraoperative assessment of cerebral ischemia remains a technological challenge. OBJECTIVE As a novel approach, cortical tissue integrity was monitored using simultaneous measurements of regional capillary-venous cerebral blood flow (rvCBF), oxygen saturation (Srvo2), and hemoglobin amount (rvHb) during aneurysm surgery. METHODS Fifteen patients scheduled for aneurysm surgery of the anterior and posterior circulation were included. A fiber optic probe was placed on the cortex associated with the distal branch of the aneurysmatic vessel. Blinded measurements by combined laser-Doppler flowmetry (rvCBF) and photospectrometry (Srvo2, rvHb) were performed before and after surgical clipping or trapping of the aneurysm. Data were correlated with postoperative imaging and neurological outcome. RESULTS Cortical measurements could be successfully performed in all patients. Significant increase (>25% change from baseline) or decrease (<25% change from baseline) of rvCBF, Srvo2, and rvHb was detectable in 33 to 46% of patients after surgical intervention. Severe decrease (>50% change from baseline) of all parameters or solitary of rvCBF was correlated to reduced cerebral perfusion and neurological deficits in 2 patients. CONCLUSION Combined laser-Doppler flowmetry and photospectrometry provides real-time information on cortical microcirculation.

The desire for fast access to vaccines triggered discussion of unrestricted access to research findings with the hope of facilitating the drug discovery process to combat COVID-19. Increasingly, abolition of the patent system is being discussed in connection with the fight against the pandemic. This may accelerate discovery of and increase access to medicines. However, society's desire for immediate disclosure of research findings conflicts with the inventor's legitimate interest to protect his or her invention as well as the need to recover investments made to develop the drug. The call for immediate disclosure of research results contradicts the interest of the inventor, whose primary goal is to secure his intellectual property rights, usually by applying for patent protection. In Europe, where patent law is based on the principle of absolute novelty, disclosure of the results reduces novelty and prevents subsequent patenting. Consequently, patenting remains the top priority for pharmaceutical companies in Europe, while disclosure of the results is secondary. The following article looks critically at the idea of using the grace period in European patent law to reconcile the conflicting interests of society and inventors in times of pandemic. In this paper, we investigate whether the implementation of a grace period in European patent law like that known in the USA, Japan, or Korea benefits the disclosure of results and increases the flow of information, ultimately leading to the promotion of innovation and rapid drug discovery.

METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal quantitative survey with 569 mothers with children <2y in December 2019 (in-person) and August 2020 (by phone). We measured HFI by using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and examined the changes in HFI during the pandemic using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. We then assessed child feeding practices and coping strategies by HFI status using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: HFI increased sharply from 21% to 80% before and during COVID-19, with 62% households changing the status from food security to insecurity and 17% remaining food insecure. Children belonging to newly and consistently food-insecure households were less likely to consume a diversified diet (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 0.56, P = 0.03 and AOR: 0.45, P = 0.04, respectively) compared to those in food-secure households. Households with food insecurity were more likely to engage in coping strategies for obtaining foods including reducing other essential non-food expenditures (AOR: 1.7C2.2), borrowing money to buy food (AOR: 3.6C4.3), selling jewelry (AOR: 3.0C5.0), and spending savings or selling other assets (AOR2.0), all P < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on HFI, which in turn had implications for child feeding practices and coping strategies. Our findings highlighted the need for further investment in targeted social protection strategies and safety nets as part of multisectoral solutions to improve HFI during and post-COVID-19.

Importantly, selective vascular lesions provide an opportunity to investigate the key neuropsychological features of reduced self-awareness in neurocognitive disorders. Because of its rarity, we present an unusual case of a woman affected by a combined polar and paramedian bilateral thalamic infarction. The patient underwent an extensive neuropsychological evaluation to assess cognitive, behavioral, and functional domains, with a focus on executive functions. She was assessed clinically in the acute phase and after 6 months from the stroke, both clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient developed a cognitive impairment, characterised by prevalent executive dysfunction associated with reduced self-awareness and mood changes, in terms of apathy and depression. Such condition persisted after 6 months. In May 2020, the patient underwent the serology test in chemiluminescence to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The result of the quantitative test highlighted a high probability of previous contact with the virus. We suggest that reduced self-awareness related to executive dysfunction and behavioral changes may be due to combined polar and paramedian bilateral thalamic lesion.

However, there is a dearth of studies on the psychological resilience in residents. AIMS: This study aims to measure the psychological resilience of Chinese residents to reflect their psychological status as well as influencing factors during the pandemic. METHOD: We conducted a combination of stratified sampling and snowball sampling to select survey subjects. We employed the psychological resilience and influencing factor questionnaire based on the 10-item Connor and Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10) for survey. We collected data from 3,398 residents in China between 31 January and 29 February 2020. Multivariable linear stepwise regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with psychological resilience in residents. RESULTS: The mean score of psychological resilience among Chinese residents was 27.11  8.45 (SD = 7.98). There were some factors significantly associated with psychological status among the Chinese residents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Residents with lower financial status, living in rural areas, unmarried, lacking fixed employment or retirement guarantees, and lacking knowledge of policies were more likely to report a lower level of psychological resilience. CONCLUSION: Health service policy makers in many countries should adopt relevant measures to improve the psychological resilience of residents during the pandemic. This includes short-term aggressive treatment, strengthening health education, and improving the awareness of residents with respect to emergency health policies. In addition, the financial status, health levels, and risk management capabilities of residents should be increased over the long term.","output":"Current status and associated factors of psychological resilience among the Chinese residents during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter focuses on the concept of governing through contagion.

In both debates the choice of government debt anchor and the speed of adjustment take centre stage. The debt rule appears predestined to fulfil the role of debt anchor. However, our analysis shows that its existing design gives rise to a pro-cyclical bias that has hampered its implementation in a low-growth and inflation environment. We propose two parametric changes to better balance the objectives of macroeconomic stabilisation and debt sustainability: first, accounting for persistent deviations of inflation from the central banks target;and, second, a reduced speed of adjustment.

By applying an active-data-mining approach, employing a mean-field kinetic model and a statistical approach of Bayesian data assimilation, we demonstrate here a fast decoding to extract key properties in the kinetics of complicated electrode processes from current-potential profiles in experimental and literary data. As the proof-of-concept, kinetic parameters on the four-electron oxygen reduction reaction in the 0.1 M HClO4 solution (ORR: O2 + 4e- + 4H+ a 2H2O) of various platinum-based single-crystal electrocatalysts are extracted from our own experiments and third-party literature to investigate the microscopic electrode processes. Furthermore, data assimilation of the mean-field ORR model and experimental data is performed based on Bayesian inference for the inductive estimation of kinetic parameters, which sheds light on the dynamic behavior of kinetic parameters with respect to overpotential. This work shows that a fast-decoding algorithm based on a mean-field kinetic model and Bayesian data assimilation is a promising data-driven approach to extract key microscopic features of complicated electrode processes and therefore will be an important method toward building up advanced human-machine collaborations for the efficient search and discovery of high-performance electrochemical materials.","output":"Fast-Decoding Algorithm for Electrode Processes at Electrified Interfaces by Mean-Field Kinetic Model and Bayesian Data Assimilation: An Active-Data-Mining Approach for the Efficient Search and Discovery of Electrocatalysts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using as a template the crystal structure of COVID-19 protease, we developed a pharmacophore of functional centers of the protease inhibitor-binding pocket Then we conducted data mining of the conformational database of FDA-approved drugs This search brought 64 compounds that can be potential inhibitors of COVID-19 protease The conformations of these compounds undergone 3D fingerprint similarity clusterization Then we conducted docking of possible conformers of these drugs to the binding pocket of protease We also conducted the same docking of random compounds Free energies of the docking interaction for the selected compounds were clearly lower than random compounds Three of the selected compounds were carfilzomib, cyclosporine A, and azithromycinathe drugs that already are tested for COVID-19 treatment Among the selected compounds are two HIV protease inhibitors and two hepatitis C protease inhibitors We recommend testing of the selected compounds for treatment of COVID-19 br br","output":"Potential COVID-19 Protease Inhibitors: Repurposing FDAapproved Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been linked to thromboembolic complications Priapism has been reported only once in link to SARS-CoV2 Here we report the second case of priapism in a patient with SARS-CoV2;our case is unique in being that the patient had priapism for 10 days while being hospitalized We discuss potential causes and possible prevention strategies The patient was managed by aspiration and Phenylephrine injection and achieved detumescence and reported normal erection at 2 weeks follow-up","output":"Priapism for 10 days in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Malaysian Society of Wound Care Professionals sets out its bid for the WUWHS 2026 Congress to be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.","output":"Bid from the Malaysian Society of Wound Care Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim: To define peculiarities of the medical students and medical PhD students' distance learning, basing on the academic performance and survey results.

Furthermore, mobile applications which accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We considered two approaches to assessing COVID-19 - a symptom-based approach, and a physiological signs based technique. Firstly, we trained a Logistic Regression classifier to predict the need for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients given the symptoms experienced, age, sex, and BMI. Secondly, we trained a neural network classifier to predict whether a person is sick on any specific day given respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability data for that day and and for the four preceding days. Data on 1,181 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 - July 14, 2020. 11.0% of COVID-19 subjects were asymptomatic, 47.2% of subjects recovered at home by themselves, 33.2% recovered at home with the help of someone else, 8.16% of subjects required hospitalization without ventilation support, and 0.448% required ventilation. Fever was present in 54.8% of subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.05 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.03 for the prediction of illness on a specific day with 4 previous days of history.

We report a case series of primary GJT placement using a combined laparoscopic-endoscopic approach. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent a combined laparoscopic-endoscopic primary GJT placement. Patients' demographics and relevant clinical information were analyzed. RESULTS Six patients (4 male, 2 female) were identified. The median age at the time of operation was 30.2 months (range, 28 days-10 years). Five GJTs were successfully placed laparoscopically/endoscopically, and one procedure was converted to open. The mean operative time was 84 minutes (range, 63-102 minutes). Postoperative abdominal radiography confirmed post-pyloric tube position in all patients.

Amino acid sequence comparisons of these proteins revealed a vast superfamily containing a conserved sequence motif that may comprise a hydrophobic interaction domain. This superfamily combines proteins of viruses belonging to all principal groups of positive-strand RNA viruses, as well as single-stranded DNA containing geminiviruses, double-stranded DNA-containing pararetroviruses (caulimoviruses and badnaviruses), and tospoviruses that have negative-strand RNA genomes with two ambisense segments. In several groups of positive-strand RNA viruses, the movement function is provided by the proteins encoded by the so-called triple gene block including two putative small membrane-associated proteins and a putative RNA helicase. A distinct type of movement proteins with very high content of proline is found in tymoviruses. It is concluded that classification of movement proteins based on comparison of their amino acid sequences does not correlate with the type of genome nucleic acid or with grouping of viruses based on phylogenetic analysis of replicative proteins or with the virus host range. Recombination between unrelated or distantly related viruses could have played a major role in the evolution of the movement function. Limited sequence similarities were observed between i) movement proteins of dianthoviruses and the MIP family of cellular integral membrane proteins, and ii) between movement proteins of bromoviruses and cucumoviruses and M1 protein of influenza viruses which is involved in nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins.

BMSCs were isolated from Wistar rats, and were infected with Hif-1-GFP lentiviral vector or Hif-1 siRNA. The modified BMSCs were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) condition, cellular viability and apoptosis were then assessed. An inhibitor of AMPK (compound C) was used to detect whether AMPK and mTOR were implicated in the functions of Hif-1 on BMSCs survival. Besides, ultrastructure of BMSCs was observed and the expression of autophagy markers was measured. The modified BMSCs were transplanted into middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of rats, and the cerebral infarction volume and neurological function was assessed. The results indicated that Hif-1 overexpression protected OGD induced injury by promoting cellular viability and inhibiting apoptosis. AMPK was activated while mTOR was inactivated by Hif-1 overexpression, and that might be through which Hif-1 functioned BMSCs survival. Hif-1 overexpression promoted autophagy; more important, compound C abolished the induction of Hif-1 on autophagy.

Targeted Learning is driven by complex problems in data science and has been implemented in a diversity of real-world scenarios: observational studies with missing treatments and outcomes, personalized interventions, longitudinal settings with time-varying treatment regimes, survival analysis, adaptive randomized trials, mediation analysis, and networks of connected subjects. In contrast to the (mis)application of restrictive modeling strategies that dominate the current practice of statistics, Targeted Learning establishes a principled standard for statistical estimation and inference (i.e., confidence intervals and p-values). This multiply robust approach is accompanied by a guiding roadmap and a burgeoning software ecosystem, both of which provide guidance on the construction of estimators optimized to best answer the motivating question. The roadmap of Targeted Learning emphasizes tailoring statistical procedures so as to minimize their assumptions, carefully grounding them only in the scientific knowledge available. The end result is a framework that honestly reflects the uncertainty in both the background knowledge and the available data in order to draw reliable conclusions from statistical analyses - ultimately enhancing the reproducibility and rigor of scientific findings.","output":"Targeting Learning: Robust Statistics for Reproducible Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The necessity of e-signature has been accepting by all organizations like finance, education, business. With the effect of this, the popularity has been increasing day by day especially uncertainty times such as the Covid-19 pandemic.

Aim To explore perceptions and psychosocial experiences of frontline staff providing care at UDCs in England during COVID-19. Method A qualitative research study using a phenomenological approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted remotely. Using line-by-line coding, data were analysed using a hybrid approach that incorporated both a deductive, theoretical process and an inductive, data-driven process. Results Participants included 29 dentists and nine dental nurses from UDCs across England. Twelve themes were identified and grouped into positive and negative experiences. Positive experiences were: role fulfilment and having a sense of purpose; team unity and collective coping strategies; and strategic teamwork and preparedness for effective organisation of care. Negative experiences included: feeling undervalued and frustrated due to fragmented guidance and communication; sense of unfairness generated by relational challenges; patient demand outstripping UDC capacity; complex decision-making; uncertainty over safety; suffocating PPE hindering effective communication; ineffective communication channels across healthcare sectors; lack of commitment to remote video consultations; and variable referral quality. Conclusions Participants reported experiencing a number of emotional challenges that appeared to be exacerbated by an unsupportive environment, often due to lack of leadership. However, positive experiences and coping strategies were also identified. Collective and sustained efforts at system level to improve the resilience and mental wellbeing of the current and future dental workforce and integration of dentistry into wider healthcare infrastructures are needed.

The COVID-19 pandemic affected older patients with co-morbidities both directly due to more severe infection and indirectly by affecting care provision. To promote continuity of care, public health professionals require tools to quickly and precisely coordinate with primary care providers. This study evaluated whether digital interventions powered by current existing infrastructure are more effective than conventional interventions in promoting primary care appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : We developed a digital intervention delivered by secure messaging and compared it to a post delivered intervention to promote continuity of care for vulnerable veterans during COVID-19 in a real world, non-randomised, interventional study. The study was implemented as part of the Veterans MATES program, an Australian Government Department of Veterans Affairs program to promote improvements in health care for veterans. The intervention provided patient specific information to general practitioners (GPs) to support continuity of care, alongside mailed education to veterans. The intervention key messages were to maintain regular contact with care providers and to continue to adhere to health plans. The intervention took place in April 2020, during the first weeks of COVID-19 social distancing rules in Australia. The main outcome was time to first appointment with the primary general practitioner (GP) measured using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: : GPs received digital messaging for 51,052 veterans and post messaging for 26,859 veterans. The proportion of patients seeing their primary GP during the three months following intervention was higher in the digital group (77.8%) than the post group (61.5%) (p<0.01). Being in the digital group was associated with earlier appointments.

Interestingly, a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19, also develop ARDS. In the absence of effective treatments, ARDS results in almost 40% mortality. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that resveratrol (RES), a stilbenoid, with potent anti-inflammatory properties can attenuate SEB-induced ARDS. In the current study, we investigated the role of RES-induced alterations in the gut and lung microbiota in the regulation of ARDS. Our studies revealed that SEB administration induced inflammatory cytokines, ARDS, and 100% mortality in C3H/HeJ mice. Additionally, SEB caused a significant increase in pathogenic Proteobacteria phylum and Propionibacterium acnes species in the lungs. In contrast, RES treatment attenuated SEB-mediated ARDS and mortality in mice, and significantly increased probiotic Actinobacteria phylum, Tenericutes phylum, and Lactobacillus reuteri species in both the colon and lungs. Colonic Microbiota Transplantation (CMT) from SEB-injected mice that were treated with RES as well as the transfer of L. reuteri into recipient mice inhibited the production of SEB-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-?3 and IL-17 but increased that of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Additionally, such CMT and L. reuteri recipient mice exposed to SEB, showed a decrease in lung-infiltrating mononuclear cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, Th1 cells, and Th17 cells, but an increase in the population of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th3 cells, and increase in the survival of mice from SEB-mediated ARDS. Together, the current study demonstrates that ARDS induced by SEB triggers dysbiosis in the lungs and gut and that attenuation of ARDS by RES may be mediated, at least in part, by alterations in microbiota in the lungs and the gut, especially through the induction of beneficial bacteria such as L. reuteri.","output":"Resveratrol-mediated attenuation of superantigen-driven acute respiratory distress syndrome is mediated by microbiota in the lungs and gut"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Models of disease spreading are critical for predicting infection growth in a population and evaluating public health policies. However, standard models typically represent the dynamics of disease transmission between individuals using macroscopic parameters that do not accurately represent person-to-person variability. To address this issue, we present a dynamic network model that provides a straightforward way to incorporate both disease transmission dynamics at the individual scale as well as the full spatiotemporal history of infection at the population scale. We find that disease spreads through a social network as a traveling wave of infection, followed by a traveling wave of recovery, with the onset and dynamics of spreading determined by the interplay between disease transmission and recovery. We use these insights to develop a scaling theory that predicts the dynamics of infection for diverse diseases and populations. Furthermore, we show how spatial heterogeneities in susceptibility to infection can either exacerbate or quell the spread of disease, depending on its infectivity. Ultimately, our dynamic network approach provides a simple way to model disease spreading that unifies previous findings and can be generalized to diverse diseases, containment strategies, seasonal conditions, and community structures.","output":"Infection percolation: A dynamic network model of disease spreading"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to evaluate lifestyle factors among Information Technology (IT) workers from Romania before and during the pandemic.

In this article, we provide an overview of the extent to which states violated democratic standards in their response to Covid-19 during 2020. We find no relationship between violations of democratic standards and reported Covid-19 mortality. Illiberal and authoritarian practices in response to the Covid-19 pandemic do not correlate with better public health outcomes. Rather, such crisis-driven violations should be carefully observed as they could signal autocratization.","output":"Pandemic backsliding: Violations of democratic standards during Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pandemic of misinformation is said to spread alongside the COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries imposed lockdowns, which were followed by a reduction in care utilization. The aims of this study were to quantify the effects of lockdown on pediatric care in the Netherlands, to elucidate the cause of the observed reduction in pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions, and to summarize the literature regarding the effects of lockdown on pediatric care worldwide. ED visits and hospital admission data of 8 general hospitals in the Netherlands between January 2016 and June 2020 were summarized per diagnosis group (communicable infections, noncommunicable infections, (probable) infection-related, and noninfectious). The effects of lockdown were quantified with a linear mixed effects model. A literature review regarding the effect of lockdowns on pediatric clinical care was performed. In total, 126,198 ED visits and 47,648 admissions were registered in the study period. The estimated reduction in general pediatric care was 59% and 56% for ED visits and admissions, respectively. The largest reduction was observed for communicable infections (ED visits: 76%; admissions: 77%), whereas the reduction in noninfectious diagnoses was smaller (ED visits 36%; admissions: 37%). Similar reductions were reported worldwide, with decreases of 30-89% for ED visits and 19-73% for admissions.Conclusion: Pediatric ED utilization and hospitalization during lockdown were decreased in the Netherlands and other countries, which can largely be attributed to a decrease in communicable infectious diseases. Care utilization for other conditions was decreased as well, which may indicate that care avoidance during a pandemic is significant. What is Known: a? The COVID-19 pandemic had enormous impact on society. a? Countries imposed lockdowns to curb transmission rates, which were followed by a reduction in care utilization worldwide. What is New: a? The Dutch lockdown caused a significant decrease in pediatric ED utilization and hospitalization, especially in ED visits and hospital admissions because of infections that were not caused by SARS-CoV-2. a? Care utilization for noninfectious diagnoses was decreased as well, which may indicate that pediatric care avoidance during a pandemic is significant.","output":"The impact of lockdown on pediatric ED visits and hospital admissions during the COVID19 pandemic: a multicenter analysis and review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Countries across the world are in different stages of COVID-19 trajectory, among which many have implemented lockdown measures to prevent its spread. Although the lockdown is effective in such prevention, it may put the economy into a depression. Predicting the epidemic progression with the government switching the lockdown on or off is critical. We propose a transfer learning approach called ALeRT-COVID using attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to predict the epidemic trends for different countries. A source model was trained on the pre-defined source countries and then transferred to each target country. The lockdown measure was introduced to our model as a predictor and the attention mechanism was utilized to learn the different contributions of the confirmed cases in the past days to the future trend. Results demonstrated that the transfer learning strategy is helpful especially for early-stage countries. By introducing the lockdown predictor and the attention mechanism, ALeRT-COVID showed a significant improvement in the prediction performance. We predicted the confirmed cases in 1 week when extending and easing lockdown separately. Our results show that lockdown measures are still necessary for several countries.

Mental health assessment was completed by self-rating and professional evaluation. The gaps between self-rating and professional evaluation in different demographic characteristics were compared. Results: The results of self-rating were inconsistent with those of professional evaluation. The gap was statistically different among certain demographic subgroups. As for anxiety, the gaps had remarkable statistics differences in subgroups of sex, monthly income, infection way, and anxiety/depression medical history. Similarly, in the terms of depression, the gaps had significant statistic differences in the subgroups of the medical history of anxiety/depression, history of physical disease, employment status and the insurance type, marriage, education (year), residing in Beijing (year), and the monthly income. Conclusion: Compared to the professional evaluation, patients had a higher self-rating, which may be related to some demographic characteristics.

Objective We explored how the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated changes in clinical and educational experiences, were related to internal medicine residents' well-being in the early months of the pandemic. Methods Across 4 internal medicine residency programs in the Northeast United States that have previously participated in the iCOMPARE study, all 394 residents were invited to participate in a study with open-ended survey prompts about well-being approximately every 2 weeks in academic year 2019-2020. In March and April 2020, survey prompts were refocused to COVID-19. Content analysis revealed themes in residents' open-ended responses to 4 prompts. Results One hundred and eighty-six residents expressed interest, and 88 were randomly selected (47%). There were 4 main themes: (1) in early days of the pandemic, internal medicine residents reported fear and anxiety about uncertainty and lack of personal protective equipment; (2) residents adapted and soon were able to reflect, rest, and pursue personal wellness; (3) communication from programs and health systems was inconsistent early in the pandemic but improved in clarity and frequency; (4) residents appreciated the changes programs had made, including shorter shifts, removal of pre-rounding, and telemedicine.

This study was performed in the surgical department of COVID hospital on the basis of the Clinical Hospital No. 4 of the First Moscow State Medical University named I.M. Sechenov (Sechenov University). During the period from April 2020 to February 2021, 32 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and the presence of venous trophic ulcers (VTU) of the lower extremities were treated. All patients underwent complex therapy for viral pneumonia in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The protease inhibitor Aprotinin (Gordox ?) was used to improve microcirculation and prevent the development of a \\"cytokine storm\\". To accelerate the cleansing and epithelialization of venous trophic ulcers, the surface of the trophic ulcer was treated with an air plasma flow of NO and injections into the trophic ulcer of autoplasma. Against the background of complex treatment, all patients showed positive dynamics of the clinical picture: relief of hyperthermia, increase or stabilization of SpO2 values from 95% and above, significant decrease in CRP, LDH, D-dimer indices, increase in the number of lymphocytes, decrease in the VTU area by 1.5 times, active granulation and marginal epithelialization of the ulcer. In 14 patients (43.8%), complete epithelialization of the VTU defect was noted by the end of the third week. According to the CIVIQ-20 questionnaire, all 32 patients participating in the study showed positive dynamics. There were no lethal outcomes. Multicomponent therapy of decompensated forms of CVI of the lower extremities in the COVID hospital in patients with moderate severity of coronavirus infection with the use of proteolysis inhibitors leads to a rapid relief of symptoms of intoxication, prevents the progression of lung tissue and parenchymal organ damage and contributes to the positive dynamics of healing of ulcerative defects in the vast majority of patients.","output":"[COMPLEX TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH VENOUS TROPHIC ULCER IN THE CONDITIONS OF COVID-19 HOSPITAL]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To date, no cases have been reported on the effects of COVID-19 in laryngectomees.

The understanding of feeding preference of malaria vectors on different hosts is a major challenge for hindering the transmission cycle of malaria. In this study, blood meals taken by blood-fed Anopheles mosquitoes collected from the field in malaria endemic areas of Sudan were analysed for source of blood meal and malaria parasite presence. METHODS: Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from different regions in Sudan: Khartoum state, Sennar state, Northern state, and El Gedarif state between September 2020 and February 2021. Anopheles mosquitoes were collected using the standard pyrethrum spray catch and back-pack aspirator. Mosquito samples were sorted and morphologically identified to species level using international identification keys. Morphologically identified mosquito species were also confirmed using PCR. Genomic DNA was extracted from mosquitoes for molecular identification of blood meal source and parasite detection. The presence of Plasmodium species DNA in each mosquito sample was investigated using semi-nested PCR. Frequency of each blood meal source, Anopheles mosquito vector, and malaria parasite detected was calculated. Positivity rate of each fed female Anopheles mosquito was calculated for each species. RESULTS: A total of 2132 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected. 571 (26.8%) were males and 1561 (73.2%) were females classified based on their abdominal status into 1048 (67.1%) gravid, 274 (17.6%) fed, and 239 (15.3%) unfed females. Among the blood fed Anopheles mosquitoes, 263 (96.0%) were morphologically identified and confirmed using PCR to Anopheles arabiensis, 9 (3.3%) to Anopheles stephensi, and 2 (0.7%) to Anopheles rufipes. Of 274 blood-fed An. arabiensis, 68 (25.9%) fed on mixed blood meals from human and cattle, 8 (3.0%) fed on cattle and goat, and 13 (4.8%) fed on human, cattle and goat. For single blood meal sources, 70 (26.6%) fed on human, 95 (36.1%) fed on cattle, 8 (3.0%) fed on goat, and 1 (0.4%) fed on dog. While An. rufipes and An. stephensi fed on dog (2; 0.75%) and cattle (9; 3.3%), respectively. Plasmodium parasite detection in the blood meals showed that 25/274 (9.1%) An. arabiensis meals were positive for Plasmodium vivax and 19/274 (6.9%) An. arabiensis meals were positive for Plasmodium falciparum. The rate of positivity of An. arabiensis with any Plasmodium species was 16.7%. However, the positivity rate with P. falciparum only was 7.2%, while P. vivax was 9.5%. Both An. rufipes and An. stephensi were having positivity rates of 0.0% each. CONCLUSIONS: This study which was mainly on blood-fed Anopheles mosquitoes showed a diversity in the type of diet from human, cattle, and goat. Anopheles mosquitoes especially An. arabiensis in Sudan, are opportunistic blood feeders and can feed broadly on both human and cattle. The application of blood meal identification is not only important in malaria vector epidemiological surveillance but also is very useful in areas where arthropods exhibit zoophilic feeding behaviour for mammals.","output":"Blood meal profile and positivity rate with malaria parasites among different malaria vectors in Sudan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the opportunities for irrigated agriculture in Khyber District of Former Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA). Agriculture continues to be most important economic activity in Pakistan and former FATA is no exception. However, agriculture in the semi-arid Khyber District continues to suffer a decline due to excessive reliance on rainfall, which is drastically insufficient. Khyber District have large expanses of fertile land; however, farmers depend on unpredictable rain-fed agriculture, which has low productivity and food insecurity. There are a number of rivers in the region where great prospects exist for irrigated farming. Geographical information systems (GIS)-based multi-criteria analysis can be used to map areas with irrigation potential. The current study focused on different variables including soil texture, perennial rivers, land cover, topography, and dams. For this study, data was collected from diverse sources which include Google earth images, top sheets, land use land cover, soil texture map of FATA, and SRTM 30 Meter. The collected data was analyzed by using multi-criteria analysis in Arc GIS 10.2.2 by using MIF technique. The results of this research indicate that there is great potential for irrigated farming in the study area. Potential land for this purpose were divided into three categories, i.e., highly suitable which consisted of 678 km2, or 26% of the total area; 1044 km2 representing 40% were moderately suitable to irrigation; while the remaining 698 km2 representing 27% were considered least suitable for irrigation. Likewise, 204 km2 representing 7% were deemed unsuitable for irrigated agriculture mostly consisting of barren rocks.

However, there is a clear gap in patient care after surgical patients are discharged from hospital, resulting in poorly controlled postoperative pain. Inadequate pain management after discharge can have detrimental effects on quality of life and lead to the development of chronic postsurgical pain. The severity of postoperative pain before discharge is well described, but less emphasis has been placed on assessing pain at home after hospital discharge. OBJECTIVE The objective of this review is to summarize the prevalence of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain within the first 1 to 14 days after hospital discharge. METHODS A detailed search of epidemiological studies investigating postoperative pain will be conducted on MEDLINE and EMBASE from their inception until the date the searches are run. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients reporting moderate-to-severe postoperative pain at rest and with movement within the first 1 to 14 days after hospital discharge. The secondary outcomes will include a comparison of postoperative pain after discharge between patients who underwent ambulatory and inpatient surgery, and adverse outcomes attributable to poor pain control after hospital discharge (eg, readmission to hospital, emergency room or other unplanned medical visits, or a decrease in quality of life). RESULTS The protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020194346). The search strategies for MEDLINE and EMBASE have been completed.

Twelve years after the great financial crisis of 2008-09, the issue of trade finance reemerged as a matter of urgency. While the current pandemic-related crisis did not have a financial cause, one of its results has been that many countries are experiencing difficulties in accessing trade credit. This is occurring notably in countries C particularly developing countries C in which structural trade finance gaps were high even before the pandemic. As the health crisis developed and persisted, banks experienced an increase in failures by traders to fulfil payments, including in industries and sectors beyond those initially impacted by lockdowns, such as airlines, aeronautics and tourism. It quickly became evident that one-off extensions of terms of payment by creditors would be insufficient to alleviate the trade finance crisis. Based on the experience of the 2008-09 crisis, governments, export credit agencies and international financial institutions, including multilateral development banks, rapidly intervened to support private markets.

Most (59.7%) had used kratom >100 times and reported currently or having previously used kratom >4 times per week (62 weeks on average). Under half (41.9%) reported that they considered themselves to be a current regular kratom user. A majority (79.8%) reported experiencing acute effects from their typical kratom dose and that onset of effects began in minutes but dissipated within hours. Over a quarter reported that they had increased their kratom dose since use initiation, whereas 18.6% had decreased. Greater severity of unwanted effects from 1 day of kratom cessation was predicted by more weeks of regular kratom use ( = 6.74, p = 0.02). Acute kratom effects were largely reported as compatible with, and sometimes helpful in, meeting daily obligations. In the absence of human laboratory studies, survey methods must be refined to more precisely assess dose-effect relationships. These can help inform the development of controlled observational and experimental studies needed to advance the public health understanding of kratom product use.","output":"Searching for a Signal: Self-Reported Kratom Dose-Effect Relationships Among a Sample of US Adults With Regular Kratom Use Histories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThroughout the COVID-19 Pandemic, it was recommended to implement mental health care services mediated by Information and Communication Technologies to alleviate the suffering caused by the social distance.ObjectivesTo characterize the demands and the possibilities of psychological support at the Call Center of a Brazilian public university, which aims clarifying doubts about COVID-19 and to forward suspected cases of contamination.MethodsCross-sectional, quantitative study with secondary data.

A triple-blind randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the effects of these medications on the COVID-19 progression. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in this trial between April and September 2020. They were randomized in two groups. The former dosage of ACEis/ARBs was continued in one group while in another group, the ACEis/ARBs were replaced by amlodipine  carvedilol according to the dose equivalents. The primary outcomes were length of stay in hospitals and intensive care units. Other outcomes include mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, readmission, and COVID-19 symptoms after discharge. RESULTS: We randomized 64 patients with COVID-19 into two groups. Most patients were aged 66-80 and 46-65 years-old, 33 (51.6%) and 27 (42.2%), respectively. The study groups were nearly similar in baseline vital signs and characteristics. In addition, there was no significant difference in terms of recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements between groups. Furthermore, we did not find a significant difference between the days of intensive care unit or ward admission, the discharge rate, or readmission rates between the two groups.

Colonized mice were treated intranasally over 7 days with ATA using a wide dose range (0.5C10%). Mupirocin completely eliminated the bacteria from the nose within three days of treatment. In contrast, even high concentrations of ATA failed to eradicate the bacteria.

The program was developed using cartoons and color-in materials and was based on the health promotion model developed by Nola J. Pender and brain-based learning theories (Pender, Murdaugh, & Parsons, 2015).Materials and Methods: The sample of the study consisted of 74 children between the ages of 7 and 11 who presented to the respiratory diseases' unit of a university hospital in Istanbul. All participants were given basic asthma education by their physicians, and were then randomly assigned to a group that received the HPPCA program or a control group that received no further education. After the HPPCA education was applied to the experimental group alone, both groups were administered two post-tests as a follow-up and retest at the end of the first and fourth month after the intervention. The standardized Sociodemographic Question Form, the Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) and the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) were used for the follow-up.Results: The asthma control and quality of life scores of the children included in the experimental group were found to be significantly higher compared to the control group at the first- and fourth-month follow-ups (p<.001). The rate of school absenteeism decreased significantly in children who received HPPCA education at the first follow-up compared to the children who did not receive the education (p<.05).Practice Implications: The present study found that the HPPCA education, whose design was based on the health promotion model, and which was supported by cartoons in order to attract the attention of the children, was effective. The HPPCA was proven to create a sense of control over asthma and to improve the quality of life in the children.

Gene expression can be controlled by different epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs. In addition, several environmental factors such as dietary components (vitamin D, butyrate, folic acid) are able to regulate this epigenetic mechanism. All these factors produce modifications in immune genes that could alter the development and function of immune cells, and therefore the etiology of the disease. Furthermore, these epigenetic mechanisms have also an influence on immunomodulation, which could explain sustained responsiveness or unresponsiveness during immunotherapy due to epigenetic modifications in key genes that induce tolerance in several FA.

METHODS: We applied supervised machine learning to electronic health records data available at the start coronavirus disease 2019 inpatients admissions at three hospitals to build an incident delirium predictive model. We validated this model in three different hospitals. Both hospital cohorts included academic and community settings. RESULTS: Among 2907 patients across 6 hospitals, 488 (16.8%) developed delirium. Applying the predictive model in the external validation cohort of 755 patients, the c-index was 0.75 (0.71C0.79) and the lift in the top quintile was 2.1.

The p38 MAPK pathway plays a crucial role in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and has been implicated in acute lung injury and myocardial dysfunction. The overwhelming inflammatory response in COVID-19 infection may be caused by disproportionately upregulated p38 activity, explained by two mechanisms. First, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity is lost during SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs and heart and converts Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1C7. Angiotensin II signals proinflammatory, pro-vasoconstrictive, pro-thrombotic activity through p38 MAPK activation, which is countered by Angiotensin 1C7 downregulation of p38 activity. Loss of ACE2 upon viral entry may tip the balance towards destructive p38 signaling through Angiotensin II. Second, SARS-CoV was previously shown to directly upregulate p38 activity via a viral protein, similar to other RNA respiratory viruses that may hijack p38 activity to promote replication. Given the homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the latter may employ a similar mechanism. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may induce overwhelming inflammation by directly activating p38 and downregulating a key inhibitory pathway, while simultaneously taking advantage of p38 activity to replicate. Therapeutic inhibition of p38 could therefore attenuate COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, a prior preclinical study showed protective effects of p38 inhibition in a SARS-CoV mouse model. A number of p38 inhibitors are in the clinical stage and should be considered for clinical trials in serious COVID-19 infection.","output":"p38 MAPK inhibition: A promising therapeutic approach for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Telehealth is the use of electronic technologies for communication, storage, and analysis of health-related information.

Before HBM education, there were no significant differences in the mean scores of psychological resilience (50.43  3.29 vs. 50.55  2.29, P = 0.738), psychological flexibility (48.98  3.45 vs. 49.29  3.59, P = 0.465), self-efficacy (26.49  5.26 vs. 26.29  6.41, P = 0.781), or rehabilitation training compliance (28.4% vs. 27.8%, P = 0.922) between the two groups. After HBM education, the scores of training compliance (80.6% vs. 30.1%, P < 0.001), psychological resilience (55.47  5.01 vs. 50.46  2.62, P < 0.001), psychological flexibility (56.53  4.51 vs. 49.13  3.62, P < 0.001), self-efficacy (30.79  4.56 vs. 26.41  6.37, P < 0.001), self-care knowledge (43.36  7.60 vs. 34.05  6.99, P < 0.001), self-concept (29.57  5.67 vs. 20.11  3.86, P < 0.001), self-care responsibility (27.54  5.09 vs. 20.86  4.53, P < 0.001), and self-care skills (34.51  5.62 vs. 21.62  5.64, P < 0.001) were higher in the HBM education group than those in the basic nursing group. Additionally, the incidence of LEDVT was lower in the HBM group than that in the basic nursing group (2.2% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.027).

DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING General and cardiothoracic ICU, tertiary hospital. PATIENTS Twenty-six postoperative patients. INTERVENTION Two hundred and fifty-milliliter fluid challenge performed over 5 minutes. Data were recorded over 10 minutes after the end of fluid infusion MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Cardiac output was measured with a calibrated LiDCOplus (LiDCO, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and Navigator (Applied Physiology, Sydney, Australia) to obtain the Pmsf analogue (Pmsa). Pharmacodynamics outcomes were modeled using a Bayesian inferential approach and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation methods. Parameter estimates were summarized as the means of their posterior distributions, and their uncertainty was assessed by the 95% credible intervals. Bayesian probabilities for groups' effect were also derived. The predicted maximal effect on cardiac output was observed at 1.2 minutes (95% credible interval, -0.6 to 2.8 min) in responders. The probability that the estimated area under the curve of central venous pressure was smaller in nonresponders was 0.12. (estimated difference, -4.91 mm Hgmin [95% credible interval, -13.45 to 3.3 mm Hg min]). After 10 minutes, there is no evidence of a difference between groups for any hemodynamic variable. CONCLUSIONS The maximal change in cardiac output should be assessed 1 minute after the end of the fluid infusion. The global effect of the fluid challenge on central venous pressure is greater in nonresponders, but not the change observed 10 minutes after the fluid infusion. The effect of a fluid challenge on hemodynamics is dissipated in 10 minutes similarly in both groups.","output":"Pharmacodynamic Analysis of a Fluid Challenge."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has become an evolving worldwide health crisis.

We investigated multiple commonly used disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Heating was recently found to inactivate the virus in solution within 5 min at 70 C and is among the most scalable, user-friendly methods for viral disinfection. We found that heat (&#8804;85 C) under various humidities (&#8804;100% relative humidity, RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. At 85 C, 30% RH, we were able to perform 50 cycles of heat treatment without significant changes in the filtration efficiency. At low humidity or dry conditions, temperatures up to 100 C were not found to alter the filtration efficiency significantly within 20 cycles of treatment. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice, which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can potentially impact the material strength and subsequent sealing of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach all may lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.","output":"Can N95 Respirators Be Reused after Disinfection?

The main objective of this study was to explore the epidemiological patterns of dengue since its first outbreak (2006) to 2019 in Nepal. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis that covers the last 14 years (2006C2019) of reported dengue cases from Epidemiology Diseases Control Division (EDCD), Ministry of Health and Population, Government of Nepal. Reported cases were plotted over time and maps of reported case incidence were generated (from 2016 through 2019). An ecological analysis of environmental predictors of case incidence was conducted using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: While endemic dengue has been reported in Nepal since 2006, the case load has increased over time and in 2019 a total of 17 992 dengue cases were reported from 68 districts (from all seven provinces). Compared to the case incidence in 2016, incidence was approximately five times higher in 2018 [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 4.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5C15.3] and over 140 times higher in 2019 (IRR: 141.6; 95% CI 45.8C438.4). A one standard deviation increase in elevation was associated with a 90% decrease in reported case incidence (IRR: 0.10; 95% CI 0.01C0.20). However, the association between elevation and reported cases varied across the years. In 2018 there was a cluster of cases reported from high elevation Kaski District of Gandaki Province. Our results suggest that dengue infections are increasing in magnitude and expanding out of the lowland areas to higher elevations over time. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high risk of dengue outbreak in the lowland Terai region, with increasing spread towards the mid-mountains and beyond as seen over the last 14 years. Urgent measures are required to increase the availability of diagnostics and resources to mitigate future dengue epidemics.

Methods: Newly diagnosed ILD patients (n = 60) were enrolled, whose serological levels of -CGRP, -CGRP, AQP5, receptor activity modifying protein 1, and receptor component protein were detected by ELISA. Th1 and Th2 cytokines and CD4+ and CD8+ cells were measured by flow cytometry method. In vivo, bleomycin (BLM) was set for modeling pulmonary fibrosis. A CALCA-HET model was set as a chronic pulmonary fibrosis model. Hematoxylin-eosin, immunohistochemistry, and Masson's trichrome staining were performed to assess the role of apoptosis in the injured lung. The concentrations of cytokines were determined by cytokine antibody arrays. Results: Abnormal activation of serological CD4+ T lymphocytes and predominant Th2 response was established in the patients with ILD. Moreover, the ratio of -CGRP/-CGRP positively correlated with the increased level of AQP5 in patients with ILD. In vivo, a significant increase of AQP5 and -CGRP at the chronic stage of pulmonary fibrosis was induced by BLM in the mice model, whereas the expression of AQP5 protein was generally lower in the acute alveolitis phase. Moreover, the levels of AQP5 and -CGRP in the CALCA-HET rats were lower than those of the normal saline group. The high ratio -CGRP/-CGRP enhanced the expression of AQP5, inhibited transforming growth factor-1 (TGF1)/P-Smad1/Smad4 pathway, and upregulated the NRF2 signal, whereas the apoptosis of AECs was significantly reduced in late-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusions: The imbalance of -CGRP/-CGRP may be associated with the predominance of Th2 response and participate in the process of AEC apoptosis in lung fibrosis. The high ratio of -CGRP/-CGRP may elevate the level of AQP5 through inactivation of the TGF-1/smad1 signaling pathway and upregulation of the Nrf2 signaling in the chronic stage of pulmonary fibrosis.","output":"Maladjustment of -CGRP/-CGRP Regulation of AQP5 Promotes Transition of Alveolar Epithelial Cell Apoptosis to Pulmonary Fibrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with hematological malignancies with immunodeficiency are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Victims of IPV usually experience long-term mental health disorders and maladjustments in their daily lives. AIMS: To examine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder in female victims of IPV that participated in a public mental health care program, and to analyze the relationships between the type of IPV exposure, its psychological consequences, and daily life adjustment. METHOD: Up to 164 female victims of IPV referred by their primary care doctors to the Adult Mental Health Casntre of Sant Cugat del Valls (Barcelona) between 2010 and 2016 were evaluated using several tests (Index of Spouse Abuse - ISA, Beck Depression Inventory - BDI-II, Sate-Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAI, the Maladjustement Scale - MS, and the Severity Symptom Scale for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder - EGS). RESULTS: Of the 164 referred women, 102 (62.2%) agreed to participate (mean age 44.98 years, range 19-71) and 73% scored above the cut-off point in the physical IPV dimension (ISA). Moreover, 73% had depression symptoms, 77% trait anxiety, and 87% state anxiety altered scores. Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was also high (87%).

METHODS: The referral decision defined by physician reading biosignal-based ECG or CHART report were compared for 550 patients, where its performance is calculated against the ground truth referral decision. The ground truth was established by cardiologist consensus based on all the available measurements and findings including echocardiography (ECHO). RESULTS: The results confirmed that CHART analysis was far more effective than ECG only analysis: CHART reduced false negative rates 15.8% and false positive (FP) rates by 5%, when compared with SOTA ECG devices. General physicians (GPs) using CHART saw their positive diagnosis rate significantly increased, from ~10% to ~26% (260% increase), and the uncertainty rate significantly decreased, from ~31% to ~1.9% (94% decrease). For cardiology, the study showed that in 98% of the cases, the CHART report was found to be a good indicator as to what kind of heart problems can be expected (the start-point) in the ECHO examination. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that GP use of CHART resulted in more accurate referrals for cardiology, resulting in fewer true negative or FPhealthy or mildly abnormal patients not in need of ECHO confirmation. The indirect benefit is the reduction in wait-times and in unnecessary and costly testing in secondary care.

We aimed to determine whether development of significant liver injury during hospitalization is related to concomitant medications or processes common in COVID-19 (e.g. ischemia, hyperinflammatory or hypercoagulable states) and to determine whether it can result in liver failure and death. Methods 834 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included. Clinical, medication and laboratory data were obtained at admission and throughout hospitalization using an identified database. Significant liver injury was defined as an AST 5X ULN; ischemia was defined as vasopressor use for a minimum of 2 consecutive days; hyper-inflammatory state as hs-CRP 100mg/L and hypercoagulability as D-dimer 5mg/L, any time during hospitalization. Results 105 (12.6%) patients developed significant liver injury. Compared to those without significant liver injury, ischemia [OR 4.3 (2.5-7.4, p <0.0001)] and tocilizumab use [OR 3.6 (1.9-7.0, p=0.0001)] were independent predictors of significant liver injury. While AST correlated closely with ALT (R=0.89) throughout hospitalization, AST did not correlate with INR (R= 0.10) or with bilirubin (R=0.09). Death during hospitalization occurred in 136 (16.3%) patients.

ECG monitoring was repeated in 12 (9.5%) p due to poor ECG quality in 6 p or high suspicion of AF despite an initial negative result in 6 p. AF &gt;30 s was detected in a total of 27 (21.4%) p, average AF duration was 52 hours (range 30 s-22 d). AF &gt;30s was detected in 2 (17%) p with repeated monitoring. All these patients were placed on anticoagulation. Sustained paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) was documented in 4 (4.4%) p without AF. All episodes of AF and SVT were asymptomatic. Mobitz I second degree AV block in 4 (3.2%) p. 3 (2.4%) p had a pacemaker implanted: 2 for severe sinus dysfunction and 1 for AV block. High-density ventricular ectopy (&gt;3000/d) was present in 7 (6%) p and 1 episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was detected in 26 (21%) p.

This variant was estimated to be responsible for more than 96% of cases reported between January and June 2021, being associated with increased transmissibility and disease severity, a reduction in neutralization antibodies and effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, as well as diagnostic detection failure. Here we show that, following several importations predominantly from the USA, the Delta variant rapidly replaced Gamma after July 2021. However, in contrast to what was seen in other countries, the rapid spread of Delta did not lead to a large increase in the number of cases and deaths reported in Brazil. We suggest that this was likely due to the relatively successful early vaccination campaign coupled with natural immunity acquired following prior infection with Gamma. Our data reinforces reports of the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant and, considering the increasing concern due to the recently identified Omicron variant, argues for the necessity to strengthen genomic monitoring on a national level to quickly detect and curb the emergence and spread of other VOCs that might threaten global health.","output":"Replacement of the Gamma by the Delta variant in Brazil: impact of lineage displacement on the ongoing pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current influenza vaccines, live attenuated or inactivated, do not protect against antigenically novel influenza A viruses (IAVs) of pandemic potential, which has driven interest in the development of universal influenza vaccines. Universal influenza vaccine candidates targeting highly conserved antigens of IAV nucleoprotein (NP) are promising as vaccines that induce T cell immunity, but concerns have been raised about the safety of inducing robust CD8 T cell responses in the lungs. Using a mouse model, we systematically evaluated effects of recombinant adenovirus vectors (rAd) expressing IAV NP (A/NP-rAd) or influenza B virus (IBV) NP (B/NP-rAd) on pulmonary inflammation and function after vaccination and following live IAV challenge. After A/NP-rAd or B/NP-rAd vaccination, female mice exhibited robust systemic and pulmonary vaccine-specific B cell and T cell responses and experienced no morbidity (e.g., body mass loss). Both in vivo pulmonary function testing and lung histopathology scoring revealed minimal adverse effects of intranasal rAd vaccination compared with unvaccinated mice. After IAV challenge, A/NP-rAd-vaccinated mice experienced significantly less morbidity, had lower pulmonary virus titers, and developed less pulmonary inflammation than unvaccinated or B/NP-rAd-vaccinated mice. Based on analysis of pulmonary physiology using detailed testing not previously applied to the question of T cell damage, mice protected by vaccination also had better lung function than controls. Results provide evidence that, in this model, adenoviral universal influenza vaccine does not damage pulmonary tissue. In addition, adaptive immunity, in particular, T cell immunity in the lungs, does not cause damage when restimulated but instead mitigates pulmonary damage following IAV infection.IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses can emerge and spread rapidly before vaccines are available. It would be a tremendous advance to use vaccines that protect against whole categories of viruses, such as universal influenza vaccines, without the need to predict which virus will emerge. The nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus provides a target conserved among strains and is a dominant T cell target. In animals, vaccination to NP generates powerful T cell immunity and long-lasting protection against diverse influenza strains. Concerns have been raised, but not evaluated experimentally, that potent local T cell responses might damage the lungs. We analyzed lung function in detail in the setting of such a vaccination. Despite CD8 T cell responses in the lungs, lungs were not damaged and functioned normally after vaccination alone and were protected upon subsequent infection. This precedent provides important support for vaccines based on T cell-mediated protection, currently being considered for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","output":"Effect of an Adenovirus-Vectored Universal Influenza Virus Vaccine on Pulmonary Pathophysiology in a Mouse Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A COVID-19 outbreak occurred in May 2020 in a public housing building in Hong Kong C Luk Chuen House, located in Lek Yuen Estate. The horizontal cluster linked to the index case flat (flat 812) remains to be explained. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were conducted to obtain the wind-pressure coefficients of each external opening on the eighth floor of the building. The data were then used in a multi-zone airflow model to estimate the airflow rate and aerosol concentration in the flats and corridors on that floor. Apart from flat 812 and corridors, the virus-laden aerosol concentrations in flats 811, 813, 815, 817 and 819 (opposite to flat 812, across the corridor) were the highest on the eighth floor. When the doors of flats 813 and 817 were opened by 20%, the hourly-averaged aerosol concentrations in these two flats were at least four times as high as those in flats 811, 815 and 819 during the index case's home hours or the suspected exposure period of secondary cases. Thus, the flats across the corridor that were immediately downstream from flat 812 were at the highest exposure risk under a prevailing easterly wind, especially when their doors or windows that connected to the corridor were open. Given that the floorplan and dimension of Luk Chuen House are similar to those of many hotels, our findings provide a probable explanation for COVID-19 outbreaks in quarantine hotels.

METHODS Children with anti-TNF refractory UC initiating ustekinumab intravenously at sites of the Canadian Children IBD Network prior to 12/2019 are included. The primary endpoint was steroid-free clinical remission with subcutaneous ustekinumab at 52 weeks (Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index <10, no steroids 4 weeks). Ustekinumab levels were measured after week 20. Endoscopic improvement was defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore 1, or faecal calprotectin (FCP) <250 g/g if not re-colonoscoped. RESULTS At six sites between 01/2018 and 11/2019, 25 children (median [IQR] age 14.8 years [12.3-16.2], 72% female) with UC duration 2.3 years (1.1-4.2) received intravenous ustekinumab (median dose/kg of 6.4 [5.5-7.5] mg).

We report the early and late toxicity in patients infected with covid-19 treated at the same time for early-stage breast cancer. Material and methods: This is a monocentric prospective study of patients treated in our hospital between March and June 2020 who were diagnosed with covid-19 infection. The inclusion criteria were to be irradiated for early stage breast cancer and to have a positive covid diagnosis on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and / or a lung computed tomography (CT) scan and / or suggestive clinical symptoms. All of them needed 6 months follow-up clinic after the end of the radiotherapy with clinical examination, mammogram, as well as CT scan to evaluate the lung status. Radiotherapy consisted of breast or chest wall irradiation with or without lymph node irradiation, with protocols adapted to pandemic situation. The treatment-related toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Results: All 350 patients treated for early stage breast cancer were studied. Of them, 16 presented clinical symptoms of covid-19 infection, and of them 12 had clinical, CT scan and PCR confirmation. This entire cohort of 12 patients with median age of 56 years (range: 42-72 years) underwent their radiotherapy. During the radiotherapy, nine patients presented radiodermatitis: eight grade 1 (66%) and one grade 2 (8%). Two patients with lymph nodes irradiation presented grade 2 oesophagitis. Late toxicity was evaluated 6 months after the end of the radiotherapy, and there was no radiation or covid lung sequel on the CT scans. One patient presented covid-related dyspnoea, and two had fibrosis. Conclusion: The half-year follow-up of prospective covid-19 cohort, treated for early stage breast cancer demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile with few low-grade adverse events.

The present study examined short-term primary causes of death after PCI in a national cohort before and during COVID-19. RESULTS The overall rates of in-hospital and 30-day death were 1.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The rate of 30-day death declined between 2017 (2.9%) and February 2020 (2.5%), mainly due to lower in-hospital death (2.1% vs 1.5%), before rising again from March 1, 2020 (3.2%) due to higher rates of postdischarge mortality. Only 59.6% of 30-day deaths were due to cardiac causes, with the most common causes being acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure, and this persisted throughout the study period. In the 30-day death group, 10.4% after March 1, 2020 were due to confirmed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS In this nationwide study, we show that 40% of 30-day deaths are due to non-cardiac causes.

Not surprisingly, many viruses including SARS-CoV-2 have evolved de-ISGylating activities to antagonize its effect. In this study we compared ISG15-driven macrophage responses upon infection by influenza, Zika and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. ISG15 and its modifying enzymes were upregulated in human macrophages after infection with all three viruses. While influenza and Zika viruses induced cellular ISGylation, SARS-CoV-2 triggered hydrolysis of ISG15 modifications instead, to generate free, extracellular ISG15 from macrophages and dendritic cells, but not from bronchial epithelial cells. Extracellular ISG15 was released independent of the conventional secretory pathway or cell death, but instead, depended on a non-classical autophagy-related secretory process. Increase of extracellular ISG15 was also reflected in serum samples from COVID-19 patients. The high ratio of free versus conjugated ISG15 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells triggered macrophage polarization towards a M1 phenotype, increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. MCP-1 (CCL2), IL-1?, TNF? and IL-6, and attenuated antigen presentation. Depleting ISG15 conjugating enzymes Ube1L and HERC5 further increased free ISG15 and exacerbated this effect. We could recapitulate this phenomenon by expressing the wild-type but not the catalytically inactive PLpro de-ISGylating enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. Proteomic analyses of the secretome from SARS-CoV-2 infected macrophages revealed that besides ISG15, it displayed significant enrichment in non-classical secretory proteins and inflammatory responses, which was further amplified by free ISG15. Collectively, our results indicate that increased proportions of free ISG15 dramatically alter macrophage responses and is likely a key feature of cytokine storms triggered by highly pathogenic respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Altered ISGylation drives aberrant macrophage-dependent immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction.

The target of APT attack has gradually expanded from government agencies to vaccine manufacturers, medical industry and so on. What's more, APT groups have a strict organizational structure and professional division of labor and malware delivered by the same APT groups are similar. Classifying malware samples into known APT groups in time can minimize losses as soon as possible and keep relevant industries vigilant. In our paper, we proposed a multi-classification method of APT malware based on Adaboost and LightGBM. We collect real APT malware samples that have been delivered by 12 known APT groups. The API call sequence of each APT malware is obtained through the sandbox. For the relationship between adjacent APIs, we use TF-IDF algorithm combined with bi-gram. Then, Adaboost algorithm is used to select out the important API features, which form the target feature subset. Finally, we use the above subset combined with LightGBM ensemble algorithm to train multiple classifiers, named Ada-LightGBM. The experimental results show that our method is superior to the single Adaboost and LightGBM method. The classifier has good recognition performance for the test samples. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"An APT Malware Classification Method Based on Adaboost Feature Selection and LightGBM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Using technology to reduce the pressure on the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales is a key government target, and the NHS Long-Term Plan outlines a strategy for digitally enabled outpatient care to become mainstream by 2024. In 2020, the COVID-19 response saw the widespread introduction of remote consultations for patient follow-up, regardless of individual preferences. Despite this rapid change, there may be enduring barriers to the effective implementation of remote appointments into routine practice once the unique drivers for change during the COVID-19 pandemic no longer apply, to which pre-COVID implementation studies can offer important insights. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of using real-time remote consultations between patients and secondary care physicians for routine patient follow-up at a large hospital in the United Kingdom and to assess whether patient satisfaction differs between intervention and usual care patients. METHODS: Clinically stable liver transplant patients were randomized to real-time remote consultations in which their hospital physician used secure videoconferencing software (intervention) or standard face-to-face appointments (usual care). Participants were asked to complete postappointment questionnaires over 12 months. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome was the difference in scores between baseline and study end by patient group for the three domains of patient satisfaction (assessed using the Visit-Specific Satisfaction Instrument). An embedded qualitative process evaluation used interviews to assess patient and staff experiences. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients who were randomized, 29 (54%) received remote consultations, and 25 (46%) received usual care (recruitment rate: 54/203, 26.6%). The crossover between study arms was high (13/29, 45%). A total of 129 appointments were completed, with 63.6% (82/129) of the questionnaires being returned. Patient satisfaction at 12 months increased in both the intervention (25 points) and usual care (14 points) groups. The within-group analysis showed that the increases were significant for both intervention (P<.001) and usual care (P=.02) patients; however, the between-group difference was not significant after controlling for baseline scores (P=.10). The qualitative process evaluation showed thataccording to patientsremote consultations saved time and money, were less burdensome, and caused fewer negative impacts on health. Technical problems with the software were common, and only 17% (5/29) of patients received all appointments over video. Both consultants and patients saw remote consultations as positive and beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Using technology to conduct routine follow-up appointments remotely may ease some of the resource and infrastructure challenges faced by the UK NHS and free up clinic space for patients who must be seen face-to-face. Our findings regarding the advantages and challenges of using remote consultations for routine follow-ups of liver transplant patients have important implications for service organization and delivery in the postpandemic NHS.

Design/methodology/approach: An analysis was carried out of relevant documents that included government policy statements, budgets, news articles and website information on the pandemic. Meaningful interpretation of information and reflections helped provide the basis of the commentary. Findings: Public budgeting has a prominent role in addressing a major global crisis. Budgets need to quickly respond to the needs of the moment in saving lives and sustaining peoples well-being, businesses and the economy. In a crisis situation, the social, political and economic factors become crucial determinants of budgetary policy measures. Although strong political leadership is required to deliver budgets under unimaginable circumstances, the ideology of the political party in government can be a powerful predictor of fiscal policies. Crisis budgeting will result in mounting budget deficits and public debts that will take many years for future generations to pay back. Practical implications: This paper provides a significant learning for other nations. These lessons will guide budget policymakers to prepare better for potential crisis in the future.

The cardiac involvement was assessed by serial troponin levels and echocardiograms in 28 consecutive patients with COVID-19 ARDS consecutively admitted to our Intensive Care Unit from March 1 to March 31. Twenty-eight COVID-19 patients (aged 61.7  10 years, males 79%). The majority was mechanically ventilated (86%) and 4 patients (14%) required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of March 31, the Intensive Care Unit mortality rate was 7%, whereas 7 patients were discharged (25%) with a length of stay of 8.2 5 days. At echocardiographic assessment on admission, acute core pulmonale was detected in 2 patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Increased systolic arterial pressure was detected in all patients. Increased Troponin T levels were detectable in 11 patients (39%) on admission. At linear regression analysis, troponin T showed a direct relationship with C-reactive Protein (R square: 0.082, F: 5.95, pa?=a?0.017). In conclusions, in COVID-19-related ARDS, increased in Tn levels was common but not associated with alterations in wall motion kinesis, thus suggesting that troponin T elevation is likely to be multifactorial, mainly linked to disease severely (as inferred by the relation between Tn and C-reactive Protein).

While the knowledge on the acute phase of the disease has rapidly expanded, little is known on the consequences of COVID-19 following clinical remission. We set up a multidisciplinary COVID-19 follow-up outpatient clinic to identify and address the clinical needs of COVID-19 survivors. Here we describe the features of our follow-up programme. METHODS: The multidisciplinary assessment comprises a complete physical examination, respiratory evaluation (peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, dyspnoea assessment, lung ultrasound and pulmonary function), cardiovascular assessment (electrocardiography, echocardiography), nutritional assessment (anthropometrics, mini Nutritional Assessment screening tool), neurological examination including cognitive tests, and mental health assessment. All data are prospectively collected, and blood is sampled for biobanking. RESULTS: Since 7 April to 5 June, 2020, 453 out of the 1388 COVID-19 survivors managed at our University Hospital have been evaluated at the Outpatient COVID-19 Follow-up Clinic. The characteristics of the follow-up cohort are similar to those of the whole cohort of COVID-19 in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and COVID-19 severity upon ED presentation, indicating that the follow-up cohort is representative of the whole cohort.

One drug that has shown promising results in vitro is nitazoxanide. Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (EC50) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cmax : EC50 roughly equal to 14:1). As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials. Furthermore, treatments for COVID-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production. We aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production. Methods A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5-14 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind. Data extracted were grade 1-4 and serious adverse events (AEs). Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects.Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax. Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered. Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries. Results Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion. These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up. No significant differences were found in any of the AE endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active- or placebo-controlled trials. Mild GI AEs increased with dose. No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported. There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited.Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41. The daily cost would therefore be $0.10. The same 14-day course could cost $3944 in US commercial pharmacies, and $3 per course in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. At a higher dose of 1100 mg TDS, our estimated cost was $4.08 per 14-day course, equivalent to $0.29 per day. Conclusion Nitazoxanide demonstrates a good safety profile at approved doses. However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity. We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS. Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated. If efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated in clinical studies, nitazoxanide may represent a safe and affordable treatment in the ongoing pandemic.","output":"Review of safety and minimum pricing of nitazoxanide for potential treatment of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the global nature of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the need for disease detection and expanding testing capacity remains critical priorities.

We observed that the inhibition of NLRP3 activation using the small molecule inhibitor, MCC950, or in genetically modified NLRP3 knockout (Nlrp3?/?) mice during in vivo RSV infection led to decreased lung immunopathology along with a reduced expression of the mucus-associated genes and reduced production of innate cytokines (IL-1, IL-33 and CCL2) linked to severe RSV disease while leading to significant increases in IFN-.

Within Europe, the United Kingdom is the most severely affected country, with a death toll in excess of 100.000 as of February 2021. We aimed to compare the national impact of Covid19 on the risk of death in UK cancer patients versus those in continental Europe (EU). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the OnCovid study database, a European registry of cancer patients consecutively diagnosed with Covid-19 in 27 centres from February 27 to September 10, 2020. We analysed case fatality rates and risk of death at 30 days and 6 months stratified by region of origin (UK versus EU). We compared patient characteristics at baseline, oncological and Covid-19 specific therapy across cohorts and tested these in multivariable Cox regression models to identify predictors of adverse outcome in UK versus EU patients. Results: Compared to EU patients (n = 924), UK patients (n = 468) were characterised by higher case fatality rates (40.38% versus 26.5%, p &lt; 0.0001), higher risk of death at 30 days (hazard ratio, HR 1.64 [95%CI 1.36-1.99]) and 6 months after Covid-19 diagnosis (47.64% versus 33.33%, p &lt; 0.0001, HR 1.59 [95%CI 1.33-1.88]). UK patients were more often males, of older age and more co-morbid than EU counterparts (p &lt; 0.01). Receipt of anti-cancer therapy was lower in UK versus EU patients (p &lt; 0.001). Despite equal proportions of complicated Covid-19, rates of intensive care admission and use of mechanical ventilation, UK cancer patients were less likely to receive anti-Covid-19 therapies including corticosteroids, anti-virals and interleukin-6 antagonists (p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariable analyses adjusted for imbalanced prognostic factors confirmed the UK cohort to be characterised by worse risk of death at 30 days and 6 months, independent of patient's age, gender, tumour stage and status, number of co-morbidities, Covid-19 severity, receipt of anti-cancer and anti-Covid-19 therapy. Rates of permanent cessation of anti-cancer therapy post Covid-19 were similar in UK versus EU. Conclusions: UK cancer patients have been more severely impacted by the unfolding of the Covid-19 pandemic despite societal risk mitigation factors and rapid deferral of anti-cancer therapy.

The ongoing outbreak of this respiratory disease has posed critical challenges for the public health, research, and medical communities around the world. This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with lung cancer in China. Methods We collected data on 397 inpatients from a single center during 4 weeks of the epidemic time (2020 group), and that of 2504 inpatients during the same period (4 weeks) in last 5 years (2015-2019 group). A questionnaire was used to investigate medical demands among 803 patients with lung cancer at 65 hospitals from 20 provinces in China during the epidemic. We evaluate the incidence data of COVID-19 in Guangdong to analyze the tendency of the pandemic and compared it with inpatient data. Results The number of hospitalizations and lung cancer-related surgeries had steadily increased in 2015-2019 but reduced by an average of 26.72% (133.8) and 57.18% (45.4) in 2020. The hospital capacity decreased by 28.00% (35 inpatient beds) during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic period. The epidemic caused a greater impact on medical work related to lung cancer after the Chinese New Year holiday. Patients were most concerned about longer waiting time for outpatient services, inpatient beds, physical examinations, or surgeries (406; 50.56%), the possibility of infection with the novel coronavirus (359; 44.71%), difficulties in getting to a hospital due to transportation outages (279; 34.74%). Patients in stage I and II showed less fear about disease progression (14, 18.18%; 4, 14.81%), lower proportions of delayed medical arrangement (15, 19.48%; 6, 22.22%) and less complain about complex treatment procedures (12, 15.58%, 5, 18.52%). Patients in high-infected area (345, 56.74%) complained more frequently about longer booking periods than in low-infected area (61, 31.28%). Conclusion Treatment of patients with lung cancer has been affected by the epidemic to some extent. We provide suggestions on both clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies of lung cancer to optimize the process regarding to the currently urgent circumstances.

Liminality - the ambiguous in-between state of individuals completing a migratory journey - represents a state of legal, economic, and physical insecurity. Through the framework of liminality, this analysis seeks to understand the unique challenges faced by displaced Colombian women in Ecuador including their experience of IPV. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of 15 in-depth interviews and 319 longitudinal surveys, conducted on the border of Ecuador and Colombia, following a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. We analysed interviews thematically and mapped the main themes onto complementary quantitative variables. We conducted logistic regression with identified risk and protective factors (measured at time 1) and recent IPV (measured at time 2), controlling for demographic characteristics and IPV at time 1. RESULTS: Our mixed-methods analysis revealed four main mechanisms by which displacement influenced the social and economic realities of Colombian women years after crossing the border, compounding their risk of IPV and limiting their ability to escape it. Lack of legal residence and documentation, violence experienced along life course and migratory continuums which increased their risk for later revictimisation, social isolation including loss of support networks and restricted mobility and lastly, financial stress. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights the critical importance of supporting the economic and social integration of migrants and refugees in host communities, as well as the need to carefully consider migration-related vulnerabilities in IPV prevention and response interventions. As the regional refugee crisis grows, policy makers must consider how the long-term marginalisation of refugee women contributes to their victimisation.

However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza viruses. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with ARDS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This analysis was a retrospective case-control study. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 (n = 73) or H1N1 (n = 75) were compared. Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The median age of patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of patients with H1N1, and there was a higher proportion of male subjects among the COVID-19 cohort (P < .05). Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P < .05). Patients with H1N1 had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores than patients with COVID-19 (P < .05). The Pao(2)/Fio(2) of 198.2 mm Hg in the COVID-19 cohort was significantly higher than the Pao(2)/Fio(2) of 107.0 mm Hg in the H1N1 cohort (P < .001). Ground-glass opacities was more common in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with H1N1 (P < .001). There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients. The in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 28.8%, whereas that of patients with H1N1 was 34.7% (P = .483). SOFA score-adjusted mortality of H1N1 patients was significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients, with a rate ratio of 2.009 (95% CI, 1.563-2.583; P < .001). INTERPRETATION: There were many differences in clinical presentations between patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 or H1N1. Compared with H1N1 patients, patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA score-adjusted mortality.","output":"Comparison of Hospitalized Patients With ARDS Caused by COVID-19 and H1N1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whole genome sequencing on next-generation instruments provides an unbiased way to identify the organisms present in complex metagenomic samples.

Effective infection control measures and identifying areas of highest risk is required to reduce the risk of spread to patients who are admitted with other illnesses. This is the first pandemic where whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been readily available. We demonstrate how WGS can be deployed to help identify and control outbreaks. Aims & Methods Swabs performed on patients to detect SARS-CoV-2 underwent RT-PCR on one of multiple different platforms available at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. Positive samples underwent WGS on the GridION platform using the ARTIC amplicon sequencing protocol at the University of Nottingham. Results Phylogenetic analysis from WGS and epidemiological data was used to identify an initial transmission that occurred in the admissions ward. It also showed high prevalence of asymptomatic staff infection with genetically identical viral sequences which may have contributed to the propagation of the outbreak. Actions were taken to help reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission by the introduction of rapid point of care testing in the admissions ward and introduction of portable HEPA14 filters. WGS was also used in two instances to exclude an outbreak by discerning that the phylotypes were not identical, saving time and resources. Conclusions In conjunction with accurate epidemiological data, timely WGS can identify high risk areas of nosocomial transmission, which would benefit from implementation of appropriate control measures. Conversely, WGS can disprove nosocomial transmission, validating existing control measures and maintaining clinical service, even where epidemiological data is suggestive of an outbreak.","output":"The impact of real-time whole genome sequencing in controlling healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are neurotropic viruses with broad host range whose infections cause considerable health problems in both animals and humans.

This order affected different neighborhoods differently, as stores and workplaces are not randomly distributed across the city, and different populations may have responded differently to the out-of-home restrictions. This study examines how the business closures and activity restrictions affected COVID-19 testing results. An evaluation of whether such actions slowed the spread of the pandemic is a crucial step in designing effective public health policies. METHODS: Daily data on the fraction of COVID-19 tests yielding a positive result at the zip code level were analyzed in relation to the number of visits to local businesses (based on smartphone location) and the number of smartphones that stayed fixed at their home location. The regression model also included vectors of fixed effects for the day of the week, the calendar date, and the zip code of residence. RESULTS: A large number of visits to local businesses increased the positivity rate of COVID-19 tests, while a large number of smartphones that stayed at home decreased it. A doubling in the relative number of visits increases the positivity rate by about 12.4 percentage points (95% CI, 5.3 to 19.6). A doubling in the relative number of stay-at-home devices lowered it by 2.0 percentage points (95% CI, -2.9 to -1.2). The business closures and out-of-home activity restrictions decreased the positivity rate, accounting for approximately 25% of the decline observed in April and May 2020.

One commonly proposed reason for the low COPD rates among COVID-19 patients is the usage of inhaled corticosteroids or bronchodilators that may protect against COVID-19. However, another possible reason not discussed elsewhere is that lungs in a diseased state may not be conducive for the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to establish COVID-19. For one, COPD causes mucous plugging in large and small airways, which may hinder SARS-CoV-2 from reaching deeper parts of the lungs (i.e., alveoli). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may only localize to the upper respiratory tract of persons with COPD, causing mild or asymptomatic infections requiring no hospital attention. Even if SARS-CoV-2 reaches the alveoli, cells therein are probably under a heavy burden of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and extensively damaged where it may not support efficient viral replication.

The conflicting role of innate immunity in the antitumor activity of oncolytic viruses is still a matter of debate. The STING-dependent DNA sensing axis is considered detrimental for viral replication and cancer cell clearance. Accordingly, we observed that STING loss in tumor cells was associated with improved lytic potential by a herpes-based oncolytic virus. However, STING-knockout cancer cells infected with the oncolytic virus showed impaired immunogenicity, as immunogenic cell death was improperly triggered. In agreement with these observations, STING-knockout tumors raised in a murine syngeneic model were more resistant to a combined treatment of the oncolytic virus with PD-1 blockade. The present study demonstrates the antitumor benefit of antiviral immunity and sheds lights on the mechanisms of immune resistance to oncovirotherapy exerted by STING-loss in tumor cells. ABSTRACT: The dichotomic contribution of cancer cell lysis and tumor immunogenicity is considered essential for effective oncovirotherapy, suggesting that the innate antiviral immune response is a hurdle for efficacy of oncolytic viruses. However, emerging evidence is resizing this view. By sensing cytosolic DNA, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) axis can both counteract viral spread and contribute to the elicitation of adaptive immunity via type I interferon responses. In this paper, we analyzed the tumor-resident function of Sting-mediated DNA sensing in a combined approach of oncovirotherapy and PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade, in an immunocompetent murine model. While supporting increased lytic potential by oncolytic HER2-retargeted HSV-1 in vitro and in vivo, Sting-knockout tumors showed molecular signatures of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These signatures were correspondingly associated with ineffectiveness of the combination therapy in a model of established tumors. Results suggest that the impairment in antiviral response of Sting-knockout tumors, while favoring viral replication, is not able to elicit an adequate immunotherapeutic effect, due to lack of immunogenic cell death and the inability of Sting-knockout cancer cells to promote anti-tumor adaptive immune responses. Accordingly, we propose that antiviral, tumor-resident Sting provides fundamental contributions to immunotherapeutic efficacy of oncolytic viruses.","output":"Integrity of the Antiviral STING-mediated DNA Sensing in Tumor Cells Is Required to Sustain the Immunotherapeutic Efficacy of Herpes Simplex Oncolytic Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) highlighted our daily lives recently and caused panic over the world.

The results of the system depended not only the parameters also on social consciousness. Results: It is found that disease progression in this model is determined by the basic reproductive ratio, $R_0$, the actual epidemic of $R_0$ and effective $R(t)$ of each day. If $R_0>1$, the number of latently infected individuals grows exponentially;endemic solution is stable while infection rate decays if $R_0<1$.

Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean ( SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40  2.00 and 5.52  4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.","output":"Clinical Features and Chest CT Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Single-Center Study in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Potentially pandemic strains of influenza pose an undeniable threat to human populations.

TMPRSS2, which interacts with ACE2, may be a better candidate for targeted therapies. Using publicly-available expression data, we show that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in many host tissues, including lung. The highest expression of ACE2 is found in the testes, whereas the prostate display the highest expression of TMPRSS2. Given the increased severity of disease among older males with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we address the potential roles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in their contribution to the sex differences in disease severity. We show that expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are overall comparable between males and females in multiple tissues suggesting that differences in the expression levels of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in the lung and other non-sex-specific tissues may not explain the gender disparities in SARS CoV-2 severity.

Methods Forty-two patients aged 20-80 years, who were scheduled for surgery under spinal anesthesia were enrolled. Spinal anesthesia was performed using 0.5% bupivacaine, which was followed by dexmedetomidine infusion (loading dose, 0.5-1 g/kg for 10 min; maintenance dose, 0.3-0.6 g/kg/h). The MOAA/S score was used to evaluate the level of sedation. Results A total of 215082 MOAA/S scores and BIS data pairs were analyzed. The baseline variability of the BIS value was 7.024%, and BIS value decreased, as the MOAA/S scored decreased. The correlation coefficient and prediction probability between the two measurements were 0.566 (P < 0.0001) and 0.636, respectively. The mean  standard deviation values of the BIS were 87.22  7.06, 75.85  9.81, and 68.29  12.65 when the MOAA/S scores were 5, 3, and 1, respectively. Furthermore, the cut-off BIS values in the receiver operating characteristic analysis at MOAA/S scores of 5, 3, and 1 were 82, 79, and 73, respectively. Conclusion The BIS values were significantly correlated with the MOAA/S scores.

The maximum travelled distance was also calculated to leading and higher orders, and it is observed that there is a small difference between the leading and higher order results, and that it depends on the strength of the flow.

Deep learning convolution neural network (DL-CNN) technologies are showing remarkable results for detecting cases of COVID-19. In this paper, deep feature concatenation (DFC) mechanism is utilized in two different ways. In the first one, DFC links deep features extracted from X-ray and CT scan using a simple proposed CNN. The other way depends on DFC to combine features extracted from either X-ray or CT scan using the proposed CNN architecture and two modern pre-trained CNNs: ResNet and GoogleNet. The DFC mechanism is applied to form a definitive classification descriptor. The proposed CNN architecture consists of three deep layers to overcome the problem of large time consumption.

We examined the expression of ACE2, to which SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein binds to facilitate viral entry, in cord blood derived HSCs/HPCs and in peripheral blood derived immune cell subtypes. ACE2 is expressed in low numbers of immune cells, higher numbers of HPCs, and up to 65% of rigorously defined HSCs. We also examined effects of exposing HSCs/HPCs and immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 S protein ex vivo. HSCs and HPCs expand less effectively and have less functional colony forming capacity when grown with S protein, while peripheral blood monocytes upregulate CD14 expression and show distinct changes in size and granularity.

The objective of this study was to investigate the development of the most relevant device-associated HAI in German ICUs during the year 2020 as compared to 2019. METHODS: We utilized the data of the ICU component of the German National Reference Center for Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections (KISS = Krankenhaus-Infektions-Surveillance-System) for the period 2019C2020. We focused on central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), ventilator-associated lower respiratory infections (VALRTI) and bloodstream infections associated with the use of Extracorporeal-Life-Support-Systems (ECLSABSI). Device use was defined as the number device days per 100 patient days; device-associated infection rates as the number of device-associated infections per 1000 device days. To compare the pooled means between the years and quarters we calculated rate ratios of device-associated infection rates with 95% confidence intervals by Poisson regression models. RESULTS: The number of participating ICUs in the surveillance system decreased from 982 in 2019 to 921 in 2020 (6.2%). Device utilization rates increased significantly for central lines and ventilator use. VALRTI rates and CAUTI rates decreased in 2020 compared with 2019, however, no increase was shown for CLABSI or ECLSABSI. This result was also confirmed when the corresponding quarters per year were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of an increase in device-associated healthcare associated infections (HAI) in German ICUs may be due to the lower overall incidence of COVID-19 cases in Germany in 2020 compared with US, to a very high availability of ICU beds per 100,000 inhabitants compared with many other countries, and a change in the ICU patient mix due to numerous elective procedures that were postponed during the first two waves.

Thirty-six patients (52.2%) received CFR, 66 Gy in 33 fractions, 2 Gy per fraction, and 33 patients (47.8%) received HFR, 52.5 Gy in 20 fractions, 2.63 Gy per fraction. Forty-seven (68%) patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 5-year PSA failure- and metastasis-free survival rate was 56.9% and 76.9%, respectively. Thirty patients (43%) experienced biochemical failure after salvage radiotherapy and 16 patients (23%) experienced metastatic relapse. Nine patients (13%) developed metastatic castration-resistant disease and died of advanced prostate cancer. Median PSA failure-free survival was 72 months (95% CI; 41C72 months), while median metastasis-free survival was not reached. Patients in HFR group were more likely to experience shorter PSA failure-free survival when compared to CFR group (HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.0C4.6, p = 0.04). On univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with PSA failure-free survival were radiotherapy schedule (CFR vs HFR, HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0C4.6, p = 0.04), first postoperative PSA (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.0C1.04, p = 0.03), and concomitant ADT (HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2C8.6, p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with PSA failure-free survival were radiotherapy schedule (HR 3.04, 95% CI 1.37C6.74, p = 0.006) and concomitant ADT (HR 4.41, 95% CI 1.6C12.12, p = 0.004). On univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with metastasis-free survival were the first postoperative PSA (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03C1.12, p = 0.002), seminal vesicle involvement (HR 3.48, 95% CI 1.26C9.6,p = 0.02), extracapsular extension (HR 7.02, 95% CI 1.96C25.07, p = 0.003), and surgical margin status (HR 2.86, 95% CI 1.03C7.97, p = 0.04). The first postoperative PSA (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00C1.08, p = 0.02) and extracapsular extension (HR 4.24, 95% CI 1.08C16.55, p = 0.04) remained significantly associated with metastasis-free survival on multivariate analysis. Three patients in CFR arm (8%) experienced late genitourinary grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, commonly used hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen was associated with lower biochemical control compared to standard fractionation in patients with persistent PSA receiving salvage radiotherapy. Reason for this might be lower biological dose in HFR compared to CFR group. However, this observation is limited due to baseline imbalances in ADT use, ADT duration and Grade Group distribution between two radiotherapy cohorts. In patients with persistent PSA post-prostatectomy, the first postoperative PSA is an independent risk factor for treatment failure. Additional studies are needed to corroborate our observations.","output":"Comparison of hypofractionation and standard fractionation for post-prostatectomy salvage radiotherapy in patients with persistent PSA: single institution experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patient involvement and high-quality patient-provider interactions are critical factors for quality of care in chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Also, assessing the patient's perspective contributes to optimising care delivery and patient's experience. Until today, no user-friendly tools to measure patient experiences exist within immunodermatology. OBJECTIVES To identify the relevant items for patient's experience in immunodermatology and develop a concise questionnaire to assess patient's experience in routine clinical care. METHODS Potential relevant items for measuring patient's perspective of immunodermatology care were identified by a literature search. From this longlist, a shortlist from patient's perspective was distilled by semi-structured interviews with a diverse patient group. This list was reduced to final items using a modified Delphi-method in a multi-stakeholder focus group. For each item, one question was formulated to generate the PREM questionnaire. A first internal validation was achieved by an email round. RESULTS 49 longlist-items were categorized into five domains (access to care, patient centeredness, access to information, care process, satisfaction). During interview rounds, 19 shortlist-items were selected if mentioned by  40% of interviewees. Via the focus group, the most important items were chosen by participant consensus. For each item a question was formulated. The final PREM covers 11 items (plus 2 in case of a first consult). The first internal validation showed that the tool is clear, understandable and has an ideal length.

Additionally, the study also explores the possible strategies adopted by professional students to cope with the pandemic situation.Design/methodology/approachWith an approach to establish a probable concrete relationship between fear with the level of stress, anxiety and depression, the data for the study was collected from 1,408 management students through a structured questionnaire designed in Google Form and administered through WhatsApp. The survey was carried out in the month of July and August 2020 during the lockdown period. Correlation and structural equation modeling have been used to examine the relationship among the test attributes.FindingsThe results from the study discovered that fear of COVID-19 has a significant and considerable impact on the increased level of anxiety and stress among the professional students, but the observations did not demonstrate a significant influence of the fear on depression. The responses reveal that students have developed anxiety and felt stressed mostly due to uncertainty in the upcoming academic plans, disturbances in their regular academic routines and concerns about their future careers. Further, the findings have portrayed that students have adopted both protective and avoidance coping strategies to overcome the adverse consequences of the pandemic.Research limitations/implicationsThe study gives an insight on the psychological vulnerability of the management students and their capability to overcome such sudden disruptions due to pandemics. This research could thus, serve as a reference to the policymakers, universities and institutions while planning out programs and schemes, which would encourage the aspiring managers to overcome the crisis and prepare themselves to befit the vibrant corporate world.Originality/valueSeveral studies exist on the impact of the pandemic on undergraduate students in different universities.

DESIGN: Both online survey and face-to-face interviews were employed in this cross-sectional study. The Household Food Security Scale and Household Dietary Diversity Score were used to access HFS and HDD, respectively. The HDD scores were derived from a 24-h recall of food intake from 12 groups. SETTING: Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: A total sample of 1876 households were recruited. RESULTS: The overall mean scores of HFS and HDD were 3186 (sd 252) and 622 (sd 549), respectively. Being a rural resident, having no formal education, occupation of household head other than government job and low monthly income were potential determinants of lower HFS and HDD. Approximately 45 % and 61 % of Bangladeshi households did not get the same quantity and same type of food, respectively, as they got before the pandemic. Over 10 % of respondents reported that they lost their job or had to close their businesses, and income reduction was reported by over 70 % of household income earners during the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn was negatively associated with HFS and HDD. CONCLUSION: Household socio-economic variables and COVID-19 effects on occupation and income are potential predictors of lower HFS and HDD scores. HFS and HDD deserve more attention during this pandemic particularly with reference to low-earning households and the households whose earning persons' occupation has been negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Determinants of household food security and dietary diversity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The detection of pathogens in clinical and environmental samples using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is often hampered by large amounts of background information, which is especially true for viruses with small genomes. Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples. Methods A virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA-baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted. Results The VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA-baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also point to the risk of carryover between samples. Conclusions The VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector or research question. The risk of carryover needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user-friendly, and even non-experts (without sophisticated bioinformatics skills) can easily use the VirBait workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible without any problems as shown for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Next-generation diagnostics: virus capture facilitates a sensitive viral diagnosis for epizootic and zoonotic pathogens including SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Recent studies revealed a high prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, especially in those who are critically ill. Available studies report varying prevalence rates. Hence, the exact prevalence remains uncertain. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate regarding the appropriate dosage of thromboprophylaxis. Methods: We performed a systematic review and proportion meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies exploring the prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients till 22/07/2020. We pooled the proportion of VTE. Additionally, in a subgroup analysis, we pooled VTE events detected by systematic screening. Finally, we compared the odds of VTE in patients on prophylactic compared to therapeutic anticoagulation. Results: The review comprised of 24 studies and over 2500 patients. The pooled proportion of VTE prevalence was 0.31 (95% CI 0.24, 0.39 I2 94%), of VTE utilizing systematic screening was 0.48 (95% CI 0.33, 0.63 I2 91%), of deep-venous-thrombosis was 0.23 (95% CI 0.14, 0.32 I2 96%), of pulmonary embolism was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09, 0.20 I2 90%). In a subgroup of studies, utilizing systematic screening, VTE risk increased significantly with prophylactic, compared to therapeutic anticoagulation (OR 5.45; 95% CI 1.90, 15.57 I2 0%). Discussion: Our review revealed a high prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Almost 50% of patients had VTE detected by systematic screening.

ARDS is characterised by diffuse alveolar damage that leads to protein-rich pulmonary oedema, local alveolar hypoventilation and atelectasis. Inadequate perfusion of these areas is the main cause of hypoxaemia in ARDS. High perfusion in relation to ventilation (V/Q<1) and shunting (V/Q=0) is not only caused by impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction but also redistribution of perfusion from obstructed lung vessels. Rebalancing the pulmonary vascular tone is a therapeutic challenge. Previous clinical trials on inhaled vasodilators (nitric oxide and prostacyclin) to enhance perfusion to high V/Q areas showed beneficial effects on hypoxaemia but not on mortality. However, specific patient populations with pulmonary hypertension may profit from treatment with inhaled vasodilators. Novel treatment targets to decrease perfusion in low V/Q areas include epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and specific leukotriene receptors. Still, lung protective ventilation and prone positioning are the best available standard of care. This review focuses on disturbed perfusion in ARDS and aims to provide basic scientists and clinicians with an overview of the vascular alterations and mechanisms of V/Q mismatch, current therapeutic strategies, and experimental approaches.","output":"Impairment of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breaking bad news is a key component of the physicians' work.

Reported non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) allergies may predispose to use of stronger pain medications and potentially to OUD. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the clinical impact of reported NSAID allergy on OUD in patients with chronic back pain. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of adults receiving care at a tertiary healthcare system from 1/1/2013-12/31/2018. Back pain and OUD were identified using administrative data algorithms. We used propensity score matching and logistic regression to estimate the impact of self-reported NSAID adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on risk of OUD, adjusting for other relevant clinical information. RESULTS: Of 47,114 patients with chronic back pain, 3,620 (7.7%) had a reported NSAID ADR. In an adjusted propensity score matched analysis, patients with NSAID ADRs had higher odds (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.07-1.67]) of developing OUD as compared to those without NSAID ADRs. Additional risk factors for OUD included younger age, male sex, Medicaid insurance, Medicare insurance, higher number of inpatient and outpatient visits in the prior year, and co-morbid anxiety and depression. Patients with listed NSAID ADRs also had higher odds of a documented opioid prescription during the study period (OR 1.22 [95% CI 1.11-1.34]).

In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about which TLRs are expressed by cell subsets of the CNS. Furthermore, we specifically highlight functional implications of TLR stimulation in neurons, astrocytes and microglia.

However, measles and mumps' resurgence was recently reported, outbreaks still occur, and challenges remain to control these diseases.Areas covered: This qualitative narrative review provides an objective appraisal of the literature regarding current challenges in controlling measles, mumps, rubella infections, and interventions to address them.Expert opinion: While vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella (including trivalent vaccines) are widely used and effective, challenges to control these diseases are mainly related to insufficient immunization coverage and changing vaccination needs owing to new global environment (e.g. traveling, migration, population density). By understanding disease transmission peculiarities by setting, initiatives are needed to optimize vaccination policies and increase vaccination coverage, which was further negatively impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Also, awareness of the potential severity of infections and the role of vaccines should increase. Reminder systems, vaccination of disadvantaged, high-risk and difficult-to-reach populations, accessibility of vaccination, healthcare infrastructure, and vaccination services management should improve. Outbreak preparedness should be strengthened, including implementation of high-quality surveillance systems to monitor epidemiology. While the main focus should be on these public health initiatives to increase vaccination coverage, slightly more benefits could come from evolution of current vaccines.Plain Language SummaryWhat is the context? Measles, mumps, and rubella are highly contagious diseases associated with significant medical and societal burden. Effective vaccines against these diseases are available, and the implementation of vaccination programs drastically reduced disease incidence globally. However, reports of measles and mumps outbreaks in the last few years highlight remaining challenges to eliminate these diseases.What does the review highlight? We conducted a literature review to identify challenges associated with controlling measles, mumps, and rubella infections, and interventions needed to address them. We identified 11 challenges mainly related to low immunization coverage and vaccine characteristics. Societal challenges could be addressed by increasing awareness of disease severity and vaccines impact, targeting high-risk, unvaccinated, and under-vaccinated populations, improving vaccination access, setting up clear outbreak preparedness plans, and implementing country-specific vaccination policies. System weaknesses could be addressed through improving vaccination services and health infrastructure, implementing high-quality surveillance, patient invite, and reminder systems, ensuring vaccine implementation and long-term supply. Interventions related to vaccine characteristic challenges could include adaptation of vaccination schedules (shorter interval between doses, administration of a third dose) and development of vaccines against emerging strains.What is the take-home message?Policymakers should support the following strategies to increase vaccination coverage and reach elimination of measles, mumps, and rubella: strengthening health systems and vaccination access; raising awareness of disease severity and vaccination impact; limiting disease propagation owing to global changing environment and population dynamics (traveling, migration); improving surveillance systems to rapidly address the immunity gaps against disease resurgence.","output":"Measles, mumps, rubella prevention: how can we do better?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The microbiome, by virtue of its interactions with the host, is implicated in various host functions including its influence on nutrition and homeostasis. Many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by a disruption of microbial communities in at least one biological niche/organ system. Various molecular mechanisms between microbial and host components such as proteins, RNAs, metabolites have recently been identified, thus filling many gaps in our understanding of how the microbiome modulates host processes. Concurrently, high-throughput technologies have enabled the profiling of heterogeneous datasets capturing community level changes in the microbiome as well as the host responses. However, due to limitations in parallel sampling and analytical procedures, big gaps still exist in terms of how the microbiome mechanistically influences host functions at a system and community level. In the past decade, computational biology and machine learning methodologies have been developed with the aim of filling the existing gaps. Due to the agnostic nature of the tools, they have been applied in diverse disease contexts to analyze and infer the interactions between the microbiome and host molecular components. Some of these approaches allow the identification and analysis of affected downstream host processes. Most of the tools statistically or mechanistically integrate different types of -omic and meta -omic datasets followed by functional/biological interpretation.

We analyze mobility data from 93 countries implementing lockdowns to investigate their effectiveness in immediately reducing mobility and the subsequent evolution of mobility. We find that at the start of a lockdown, median mobility is reduced to 36% below the baseline, and by another 18% in the subsequent two weeks. 70 countries had lockdowns lasting beyond four weeks and showed a significant reduction in mobility compared to that prior to the lockdown. Mobility was at its minimum 18 days into the lockdown for the median country. Comparing this minimum mobility to the average mobility two weeks before the lockdown, we observe a median reduction of 50 percentage points, evidencing that lockdowns are effective in reducing mobility. For 59 of these 70 countries, lockdowns lasted at least four weeks after reaching minimum mobility and most observed a significant rebound in mobility during the lockdown period. For the median country, 30.1% of the mobility reduction achieved is lost within four weeks, and lockdowns lose all their effectiveness in 112.1 days. Overall, our findings show that while lockdowns are effective at significantly reducing mobility, they are also subject to fatigue as the lockdown periods extend longer.

Our work suggests that in highly monitored disease time series such as COVID-19, EWSs offer the opportunity for policymakers to improve the accuracy of urgent intervention decisions but best characterize hypothesized critical transitions.","output":"Early warning signal reliability varies with COVID-19 waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On February 23rd, the 1st case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was diagnosed at the University Hospital Trust of Verona, Italy. On March 13th, the Oncology Section was converted into a 22-inpatient bed coronavirus disease (COVID) Unit, and we reshaped our organisation to face the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, while maintaining oncological activities. METHODS: We tracked down (i) volumes of oncological activities (January 1st - March 31st, 2020 versus the same period of 2019), (ii) patients' and caregivers' perception and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in oncology health professionals and SARS-CoV-2 infection-related hospital admissions of \\"active\\"' oncological patients. RESULTS: As compared with the same trimester in 2019, the overall reduction in total numbers of inpatient admissions, chemotherapy administrations and specialist visits in January-March 2020 was 8%, 6% and 3%, respectively; based on the weekly average of daily accesses, reduction in some of the oncological activities became statistically significant from week 11. The overall acceptance of adopted measures, as measured by targeted questionnaires administered to a sample of 241 outpatients, was high (>70%). Overall, 8 of 85 oncology health professionals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (all but one employed in the COVID Unit, no hospital admissions and no treatment required); among 471 patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 7 had an \\"active\\"' oncological disease (2 died of infection-related complications). CONCLUSIONS: A slight, but statistically significant reduction in oncology activity was registered during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in Verona, Italy.

It has been proposed that either the TMDs associate, resulting in the formation of large oligomers of Golgi enzymes, or that they mediate the lateral segregation of the enzymes between lipid microdomains. Evidence for either type of interaction has been sought by examining the retention of sialyltransferase (ST), an enzyme of the mammalian trans Golgi. No evidence could be obtained for specific interactions or 'kin recognition' between ST and other proteins of the trans Golgi. Moreover, it is shown that the previously described kin recognition between enzymes of the medial Golgi involves the lumenal portions of these proteins rather than their TMDs. To investigate further the role of the ST TMD, the effects on Golgi retention of various alterations in the TMD were examined. The addition or removal of residues showed that the efficiency of retention of ST is related to TMD length. Moreover, when a type I plasma membrane protein was expressed with a synthetic TMD of 23 leucines it appeared on the cell surface, but when the TMD was shortened to 17 leucines accumulation in the Golgi was observed. These observations are more consistent with lipid-based sorting of ST TMD, but they also allow for reconciliation with the kin recognition model which appears to act on sequences outside of the TMD.","output":"An investigation of the role of transmembrane domains in Golgi protein retention."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Epidemics are associated with increased burden of psychological distress. However, the role of boredom on mental health during epidemic periods has seldom been explored. OBJECTIVE: This study attempted to examine the effect of state boredom on psychological outcomes, and the role of media use and meaning in life among the indirectly exposed Chinese adults in the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: An online survey was administered to 917 Chinese adults on 28 January 2020 (1 week after the official declaration of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus). Self-report questionnaires were used to assess state boredom, anxiety, depression, stress, media use and meaning in life. Moderated mediation analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the effect of state boredom on anxiety and stress, but not depression, were mediated by media use and that sense of meaning in life modified this association. Meaning in life served as a risk factor, rather than a protective factor for the negative psychological outcomes when people experienced boredom. The association between boredom and media use was significant for high but not low meaning in life individuals. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that boredom and media use were associated with an increased burden or psychological distress in the sample. It is important to pay attention to the possible negative impact of boredom and media use during COVID-19, and find more ways to cope with boredom, especially those with high presence of meaning in life.","output":"Psychological distress and state boredom during the COVID-19 outbreak in China: the role of meaning in life and media use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The persistence of measles incidence and outbreaks in humanitarian settings is troubling and needs urgent attention There is now a pressing need to develop, test and implement innovative approaches to vaccinate populations affected by humanitarian emergencies in light of the new and heightened threats posed by COVID-19 Humanitarian interventions must keep a balance between Supplementary Immunization Activities and Routine Vaccination Programs, as well as between host and displaced communities Building strong partnerships, including with warring parties and the local communities, will support the delivery of broader primary healthcare services including immunization in humanitarian settings It is essential to build strong partnerships, including with the local communities, that can support the delivery of primary healthcare services including immunization in humanitarian settings This will require negotiating access with warring factions to enable integrated delivery of essential services amidst insecurity, addressing mistrust and rumours through risk communication, and engaging with communities Building health and research capacity at local levels can elucidate long-standing uncertainties regarding immunity profiles, vaccination coverage and vaccine efficacy Finally, funding policies must systematically address local inequalities with host populations as well as exit strategies in humanitarian interventions","output":"Containing measles in conflict-driven humanitarian settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To explore the applicability of MuLBSTA Score in COVID-19 patients, a retrospective analysis was performed on 330 cases of COVID-19 patients in Southeast Hospital of Xiaogan City, Hubei Province.

Mixed evidence exists on the aerosol-generating potential of orthodontic procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate splatter and/or settled aerosol contamination during orthodontic debonding.Material and methods Fluorescein dye was introduced into the oral cavity of a mannequin. Orthodontic debonding was undertaken with surrounding samples collected. Composite bonding cement was removed using a speed-increasing handpiece with dental suction. A positive control condition included a water-cooled, high-speed air-turbine crown preparation. Samples were analysed using digital image analysis and spectrofluorometric analysis.Results Contamination across the eight-metre experimental rig was 3% of the positive control on spectrofluorometric analysis and 0% on image analysis. Contamination of the operator, assistant and mannequin was 8%, 25% and 28% of the positive control, respectively.Discussion Splatter and settled aerosol from orthodontic debonding is distributed mainly within the immediate locality of the mannequin. Widespread contamination was not observed.Conclusions Orthodontic debonding is unlikely to produce widespread contamination via splatter and settled aerosol, but localised contamination is likely. This highlights the importance of personal protective equipment for the operator, assistant and patient.

Infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV inhibits cell proliferation. Our previous study indicated that Akt, which is poorly phosphorylated in confluent cultures of Vero E6 cells, is phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated upon infection by SARS-CoV. In the present study, we showed that a serine residue of Akt was phosphorylated in Vero E6 cells in subconfluent culture and that Akt was dephosphorylated rapidly after SARS-CoV infection without up-regulation of its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3, which is one of the downstream targets of Akt, was prevented in SARS-CoV-infected cells. However, treatment with glycogen synthase kinase-3 small interfering RNA indicated that the glycogen synthase kinase-3 signaling pathway was not related to inhibition of cell proliferation. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, which induces dephosphorylation of Akt, inhibited cell proliferation. As shown in our previous studies, apoptosis occurred in virus-infected cells within 18 h postinfection. Cellular mRNA transcription, which was reported to be up-regulated in SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells, was not up-regulated in virus-infected Vero E6 cells, partially as a result of apoptosis. These results suggested that inhibition of cell proliferation is regulated by both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway and by apoptosis in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.

The N-terminal domain of coronaviral N proteins (N-NTD) provides a scaffold for RNA binding, while the C-terminal domain (N-CTD) mainly acts as oligomerization modules during assembly. The C terminus of the N protein anchors it to the viral membrane by associating with M protein. We characterized the structures of N-NTD from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in two crystal forms, at 1.17 A (monoclinic) and at 1.85 A (cubic), respectively, resolved by molecular replacement using the homologous avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) structure. Flexible loops in the solution structure of SARS-CoV N-NTD are now shown to be well ordered around the beta-sheet core. The functionally important positively charged beta-hairpin protrudes out of the core, is oriented similarly to that in the IBV N-NTD, and is involved in crystal packing in the monoclinic form. In the cubic form, the monomers form trimeric units that stack in a helical array. Comparison of crystal packing of SARS-CoV and IBV N-NTDs suggests a common mode of RNA recognition, but they probably associate differently in vivo during the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Electrostatic potential distribution on the surface of homology models of related coronaviral N-NTDs suggests that they use different modes of both RNA recognition and oligomeric assembly, perhaps explaining why their nucleocapsids have different morphologies.","output":"Ribonucleocapsid formation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus through molecular action of the N-terminal domain of N protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Farmers Market (FM) Food Navigator program was designed over 3 years and follows a social ecological framework to increase vulnerable populations' access to local foods and build confidence to shop in a FM supporting local food systems while promoting fruit and vegetable consumption. Food Navigators followed a program Playbook, though unlike many similar programs, the program did not offer incentives to subsidize FM purchases. To inform program design and understand outcomes, data were collected from Food Navigators, shoppers, FM managers, and FM vendors. Food Navigators supported five to seven FMs each season (May through October), spending 590 days in FMs over three seasons. Due to their interaction with Food Navigators, shoppers in Season 3 (n = 689) indicated that they would: shop more at the FM (80%); eat more vegetables (52%); and purchase more vegetables (50%). Of shoppers who interacted with Food Navigators more than once (n = 55), 26% reported a higher frequency of vegetable consumption on their last survey compared with their first. In Season 3, at least half of FM managers (n = 4, 50%) and vendors (n = 68, 57%) agreed that food navigators helped increase overall market fruit and vegetables sales. Findings indicated the program did influence multiple levels of a social ecological framework as intended. FM nutrition programs can have success at increasing market sales and improving health-related behaviors without offering incentives.

Patients undergoing HCT are usually immunosuppressed and require frequent outpatient visits. Patients actively enrolled at Hospital das Clnicas, School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP) HCT Outpatient Clinic were already reached via Whatsapp (personal or family members cell phones) for clinic appointments and non-medical information before the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have faced a challenge: providing medical care for HCT patients while preventing environmental exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Our HCT team started performing telehealth care using a HIPAA-compliant Google Meet-based institutional platform and telephone calls in March/2020. To evaluate this strategy as a permanent tool, we sent out a survey to patients in order to better understand their opinion on and early experience with telehealth. Methods: We sent out a questionnaire on Google Forms containing a few questions regarding barriers to commute to hospital, internet access, feelings about the use of telehealth at our outpatient clinic and their incipient experience with it. Participants were instructed to answer the questions from the patient's perspective, regardless if the survey was filled out by the patients themselves or caregivers. The questionnaire was anonymous, written in Portuguese, and remained open from August 3rd to 9th, 2020. Results: A survey invitation was sent out to 299 patients who had been seen in clinic over the last 12 months. During this period, all patients provided a contact number that could reached through Whatsapp, either on their own or a caregiver's smartphone. Of these, 133 patients answered the survey. The total time to go to and come back from hospital was <30 min for 5%, 30-60 min for 23%, 60-90 min for 20%, 90-120 min for 14% and >120 min for 38%. Total cost to commute to and from hospital (for both the patient and an eventual caregiver) was > US$ 10.00 for 42% (equivalent to 5% of the minimum wage per month). Thirty-two percent of participants reported any degree of mobility disability. Thirty-three and 29% of patients complained of long waiting times for in-person doctor and pharmacy appointments, respectively. In terms of technology, 97% had a personal cell phone or smartphone. Ninety-five percent of patients had access to internet on a smartphone, and 32% through a personal computer (some had both). Sixty-six percent reported no difficulty using a cell phone, 23% some difficulty and 9% significant difficulty. Ninety-five percent regularly used social media apps. Approximately half of the patients had at least one previous interaction via telehealth with our center during the COVID-19 pandemic, of whom 92% considered it a good or very good experience. When inquired if they would like to start receiving or continue to receive telehealth care, 83% answered yes, 10% expressed some interest and 7% declared no interest. When asked about their opinion on widening telehealth use at the HCFMUSP HCT Outpatient Clinic following the pandemic, 43% answered they would certainly use it, 45% thought it could be good, 5% had concerns, 4% were indifferent, and 3% did not approve the idea. Conclusions: In-person appointments seem to be both cost and time-consuming and represent a relevant burden on this limited-resource population. Despite being a public health institution from a middle-income country, most of our patients have personal cell phones with easy internet access. Among those who had an incipient experience with telehealth, the impression was overall positive. We cannot rule out selection bias towards participants who were more familiar with technology and thus more inclined to appreciate telehealth. Taken together, although not always fit for all clinical scenarios, our findings suggest telehealth may be efficient and complementary to in-person interactions with HCT patients, and prompt wider implementation of this health care modality.

Such models project that containment measures flatten the curve, i.e., reduce but delay the peak in daily infections, cause a longer epidemic, and increase the death toll. These projections have entered common understanding; individuals and governments often advocate lifting containment measures such as social distancing to shift the peak forward, limit societal and economic disruption, and reduce mortality. It was, then, an extraordinary surprise to discover that COVID-19 pandemic data exhibit phenomenology opposite to the projections of SIR models. With the knowledge that the commonly used SIR equations only approximate the original equations developed to describe epidemics, we identified a closed form solution to the original epidemic equations. Unlike the commonly used approximations, the closed form solution replicates the observed phenomenology and quantitates pandemic dynamics with simple analytical tools for policy makers.

In 17 % of cases, the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was observed for one or more markers: in three samples, a new coronavirus of the B. 1.1.7 line (British) was detected;in a number of cases, only one mutation was detected in the virus found in samples - deletion Y144 or substitution D138Y, E484K, N501Y, and very rarely two mutations - deletion Y144 and substitution E484K. The presence of the L141-G142-V143 deletion localized in the recurrent deletion region RDR2 of the S-gene was shown in 10 % of the cases. The data obtained indicate the heterogeneity in macroorganism of the population of the new coronavirus with the deletion L141-G142-V143, which leads to a change in the antigenic structure of the virus, which probably allows the virus to evade the immune response. ? 2021 Russian Research Anti-Plague Institute.

The SILS techniques applied to cholecystectomy vary, and reporting has been sparse. Because most cholecystectomies are outpatient procedures performed by busy, practicing general surgeons, the authors report their initial experience adopting this technique. METHODS From March, 2008 to January, 2009, SILS was performed for 100 consecutive outpatients needing cholecystectomy. All the patients underwent a single-incision, multiport laparoscopic (SIMPL) technique using existing instrumentation. The patients were followed postoperatively for at least 6 months. RESULTS Of the 100 patients, 98 underwent SIMPL cholecystectomy and 2 required conversion to the standard laparoscopic technique because of bleeding from the cystic artery. No major postoperative complications occurred, including infections and hernias. CONCLUSIONS The findings show SIMPL cholecystectomy to be safe in the outpatient setting. It is an excellent alternative to traditional three- or four-port cholecystectomy for the ideal candidate with a lower body mass index (BMI), early disease, and no previous abdominal surgery. The authors' initial outpatient experience shows that it can be performed using existing instrumentation without increasing costs by a reproducible technique that can be adopted by any practicing general surgeon.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the first 100 outpatients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2020 y&0131;l&0131;n&0131;n ilk aylar&0131;ndan itibaren ?iddetini art&0131;ran COVID-19 salg&0131;n&0131;etkisini tm alanlarda g?stermektedir Sadece sa&gcaron;l&0131;k politikalar&0131;de&gcaron;il, tm ana ak&0131;m sre?lerde yeniden yap&0131;lanmalar ger?ekle?mektedir Bu kapsamda i?letmeler ve y?netimler de bu salg&0131;ndan byk oranda etkilenmi?lerdir &Iacute;?letme ve muhasebe biliminin en temel varsay&0131;m&0131;olan i?letme sreklili&gcaron;i tehdit edilir hale gelmi?tir Ola&gcaron;an i? sre?lerini devam ettiremeyen i?letmeler kapanma tehdidi ile kar karya kalm&0131;? durumdad&0131;r Bu anlamda i?letmelerin sreklilik mcadelesi verdi&gcaron;i bu zamanlarda denetim ve bams&0131;z denetim olgular&0131;daha da ?nemli hale gelmi?tir ?al&0131;?mada salg&0131;n bask&0131;s&0131;ya?adm&0131;z bu d?nemlerde, BDS 570 kapsam&0131;nda dzenlenen i?letme sreklili&gcaron;i kavram&0131;ve bams&0131;z denetim ili?kisi nitel y?ntemler ile incelenmi?tir ?al&0131;?ma sonucunda i?letme sreklili&gcaron;i ba&gcaron;lam&0131;nda, bams&0131;z denetim olgusunun pozitif katk&0131;sundu&gcaron;u tespit edilmi?tir Alternate abstract:The COVID-19 outbreak, which has increased its severity since the first months of 2020, shows its effect in all areas Restructuring takes place not only in health policies, but in all mainstream processes In this context, businesses and administrations have been greatly affected by this epidemic Go&0131;ng Concern, the basic assumption of business and accounting science, has become threatening Businesses which cannot continue their ordinary business processes are faced with the threat of closure In this sense, audit and independent audit phenomena become even more significant in these times when businesses struggle for continuity During this period of epidemic pressure, the concept of go&0131;ng concern and independent audit, which are regulated within the scope of ISA 570, are examined by qualitative methods As a result of the study, it is determined that the independent audit phenomenon contributes positively in the context of going concern","output":"COVID - 19 GNDEMNDE ?LETME SREKLL?

Methods and results: The Telerehabilitation in Heart Failure Patients trial (TELEREH-HF) is a multicenter, prospective, randomized (1:1), open-label, parallel-group, controlled trial involving HF patients assigned either to HCTR involving a remotely monitored home training program in conjunction with usual care (HCTR group) or usual care only (UC group). The patient in the HCTR group underwent a 9-week HCTR program consisting of two stages: an initial stage (1 week) conducted in hospital and the subsequent stage (eight weeks) of home-based HCTR five times weekly. Due to difficulties of proper assessment and differences in the evaluation of diastolic function in patients with atrial fibrillation, we included in our subanalysis only patients with sinus rhythm. Depending on the grade of diastolic dysfunction, patients were assigned to subgroups with mild diastolic (MDD) or severe diastolic dysfunction (SDD), both in HCTR (HCTR-MDD and HCTR-SDD) and UC groups (UC-MDD and UC-SDD). Changes from baseline to 9 weeks in echocardiographic parameters were seen only in A velocities in HCTR-MDD vs. UC-MDD; no significant shifts between groups of different diastolic dysfunction grades were observed after HCTR. All-cause mortality was higher in UC-SDD vs. UC-MDD with no difference between HCTR-SDD and HCTR-MDD. Higher probability of HF hospitalization was observed in HCTR-SDD than HCTR-MDD and in UC-SDD than UC-MDD. No differences in the probability of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization were found. Conclusions: HCTR did not influence diastolic function in HF patients in a significant manner. The grade of diastolic dysfunction had an impact on mortality only in the UC group and HF hospitalization over a 12C24-month follow-up in HCTR and UC groups.","output":"Prognostic Impact of Hybrid Comprehensive Telerehabilitation Regarding Diastolic Dysfunction in Patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection FractionSubanalysis of the TELEREH-HF Randomized Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a prototypical response to an acute viral infection it would be expected that the adaptive immune response would eliminate all virally infected cells within a few weeks of infection.

It explores the link between innovative food production and food consumption entrepreneurship and underdevelopment based on sustainable development goals (SDGs). The study also generates a conceptual model designed to bridge the development gap between privileged and marginalised communities in SA. Philosophically, an interpretivism research paradigm based on the socialised interpretation of extant literature is pursued. Consistent with this stance, an inductive approach and qualitative methodological choices are applied using a combination of thematic analysis and grounded theory to generate research data. Grounded theory techniques determine the extent to which the literature review readings are simultaneously pursued, analysed, and conceptualised to generate the conceptual model. Research findings highlight the perpetual inequality in land distribution, economic and employability status, social mobility, gender equity, education, emancipation, empowerment, and quality of life between privileged and marginalised societies in SA. Underdevelopment issues such as poverty, unemployment, hunger, criminal activities, therefore, characterise marginalised communities and are linked to SDGs. Arguably, food production and food consumption entrepreneurship are ideally positioned to address underdevelopment by creating job opportunities, generating income, transforming the economic status, social mobility, and quality of life. Although such entrepreneurship development initiatives in SA are acknowledged, their impact remains insignificant because the interventions are traditionally prescriptive, fragmented, linear, and foreign-driven.

AIM The aim of this study was to understand the role and experience of hospital palliative care volunteers. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed and three dissertation databases were searched from inception to June 2019. A forward and backward search of included papers in key journals was also undertaken. Records were independently assessed against inclusion criteria by authors. Included papers were assessed for quality, but none were excluded. RESULTS In total, 14 papers were included. Hospital palliative care volunteers were mostly female, aged above 40 years, and training varied considerably. Volunteers faced unique challenges in supporting dying patients due to the nature of hospital care, rapid patient turnover and the once-off nature of support. Volunteer roles were diverse, with some providing hands-on care, but most focused on 'being with' the dying patient. Volunteers were appreciated for providing psychosocial support, seen as complementary to, rather than replacing the work of health professionals. Given volunteers were often required to work across multiple wards, establishing positive work relationships with health professionals was challenging. Divergent views about whether the volunteer was part of or external to the team impacted volunteers' experience and perceptions of the value of their contribution. CONCLUSION Hospital palliative care volunteers face unique challenges in supporting terminally ill patients. Volunteer support in hospital settings is possible and appropriate, if sufficient support is available to mitigate the challenges associated with complex, high-acuity care.","output":"'It's not what they were expecting': A systematic review and narrative synthesis of the role and experience of the hospital palliative care volunteer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the most accurate way to diagnose an active SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection is through detection of viral RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. While RT-PCR tests are the most sensitive for identifying infection, there are significant limitations, such as global access to sufficient test kits, turnaround times (TAT) from specimen collection to test result is often greater than 24 h and the need for skilled operators in accredited laboratories requiring specialized equipment. A rapid test performed at the point of care (POC) could provide a result within an approximate time of 30 min post specimen collection, be performed by a health care worker and comprise a simple workflow, improving both turnaround time and potentially decreasing costs (e.g., transport, cold-chain, skilled laboratory staff, complex equipment). Determining the performance of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests is, however, easier to assess than antigen-based POCT, as residual clinical specimens (swabs in universal transport media [UTM]) are readily available in laboratory environments, and do not require patient informed consent. Evaluating the performance of POCT requires informed-consent driven studies, with patients required to provide a standard of care specimen as well as study evaluation specimens, which is often not acceptable as nasopharyngeal swabbing can be invasive, clinical field trials are costly and time consuming. Many institutions and regulatory bodies also require preliminary data prior to use in field settings. Therefore, we have developed a method to determine the performance of antigen based POCT that can be used by implementers in national healthcare programs, regulators and rapid test developers. The method investigates both quantitative and qualitative parameters, with the latter providing insights into the capability for implementation and national program uptake.","output":"Antigen-Based Point of Care Testing (POCT) for Diagnosing SARS-CoV-2: Assessing Performance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although much is known about children and teachers' attitudes towards science and science activities, considerably less is known about what parents believe about them.

AIM OF STUDY: This review provided comprehensive and up-to-date information about botanic characterization and distribution, ethnopharmacology, secondary metabolites, pharmacological activities, and toxicology of plants of genus Stemona to explore the scientific potential and future therapeutic potential of the plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article conducted a literature review on information about the Stemona species in multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Wiley, Science Direct, Elsevier, Google Scholar, ACS publications, SpringerLink, Elsevier, and China National Knowledge Internet. Information was also derived from other literature sources (e.g. Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 2015 edition, Chinese herbal classic books, PhD and MSc thesis, etc). RESULTS: Our comprehensive analysis of the scientific literatures indicated that many Stemona species are popular and valuable herbal medicines with therapeutic potentials to treat various ailments. Phytochemical analyses identified alkaloids and stilbenoids as the major bioactive substances of Stemona species. Numerous studies have shown that the extracts and secondary metabolites isolated from these plants have a wide range pharmacological activity, including anti-inflammatory, antitussive, antitumour, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, insecticidal and antifeedant, and anti-virus activities. CONCLUSION: Though plants of genus Stemona have been put to enormous traditional uses, the pharmacological studies conducted were insufficient. Nowadays, researches were mainly focused on the antitussive, anti-inflammatory as well as insecticidal and antifeedant activities. Therefore, more secondary metabolites need to be studied for more detailed pharmacological studies.

Facing this largescale infectious public health event, everyone is under great psychological pressure. The aim was to investigate the psychological status of people affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: The online cross-sectional study involving 922 participants (656 medical staff and 266 general population) was conducted in China between February and March, 2020. The psychological status was evaluated using the Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90). Linear and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the effect in the study. RESULTS: Of the 922 participants, approximately 18.3% had psychological health problems. The score of the SCL-90 was significant higher in medical staff (mean = 1.49) than that in general population (mean = 1.36). In addition, the participants enrolled in March were less likely to have psychological health problems than in February (odds ratio = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30 to 0.59).

DESIGN AND SETTING In-depth interviews were conducted in isiXhosa with purposively selected patients and in English with healthcare workers and key informants. All transcripts were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated to English, manually coded and thematically analysed. The participants had been involved in a randomised controlled trial evaluating multi-month ART dispensing in adherence clubs, comparing 6-month and 2-month refills. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-three patients, seven healthcare workers and six key informants. RESULTS Patients found that 6-month refills increased convenience and reduced unintended disclosure. Contrary to key informant concerns about patients' responsibility to manage larger quantities of ART, patients receiving 6-month refills were highly motivated and did not face challenges transporting, storing or adhering to treatment. All participant groups suggested that strict eligibility criteria were necessary for patients to realise the benefits of extended dispensing intervals. Six-month refills were felt to increase health system efficiency, but there were concerns about whether the existing drug supply system could adapt to 6-month refills on a larger scale. CONCLUSIONS Patients, healthcare workers and key informants found 6-month refills within adherence clubs acceptable and beneficial, but concerns were raised about the reliability of the supply chain to manage extended multi-month dispensing.

CAV was isolated from the liver sample of the chicks, and the isolated strain was designated as CAV/Japan/HS1/17. A phylogenetic analysis of the CAV VP1 gene revealed that CAV/Japan/HS1/17 is genetically similar to Chinese strains collected from 2014 to 2016. An experimental infection was performed using CAV/Japan/HS1/17 and specific-pathogen-free chicks to determine the pathogenicity of CAV/Japan/HS1/17. The isolate caused 100% anemia and 70% mortality to chicks inoculated at one day old, 80% of chicks inoculated at seven days old also developed anemia, and 10% died from CAV infection. These results suggest that the unusually high mortality in Japanese native chicks can be attributed to dual infection with both CAV and IBV. The results of the experimental infection suggest that CAV/Japan/HS1/17 has a pathogenic potential to specific-pathogen-free chicks and a relatively higher pathogenicity than previous Japanese CAV strains.","output":"Pathological and virological analysis of concurrent disease of chicken anemia virus infection and infectious bronchitis in Japanese native chicks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most peptide drugs contain non-proteinogenic amino acids (NPAAs), born out through extensive structureCactivity relationship (SAR) studies using solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).

METHODS Three hundred and five patients with unexplained reduced LVEF 45% who underwent both CA and CMR were retrospectively registered. Patients were classified as CMR+ or CMR- according to presence or absence of myocardial ischemic scar, and classified CA+ or CA- according to presence or absence of significant coronary artery disease(CAD).

CMR had 96% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 99% negative predictive value, and 58% positive predictive value for detecting CA+ patients. Revascularization was performed in 6.5% of the patients (all CMR+). Performing CA only for CMR+ patients would have decreased the number of CAs by 71%.

Often outbreak investigations aim to identify who infected whom by reconstructing the outbreak transmission tree, which visualizes transmission between individuals as a network with nodes representing individuals and branches representing transmission from person to person. We compiled a database of 383 published, standardized transmission trees consisting of 16 directly-transmitted diseases ranging in size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease we calculated several key statistics, such as outbreak size, average number of secondary infections, the dispersion parameter, and the number of superspreaders. We demonstrated the potential utility of the database through short analyses addressing questions about superspreader epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including COVID-19. First, we compared the frequency and contribution of superspreaders to onward transmission across diseases. COVID-19 outbreaks had significantly fewer superspreaders than outbreaks of SARS and MERS and a dispersion parameter between that of SARS and MERS. Across diseases the presence of more superspreaders was associated with greater outbreak size. Second, we further examined how early spread impacts tree size. Generally, trees sparked by a superspreader had larger outbreak sizes than those trees not sparked by a superspreader, and this trend was significant for COVID-19 trees. Third, we investigated patterns in how superspreaders are infected. Across trees with more than one superspreader, we found support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders, even when controlling for number of secondary infections. In sum, our findings put the role of superspreading to COVID-19 transmission in perspective with that of SARS and MERS and suggest an avenue for further research on the generation of superspreaders.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive accuracy of a prognostic model for forecasting the development of the cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries and administrative regions worldwide until the end of May 2020. METHODS: The cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases was forecasted in 251 regions with a horizon of two weeks, one month, and two months using a hierarchical logistic model at the end of March 2020. Forecasts were compared to actual observations by using a series of evaluation metrics. RESULTS: On average, predictive accuracy was very high in nearly all regions at the two weeks forecast, high in most regions at the one month forecast, and notable in the majority of the regions at the two months forecast. Higher accuracy was associated with the availability of more data for estimation and with a more pronounced cumulative case growth from the first case to the date of estimation. In some strongly affected regions, cumulative case counts were considerably underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: With keeping its limitations in mind, the investigated model may be used for the preparation and distribution of resources during the initial phase of epidemics. Future research should primarily address the models assumptions and its scope of applicability.

The mature collagen (type I) was the predominant collagen in the wounds of normal colon. (p=0.0102). On the 3th post-operative day It was also observed that the organization of collagen was poorer on the third day in the colonic wounds with inflammatory bowel disease. Nevertheless, the analysis of the inflammatory reaction at the level of the anastomosis was similar in both groups. These results suggest that inflammatory bowel disease increases the risks of anastomosis dehiscence, probably because of the delay in the maturation and the organisation of collagen.","output":"Cicatrizao de anastomoses do clon esquerdo com doen?a inflamatria: estudo experimental em ratos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There are concerns about pulmonary function tests (PFT) being associated with aerosol generation and enhanced virus transmission. As a consequence, the number of PFTs was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are no robust data supporting this fear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to perform real-life measurement of aerosol concentration in a PFT laboratory to monitor the concentration of particles near the patient and to model the associated potential viral load. METHODS: Two optical particle counters (OPC) were used to sample the background concentration and the concentration of particles in the vicinity of the mouth of the patients in the whole-body plethysmography box. A statistical evaluation of the measured particle concentration time series was completed. The particle exhalation rate was assessed based on the measured particle concentration data by applying the near-field/far-field theory. The number of exhaled viruses by an infected patient during the test was assessed in comparison with the emission of viruses during quiet breathing and speaking. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were involved in the study. Eighteen patients produced a significant increase of the aerosol concentration, which was 1910593 particles/L. Submicron particles dominated the number size distribution of the generated particles, but large particles represented a higher volume fraction in the generated particles compared to the background. An average gene exhalation rate of 0.2/min was estimated from this data. This is one order of magnitude higher than the release rate of the same infected person during quiet breathing and of the same order of magnitude with the release rate during normal speaking. CONCLUSIONS: Present results demonstrated that PFT is an aerosol generating procedure. Based on current results, the moderate increase of viral load does not underpin the stopping of such examinations.","output":"Real-life measurement of size-fractionated aerosol concentration in a plethysmography box during the COVID-19 pandemic and estimation of the associated viral load"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, in the pharmaceutical industry, a growing concern with sustainability has become a strict consideration during the COVID-19 pandemic There is a lack of good mathematical models in the field In this research, a productionCdistributionCinventoryCallocationClocation problem in the sustainable medical supply chain network is designed to fill this gap Also, the distribution of medicines related to COVID-19 patients and the periods of production and delivery of medicine according to the perishability of some medicines are considered In the model, a multi-objective, multi-level, multi-product, and multi-period problem for a sustainable medical supply chain network is designed Three hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms, namely, ant colony optimization, fish swarm algorithm, and firefly algorithm are suggested, hybridized with variable neighborhood search to solve the sustainable medical supply chain network model Response surface method is used to tune the parameters since meta-heuristic algorithms are sensitive to input parameters Six assessment metrics were used to assess the quality of the obtained Pareto frontier by the meta-heuristic algorithms on the considered problems A real case study is used and empirical results indicate the superiority of the hybrid fish swarm algorithm with variable neighborhood search","output":"An integrated sustainable medical supply chain network during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The causative agent of the present COVID-19 pandemic is a novel RNA virus called SARS CoV-2. Clinical laboratory has a central role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and predicting the progression of the disease.

Based on the information from several studies, it is presumed that virus replication alters the immune system of the body. These alterations cause cellular damage in various organs like the lungs, liver, heart, and bone marrow. Ultimately, it may lead to multi-organ failure and death. Methods: An Internet search in Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Scholarly articles was performed. Studies reporting on changes in laboratory parameters in COVID-19 were selected, data extracted, and analyzed. Conclusion: Laboratory markers are helpful in the diagnosis of cases and more importantly, to identify those patients where chances of disease progression to severity are present.

This study examines the effect of edema-related pressure elevation on renal function and describes a simple method to relieve pressure within the renal compartment. METHODS Subcapsular pressure at 6, 12, 24, 48 hr, and 18 days after a 45 min warm ischemia was determined in a murine model of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Renal function was measured by Tc-MAG3 scintigraphy and laser Doppler perfusion. Structural damage was assessed by histologic analysis. As a therapeutic approach, parenchymal pressure was relieved by a standardized circular 0.3 mm incision at the lower pole of the kidney capsule. RESULTS Compared with baseline (0.9+/-0.3 mm Hg), prolonged ischemia was associated with a sevenfold increase in subcapsular pressure 6 hr after ischemia (7.0+/-1.0 mm Hg; P<0.001). Pressure levels remained significantly elevated for 24 hr. Without therapy, a significant decrease in functional parameters was found with considerably reduced tubular excretion rate (33+/-3.5%, P<0.001) and renal perfusion (64.5+/-6.8%, P<0.005). Histologically, severe tissue damage was found. Surgical pressure relief was able to significantly prevent loss of tubular excretion rate (62.5+/-6.8%, P<0.05) and renal blood flow (96.2+/-4.8%; P<0.05) and preserved the integrity of renal structures. CONCLUSIONS Our data support the hypothesis of the existence of a renal compartment syndrome as a consequence of ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Furthermore, the 3D printed electrodes conveniently accommodate other active layers for diverse applications such as energy storage, catalysis, and sensors. Nevertheless, to enhance a complex 3D structure while preserving the fine morphology, conformal deposition by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique is a powerful solution. Herein, we present the concept of coating Al2O3 by ALD with different thicknesses from 20 to 120 cycles on the 3D printed nanocarbon/PLA electrodes for the electrocatalytic oxidation of catechol as an important biomarker. Overall, 80 ALD cycle Al2O3 achieved an optimum thickness for catechol electrocatalysis. This is resonated with the enhanced adsorption of catechol at the electrode surface and efficient electron transfer, according to the two-proton, two-electron-transfer mechanism, as well as for the passivation of surface defects of the nanocarbon electrode.

METHODS: Longitudinal, prospective cohort. Moderate-to-severe QTc prolongation during therapy was defined as a QTc interval exceeding 470 ms in men or 480 ms in women. Patients were treated under strict cardiac supervision. RESULTS: One hundred and five adults, 56% male and median (Q1, Q3) age of 69 (57, 79), were included. All received therapy with HCQ in combination with azithromycin (AZM), and 95 (90%) also with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV). Concomitant medications classified as having risk of developing Torsades de Pointes (TdP) were simultaneously used in 81 (77%) patients. In 14 (13%) subjects, a moderate-to-severe QTc prolongation was observed, mostly at days 3-5 from baseline, with 6 (6%) of them developing severe prolongation (> 500 ms). There was no evidence of TdP arrhythmia or TdP-associated death. Adding LPV/RTV to HCQ/AZM did not significantly prolong the QTc. Multivariable Cox regression revealed that comedications with known risk of TdP (HR 11.28, 95%CI 1.08C117.41), higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (HR 1.10, 95%CI 1.03-1.18 per unit increase) and higher serum HS-cardiac troponin I (HR 4.09, 95%CI 1.36-12.2 per unit increase) were major contributors to moderate-to-severe QTc prolongation. CONCLUSIONS: In this closely screened and monitored cohort, no complications derived from QTc prolongation were observed during pharmacologic therapy containing HCQ for COVID-19. Evidence of myocardial injury with elevated troponin and strong inflammatory response, specifically a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, are conditions under which QTc interval monitoring should be particularly careful.","output":"Predictive factors for cardiac conduction abnormalities with hydroxychloroquine-containing combinations for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To report the Mayo Clinic experience with COVID-19 related to patient outcomes. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020 at any of the Mayo Clinic sites. We abstracted pertinent comorbidities such as age, gender, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) variables, and treatments received. Factors associated with hospitalization and mortality were assessed in univariate and multivariate models. Results A total of 7,891 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with research authorization on file received care across the Mayo Clinic during the study period. Of these, 7217 patients were adults  18 years old which were analyzed further. 897 (11.3%) patients required hospitalization, and 354 (4.5%) patients received care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). All hospitalized patients were reviewed by a COVID-19 Treatment Review Panel, and 77.5% of inpatients received a COVID-19 directed therapy.

METHODS: The study is based on qualitative one-to-one interviews with households with at least two members and at least one PCR confirmed COVID-19 case. Recruitment took place via website or SMS messages sent to PCR confirmed cases in the capital area of Helsinki. Sampling was based on maximum variation to acquire different types of respondents. The framework of health stigma was used to develop question guides and analyze stigma. Quarantine and isolation experiences were explored through open-ended questions. The analysis was based on thematic analysis. RESULTS: The study included 64 participants from 24 households. Perceived stigma among respondents was driven by fear and blame for infection, and it manifested in various ways leading to a reluctance to disclose their coronavirus status to others. Self-stigma developed from conflicting information and advice about coronavirus and COVID-19 led to difficulties interacting with others outside of the house and reluctance to meet people after quarantine and isolation. Quarantine and isolation experiences included uncertainty, health concerns, and boredom. Communication with others in similar situations was perceived vital, whereas discussions with family members about worries and fears related to coronavirus and COVID-19 was not preferred.

Weekly volume data were collected for total imaging studies, abdominopelvic CT, and abdominopelvic CTs positive for common causes of acute nontraumatic abdominal pain. Two emergency radiology attendings scored all diverticulitis cases independently, and weekly volume data for uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis cases was also collected. Volume data prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared, using 2019 volumes as a control. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, overall emergency imaging volume decreased 30% compared to 2019 (p = 0.002). While the number of emergency abdominopelvic CTs positive for appendicitis and small bowel obstruction did not significantly change during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases of diverticulitis decreased significantly compared to 2019 (p = 0.001).

ARI (defined by fever or cough) were considered lower respiratory tract infections if tachypnea, wheezing, grunting, stridor or retractions were present. Nasal swabs collected during ARI episodes were tested for respiratory viruses by real-time, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. ARI incidence was calculated using Poisson regression. RESULTS During 755.1 child-years of observation among 892 children in 58 communities, 4475 ARI were observed, yielding an adjusted incidence of 6.2 ARI/child-year (95% confidence interval: 5.9-6.5). Families sought medical care for 24% of ARI, 4% were classified as lower respiratory tract infections and 1% led to hospitalization. Of 5 deaths among cohort children, 2 were attributed to ARI.

Measures adopted to address these issues have not yielded result on expected lines. But the year 2020 turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the environment. The COVID-19 quarantine lockdown has restricted people to home and brought human activities to a halt; thus, giving an edge to the natural resources to replenish themselves or the freedom of movement to animals in human-dominated lands. Scientists from diverse fields are trying to explore and validate the lockdown impact on ecology through proper scientific methods and data interpretation. This chapter mainly reviews the various studies carried out globally to assess the effects of the lockdown on the ecology and natural resources.

The prediction model is presented based on the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, which has been widely used to describe the epidemic time evolution of infectious diseases. The original version of the Kermack and McKendrick model is used in this study. This included the daily rates of infection spread by infected individuals when these individuals interact with a susceptible population, which is denoted by the parameter , while the recovery rates to determine the number of recovered individuals is expressed by the parameter . The parameters estimation of the three-compartment SIR model is determined through using a mathematical sequential reduction process from the logistic growth model equation. As the parameters are the basic characteristics of epidemic time evolution, the model is always tested and applied to the latest actual data of confirmed COVID-19 cases. It seems that this simple model is still reliable enough to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively with a high degree of correlation between actual data and prediction results. Therefore, it is possible to apply this model to predict cases of COVID-19 in several countries. In addition, the parameter characteristics of the classic SIR model can provide information on how these parameters reflect the efforts by each country to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. This is clearly seen from the changes of the parameters shown by the classic SIR model.","output":"Forecasting the Long-Term Trends of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Epidemic Using the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organic room temperature phosphorescence materials with ultralong lifetime possess the remarkable advantage in bioimaging for elimination of background noise by characteristic time scale.

So far, researchers have explored the predictive effect of diverse factors on pandemic-related psychological distress, but none have focused on the impact of prior depression and anxiety symptomatology adopting an extended (10-year) longitudinal design. 105 patients aged over 60, affected by hypertension who participated in a previous longitudinal study were assessed through a follow-up telephone structured interview. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were used for assessing depression and anxiety symptoms and the psychological impact of COVID-19, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. At the assessment, participants did not report clinically relevant depression, anxiety, and psychological pandemic-related distress symptoms. However, significant mean differences between baseline and current follow-up evaluations for both depression and anxiety were found, reflecting a decrease in symptomatology over time (p < .001). Baseline depression symptoms ( = 1.483, p = .005) significantly predicted the psychological impact of COVID-19 after 10 years. Conversely, their decrease ( = ?1.640, p < .001) and living with others ( = ?7.274, p = .041) significantly contributed to lower psychological distress scores.

Forty-two percent of the respondents practiced in the UK and Ireland. In addition to rejecting or keeping images in the presented 30 cases and giving a main reason for the images rejected, the participants explained their choice using comments, 1176 comments were obtained. Sixty percent of the comments were on kept images. The respondents kept on average 63% of the images.

The most common reasons given for rejecting an image were suboptimal positioning and centering. Potential diagnostic value and radiation protection were indicated as reasons to keep an image perceived as of low quality reported in n = 353 and n = 33 comments respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is an agreement internationally on what makes a good quality X-ray image. However, the opinion on medical usefulness of images of low or poor quality compared to image criteria varies.

This study aims to investigate the change in pore water pressure (PWP) with rainfall infiltration into the slope and the corresponding effect of the slope stability on different hill slopes from different regions of India. By applying rainfall on the surface of slope as a flux boundary condition, a transient seepage analysis is performed using SEEP/W, and the corresponding results in the form of PWP distribution within the slope are used as input for SLOPE/W program of Geostudio 2018 R2, to check the stability of slope. This study involves the use of CMIP5 (Coupled model intercomparision project phase 5) simulations for rainfall data of different regions for the duration of 2015C2050, 2051C2075 and 2076C2100; which is completely based on non-stationary approach (i.e., the statistics of extremes changes with time) rather than the conventional methods of extracting rainfall data that are based on stationary approach. The stability of different slopes is checked for 95 percentile rainfall intensity as well as for maximum rainfall intensity for a period of 2015C2100, and the analysis is performed for 5 days for which the duration of rainfall is considered to be 24 h. It is concluded that due to climate change, slopes which may be marginally stable under historical and present rainfall events can fail under projected precipitation estimates, and this can be understood by the results of Haflong slope stability analysis as the 30 slope, which is marginally stable under maximum rainfall intensity for the period 2015C2050 having factor of safety (FOS) value 1.0013, will fail under the maximum rainfall intensity for the period 2051C2075 and 2076C2100 having FOS value 0.9935 and 0.9989, respectively.

Hence, it is essential to appreciate the influence of age structure while reporting mortality for a better summary of the magnitude of the epidemic. OBJECTIVES: We described and compared the pattern of COVID-19 mortality standardized by age between selected states and India from January to November 2020. METHODS: We initially estimated the Indian population for 2020 using the decadal growth rate from the previous census (2011). This was followed by estimations of crude and age-adjusted mortality rate per million for India and the selected states. We used this information to perform indirect-standardization and derive the age-standardized mortality rates for the states for comparison. In addition, we derived a ratio for age-standardized mortality to compare across age groups within the state. We extracted information regarding COVID-19 deaths from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme special surveillance portal up to November 16, 2020. RESULTS: The crude mortality rate of India stands at 88.9 per million population (118,883/1,337,328,910). Age-adjusted mortality rate (per-million) was highest for Delhi (300.5) and lowest for Kerala (35.9). The age-standardized mortality rate (per million) for India is (<15 years = 1.6, 15C29 years = 6.3, 30C44 years = 35.9, 45C59 years = 198.8, 60C74 years = 571.2, 75 years = 931.6). The ratios for age-standardized mortality increase proportionately from 45 to 59 years age group across all the states. CONCLUSION: There is high COVID-19 mortality not only among the elderly ages, but we also identified heavy impact of COVID-19 on the working population. Therefore, we recommend further evaluation of age-adjusted mortality for all States and inclusion of variables like gender, socio-economic status for standardization while identifying at-risk populations and implementing priority public health actions.","output":"Comparing COVID-19 mortality across selected states in India: The role of age structure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fatty acids (FAs) are essential nutrients, but how they are transported into cells remains unclear. Here, we show that FAs trigger caveolae-dependent CD36 internalization, which in turn delivers FAs into adipocytes. During the process, binding of FAs to CD36 activates its downstream kinase LYN, which phosphorylates DHHC5, the palmitoyl acyltransferase of CD36, at Tyr91 and inactivates it. CD36 then gets depalmitoylated by APT1 and recruits another tyrosine kinase SYK to phosphorylate JNK and VAVs to initiate endocytic uptake of FAs. Blocking CD36 internalization by inhibiting APT1, LYN or SYK abolishes CD36-dependent FA uptake. Restricting CD36 at either palmitoylated or depalmitoylated state eliminates its FA uptake activity, indicating an essential role of dynamic palmitoylation of CD36. Furthermore, blocking endocytosis by targeting LYN or SYK inhibits CD36-dependent lipid droplet growth in adipocytes and high-fat-diet induced weight gain in mice.

In our experiments, the males of S. ovinae developed significantly higher forces on smooth surfaces. However, the forces were significantly lower on all the hymenopteran surfaces used in the experiment. The absence of anisotropy in the force grip in cranial/caudal direction relative to the host might indirectly indicate that S. ovinae generate forces rather by adhesion and not by mechanical interlocking with the host hairs.

Successful application of ECLS has led to its more frequent use in general thoracic surgery, especially as a tool to treat hypercapnia and to ensure oxygenation and haemodynamic support. However, these methods are essential in lung transplant programmes; without their help, in most cases, it would not be possible to perform the transplantation or prevent the severe complications associated with critical primary graft dysfunction. Additionally, the extracorporeal circulation also facilitates the performing of specific surgical procedures that would not be feasible under standard conditions or would be associated with an inadequate risk.

Without the possibility of resecting such structures en bloc, together with the tumour, and, thus, achieving an R0 resection, these malignant tumours are often directly contraindicated for surgery or are operated non-radically, i.e. unsuccessfully.

To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. We show that treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. Further, our results suggest boosting of IFN-induced antiviral activity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication.

We manipulated VSTM load via the number of items in the memory set in a color and location VSTM task and assessed the contrast response function for an orientation discrimination task during maintenance. Attention demand was varied through spatial cuing of the orientation stimulus. Higher VSTM load increased the estimated contrast threshold of the contrast response function without affecting the estimated asymptote, but only when the discrimination task demanded attention. When attentional demand was reduced (in the cued conditions), the VSTM load effects on the contrast threshold were eliminated. The results suggest that VSTM load reduces perceptual sensitivity by increasing contrast thresholds, suggestive of a contrast gain modulation mechanism, as long as the perceptual discrimination task demands attention.

The majority of infected patients (n = 75/111) underwent stem cell transplantation (42 autologous, 48 allogeneic, 15 autologous and allogeneic). LRTI was observed in 48 patients, of whom 15 patients developed severe LRTI, and 13 patients with respiratory tract infection died. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a variety of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), influenza B, parainfluenza 3 and RSV A, B viruses. RSV A was detected in 54 patients, RSV B in ten patients. The newly emerging RSV A genotype ON1 predominated in the study cohort and was found in 48 (75%) of 64 RSV-infected patients. Furthermore, two distinct clusters were detected for RSV A genotype ON1, identical RSV G gene sequences in these patients are consistent with nosocomial transmission. Long-term viral shedding for more than 30 days was significantly associated with prior allogeneic transplantation (p = 0.01) and was most pronounced in patients with RSV infection (n = 16) with a median duration of viral shedding for 80 days (range 35C334 days). Long-term shedding of respiratory viruses might be a catalyzer of nosocomial transmission and must be considered for efficient infection control in immunocompromised patients.","output":"Long-Term Shedding of Influenza Virus, Parainfluenza Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Nosocomial Epidemiology in Patients with Hematological Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ɡлҽѧ־ι˾죬лಡ־༭а죬йƼڿ2019׿ԽжƻݶڿĿ\\"Ը׸߾רֻ\\"202062728ٿءĴ졢ݡϵ90רҴμ˻鼰ۣͲԸ׸߾״ٴӦý˹㷺̽֡.","output":"[Meeting minutes of chronic viral hepatitis symposium on high-precision detection]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to explore the involvement of interleukin 6 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to position the drug siltuximab in the management of severe forms of COVID-19.

This is explored through four themes. First, we show how coughing becomes a matter of biopolitical citizenship expressed through etiquettes that also displace pollution anxieties to surroundings. Second, coughing is a question of being assisted to cough through the mediation of professional skills, interventions and devices. Third, coughing is seen to be central to the sonographic soundscape of the healthcare environment whereby people learn to recognise (and sometimes misrecognise) each other through the sound of the cough. Finally, coughing properly can be seen to have both a time and a place including the retreat of the cough from public space into risky confined spaces.

Western blotting, gelatin zymography, immunohistochemistry (IHC), Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) were used to detect the pathogenesis of ischemia-hypoxia injury. CPT-11 increased levels of tissue factor (TF) both in the blood and in intestines, and decreased the intestinal blood flow in mice.

Intestinal microthrombus and mixed thrombus formation were detectable in chemotherapeutic enteritis. Furthermore, ozone therapy relieved chemotherapeutic enteritis in mice. Ozone inhibited TF expression induced by CPT-11 via activating AMPK/SOCS3, and effectively ameliorated the intestinal mucosal injury in mice. Moreover, ozone autotransfusion therapy effectively attenuated chemotherapeutic enteritis and the blood hypercoagulability in patients.

The incidence of such complications is highly related to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Recent evidence suggests that the coagulopathy of COVID-19 may persist for some period even after the full recovery from pneumonia. We report the case of a 35-year-old man who presented with a 10-day history of fever and cough. His plain radiograph showed bilateral peripherally located opacities suggestive of COVID-19. The diagnosis was confirmed by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). He was placed on a non-invasive ventilator but it failed to maintain normal oxygen saturation. Hence, the decision for intubation was made. He was extubated after 10 days in the ICU. The patient had a complete recovery. One week after discharge, the patient presented with severe abdominal pain that was out of proportion to the physical examination findings. He had an abdominal CT scan, which demonstrated a large thrombus occluding the superior mesenteric artery. There was no bowel dilatation or focal mural thickening to suggest bowel ischemia. The patient was resuscitated with intravenous fluid hydration. Opioid analgesics were administered to control the pain. After stabilizing the patient, he underwent laparotomy with thrombectomy. The patient tolerated the operation with no complications and had an uneventful recovery. The patient was discharged in good condition with no active issues after four days of hospitalization. The superior mesenteric thrombosis is an unusual complication of COVID-19 pneumonia. This case provides further evidence on the possibility of thrombotic events following the recovery from COVID-19.

METHODS: Variables of interest between women living with HIV and men living with HIV were compared. A trend analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox regression analysis were used to study survival. RESULTS: A total of 10,469 people were enrolled; of them, 1,742 (16.6%) were women. At the time of enrolment in the cohort, women living with HIV, compared to men living with HIV, had higher rates of transmission due to intravenous drug use (IDU), hepatitisC virus (HCV) coinfection, AIDS-stage disease and foreign origin. They also had a worse immunovirological status and a lower educational level. These differences were maintained in the trend study. Regarding age, the women included in the cohort were older whereas the men were younger. In the comparative analysis between women according to place of origin, we found that the group of Spanish women living with HIV featured older women with higher rates of IDU transmission and HCV coinfection, whereas the group of women living with HIV born outside of Spain featured women with higher rates of syphilis infection. There were no major differences in relation to other characteristics such as educational level or disease status. Although sex was not a determinant of survival, conditions more prevalent in women were determinants of survival.

This paper presents an investigation into developing a shared understanding of COVID-19 in indigenous communities of Choco, Colombia, that could help them develop effective mitigating practices, while being respectful of their believes. Unstructured interviews and observations were used to explore how indigenous communities perceive and respond to COVID-19. Based on these, a communicative strategy was developed using participatory design and gamification approach, that aimed at bridging their beliefs and traditional ancestral medicine with the official medical recommendations for prevention of the virus transmission. The findings revealed that the intervention became a trigger for mindful discussion within indigenous communities about the preventive measures from the virus, while gamification elements acted as an enabler of such discussion and created more trusting attitude towards the recommendations. Based on the initial findings, we discuss challenges of conducting indigenous research, including the role of trust between researchers and the communities, gamification as an enabler of shared knowing of a problem matter, and the importance of flexible participatory research methods whereby indigenous people are treated not as mere researched, but as full participants of the study.

In this study, its use as a potential measure for cancer patients at the end of life (EOL) was explored. METHODS Patient demographics and health care use among Medicare beneficiaries with cancer who died over the years 2014 to 2017 were identified. The HDAH was calculated by subtracting the following components from 180 days: number of days spent in inpatient and outpatient hospital observation, the emergency room, skilled nursing facilities (SNF), inpatient psychiatry, inpatient rehabilitation, long-term hospitals, and inpatient hospice. How HDAH and its components varied by beneficiary demographics and health care market were evaluated. A patient-level linear regression model with HDAH as the outcome, hospital referral region (HRR) random effects, and market fixed effects were specified, as well as beneficiary age, sex, and comorbidities as covariates. RESULTS The 294,751 beneficiaries at the EOL showed a mean number of 154.0 HDAH (out of 180 days). Inpatient (10.7 days) and SNF (9.7 days) resulted in the most substantial reductions in HDAH. Males had fewer adjusted HDAH (153.1 vs 155.7, P < .001) than females; Medicaid-eligible patients had fewer HDAH compared with non-Medicaid-eligible patients (152.0 vs 154.9; P < .001). Those with hematologic malignancies had the fewest number of HDAH (148.9). Across HRRs, HDAH ranged from 10.8 fewer to 10.9 more days than the national mean. At the HRR-level, home hospice was associated with greater HDAH, whereas home health was associated with fewer HDAH.

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Shifa International Hospital (SIH), Islamabad from March to June 2020. METHODOLOGY After IRB approval, 112 patients were consecutively enrolled, having laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalised in SIH. Patients' demographics and clinical data were retrieved from Radiology Information System (RIS). Chest radiographs (CXR) were retrieved from picture archive and communication system (PACS). CXR severity scoring was determined by three radiologists, and results were analysed. RESULTS Lung opacities (98.2%), involvement of both lungs (96.4%), both peripheral and central region involvement (62.5%) and upper/mid/lower zone distribution (61.6%) were the most frequent findings. Males affected more than females with a mean age of 58.9  13.1 years. Zonal involvement, density and extent of opacities peaked on 10-13th day of illness. In the last CXR, opacities showed decrease in extent as well as density, reduction in zonal involvement, and few having mixed interstitial thickening/fibrosis. One hundred and five out of 112 (93.8%) patients had residual radiographic abnormalities on discharge.

Methods: Data from a supplemental COVID-19 survey from the Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS-TILDA) (n=710) was used to assess outcomes from the first infection wave of COVID-19 among adults with intellectual disability aged 40+ years in Ireland. Data was gathered on testing, for symptoms and outcomes; procedures to manage COVID-19; and both stress/anxiety and positive experiences during the pandemic. Demographic and health-related data from the main IDS-TILDA dataset was included in analyses. Results: High rates were identified of health conditions associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes, including overweight/obesity (66.6%, n=365), high cholesterol (38.6%, n=274) and cardiovascular disease (33.7%, n=239). Over half (53.5%, n=380) reported emotional, nervous or psychiatric disorders. Almost two-thirds (62.4%, n=443) were tested for COVID-19, with 10% (n=71) reporting symptoms and 2.5% (n=11) testing positive. There were no instances of COVID-19 related mortality. Common symptoms included fatigue, fever, and cough. Some participants (7.8%, n=55) moved from their usual home to isolate, most often (n=31) or relocate to a family home (n=11). Three-quarters (78.7%) of those who were symptomatic or who tested positive had plans to manage self-isolation and two-thirds were able to comply with guidelines. Over half (55%, n=383) reported some COVID-19 related stress/anxiety; and a similar proportion reported positive aspects during this period (58%, n=381). Conclusions: Our data suggests that people with intellectual disability avoided the worst impacts of COVID-19 during the first infection wave in Ireland. Nevertheless, participants' health profiles suggest that this population remains at high risk for adverse infection outcomes.

IGs success in the B2B segment was because of Shaikhs ability to build strong relationships and customised solutions in an emerging market context. To deal with the COVID pandemic, the Indian Government had imposed a country-wide lockdown, which forced organisations to adopt work from home. This, in turn, created a pull for IFPDs.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective, population-based cohort study including early stage (Stage I-II) breast cancer patients who underwent resection between 2006 and 2018 in a New York City hospital system. The primary outcome was oncologic follow-up prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary analyses compared differences in follow-up by COVID-19 case rates stratified by ZIP code. RESULTS: A total of 2942 patients with early-stage breast cancer were available for analysis. 1588 (54%) of patients had attended follow-up in the year prior to the COVID-19 period but failed to continue to follow-up during the pandemic, either in-person or via telemedicine. 1242 (42%) patients attended a follow-up appointment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with patients who did not present for follow-up during COVID-19, patients who continued their oncologic follow-up during the pandemic were younger (p = 0.049) more likely to have received adjuvant radiation therapy (p = 0.025), and have lower household income (p = 0.031) on multivariate modeling. When patients who live in Bronx, New York, were stratified by ZIP code, there was a modest negative association (r = ?0.56) between COVID-19 cases and proportion of patients who continued to follow-up during the COVID-19 period. CONCLUSION: We observed a dramatic disruption in routine breast cancer follow-up during the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers and health systems should emphasize reintegrating patients who missed appointments during COVID-19 back into regular surveillance programs to avoid significant morbidity and mortality from missed breast cancer recurrences.","output":"Breast cancer survivorship care during the COVID-19 pandemic within an urban New York Hospital System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emergence of novel respiratory viruses such as avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) highlights the importance of understanding determinants of transmission to healthcare workers (HCWs) and the public. OBJECTIVES: We aim to determine the viral content of the air emitted by symptomatic inpatients or long-term care residents with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection (emitters), and in the breathing zones of healthcare workers who attend to them. DESIGN: A prospective pilot study of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was undertaken. Air within 1 m of the patient was sampled using a high volume air sampler. In addition, a lower volume air sampler was placed <1 m from the patient, with another >1 m from the patient. Viral RNA was recovered from the samplers and submitted for quantitative real time PCR. In addition, personal button samplers were provided to HCWs. RESULTS: The air emitted by 15 participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was sampled. Of the patients infected with influenza A, viral RNA was recovered from the air emitted by 9/12 patients using the low-volume sampler; no viral RNA was detected from air emitted by patients with influenza B (n = 3). Influenza virus RNA was recovered from one HCWs sampler. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with respiratory virus infection emit virus into the air which disperses to >1 m and may reach the breathing zone of a HCW. This pilot study highlights the feasibility and importance of conducting a larger-scale study to identify determinants of exposure and transmission from patient to HCW.","output":"Influenza virus emitted by naturally-infected hosts in a healthcare setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between lumbar lordosis and severe menstrual pain and bleeding for the improvement of the health status in women. This was a quasi-experimental study where the effects of a training program, (based on correctional and therapeutic exercises, on primary dysmenorrhoea and menstrual bleeding in women with hyper-lordosis) was determined. The severity of menstrual pain was evaluated by use of a questionnaire. There was a significant incidence of neurological pain, which was not reduced in the control group (who had no exercise). There was a significant relationship between the severity of menstrual pain and hyper-lordosis. In the intervention group, there was a significant decrease in the severity of menstrual pain following 12 weeks of exercise.

We evaluate the eight boarding methods using three performance metrics related to passenger health and one operational metric (airplane boarding time) for a one-door airplane. The three health metrics reflect the risks of virus spread by passengers through the air and surfaces (e.g. headrests and seat arms) and consider the amount of aisle social distancing between adjacent boarding passengers walking towards their seats. For an airline that highly values the avoidance of window seat risk, the best method to use is one of the new methods: back-to-front by row C WilMA, though it will result in a longer time to complete boarding of the airplane.

The objective of this study is to explore the impact of the pandemic and of the measures adopted on breastfeeding initiation and maintenance. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted by means in-depth semi-structured interviews, until reaching data saturation. The study was conducted between the months of January to May 2021. Participants were recruited by midwives from the Primary Care Centres of the Andalusian provinces provinces of Seville, Cdiz, Huelva, Granada, and Jan. The interviews were conducted via phone call and were subsequently transcribed and analysed by means of reflexive inductive thematic analysis, using Braun and Clarkes thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 30 interviews were conducted. Five main themes and ten subthemes were developed, namely: Information received (access to the information, figure who provided the information), unequal support from the professionals during the pandemic (support to postpartum hospitalization, support received from Primary Health Care during the postpartum period), social and family support about breastfeeding (support groups, family support), impact of confinement and of social restriction measures (positive influence on breastfeeding, influence on bonding with the newborn), emotional effect of the pandemic (insecurity and fear related to contagion by coronavirus, feelings of loneliness). CONCLUSION: The use of online breastfeeding support groups through applications such as WhatsApp?, Facebook? or Instagram? has provided important breastfeeding information and support sources. The main figure identified that has provided formal breastfeeding support during this period was that of the midwife. In addition, the social restrictions inherent to the pandemic have exerted a positive effect for women in bonding and breastfeeding, as a consequence of the increase in the time spent at their homes and in the family nucleus co-living.

DN-PMF was applied to hourly speciated particulate composition data from a field campaign that included the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. DN-PMF sharpened the morning coal combustion and rush hour traffic peaks and lowered the daytime soil, aged sea salt, and waste incinerator contributions that better reflect the actual emissions. These results identified significant changes in source contributions after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. During this pandemic, secondary inorganic aerosol became the predominant PM2.5 source representing 50.5% of the mean mass.

The answer to which modes of transport should become a priority in the context of incurred and planned investments should largely depend on their observed and forecasted environmental impact. This paper focuses on the scope and content of EU macro-regional strategies. The main objectives of the study were to identify common assumptions and differences between the Adriatic and Ionian Region and the Baltic Sea Region in terms of sustainable transport and provide a critical assessment of the EU Strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Region (EUSAIR) and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR) compliance with the assumptions of the White Paper on Transport, as well as the attempt to answer the question of which modes of transport should be prioritized by the analyzed macro-regions, making transport decarbonization one of their main goals. It is possible to state that the assumptions of both the strategies of the macro-regions seem to be partially consistent with the White Paper on Transport vision. However, the emphasis of the macro-regions on the development of maritime transport is somewhat omitted in the White Paper. Among the countries of both areas (EUSAIR, EUSBSR), estimates showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive impact on the volume of loads transported by road transport. An increase in the volume loads by 1% resulted in an increase in air pollution by 0.446% (EUSAIR) and 0.728% (EUSBSR). The elasticity of air pollution, regarding loads road transport changes, was the highest compared to other transport modes in the studied areas. This proves the highest emissivity of road transport. In the EUSAIR countries, an increase by 1% of the volume of transport by railway resulted in a decrease in air pollution, with emissions of greenhouse gases decreasing by 0.063%. Considering the analyzed documentation, reports, strategies, and assumptions, it seems right to clearly emphasize the role of rail transport in the decarbonization of transport. According to the authors, mainly, this branch of transport can significantly reduce the emission of gases into the atmosphere and thus contribute to the so-called green deal. However, many activities must be undertaken for this to happen, not only investment ones. First of all, it is worth paying attention to the coherence of regional strategies with the European transport development plan contained in the White Paper.","output":"Maritime or Rail: Which of These Will Save the Planet?

Methods Observational multicenter cohort of patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS, comparing antiviral strategies (none, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir (L/R), others (combination or remdesivir). The primary end-point was the day-28 ventilator free days (VFD), patients which died before d28 were considered as having 0 VFD. The variable was dichotomized in patients still ventilated or dead at day 28 vs patients being extubated and alive at day 28 (VFD = or > 0). Results We analyzed 376 patients (80 with standard of care (SOC), 49 treated with L/R, 197 with HCQ, and 50 others). The median number of d28-VFD was 0 (IQR 0-13) and was different across the different groups (P=0.01), the SOC patients having the highest d28-VFD. A multivariate logistic regression including antiviral strategies, showed that age (OR 0.95 CI95%:0.93-0.98), male gender (OR 0.53 CI95%:0.31-0.93), Charlson score (OR 0.85 CI95%:0.73-0.99) and plateau pressure (OR 0.94 CI95%:0.88-0.99) were associated with having 0 d28-VFD whereas P/F ratio (OR 1.005 CI95%:1.001-1.010) was associated with having > or = 1 d28-VFD (ie. being extubated and alive).

This review summarises the data and outlines the potential challenges in the field of long-acting antiretroviral therapy (ART). RECENT FINDINGS In recent years, monthly and two monthly long-acting injectable ART in the form of cabotegravir and rilpivirine has shown safety and efficacy in large-scale phase 3 randomised control trials. Also, agents with novel mechanisms of action, such as Lenacapavir, have been tested in early-phase studies and are currently being tested in phase 2-3 clinical trials; if successful, this may allow six-monthly dosing schedules. SUMMARY However, despite evidence that suggests that these therapies are efficacious and acceptable to patients, the challenge of integrating these agents into our current healthcare infrastructure and making these novel agents cost-effective and available to the populations most likely to benefit remains. The next frontier for long-acting therapy will be to introduce these agents in a real-world setting ensuring that the groups most in need of long-acting therapy are not left behind.","output":"Long-acting injectable HIV therapies: the next frontier."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sampling is an effective approach for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

CASE REPORTS A 69-year-old woman presented with bilateral optic nerve head oedema, 16 days after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. She was diagnosed with post-vaccination CNS inflammatory syndrome and was treated for five days with intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 gram per day. Her optic disc swelling improved, and her vision stabilised. A 32-year-old woman presented six days after her first dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine with two days of sudden onset of progressive blurring of vision in her left eye. Posterior segment examination revealed left optic disc swelling, and an MRI of the brain, orbit, and cervical spine was significant for left optic nerve enhancement. The patient was diagnosed with a unilateral post-vaccination optic neuritis. She was treated with a three-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone. Her optic disc swelling and visual field improved, and she recovered 6/6 vision. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians and patients should be aware of the potential for post-vaccination CNS inflammatory syndromes associated with COVID-19 vaccine administration. Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis may aid in the diagnosis of the cause of vision loss.

Training laypeople how to perform CPR is vital, but skill decays quickly. Most methods of training require face-to-face contact which is challenging during the Covid-19 pandemic. The optimal method of delivering CPR refresher training is not yet known. Our aim was to understand how basic life support (BLS) performance decays over time, and how best to deliver refresher training in terms of timeframe and training method C are methods with limited instructor / student contact effective? Methods: this quasi-randomised trial allocated participants to receive refresher training one, two, or three years after their initial BLS training. Participants baseline BLS performance was assessed by a trained instructor, and then they were randomly allocated to receive refresher training via one of three methods: one-to-one instructor led training, video assisted learning with self-directed practice, or a written information guide alone. BLS performance was assessed again following refresher training. Results: 42 participants were recruited - all completed all study stages. Baseline BLS performance was poor C only 21% of participants passed a formative assessment. Students who had received BLS training most recently showed better BLS performance than those where greater time had elapsed. one-to-one training was the most effective refresher training modality, and video assisted training did not lead to significant improvement in BLS performance. Conclusion: one-to-one BLS refresher training outperforms self-directed methods with more limited instructor contact, though it requires greater resource and planning. It may be impractical to deliver instructor-led BLS refresher training during the Covid-19 pandemic. The video we chose to use for our training was not interactive, though such tools exist.

We performed a meta-analysis to characterize the dynamics and influencing factors of HBsAg. METHODS Literature search was conducted through PubMed from January 1995 to May 2015 for papers reporting HBsAg in patients receiving various anti-viral treatments. We conducted weighted linear regression to select for potential influencing factors on maximum HBsAg loss percentage, and subgroup analysis to calculate the pooled estimates of maximum HBsAg loss and seroconversion percentage following treatment of interferon (IFN), nucleoside analogue (NUC), or combination therapies (NUC+IFN), respectively. Study heterogeneity was assessed through sensitivity test and I-square statistics. RESULTS We collected data from 24 papers involving 6674 adult CHB patients. In most studies, average HBsAg level decreased during treatment but relapsed after treatment cessation, while HBsAg loss or seroconversion percentage continued to increase or remain stable after treatment cessation. No strong relationship was observed between maximum HBsAg change and its baseline level. The pooled estimates of maximum HBsAg loss percentage for IFN (5.3%, 2.7%-7.9%) and NUC+IFN (5.2%, 3.1%-7.4%) were significantly higher than that of NUC (0.93%, 0.29%-1.6%). Higher maximum HBsAg loss percentage is associated with longer peak time. Pooled maximum HBsAg seroconversion percentage estimates were 1.6%, 0.56% and 6.2% for IFN, NUC and NUC+IFN. CONCLUSIONS With respect to HBsAg lowering, this meta-analysis confirmed the importance of longer treatment duration and addition of IFN, which revealed the potential value of immune-based therapies.","output":"Dynamics of HBV surface antigen related endpoints in chronic hepatitis B infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In India, the SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 epidemic has grown to 1251 cases and 32 deaths as on 30 Mar 2020. The healthcare impact of the epidemic in India was studied using a stochastic mathematical model. METHODS: A compartmental SEIR model was developed, in which the flow of individuals through compartments is modeled using a set of differential equations. Different scenarios were modeled with 1000 runs of Monte Carlo simulation each using MATLAB. Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) requirements, and deaths were modeled on SimVoi software. The impact of nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) including social distancing and lockdown on checking the epidemic was estimated. RESULTS: Uninterrupted epidemic in India would have resulted in more than 364 million cases and 1.56 million deaths with peak by mid-July. As per the model, at current growth rate of 1.15, India is likely to reach approximately 3 million cases by 25 May, implying 125,455 (18,034) hospitalizations, 26,130 (3298) ICU admissions, and 13,447 (1819) deaths. This would overwhelm India's healthcare system. The model shows that with immediate institution of NPIs, the epidemic might still be checked by mid-April 2020. It would then result in 241,974 (33,735) total infections, 10,214 (1649) hospitalizations, 2121 (334) ICU admissions, and 1081 (169) deaths. CONCLUSION: At the current growth rate of epidemic, India's healthcare resources will be overwhelmed by the end of May.

The general advice given for prenatal care is to reduce face-to-face visits. All women who refer for prenatal visits should be evaluated for signs of the infection at the time of entry. The triage of suspected women should be done separately from other patients. Outpatient monitoring with a 14-day selfquarantine can be considered for asymptomatic infected women and for those with mild symptoms. Inpatient management criteria include moderate to severe symptoms and the target level of oxygen saturation is 92 to 95% in different guidelines. In the presence of fever, it is important to conduct a thorough examination of other causes of the fever. It is important to monitor fluid intake and output, maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and prevent fluid overload. Thromboembolic prophylaxis is recommended. Corticosteroid administration is based on obstetrics indications, while in critical ill cases, it should be based on multi-disciplinary teams (MDT) decision. A positive COVID-19 result in the absence of other obstetrics causes, cannot be considered an indication for delivery in mild and asymptomatic cases. In critically ill pregnant women, an individualized decision should be made about delivery time by the MDT. General anesthetic should be avoided unless inevitable for standard procedures such as intubation is an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP). There is agreement on the point that babies born to infected mothers, even if isolated from the mother at birth, should be considered a close contact of the mother and tested for COVID-19 and separated from other neonates.

This retrospective study is the first from Jordan to report the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics of COVID-19 infected patients. Methods: All patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR in the North of Jordan admitted between March 15 and April 2, 2020 were included. The clinical features, radiological, and laboratory findings were reviewed. Results: Of 81 patients affected, 79 (97.5%) shared a common exposure to four recent travelers from endemic areas. The mean age was 40 years. Although about half (44 [54.3%]) were females, symptomatic patients were mostly females (75%). The most common presenting symptoms were nasal congestion, sore throat and dry cough. Less than one-third (31%) had chronic diseases. Although 84% of patients reported receiving Bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination, more asymptomatic patients had BCG than symptomatic (p = 0.017). Almost all patients (97.5%) had an elevated D-dimer level. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein were elevated in 50% and 42.7% of patients, respectively.

However, the acceptance of different EMH services has yet barely been examined in future generations of psychotherapists in a differentiated manner. The aims of this study were (1) to elaborate the intention to use various EMH services for different application purposes and (2) to determine predictors of EMH service acceptance among psychotherapists in clinical training (PiT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our paper is based on a secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional survey. Respondents were recruited via recognized educational institutions for psychotherapy within Germany and the German-speaking part of Switzerland between June and July of 2020. The survey contained items on the intention to use different EMH services (i.e., guided and unguided programs, virtual reality, psychotherapy by telephone and videoconference) for various application purposes (i.e., prevention, treatment addition, treatment substitute, aftercare). Potential predictors of EMH service acceptance (e.g., barriers and advantages) were examined based on an extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). RESULTS: Most of the n = 216 respondents were female (88.4%) and located in Germany (72.2%). General acceptance of EMH was moderate (M = 3.4, SD = 1.12, range 1C5), while acceptance of psychotherapy via videoconference was highest (M = 3.7, SD = 1.15) and acceptance of unguided programs was lowest (M = 2.55, SD = 1.14). There was an interaction effect of EMH service and application purpose ((2) = 0.21). Barriers and advantages both had a uniform influence on EMH service acceptance (Pr > 0.999), while impersonality, legal concerns, concerns about therapeutic alliance, simplified information provision, simplified contact maintenance, time flexibility, and geographic flexibility were significant predictors (all p < 0.05). Results showed that the extended UTAUT model was the best fitting model to predict EMH service acceptance (Pr > 0.999). CONCLUSIONS: The intention to use different EMH services varied between application purposes among PiT. To increase acceptance of EMH services and reduce misconceptions, we identified predictors that should be addressed in future acceptance-facilitating interventions when educating PiT.","output":"Acceptance of E-Mental Health Services for Different Application Purposes Among Psychotherapists in Clinical Training in Germany and Switzerland: Secondary Analysis of a Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-specific Hospital-at-Home was implemented in a 400-bed tertiary hospital in Barcelona, Spain.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a total of 50 investigations in which we documented a complete valve closure at the so called \\"crosse\\" at the valve of the large saphenous vein, a delayed valve closure or an incomplete valve closure with consecutive insufficiency at the crosse. The valve function of the crosse is crucial for the development of varicosis. For our study we recorded age and gender of the patients. One patient in the study was suffering from Covid19. For the examinations we used a 3-9aMHz probe and a high-end ultrasound device. The examination was performed in a lying position and under quiet conditions. Before examination we practiced inhalation and exhalation as well as \\"pressing\\" or coughing with the patients, which resulted in a physiological closure of the venous valves. To rule out thrombosis, we carried out compression sonography on the legs. During the examination we documented the B-scan, the Color-Coded Duplex Sonography, the HR-flow and the V-flow for 3 seconds at the estuary of the crosses and incorporated these parameters into our measurements. Via V-flow, vectors can be imaged by representing the flow of erythrocytes and visually indicate a possible insufficiency due to delayed or incomplete valve closure. RESULTS: 31 of 50 patients (age 19-81years) showed a complete valve closure of the crosses, three of them suffered from thrombosis. In eight of the 50 study participants (age 45-79 years) a delayed valve closure could be diagnosed by V-flow within 1-2 seconds. None of them had a thrombosis, but six of them suffered from cancer. In eleven patients we derived an incomplete valve closure with insufficiency (age 51-88 years). With reflux it took >2 seconds to close the valve. The patient with Covid19 also showed an incomplete valve closure with insufficiency. At the same time this patient showed a Covid19-associated deep vein thrombosis.

However, research on the antecedents, consequences, and buffers of work loneliness is scarce. Integrating research on need for belonging, regulatory loop models of loneliness, and self-compassion, the current study addresses this critical issue by developing and testing a conceptual model that highlights how COVID-related stressors frustrate employees' need for belonging (i.e., telecommuting frequency, job insecurity, and a lack of COVID-related informational justice), negatively impacting worker well-being (i.e., depression) and helping behaviors [i.e., organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)] through work loneliness. Furthermore, we examine the buffering role of self-compassion in this process. Results from a weekly diary study of U.S. employees conducted over 2 months during the initial stage of the pandemic provide support for the mediating role of work loneliness in relations between all three proposed antecedents and both outcomes. In addition, self-compassion mitigated the positive within-person relationship between work loneliness and employee depression, indicating that more self-compassionate employees were better able to cope with their feelings of work loneliness. Although self-compassion also moderated the within-person relationship between work loneliness and OCB, this interaction was different in form from our prediction. Implications for enhancing employee well-being and helping behaviors during and beyond the pandemic are discussed.

The present study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and factors associated with BCoV serological status using a commercial indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the western region of Thailand. Blood samples were collected from 30 dairy herds. In total, 617 blood serum samples were tested using a commercial indirect ELISA for BCoV-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies. A questionnaire was used to collect data on the factors which have been identified as risk factors for BCoV antibody detection. The age and history of diarrhea of each animal were recorded. Fishers exact test was performed to univariately assess the association between BCoV serological status and possible risk factors. Variables with Fishers exact test p<0.10 were then evaluated using multivariate logistic regression to identify factors associated with BCoV serological status. The Bonferroni adjustment was used for multiple comparisons of significant variables in the final multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: No herd was free from antibodies to BCoV. The individual seroprevalence of BCoV was 97.89% (604/617). The prevalence within herds was in the range of 45.45-100%. Cattle >3 years of age were more likely to be seropositive to BCoV compared to cattle <1 year of age (p=0.003), with the odds ratio being 81.96. Disinfecting diarrhea stools were a protective factor for being BCoV seropositive, with odds ratios of 0.08 and 0.06 compared to doing nothing (p=0.008) and to clean with water (p=0.002), respectively. CONCLUSION: BCoV seropositive dairy cattle were distributed throughout the western region of Thailand. The probability of being seropositive for BCoV increased with increasing animal age.

The responses required during such a pandemic would benefit from an efficiently designed model for robust and sustainable healthcare logistics. In this study, we focus on home healthcare logistics and services for planning the routing and scheduling of caregivers to visit patientshomes. Due to the need for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, these services are highly applicable for reducing the growth of the epidemic. In addition to this challenge, home healthcare logistics and services must be redesigned to meet the standards of a triple bottom line approach based on sustainable development goals. A triple bottom line approach finds a balance between economic, environmental, and social criteria for making a sustainable decision. Although, recently, the concept of green home healthcare has been studied based on the total cost and green emissions of home healthcare logistics and services, as far as we know, no research has been conducted on the formulation of a triple bottom line approach for home healthcare logistics and services. To achieve social justice for caregivers, the goal of balancing working time is to find a balance between unemployment time and overtime. Another contribution of this research is to develop a scenario-based robust optimization approach to address the uncertainty of home healthcare logistics and services and to assist with making robust decisions for home healthcare planning. Since our multi-objective optimization model for sustainable and robust home healthcare logistics and services is more complex than other studies, the last novel contribution of this research is to establish an efficient heuristic algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation theory. An initial solution is found by defining three heuristic algorithms. Our heuristic algorithms use a symmetric pattern for allocating patients to pharmacies and planning the routing of caregivers. Then, a combination of the epsilon constraint method and the Lagrangian relaxation theory is proposed to generate high-quality Pareto-based solutions in a reasonable time period. Finally, an extensive analysis is done to show that our multi-objective optimization model and proposed heuristic algorithm are efficient and practical, as well as some sensitivities are studied to provide some managerial insights for achieving sustainable and robust home healthcare services in practice.","output":"Sustainable and Robust Home Healthcare Logistics: A Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease is a highly infectious and fatal disease. It has caused distress in the form of fear, and anxiety among masses including youth. The psychosocial health of youth is important to build resilient nations after the pandemic is over.This study aimed to capture the level of COVID-19 fear among youth studying in a northern Indian university and to compare it with demographic variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study (AprilCMay 2020) conducted among university students in North India. Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was used for online survey using Google Forms. FCV-19S is a reliable tool for assessing the fear of COVID-19 among the general population. Descriptive statistics and principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 521 responses were recorded. The majority (78%) of the participants were in the age group of 18C23 years and more than half (57%) were pursuing graduation. The respondents belonged to 16 states and union territories in the country. A total of 17% reported severe fear, while a few reported moderate (17%) or mild (11%) fear on the FCV-19S. No respondent could be categorized with no fear based on the overall FCV-19S score. Approximately, 42% of respondents were nervous after watching news/social media posts about COVID-19. Based on PCA, factor 1 labeled as anxiety toward COVID-19, factor 2 media effect on shaping of fear, and factor 3 thanatophobia as contributing factors for fear among youth.

Nitric oxide also has an antimicrobial effect on a broad spectrum of pathogenic viruses, bacteria and fungi. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of inhaled NO on bacterial burden and disease outcome in a murine model of Klebsiella pneumonia. METHODS: Mice were infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae and inhaled either air alone, air mixed with constant levels of NO (at 80, 160, or 200 parts per million (ppm)) or air intermittently mixed with high dose NO (300 ppm). Forty-eight hours after airway inoculation, the number of viable bacteria in lung, spleen and blood was determined. The extent of infiltration of the lungs by inflammatory cells and the level of myeloperoxidase activity in the lungs were measured. Atomic force microscopy was used to investigate a possible mechanism by which nitric oxide exerts a bactericidal effect. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared to control animals infected with K. pneumoniae and breathed air alone, intermittent breathing of NO (300ppm) reduced viable bacterial counts in lung and spleen tissue. Inhaled NO reduced infection-induced lung inflammation and improved overall survival of mice. NO destroyed the cell wall of K. pneumoniae and killed multiple-drug resistant K. pneumoniae in-vitro.

Aim: The present study was conducted to know the epidemiological profile and clinical outcome of COVID-19 positive patients to help in understanding the disease dynamics. Materials and Methods: It was a cross-sectional, record based study at a tertiary care hospital. All the COVID-19 laboratory confirmed positive patients admitted from 15-06-2020 to 15-09-2020 were included in the study. Sample size was 1146. All the required data regarding patients was collected and analysed subsequently with the help of percentages, Z test for proportion, chi-square test and Odds ratio. Results: The mean age of the patients was 47.06 17.4 years ranging from 1 to 92 years. Males were significantly higher in numbers than females. 30.19% patients had some or other co-morbidities. 89.8% patients were discharged and 9.2% patients died. More number of deaths occurred in higher age group and highest death rate was seen in the patients who had multiple co-morbidities. Conclusion: The study concludes that most of the COVID-19 patients were middle aged and males were significantly more affected than females. Most of the patients were asymptomatic at the time of admission. It can be concluded that maximum patients had favourable clinical outcome as 90% patients being discharged and case fatality rate was 9.2%.

To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV sequence. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019-nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake.

This created significant organizational challenges including numerous non-specialist ICU caregivers who came to work in the ICU. In this context, pragmatic protocols were essential to simplify nutritional care. We aimed at providing a simple and easy-to-prescribe nutritional protocol and evaluated its usefulness with questionnaires sent to physicians involved in the care of ICU COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A simplified nutrition protocol was distributed to all physicians (n = 122) of the ICU medical team during COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical dieticians estimated energy targets for acute and post-acute phases at patient's admission and suggested adaptations of nutrition therapy. More complex situations were discussed with clinical nutrition doctors and, if required, a clinical evaluation was performed. To further facilitate the procedure, a chart with prescription aids was also distributed to the whole medical ICU team. At the end of the current pandemic wave, a 13-item questionnaire was emailed to the ICU medical team to obtain their opinion on the suggested nutritional therapy. RESULTS: Answers were received from 81/122 medical doctors (MDs) (66% response rate), from intensive care physicians (41%), anaesthesiologists (53%) and MDs from other specialties (6%). Thirty-two percent of MDs felt that their knowledge of nutrition management was insufficient and 45% of the physicians surveyed did not face nutrition management in their daily practice prior to the pandemic. The initially proposed nutritional protocol, the chart with prescription aids and the suggested nutritional proposals were considered as useful to very useful by the majority of physicians surveyed (89.9, 90.7 and 92.1% respectively). The protocol was followed by 92% of MDs, and almost all participants (95%) were convinced that adaptations of nutritional therapy had beneficial effects on patients' outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients is a challenge and the implementation of this specific pandemic simplified nutritional protocol was assessed as useful by a great majority of physicians. Pragmatic and simplified protocols are useful for ensuring the quality of nutritional therapy and could be used in future studies to assess its actual impact on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Easy-to-prescribe nutrition support in the intensive care in the era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While lymphocytopenia is a common characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the mechanisms responsible for this lymphocyte depletion are unclear.

The spleens and hilar lymph nodes (LNs) from six additional COVID-19 patients with post-mortem examinations were also collected, histopathologic detection showed that both organs manifested severe tissue damage and lymphocyte apoptosis in these six cases. In situ hybridization assays illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA accumulates in these tissues, and transmission electronic microscopy confirmed that coronavirus-like particles were visible in the LNs. SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid protein (NP) accumulated in the spleens and LNs, and the NP antigen restricted in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) positive macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 triggered the transcription of Il6, Il8 and Il1b genes in infected primary macrophages and DCs in vitro, and SARS-CoV-2-NP+ macrophages and DCs also manifested high levels of IL-6 and IL-1?, which might directly decimate human spleens and LNs and subsequently lead to lymphocytopenia in vivo.

Material and Methods In this prospective study, all infants born in \\"Cuza Voda\\" Maternity Hospital, Iasi, Romania, were enrolled over a thirteen-month period. Preductal oximetry was assessed during the first hour, and postductal oximetry was evaluated at twenty-four hours postpartum. Data were then analyzed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of pulse oximetry, as a screening test for CHD. Results 5406 infants were included in the study, with a mean gestational age of 38.2 weeks and a mean birth weight of 3175 grams. During the first minute, blood oxygen saturation varied between 40% and 90% and at 24 hours of life, it ranged between 90% and 100%. Following oximetry assessment, 14 infants with critical CHD were identified. Blood oxygen saturation values in infants with CHD were lower throughout the entire period of evaluation. Pulse oximetry had good sensitivity and specificity at 1 hour (Se=87.5%, Sp=95.5%) and 24 hours (Se=92.5%, Sp=97.4%) for the diagnosis of CHD. Blood oxygen saturation values at one minute, 1 hour and 24 hours are strong discriminative parameters for the early diagnosis of CHD.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has also severely restricted spirometry, the primary tool used for COPD diagnosis and severity evaluation, due to concerns of virus transmission. Computed tomography (CT)-based deep learning (DL) approaches have been suggested as a cost-effective alternative for COPD identification within smokers. The present study aims to develop weakly supervised DL models that utilize CT image data for the automated detection and staging of spirometry-defined COPD among natural population. Methods: A large, highly heterogenous dataset was established comprising 1393 participants recruited from outpatient, inpatient and physical examination center settings of 4 large public hospitals in China. CT scans, spirometry data, demographic data, and clinical information of each participant were collected for the purpose of model development and evaluation. An attention-based multi-instance learning (MIL) model for COPD detection was trained using CT scans from 837 participants and evaluated using a test set comprised of data from 278 non-overlapping participants. External validation of the COPD detection was performed with 620 low-dose CT (LDCT) scans acquired from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) cohort. A multi-channel 3D residual network was further developed to categorize GOLD stages among confirmed COPD patients and evaluated using 5-fold cross validation. Spirometry tests were used to diagnose COPD, with stages defined according to the GOLD criteria. Results: The attention-based MIL model used for COPD detection achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.934 on the test set and 0.866 on the LDCT subset acquired from NLST. The model exhibited high generalizability across distinct scanning devices and slice thicknesses, with an AUC above 0.90. The multi-channel 3D residual network was able to correctly grade 76.4% of COPD patients in the test set (423/553) using the GOLD scale, with a Cohens weighted Kappa of 0.619 for the assessment of GOLD categorization . Conclusion: The proposed chest CT-DL approach can automatically identify spirometry-defined COPD and categorize patients according to the GOLD scale, with clinically acceptable performance.

Despite their integral role in all ecosystems, particularly arid ecosystems, reptiles are not included in risk assessments. Two pesticides used in agricultural pest management are fipronil and fenitrothion. Here, we used a field-based BACI design experiment in semi-arid Australia to investigate the impact of these pesticides on basic physiological and behavioural parameters of a common arid-zone lizard species, Pogona vitticeps. Fipronil and fenitrothion were applied at ecologically relevant doses via oral gavage. Before and after dosing, blood, physical activity and body condition parameters were assessed. We found that temperature significantly influenced lizard activity in the morning period of movement; however, fipronil-treated individuals moved at least 49% less than fenitrothion-treated and control lizards from 7 days after dosing through to the end of the experiment. Physiological measures did not change significantly before or after exposure to both pesticides; however, other indicators showed evidence of exposure, which remained for the entirety of our monitoring period. On average, cholinesterase inhibition was still >30% compared with control lizards at the end of 4 weeks, and fipronil sulfone blood residues remained at 0.219 g/ml. Our study provides novel insights into the impacts that common pesticides have on widespread lizard species. We show that an ecologically relevant low dose of fipronil alters the behaviour of P. vitticeps, which has the potential to impact longer-term survivability. Persistence of both pesticides in the blood of all treatment lizards throughout the experiment indicates they are unable to clear these toxins within a month of being exposed. This may be significant for compounding exposure and latent toxicity.

Despite their expertise benefiting patient care, the routine contribution of pharmacists in addressing medication management failures is overlooked. Internationally, specialist pharmacist support for palliative care services remains under-resourced. By understanding experienced practices (what happens in the real world) in palliative care medication management, compared with intended processes (what happens on paper), patient safety issues can be identified and addressed. This commentary demonstrates the value of stakeholder engagement and consultation work carried out to inform a scoping review and empirical study. Our overall goal is to improve medication safety in palliative care. Informal conversations were undertaken with carers and various specialist and non-specialist professionals, including pharmacists. Themes were mapped to five steps: decision-making, prescribing, monitoring and supply, use (administration), and stopping and disposal. A visual representation of stakeholders understanding of intended medicines processes was produced. This work has implications for our own and others research by highlighting where pharmacy expertise could have a significant additional impact. Evidence is needed to support best practice and implementation, particularly with regard to supporting carers in monitoring and accessing medication, and communication between health professionals across settings.","output":"Understanding the Potential for Pharmacy Expertise in Palliative Care: The Value of Stakeholder Engagement in a Theoretically Driven Mapping Process for Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID19 pandemic highlighted deficiencies in interdisciplinary risk-communication in an intermediate care unit, based in a 30 bed independent care home, into which the hospital organisation assigns medical, pharmacy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work teams to provide post-acute care rehabilitation for adults. Mean length of stay is 20 days and > 75% return home. Weekly bed turnover is approximately 15%. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with nursing leaders and a weighted questionnaire for multidisciplinary team were used to determine baseline levels of confidence around environmental and resident-specific risk awareness. An Ishikawa diagram analysed factors contributing to risk-communication. The Chain Of Care vision for care home environments incorporated a Multidisciplinary Safety Brief. Five iterations occurred before reaching standardisation. A post-implementation weighted questionnaire collated qualitative information on confidence change. The Safety Brief supplements intra-professional group handover processes. Duration ranged 90-120 seconds, occurring at shift commencement and 12.00 h daily. Retained documentation is available for inspectors. RESULTS: The Safety Brief as a communication tool: 86% of the team found it useful; 71% found that it had the right amount of detail; and 62% found that it was of the right duration. Areas of greatest swing towards INCREASED or SLIGHTLY INCREASED confidence in awareness of...: 72%, deaths in last 24 hours; 68%, planned discharges today; 67%, residents at risk of falling/had fallen within 48 hours; 67%, residents with same name; 66%, bed-availability; 63%, infection risks; 62%, experiencing delirium; 62%, living with dementia; 59%, scheduled appointments today; and 52%, those receiving palliative care. CONCLUSION: A Multidisciplinary Safety Brief increased/slightly increased multidisciplinary team confidence in environmental and resident-specific risks in a care home environment. Risk-communication in any environment is complex especially if subject to frequent change. Communication tools need to be tailored to microsystem, systematic, comprehensive, yet brief and intuitive.

These ~24-hour internal rhythms are set to precisely 24 hours daily by exposure to the sun. However, the prevalence of night-time lighting has the potential to dysregulate these biological functions. Hospital patients may be particularly vulnerable to the consequences of light at night because of their compromised physiological state. A mouse model of stroke (middle cerebral artery occlusion; MCAO) was used to test the hypothesis that exposure to dim light at night impairs responses to a major insult. Stroke lesion size was substantially larger among animals housed in dLAN after reperfusion than animals maintained in dark nights. Mice housed in dLAN for three days after the stroke displayed increased post-stroke anxiety-like behavior. Overall, dLAN amplified pro-inflammatory pathways in the CNS, which may have exacerbated neuronal damage.

Still, no drugs are available for its treatment. The main protease is the most conserved structure responsible for the posttranslational processing of non-structural polyproteins of this virus. Therefore, it can be the potential target for drug discovery against SARS CoV-2. Twenty-one thousand two hundred and seven chemical compounds used for sequential virtual screening studies including coronavirus screening compounds (Life Chemical database) and antiviral compounds (Asinex database). The Schrodinger suite 2019 employed for high throughput screening, molecular docking and MM-GBSA through the Glide module. Subsequently, 23 compounds were selected in the phase first selection criteria for re-docking with AutoDock and iDock followed by ADMET prediction. The drug-likeness predicted through Lipinski's rule of five, Veber's rule and Muegge's rule. Finally, three ligands were selected for molecular dynamics simulation studies over 150 ns against the main protease of the SARS CoV-2. They showed promising docking scores on Glide, iDock and AutoDock Vina algorithms (ligand F2679-0163: -10.75, -10.29 and -9.2; ligand F6355-0442: -9.38, -8.61 and -7.6; ligand 8250: -9.795, -7.94 and -7.5), respectively. The RMSD parameter remained stable at 2.5 ? for all the three ligands for 150 ns. The high RMSF fluctuations, RoG of around 22 ? and the binding free energy were favorable in each case.

Data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations 2018 National Survey for Drug Use and Health were extracted and analyzed to achieve the study goal. The unweighted sample included 6,999 adults representing a weighted population size of 33,900,452.122 in the USA. Results revealed that age and marital status significantly predicted BAU in the past month among adults with MDE. Adults under the age of 50, with a college degree, never married, divorced/separated, and with a high-middle income level or higher were at higher risk for BAU. The studys clinical implications are that understanding demographics of individuals with MDE at increased risk for BAU can inform improved tailored assessment and treatment of alcohol abuse and MDE among at-risk populations.

Despite being a reliable source of soft tissue, complications do arise. Venous congestion is among the most common causes of flap failure in lower extremity reconstruction, an issue that is attributed to venous stasis and impaired venous return in this region. There remains significant debate whether dual venous drainage improves outcomes. The aim of this study was thus to compare one versus two venous anastomoses in lower limb free flap reconstruction. METHODS A systematic review of Medline, EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, SCOPUS, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, Cochrane Library, and PROSPERO from inception to May 20, 2020, was conducted. Two independent reviewers screened titles and extracted data. Our primary outcome was total free flap necrosis. Secondary outcomes were partial flap necrosis, minor complications, flap reoperation, venous thrombosis, and amputation. Methodological quality was assessed using the MINORS criteria and level of evidence. RESULTS Three-hundred and fourteen unique titles were identified. All studies were level VI evidence and had a mean MINORS score of 16.1/24. Seven studies (comprising 1499 patients, 910 single venous anastomoses, and 579 double venous anastomoses) met criteria for inclusion. The mean (SD) patient age was 46.5 (7.1) years. Double venous anastomoses did not reduce the rate of minor complications, flap takeback, venous thrombosis, total flap necrosis, or partial flap necrosis when compared to a single vein (all p > .05).

In addition to several factors influencing TPI, such as university education and empowerment courses, experience seems to play a significant role. Moreover, the role of psychological factors is highly undeniable in the formation and development of TPI. Attributional style (AS) is defined as the consistent way by which people can explain the reasons for the occurrence of good or bad events. Besides considering ASs as one of the crucial variables for academic success, it can be regarded as one of the aspects of shaping ones identity in general and the teachers identity in particular. In order to study the relationship between AS and TPI of teachers regarding their experience, two questionnaires were distributed among 317 Iranian English as foreign language (EFL) teachers, and about 80% returned them. The researchers ran correlational analyses and they came up with a positive and significant relationship (p = 0.04) between TPI and teacher attributional styles (TASs) of teachers. Moreover, experienced teachers proved to have a significant difference from novice teachers regarding their TPIs. The findings of this study would hopefully be advantageous for teacher educators to educate pre-service teachers by ways of constructing identity, and they may be applicable for Iranian EFL teachers to know and focus on different aspects of their professional identity.

In the United States, Latinx, African American, and Indigenous populations across the country have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 cases and death rates. An examination of the perceptions and beliefs about the spread of the virus, COVID-19 testing, and vaccination amongst racial/ethnic minority groups is needed in order to alleviate the widespread disparity in new cases and deaths. METHODS: From November to December 2020 the research team conducted focus groups with members of Latinx farm-working communities in the Eastern Coachella Valley, located in the inland southern California desert region. A total of seven focus groups, six in Spanish and one in Purepecha, with a total of 55 participants were conducted. Topics covered include knowledge of the coronavirus, COVID-19 testing and vaccination. RESULTS: Using theme identification techniques, the findings identify structural factors that underly perceptions held by immigrant, migrant, and indigenous Latinx community members about COVID-19, which, in turn, shape attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Common themes that emerged across focus groups include misinformation, lack of trust in institutions, and insecurity around employment and residency. CONCLUSIONS: This racial/ethnic minority population is structurally vulnerable to historical and present-day inequalities that put them at increased risk of COVID-19 exposure, morbidity, and mortality.

The European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) sent out a survey to assess what impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the practice of thoracic oncology surgery. METHODS: All ESTS members were invited (13-20 April 2020) to complete an online questionnaire of 26 questions, designed by the ESTS learning affairs committee. RESULTS: The response rate was 23.0% and the completeness rate was 91.2%. The number of treated COVID-positive cases per hospital varied from fewer than 20 cases (30.6%) to more than 200 cases (22.7%) per hospital. Most hospitals (89.1%) postponed surgical procedures. All hospitals performed patient screening with a nasopharyngeal swab, but only 6.7% routinely tested health care workers. A total of 20% of respondents reported that multidisciplinary meetings were completely cancelled and 66%, that multidisciplinary decisions were not different from normal practice. Trends were recognized in prioritizing surgical patients based on age (younger than 70), type of surgery (lobectomy or less), size of tumour (T1-2) and lymph node involvement (N1). Sixty-three percent of respondents reported that surgeons were involved in daily care of COVID-19-positive patients. Fifty-three percent mentioned that full personal protective equipment was available to them when treating a COVID-19-positive patient.

In Poland, a crisis intervention team for patients with T1DM was established. The goal of the team was to provide psychological support for these patients, if needed, and to present information concerning how these patients may obtain medical consultations and prescriptions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze the psychological parameters and main emotional reactions of patients with T1DM during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: An email with information concerning the possibility of having a web-based consultation with psychologists and psychiatrists and an attached set of psychological tests was sent to all patients with T1DM who were under the care of an outpatient diabetes clinic. The consultations were performed by licensed clinical psychologists and psychologists. This study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland. RESULTS: The patients who decided to use psychological support had statistically higher levels of anxiety (state P=.043; trait P=.022), stress (P=.001) than those of patients from the group who did not seek support.

The aim of this paper is to quantify the impact of the pandemic on the cancer care line in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina. METHOD: It is an observational cross-sectional study comparing the impact on selected variables of the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic periods. The formula of percentage variation was used to show the differences. The positivity index was calculated and expressed as a percentage. The proportions of both periods were compared through the chi-squared test and its p-value. RESULTS: Reductions were observed in all the variables under study. However, the deeper impact was evident in screening, with 56%C87% decreases in the number of procedures carried out. A 26% reduction was seen in diagnosis. Treatment was the variable with the least impact, with a 3% decrease.

Although gene expressions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have been analyzed in various organs and diseases, their soluble forms have been less studied, particularly in asthma. Therefore, we aimed to measure circulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the serum of asthmatics and examine their relationship with clinical characteristics. METHODS: Clinical data and serum samples of 400 participants were obtained from an asthma cohort. The soluble ACE2 (sACE2) and soluble TMPRSS2 (sTMPRSS2) level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the values underwent a natural log transformation. Associations between sACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels and various clinical variables were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients younger than 70 years old, those with eosinophilic asthma (eosinophils  200 cells/L), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) non-users were associated with higher levels of sACE2. Blood eosinophils and fractionated exhaled nitric oxide levels were positively correlated with serum ACE2. In contrast, lower levels of sTMPRSS2 were noted in patients below 70 years and those with eosinophilic asthma, while no association was noted between ICS use and sTMPRSS2. The level of sTMPRSS2 also differed according to sex, smoking history, coexisting hypertension, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio. The proportion of sputum neutrophils was positively correlated with sTMPRSS2, while the FEV1/FVC ratio reported a negative correlation with sTMPRSS2. CONCLUSION: The levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were differently expressed according to age, ICS use, and several inflammatory markers. These findings suggest variable susceptibility and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection among asthmatic patients.","output":"Soluble ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Levels in the Serum of Asthmatic Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the 1st COVID-19 lockdown in Israel affected emergency psychiatric presentations in a general hospital.

It is estimated that over 50% of women quit smoking during pregnancy but 90% relapse by one year. Safe and effective postpartum relapse prevention strategies are urgently needed. In an attempt to address this deficit, we will investigate the efficacy of bupropion vs. placebo as a smoking relapse prevention aid in postpartum women. The objective of this paper is to detail an approach to investigate bupropion's efficacy for preventing postpartum smoking relapse among women who quit smoking during pregnancy. Specifically, we designed a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial testing the efficacy of bupropion vs. placebo as a relapse prevention tool. Mothers of healthy infants who quit smoking while pregnant will be stratified based on current or past history of major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder and randomized to receive either active (bupropion XL 300 mg/day) or placebo medication for 12 weeks. To respond to safety concerns associated with participant and staff exposure to COVID-19, we revised our original protocol and present procedures which allow our trial to be conducted entirely remotely. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52 post-randomization. The primary outcome is 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks. Results of this work have the potential to positively impact women and their children by promoting lifelong cessation, eliminating secondhand smoke exposure, and modelling of abstinence to children.","output":"Bupropion for postpartum smoking relapse: A remote protocol for a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Objectives To investigate the rehabilitation outcomes of patients with COVID-19, admitted to an in-hospital inpatient rehabilitation unit. Design Case series method. All patients were followed up by phone call six months after discharge. Setting In-hospital Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit. Participants Subjects included three male patients in the age range of 55-65 with underlying medical conditions after COVID-19 infection with a mean acute hospital stay of 39 days. Interventions All three patients received services from an interdisciplinary team led by a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist. Interventions were focused on managing ongoing medical issues, weaning off of supplemental oxygen, restorative and compensatory training to improve independence with functional mobility, activities of daily living, assessment and treatment of dysphagia, speech/voice, and cognitive-communication deficits. Main Outcome Measures Six-minute Walk Test, 10-meter Walk Test, GG codes, Berg Balance Scale, MRC sum score, Montreal Cognitive Asessment, Dynamometry and 9-hole Peg Test. Results The average length of stay at the rehabilitation unit was 21 days. The distance on six-minute walk has improved from being unable to walk for six minutes on admission to an average of 921 feet at a speed of 1.05m/s. Two out of three patients remained at medium risk of falls requiring use of assistive devices for mobility. Persisting dysphagia and dependence on supplemental oxygen was an issue for one patient. All three patients discharged home with support from family members and no episode of readmission to hospital within six months after discharge. Conclusions Ongoing fatigue, cognitive impairment and reduced endurance demonstrates the impact of COVID-19 on multiple organ systems in the body.

METHODS: This is a retrospective observational research. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records in 1550 patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who hospitalized in Wuhan Central Hospital, China, from 1 January to 31 April, 2020. 30 COVID-19 patients with the diagnosis of epilepsy were enrolled. The clinical characteristics, complications, treatments,and clinical outcomes of 30 cases were collected. RESULT: Of 30 patients with diagnosis of epilepsy and COVID-19, 13 patients(43.4%) had new-onset epileptic seizure without epilepsy history(new-onset seizure group,NS group), 10 patients(33.3%) with epilepsy history had recurrent epileptic seizure(recurrent seizure group,RS group) and 7 patients(23.3%) with epilepsy history had no seizure during the course of COVID-19 (epilepsy history group,EH group). Patients in RS group had more other neurological disease history except for epilepsy than those in NS group and EH group(7/10[70%] VS 1/13 [7.7%]VS1/7[14.3%]), and the difference between RS group and NS group is significant (P < 0.05). Patients in NE group and RS group suffered more severe/critical COVID-19 infection than patients in EH group (10/13[76.9%] VS 6/10[60%] VS 1/7[14.3%]),and the difference between NS group and EH group is significant (P < 0.05). 36.7% of patients had 1 to 5 complications,and 46.4% of patients had 6-10 complications.The complications in patients with seizure(in RS group and NS group) seem to be more than those without seizure(in EH group), but it doesn't have statistic difference. The proportion of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) treatment before admission was higher in EH group than in RE group(7/7 [100%] VS 2/10 [20%], P < 0.05). The mortality of 30 patients with epilepsy and COVID-19 was 36.67%. The mortality of NS group(38.5%) and RS group(50%) were a little higher than in EH group(14.3%). None of convalescent patients had recurrent seizure, and there was no more death in the 3 month follow-up after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 Patients with recurrent epileptic seizure had more underlying neurological diseases than patients who had epilepsy history but without seizure.Patients with new-onset and recurrent epileptic seizure suffered more sever/critical COVID-19, which may lead to a worse prognosis.If patients with epilepsy history continue using AEDs during COVID-19 pandemics, the risk of recurrent seizure may reduce, and a good prognosis for patients with epilepsy history could be expected.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 30 COVID-19 patients with epilepsy: a retrospective study in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communities are ever-evolving, cities are constantly expanding, and the threat of natural hazards has escalated like never before. Cities can develop and prosper only if their society is resilient to external shocks. Measuring community resilience over time is crucial with the influence of technology and change in community lifestyles. With the frequent onset of floods in Kerala in recent years, the community must be well-prepared for future calamities. Thus, this paper develops a community resilience index for Keralas urban flood-prone areas (CRIF) through a rigorous bottom-up approach. The criteria for the index were developed using multi-criteria decision analysis that covered a fuzzy Delphi study, an empirical study using multi-variate probit regression, and an AHP analysis. The fuzzy Delphi study selected seven criteria: social, economical, governance/political, health, communication/coordination, education, and infrastructure from 65 experts. The empirical study helped apprehend the publics viewpoints under each criterion. Finally, the AHP analysis helped assign appropriate weights to the criteria which 28 experts designated. The index is also designed according to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015C2030). Further, the CRIF Index is put into action through a case study of the Kochi Municipal Corporation area, and the results are also validated using the Spearmans rank correlation coefficient method. Results from validation returned a value of 0.7209 for the perceived CRIF method and 0.5798 for the external validation method, which corresponds to a high and moderate correlation, respectively.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant stress on health care systems worldwide. SDD in highly selected TAVR patients can facilitate the provision of essential cardiovascular care while managing competing COVID-19 resource demands. METHODS: Patient selection for SDD was at the discretion of the local multidisciplinary heart team, across 7 international sites. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, all-cause readmission, major vascular complications, and new permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation. RESULTS: From March 2020 to August 2021, 124 of 2,100 patients who underwent elective transfemoral TAVR were selected for SDD. The average age was 78.9  7.8 years, the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 2.4 (IQR: 1.4-4.2), and 32.3% (n = 40) had preexisting PPMs. There were no major vascular complications, strokes, or deaths during the index admission. One patient (0.8%) required PPM implantation for complete heart block and was discharged the same day. No patient required a PPM between discharge home and 30-day follow-up. The composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, all-cause readmission, major vascular complications, and new PPM at 30 days occurred in 5.7% patients (n = 6 of 106). CONCLUSIONS: SDD post-TAVR is safe and feasible in selected patients at low risk for adverse clinical events postdischarge.

However, if DHI price influences utilization remains unclear. Objective: The objective was to compare changes in the use of DHI for CHD patients during three stages after two comprehensive reforms of public hospitals in Beijing. These findings will provide support for controlling the drug burden of CHD patients and regulating drug use behavior. Research Design: CHD diagnosis and treatment data were extracted from the Hospital Information System (HIS) of 33 public hospitals. Patients were grouped according to different treatment methods and clinical classifications. Changes in the utilization of DHI, including the use rate (the percentage of CHD patients using DHI), number of prescribed units (average number of units of DHI prescribed per hospital stay), and cost of DHI per hospital stay (equal to the unit price multiplied by the number of prescribed units) between the three stages were statistically analyzed. Association rules were applied to identify changes in drug combinations. Results: After the two reforms, the unit price of DHI dropped from $6.46 to $5.61. At the same time, the use rate increased from 20.77 to 24.00%, the number of prescribed units dropped from 29.76 to 29.21, and the cost of DHI per hospital stay dropped from $192.12 to $163.96. The changes in the use rate and number of prescribed units varied among patients with different clinical types and treatment methods, and the cost of CHI per hospital stay was consistent with the overall situation. The variety of drugs used in combination with DHI remained relatively stable. Conclusion: The use rate of DHI for CHD patients increased, indicating increased applications of DHI in clinical practice. Due to the drop in price, the cost of using DHI decreased, and the financial burden of this drug was reduced.","output":"Danhong Injection Price Trend and Its Utilization by Coronary Heart Disease Patients: Evidence From Hospital Records in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronary artery anastomosis training and assessment are vital for patient safety and for conferring a prognostic benefit. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to analyse the impact of simulation on coronary anastomosis proficiency in terms of time taken and skill score. METHODS This review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases on 10 October 2020, using the terms 'Coronary anastomosis simulation' or 'vascular anastomosis simulation' and 'anastomosis simulation'. Studies included had objective measurement of scores of before and after simulation. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan, version 5.4 (Cochrane Library). RESULTS From a pool of 1687 articles, 12 articles evaluating the use of simulation in teaching coronary anastomosis were identified, with objective scores at baseline and after simulation. The 12 papers included 274 subjects. Data on 223 subjects could be extracted for analysis in performing coronary anastomosis in a simulated environment. Eight trials evaluated improvement in time and 12 trials evaluated performance using an objective evaluation score. In comparison with no formal simulation training, simulation was associated with improved skill in a five-point scale (standardized mean difference 1.68 (95 per cent c.i. 1.23 to 2.13; P < 0.001)) and time (mean difference 205.9 s (95 per cent c.i. 133.62 to 278.18; P < 0.001)) in trials included in the meta-analysis. Furthermore, novice cardiothoracic surgeons benefited more from simulation as regards time improvement compared with senior cardiothoracic surgeons (293 versus 120 s improvement; P = 0.003). Fidelity of simulator did not have a significant effect on rates of improvement. CONCLUSION Simulation-based training in coronary anastomosis is associated with improved time efficiency and overall performance in comparison with no intervention.

Outcomes of interest included clot lysis rate, incidence of pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, recurrent deep vein thrombosis, number of venograms needed and amount of lytic utilized. RESULTS We found nine articles that reported outcomes of PMT. Three devices were utilized for PMT, the Angiojet, Trellis and Helix. Different thrombolytics were used to facilitate thrombus removal including urokinase, reteplase, tecneteplase, and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Complete and partial thrombus removal were achieved in up to 84% and 64% and 81% and 59% of the limbs treated with PMT and CDT alone, respectively. Data on PE and bleeding risk after PMT compared to CDT are scarce. The duration of the thrombolysis process, amount of lytics and number of venograms were substantially reduced in the patients who had PMT compared to those who underwent CDT alone. Two articles evaluated the obstacles that limit the indication of PMT in patients with VTE. CONCLUSION VTE is a prevalent burden in Western societies.

Angiogenesis is essential for tumor development. However, the role and mechanism of human vascular endothelial cells in tumor growth and angiogenesis induced by arsenic-transformed bronchial epithelial (As-T) cells remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that endothelial cells significantly increased As-T cell-induced tumor growth compared to those induced by As-T cells alone. To understand the molecular mechanism, we found that endothelial cells co-cultured with As-T cells or cultured in conditioned medium (CM) prepared from As-T cells showed much higher cell migration, proliferation, and tube formation compared to those co-cultured with BEAS-2B (B2B) cells or cultured in CM from B2B. We identified that higher levels of intracellular interleukin 8 (IL-8) were secreted by As-T cells, which activated IL-8/IL-8R signaling to promote endothelial cells migration and tube formation. IL-8 silencing and knockout (KO) in As-T cells, or IL-8 neutralizing antibody dramatically suppressed endothelial cell proliferation, migration, tube formation in vitro, and tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo, suggesting a key role of IL-8 in As-T cells to induce angiogenesis via a paracrine effect. Finally, blocking of IL-8 receptors C-X-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CXCR1) and CXCR2 with neutralizing antibodies and chemical inhibitors inhibited tube formation, indicating that IL-8Rs on endothelial cells are necessary for As-T cell-induced angiogenesis. Overall, this study reveals an important molecular mechanism of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis, and suggests a new option to prevent and treat arsenic-induced angiogenesis.","output":"Human endothelial cells promote arsenic-transformed lung epithelial cells to induce tumor growth and angiogenesis through interleukin-8 induction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical laboratory testing routinely provides actionable results, which help direct patient care in the inpatient and outpatient settings.

Nanostructured TiO(2) is a promising candidate for the passive reduction of transmission when applied to handles, push-plates and switches in hospitals. Here we report control of the nanostructure dimension of the mille-feuille crystal plates in anatase columnar crystals as a function of the coating thickness. This nanoplate thickness is key to achieving the large aspect ratio of surface area to migration path length. TiO(2) solid coatings were prepared by pulsed-pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (pp-MOCVD) under the same deposition temperature and mass flux, with thickness ranging from 1.3C16 m, by varying the number of precursor pulses. SEM and STEM were used to measure the mille-feuille plate width which is believed to be a key functional nano-dimension for photocatalytic activity. Competitive growth produces a larger columnar crystal diameter with thickness. The question is if the nano-dimension also increases with columnar crystal size. We report that the nano-dimension increases with the film thickness, ranging from 17C42 nm.

Recent works suggested that lipids might play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of PD. In particular, the so-called \\"bioactive\\" lipids whose changes in the concentration may lead to functional consequences and affect many pathophysiological processes, including neuroinflammation, are closely related to PD in terms of symptoms, disease progression, and incidence. This study aimed to explore the molecular metabolism and physiological functions of bioactive lipids, such as fatty acids (mainly unsaturated fatty acids), eicosanoids, endocannabinoids, oxysterols, representative sphingolipids, diacylglycerols, and lysophosphatidic acid, in the development of PD.

DESIGN: Observational study. METHODOLOGY: A total of 300 hospitalized patients of COVID-19 were included. Scoring of AGA was done, and severity of COVID-19 was measured as better and worse hospital outcomes. Correlation between severity of AGA and severity of COVID-19 was noted. RESULTS: Out of 300 patients, 220 (73.33%) were male and 80 (26.67%) were female. In males, mild-to-moderate Hamilton-Norwood scale (HNS<3) and severe alopecia (HNS3-7) were noted among 43(20%) and 177(80.55%) patients, respectively. In females, 43(54%) had no AGA while 37(46%) had AGA. In 37 females with AGA, mild-to-moderate (Ludwig scale <2) and severe alopecia (Ludwig scale 2-3) were seen in 9(24.32%) and 28(75.68%) patients, respectively. We report a significant increase in frequency (95%) and severity of AGA and worse outcomes in males (p-value 0.000, chi-square: 18.90) compared with females (46%) (p-value 0.273, chi-square: 7.544), with notable adverse COVID-19 disease outcomes in the younger age group of men and also in few women of younger age group suffering from AGA without any comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Our study shows a significant increase in frequency and severity of AGA and worse outcomes in men compared with women. There was a significant association between AGA severity and hospital disease outcome in men compared with women. Younger age group patients with severe AGA particularly men also faced adverse outcomes while having no known comorbidities, supporting the hypothesis that anti-androgen drugs might be valuable in patients of COVID-19.","output":"Association of androgenetic alopecia and severity of coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work takes a first look at domain names related to COVID-19 (Cov19doms in short), using a large-scale registered Internet domain name database, which accounts for 260 M of distinct domain names registered for 1.6 K of distinct top-level domains.

OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in mental health and well-being before and during the initial and later phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and test whether patterns varied with sociodemographic characteristics in a representative sample of older adults living in England. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal cohort study analyzed data from 5146 older adults participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing who provided data before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018 and 2019) and at 2 occasions in 2020 (June or July as well as November or December). EXPOSURES: The COVID-19 pandemic and sociodemographic characteristics, including sex, age, partnership status, and socioeconomic position. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in depression (8-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale), anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), quality of life (12-item Control, Autonomy, Self-realization, and Pleasure scale), and loneliness (3-item Revised University of California, Los Angeles, loneliness scale) were tested before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using fixed-effects regression models. RESULTS: Of 5146 included participants, 2723 (52.9%) were women, 4773 (92.8%) were White, and the mean (SD) age was 67.7 (10.6) years. The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms increased from 12.5% (95% CI, 11.5-13.4) before the COVID-19 pandemic to 22.6% (95% CI, 21.6-23.6) in June and July 2020, with a further rise to 28.5% (95% CI, 27.6-29.5) in November and December 2020.

During the early phase of the pandemic, several large outbreaks of Covid-19 occurred in food manufacturing plants resulting in deaths and economic loss, with approximately 15% of personnel diagnosed as asymptomatic for Covid-19. Disease spread by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals have been implicated for large outbreaks of Covid-19. In March of 2020, we assisted in implementation of environmental monitoring programs for SARS-CoV-2 in zones three and four of 116 food production facilities. All participating facilities had already implemented measures to prevent symptomatic personnel from coming to work. During the study period, from March 17, 2020 to September 3, 2020, 1.23% of the 22,643 environmental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that infected individuals were actively shedding virus. Virus contamination was commonly found on frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles, table surfaces and sanitizer dispensers. Most plants managed to control their environmental contamination when they became aware of the positive findings. Comparisons of positive test results of plant personnel and environmental surfaces in one plant showed a good correlation between the two. Our work illustrates that environmental monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a surrogate for identifying the presence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic personnel in workplaces and may aid in controlling infection spread.","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 contamination on food plant surfaces as determined by environmental monitoring."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social rights protection in the European Union has undergone significant development.

RESULTS One hundred and forty patients were included and 60 had CPA in addition to COPD. Seventy-six were male and mean age was 66.9 years (range 40-87). Thirty-nine (28%) were active cigarette smokers. On multivariate analysis, occupational contact with agricultural resources (p = 0.017), vacuuming once weekly or more often (p = 0.026) and not asking visitors to remove shoes on home entry (p = 0.035) were significantly more common in participants reporting  4 office visits for COPD symptoms in the last year.

Despite these extensive efforts, curbing this pandemic relies highly upon vaccination coverage. This study aimed to determine SARS-COV-2 vaccine uptake among Palestinian healthcare workers, the factors that influence vaccination uptake, and the motivators and barriers to vaccination. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online anonymous self-administered questionnaire during April and May 2021, after the Palestinian Ministry of Health launched the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination attitude and vaccination uptake status, and motivators and barriers towards vaccination. In addition, multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors of vaccination uptake. Results The study included 1018 participants from different professions, including 560 (55.0%) females. Of the participants, 677 (66.5%;95% CI: 63.5%- 69.4%) received the vaccine. Higher uptake was observed among males (aOR=1.5;95%CI: 1.1-2.1), single HCWs (aOR=1.3;95%CI: 1.1-1.8), HCWs working in the non-governmental sector (aOR=1.6;95%CI: 1.2-2.4), higher monthly income (aOR=1.9;95%CI: 1.4-2.8) and smoking (aOR=1.5;95%CI: 1.1-3.5).

Sample pooling offers huge advantages compared to single test rRT-PCR, as it reduces diagnostic costs, personnel time, burnout, and analytical run times.

The Business Intelligence System (BIS) is one of the emphasized innovations, and due to its potential to provide more intellectual information for decision-making processes, has attracted the interest of industry analysts and policymakers. Literature suggests that the BIS is integrated by organizations in different sectors, but most BIS initiatives struggle to produce the anticipated outcomes. Moreover, the adoption of BIS in SMEs generally and healthcare specifically is rather insignificant. This is due to numerous factors. It is therefore necessary to discover and analyze the essential determinants affecting the adoption of BIS in healthcare SMEs. Therefore, this study tries to tackle this gap by exploring the relevant factors for BIS adoption using a systematic literature review (SLR) and an expert-ranking survey of 63 studies that were published in Scopus and WoS databases from 2011 to 2020. A total of 22 determinants are identified and sent to 15 experts. The data that were gathered from these experts were analyzed using SPSS. The results of the analysis indicated 15 determinants were significant, and one determinant was added by an expert. Consequently, a theoretical structure has been developed based on technology, organization, environment, and CEOs determinants and theories.

In this study the SFS algorithm is modified to optimize the dominance measurement section. Regions that do not have hospitals will not be prioritized for PPE recipients. The preferences used in this study are maximum and minimum. The maximum preference rule is used for the number of ODP PDP positive and dead cases while the minimum preference rule is used for the cured and distance attributes. The application of SFS for calculating priority regions has been successfully carried out by developing two models namely MS1 using unmodified SFS and MS2 using modified SFS by adding a selection process for regions with no hospitals. The MS1 produces 21 skyline objects (55.55 %) while MS2 15 (66.66 %) skyline objects. The MS2 is faster than that of MS1 because fewer objects are being tested. The MS1 takes 0.0222 seconds while MS2 only 0.0193 seconds.","output":"Modifikasi skyline query untuk mengukur daerah prioritas penerima bantuan alat pelindung diri bagi tenaga kesehatan COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causal agent of COVID-19 and stands at the center of the current global human pandemic, with death toll exceeding one million.

The deeply negative net international investment position (NIIP) suggests that large current account surpluses will be needed in the future to restore external sustainability. Despite significant interest in the scope for external adjustment within a monetary union, little is known about the magnitude or likelihood of the relative price change required to facilitate this adjustment. Drawing on a new probabilistic framework of external sustainability, this paper estimates the likelihood that a real effective depreciation is needed to lower Portugals net external liabilities to more prudent levels. Contrary to conventional thinking, we find that the NIIP is sustainable without real depreciation with fairly high probability, estimated between 32 and 43 percent. We highlight the predominance of financial account shocks over current account shocks in this assessment. To provide context to the assessment, we also apply the framework to Ireland. Despite a weaker NIIP than in Portugal, the probability that the external position is sustainable in Ireland is higher, estimated between 54 and 60 percent, predominantly reflecting forecasts of large and sustained trade surpluses.

Prior studies have raised concerns about patients ability to form antibodies in response to various antigens, especially SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to determine whether OCR attenuates the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with MS as compared with other disease modifying therapies. METHODS: This is a case-control study looking at the odds of developing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patients treated with OCR versus other disease modifying therapies. From May 13, 2020 through March 1, 2021, patients with a RT-PCR-confirmed infection to SARS-CoV-2 were tested for presence of antibodies and the data was recorded. Outpatients with MS at the Methodist Hospitals Comprehensive MS Center were selected who had a prior infection with COVID-19 as demonstrated by RT-PCR in the electronic health records. Odds ratios were calculated to compare rates of antibody formation with OCR exposure vs other DMT. RESULTS: 24 patients had evidence of COVID-19 and had antibody testing available at the time of analysis. Patients who received OCR had decreased odds of forming antibodies (OR 0.045, p=0.011, 95% CI (0.004,0.488)). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received OCR within the prior 6 months of COVID-19 infection had decreased odds of developing antibodies as compared with other DMTs. This suggests that OCR may attenuate the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.

Previous studies have shown that hydrogen (H2) is involved in the treatment of COPD as an antioxidant. In this study, the effect of H2 on M1/M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages in COPD rats was observed, and its anti-inflammatory mechanism was further elucidated. Methods: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups including the control, COPD and H2 group. A rat model of COPD was established by cigarette exposure combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction. H2 therapy was administered 2 hours per day for 14 days. Lung function and pathology were assessed. The levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 and IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA, protein expression and immunoreactivity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase (Arg)-1 in lung were observed by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: Compared with the control rats, there were a significant decline in lung function, a marked inflammatory infiltration and pulmonary parenchymal remodeling and the increases of IL-6, TNF- and TGF-1 levels in BALF and lung tissue, but a lower expression of IL-10 in COPD rats. The iNOS mRNA and protein expression, as well as its optical density (OD), were increased significantly in lung tissue, while those of Arg-1 decreased significantly. H2 treatment improved the lung function and the parenchymal inflammation, reversed the increased levels of IL-6, TNF- and TGF-1, and the lower IL-10. Meanwhile, H2 also down-regulated the expression of iNOS, but up-regulated expression of Arg-1 in lung tissue. Conclusion: H2 reduces inflammation in the lung of COPD, which may be related to its inhibition of M1 type polarization and activation of M2 type polarization of alveolar macrophage.","output":"Hydrogen regulates the M1/M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages in a rat model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A growing body of literature on the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is becoming available, but a synthesis of available data has not been conducted We performed a scoping review of currently available clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and chest imaging data related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and LILACS from 01 January 2019 to 24 February 2020 Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted using the clinical and laboratory data, and random-effects models were applied to estimate pooled results A total of 61 studies were included (59,254 patients) The most common disease-related symptoms were fever (82%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56%&ndash;99%;n = 4410), cough (61%, 95% CI 39%&ndash;81%;n = 3985), muscle aches and/or fatigue (36%, 95% CI 18%&ndash;55%;n = 3778), dyspnea (26%, 95% CI 12%&ndash;41%;n = 3700), headache in 12% (95% CI 4%&ndash;23%, n = 3598 patients), sore throat in 10% (95% CI 5%&ndash;17%, n = 1387) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 9% (95% CI 3%&ndash;17%, n = 1744) Laboratory findings were described in a lower number of patients and revealed lymphopenia (0 93 &times;109/L, 95% CI 0 83&ndash;1 03 &times;109/L, n = 464) and abnormal C-reactive protein (33 72 mg/dL, 95% CI 21 54&ndash;45 91 mg/dL;n = 1637) Radiological findings varied, but mostly described ground-glass opacities and consolidation Data on treatment options were limited All-cause mortality was 0 3% (95% CI 0 0%&ndash;1 0%;n = 53,631) Epidemiological studies showed that mortality was higher in males and elderly patients The majority of reported clinical symptoms and laboratory findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection are non-specific Clinical suspicion, accompanied by a relevant epidemiological history, should be followed by early imaging and virological assay","output":"Novel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19) in Humans: A Scoping Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To compare popliteal vein (PV) diameter and peak flow velocity generated by a calf compressor, when the knee is either flexed or hyperextended.

Expert neurosurgeons from 6 different countries (China, Italy, South Korea, USA, Colombia and United Kingdom) reported on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their health care systems and neurosurgical activity. RESULTS The first part focused on the epidemiology until that date. The USA were the most affected State with 450.000 cases, followed by Italy (140.000 cases and 19.000 casualties), China (83.305 cases and 3.345 had died), South Korea (10.156 cases with 177 casualties), the UK (38.168 cases and 3.605 deaths) and Colombia (1.267 cases and 25 deaths). The second part concerned Institution and staff reorganization. In every country all surgical plans have been modified. In Wuhan the staff was enrolled in COVID-units. In New York, the Mount Sinai Health System was in lockdown mode. In South Korea, sterilizing chambers have been placed. In Italy some Departments were reorganized in a Hub and Spoke fashion. In the Latin American region, they adopted special measures for every case. In the UK a conference center has been used to accommodate intensive care unit (ICU) beds. The third part was about neurosurgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Wuhan the main hospital was used for urgent non-COVID patients. In New York the neurosurgeon staff work in ICU as advanced practitioner (APP). In South Korea every patient is screened. In Italy the on-duty Hub neurosurgeons have been doubled. In the Latin American region recommendations have been developed by some neurosurgical societies. In the UK local non-specialists and traumatologists neurosurgical experts are collaborating in terms of best practice. The final part touched upon how to perform safe surgery and re-start after the pandemic. In China elective surgical procedures are performed very carefully. In New York, surgery planning will be based on patient's viral load. In South Korea and in Italy disinfection plans and negative-pressure O.R. were created. In the Latin American region, the aim is to have a rapid testing system. In the UK they have developed flowcharts to guide trauma patient management.

Based on automated-CPR porcine data, we have developed an algorithm to support ROSC detection, which detects cardiogenic output during chest compressions via a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. The algorithm can detect palpable and impalpable spontaneous pulses. A compression-free PPG signal which estimates the spontaneous pulse waveform, was obtained by subtracting the compression component, modeled by a harmonic series. The fundamental frequency of this series was the compression rate derived from the transthoracic impedance signal measured between the defibrillation pads. The amplitudes of the harmonic components were obtained via a least mean-square algorithm. The frequency spectrum of the compression-free PPG signal was estimated via an autoregressive model, and the relationship between the spectral peaks was analyzed to identify the pulse rate (PR). Resumed cardiogenic output could also be detected from a decrease in the baseline of the PPG signal, presumably caused by a redistribution of blood volume to the periphery. The algorithm indicated cardiogenic output when a PR or a redistribution of blood volume was detected. The algorithm indicated cardiogenic output with 94% specificity and 69% sensitivity compared to the retrospective ROSC detection of nine clinicians. Results showed that ROSC detection can be supported by combining the compression-free PPG signal with an indicator based on the detected PR and redistribution of blood volume.","output":"Photoplethysmography-based algorithm for detection of cardiogenic output during cardiopulmonary resuscitation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of the global pandemic outbreak due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been challenging with no exact dedicated treatment nor established vaccines at the beginning of the pandemic.

Millions of people have become infected; billions have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes, but few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals. OBJECTIVE: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data in a cohort of college-aged students enrolled in a longitudinal study, we seek to understand the behavioral and mental health impacts associated with the pandemic, measured by search term interest in \\"coronavirus\\" and \\"covid fatigue\\" across the United States. METHODS: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs), including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Participants were 217 undergraduate students. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models. RESULTS: Linear mixed models observed differences in phone usage, sleep, sedentary time and the number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in covid fatigue. When mental health metrics (e.g., depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone usage, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (P<.001) were significantly associated with interest in covid fatigue. Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were more sedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic persisted through the spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. Though unsurprising, understanding these large-scale shifts in mental health and behaviors is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mental health during the ongoing pandemic.","output":"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students in the COVID-19 Pandemic : A Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study- Part II"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Worldwide, one of the drivers of substitution and adulteration is the cost of the natural resources (plants, animals, fungi) that are ingredients of traditional medicines. Relatively few studies have been done that link prices of traditional medicine ingredients to what drives changes in price, yet this is an important topic. Theoretically, prices have been widely considered as an economic indicator of resource scarcity. Rare, slow growing medicinal plants sell for high prices and common, less popular species for low prices. Price levels also influence the viability of farming vs. wild harvest (and incentives to overharvest high value species when tenure is weak). Prices can also influence the harvesting or buying behaviour of harvesters, traders or manufacturers. When prices are high, then there is a greater incentive to use cheaper substitute species or adulterants. As previous studies on herbal medicine ingredients have shown, adulteration applies in a wide variety of cases, including to some Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) species. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of which factors influenced changes in the market prices of document prices for four popular, but very different traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) species (2002 C 2017). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluctuations in market prices were followed over a 15-year period (2002C2017) for four very different TCM ingredients: two plant species (one wild harvested for fruits (Schisandra sphenanthera Rehder & E.H. Wilson) the other in a transition from wild harvest to cultivation (Paris polyphylla Smith), an animal species (the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko L.)) and the entomophagous caterpillar fungus (Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Berk). G.H. Sung, J.M. Sung, Hywel-Jones & Spatafora). RESULTS: High prices of medicinal plants are widely considered to reflect resource scarcity. Real-time market prices for three of the four very different TCM species we studied all showed major price fluctuations. The exception was P. polyphylla, whose wild populations are widely known to be increasingly scarce, where there was a steady increase in price, with few fluctuations in the upward price trend. The three other species showed significant price fluctuations. These were driven by multiple factors. Ecological and biogeographic factors that influence abundance or scarcity of supply certainly played a role. But other factors were also influential. These included both national and global economic factors (the influence of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)), national policy changes that in turn influenced businessmen giving expensive gifts (that included O. sinensis)), climate change (influencing fruiting success of S. sphenanthera), price speculation by traders and lack of information (e.g: reduction in G. gecko prices due to traders incorrectly believing that domestication would increase supplies). CONCLUSIONS: Price fluctuations in the four TCM species we examined are influenced by many factors and not just resource scarcity. And the situation is more complex than the trajectory based on Homma's (1992) model, where he predicted that higher prices would result in a shift to cultivation, thus replacing wild harvest. In case of both O. sinensis and P. polyphylla, Homma (1992, 1996) was right in terms of scarcity and high prices stimulating a major investment in cultivation (P. polyphylla) and artificial production (O. sinensis). But in both cases, intensive production through cultivation or artificial propagation do not yet occur on a large enough scale to reduce harvest of wild stocks. Substitution and adulteration occur with all four species. Improving information to medicinal plant traders on the supply status of TCM stocks, whether from wild harvest or from cultivation could benefit product quality, cultivation initiatives and conservation efforts.","output":"Linking resource supplies and price drivers: Lessons from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) price volatility and change, 2002C2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Acute respiratory failure is a common life-threatening complication of acute onset neuromuscular diseases, and may exacerbate chronic hypoventilation in patients with neuromuscular disease or chest wall disorders. Standard management includes oxygen supplementation, physiotherapy, cough assistance, and, whenever needed, antibiotics and intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) via nasal, buccal or full-face devices has become routine practice in many centres. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this review was to compare the efficacy of non-invasive ventilation with invasive ventilation in improving short-term survival in acute respiratory failure in people with neuromuscular disease and chest wall disorders. The secondary objectives were to compare the effects of NIV with those of invasive mechanical ventilation on improvement in arterial blood gas after 24 hours and lung function measurements after one month, incidence of barotrauma and ventilator-associated pneumonia, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and length of hospital stay. SEARCH METHODS We searched the following databases on 11 September 2017: the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched conference proceedings and clinical trials registries. SELECTION CRITERIA We planned to include randomised or quasi-randomised trials with or without blinding. We planned to include trials performed in children or adults with acute onset neuromuscular diseases or chronic neuromuscular disease or chest wall disorders presenting with acute respiratory failure that compared the benefits and risks of invasive ventilation versus NIV.

We planned to follow standard Cochrane methodology for data collection and analysis. MAIN RESULTS We did not identify any trials eligible for inclusion in the review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Acute respiratory failure is a life-threatening complication of acute onset neuromuscular disease and of chronic neuromuscular disease and chest wall disorders. We found no randomised trials on which to elaborate evidence-based practice for the use of non-invasive versus invasive mechanical ventilation. For researchers, there is a need to design and conduct new randomised trials to compare NIV with invasive ventilation in acute neuromuscular respiratory failure.

However, the transcriptional events underlying this thrombin-induced VEGF induction and angiogenic response are less well understood at present. As reported here, we conducted detailed promotor activation and signal transduction pathway studies in human microvascular ECs, to decipher the transcription factors and the intracellular signaling events underlying the thrombin and PAR-1-induced endothelial VEGF induction. We found that c-FOS is a key transcription factor controlling thrombin-induced EC VEGF synthesis and angiogenesis. Upon the binding and internalization of its G-protein-coupled PAR-1 receptor, thrombin triggers ERK1/2 signaling and activation of the nuclear AP-1/c-FOS transcription factor complex, which then leads to VEGF transcription, extracellular secretion, and concomitant proangiogenic responses of ECs. In conclusion, exposure of human microvascular ECs to thrombin triggers signaling through the PAR-1-ERK1/2-AP-1/c-FOS axis to control VEGF gene transcription and VEGF-induced angiogenesis. These observations offer a greater understanding of endothelial responses to thromboinflammation, which may help to interpret the results of clinical trials tackling the conditions associated with endothelial injury and thrombosis.","output":"Transcriptional Regulation of Thrombin-Induced Endothelial VEGF Induction and Proangiogenic Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tippy-taps are locally made devices for washing hands with running water. They are simple and low-cost, enabling technology that provides adequate water sources, handwashing stations and motivation for people to prioritise handwashing. This systematic review aimed to establish the use, benefits, adoption and effectiveness of enabling technology; tippy-tap handwashing station, in resource-limited settings. METHODS: We systematically searched for articles in the PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, CINAHL, DOAJ and Google Scholar databases guided by the acceptable best practice developed by the PROSPERO and COCHRANE for systematic search and selection of articles. Search terms such as tippy-taps, enabling technology, hand-washing station, hand-washing behaviour, diarrhoea, respiratory infection, increase handwashing behaviour were used. In addition, a PRISMA flow diagram was used to elaborate on the number of articles retrieved, retained, excluded and reasons for every action. Studies that used tippy-tap hand washing station as a handwashing facility regardless of the design were included in this review. A mixed method appraisal tool was used to appraise studies. RESULTS: Twenty articles met the eligibility criteria. The use of tippy-taps for handwashing by household members or school children was reported by authors of 16 studies, and it ranged from 2.7 to 80%. The availability of tippy-taps increased handwashing and use of soap among participants. Furthermore, the majority of people who were oriented to tippy-taps or recruited to tippy-tap studies built their tippy-tap stations even after the promotional activities or programs had ended. In one study, tippy-taps were reported by participant to be effective in preventing episodes of stomach pain among participants. CONCLUSION: Tippy-tap handwashing station could help in promoting handwashing practice in resource constraint settings. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of tippy-tap hand washing station on preventing water and hygiene-related infections.","output":"Use, adoption, and effectiveness of tippy-tap handwashing station in promoting hand hygiene practices in resource-limited settings: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the real influence of bariatric surgery on the clinical evolution of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in the postoperative period. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis including two groups of patients: those who presented COVID-19 before bariatric surgery and those who presented it within 3 months of postoperative. Primary outcome was related to the severity of COVID-19, measured by the following variables: presence of symptoms, need for hospitalization, ICU admission, and invasive ventilation. Laboratory markers for inflammatory response, glycemic status, and micronutrients were analyzed as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: From the 222 individuals operated on within the study period, only 66 (29.7%) presented COVID-19, 42 (18.9%) in the preoperative period and 24 (10.8%) after the procedure. Mean age was 36.3  9.5 years and mean preoperative BMI was 39.9  4.2 kg/m(2). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding symptoms presentation (92.9%  87.5%, p = 0.66), need for hospitalization (11.9%  16.7%, p = 0.713), ICU admission (4.8%  4.2%, p = 1.000), and invasive ventilation (2.4%  0.0%, p = 1.000).

However, systematic evidence on this subject is sparse. We aimed to investigate the rate of emergent hospital admissions, subsequent invasive treatments and comorbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective analysis of health insurance claims data from the second largest insurance fund in Germany, BARMER. Patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, acute limb ischemia, aortic rupture, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2020, were included. Admission rates per 100,000 insured, invasive treatments and comorbidities were compared from January-May 2019 (pre-COVID) to January-May 2020 (COVID). A total of 115,720 hospitalizations were included in the current analysis (51.3% females, mean age 72.9 years). Monthly admission rates declined from 78.6/100,000 insured (pre-COVID) to 70.6/100,000 (COVID). The lowest admission rate was observed in April 2020 (61.6/100,000). Administration rates for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (7.3-6.6), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (16.8-14.6), acute limb ischemia (5.1-4.6), stroke (35.0-32.5) and TIA (13.7-11.9) decreased from pre-COVID to COVID. Baseline comorbidities and the percentage of these patients treated with interventional or open-surgical procedures remained similar over time across all entities. In-hospital mortality in hospitalizations for stroke increased from pre-COVID to COVID (8.5-9.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Admission rates for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular emergencies declined during the pandemic in Germany, while patients' comorbidities and treatment allocations remained unchanged.

A study with multiple exposure groups and large group sizes was performed to establish whether exposure to 60-Hz electric fields would result in reproductive and developmental toxicity. A response model was developed from previous results and tested in groups of rats exposed to electric fields at various field strengths. Female rats were mated, and sperm-positive animals randomly distributed among four groups: sham-exposed or exposed to 10, 65, or 130 kV/m, 60-Hz vertical electric fields. Animals were exposed for 19 hr/day throughout the experiment. During gestation, exposure to the higher field strengths resulted in slightly depressed weight gains of dams. Offspring were born in the field and remained with their dams through the suckling period. Numbers of pups per litter and pup mortality did not differ among the exposure groups. Dams exposed at 65 kV/m lost slightly more weight through the lactation period than the control group. Male pups exposed to higher field strengths gained slightly less weight from 4 to 21 days of age than did sham-exposed animals. At weaning, two F(1) females per litter (randomly selected) continued on the same exposure regimen were mated at 11 weeks of age to unexposed males, and euthanized at 20 days of gestation. Uterine contents were evaluated, and all live fetuses were weighed and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. Fertility and gestational weight gain of F(1) females were not affected by exposure, nor was prenatal viability or fetal body weight. No significant increase in the incidence of litters with malformations was observed. Although no developmental toxicity was detected, exposures produced physical changes in the dams, evidenced as a rust-colored deposit on the muzzle and ears (chromodac-ryorrhea) that increased in incidence and severity at 65 and 130 kV/m. Incidence of chromodac-ryorrhea was not significantly different between sham-exposed rats and those exposed at 10 kV/m.","output":"Reproduction, Growth, and Development of Rats during Chronic Exposure to Multiple Field Strengths of 60-Hz Electric Fields"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Evidence for indoor airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is accumulating. If SARS-CoV-2 also spreads via aerosols, this has implications for measures taken to limit transmission. Objectives The aim of this study is to assess exposure to airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles from breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing in an indoor environment. Methods An exposure assessment model was developed to estimate numbers of SARS-CoV-2 particles in aerosol droplets, expelled during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing by an infected person in an unventilated indoor environment, and subsequent inhalation by one or more persons. Scenarios encompass a range of virus concentrations, room sizes and exposure times. Results The calculated total volume of expelled aerosol droplets was highest for a sneeze, followed by a cough and speaking for 20 minutes, and lastly breathing for 20 minutes. A few to as much as tens of millions of virus particles were expelled. Exposure probability strongly depends on the viral concentration in mucus, as well as on the scenario. Exposure probabilities were generally below 1% at a virus concentration in mucus below 10^5 per mL for all scenarios, increasing steeply at different higher concentrations. According to nose / throat swab data collected from patients, 75%, 50% and 5% of infected individuals carry an estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 per mL mucus of at least 10^5, 10^6 and 10^8, respectively. Discussion Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols generated during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing in an unventilated indoor environment is possible. This study forms a basis to estimate probabilities of exposure to SARS-Cov-2 by airborne transmission in indoor spaces. As long as it is uncertain what fraction of the airborne virus particles is infectious and as long as a dose response relation is lacking, it is recommended to be precautious.","output":"Exposure assessment for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many systematic reviews of clinical trials on acupuncture were performed within the Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence-based medicine (EBM) most recognized organization. Objective of the article was to systematically collect and identify systematic reviews of acupuncture published in the Cochrane Library and assess their quality from a methodological perspective.

The methodological quality of the included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 checklist, an evaluation tool for systematic reviews. RESULTS: Out of a total of 126 eligible reviews, 50 systematic reviews were included. According to the AMSTAR 2, 52% of Cochrane Systematic Reviews (CSRs) were of low quality, due to the presence of one or more weaknesses in at least one of the domains defined as critical for the methodological quality assessment. The less satisfied critical domain was inadequate investigation and discussion of publication bias. Declaration of potential sources of conflict of interest, and funding of the authors of the review and of the included studies were other important weaknesses. CONCLUSIONS: The main methodological flaws in the included CSRs were related to topics of relatively new concern in the conduction of systematic reviews of the literature.

The relationship between suicidality, COVID-19 risk perceptions, and guideline adherence was examined to inform potential barriers to the implementation of behavioral interventions aimed at preventing future pandemics. METHODS: A national sample of 159 MTurk participants (M(age) = 37.64 years, SD = 11.92; 48.4% female) completed an online survey containing the following: demographics, Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale, Broadly Applicable Measure of Risk Perception of COVID-19, and Adherence to COVID-19 Guidelines and Perceived Risk Scale. RESULTS: Multiple linear regressions assessed how suicidality related to perceived risk subscales and each adherence indicator while controlling for biological sex, age, and essential worker status. Over 25% of participants reported suicidality over the past month, and 19% were at high risk of suicidal behavior. Greater suicidality was associated with lower general COVID-19 risk perceptions ( = ?0.326, p < .001), decreased handwashing ( = ?0.423, p < .001), lower likelihood of planning to self-quarantine if infected with COVID-19 ( = ?0.400, p < .001), less social distancing ( = ?0.457, p < .001), and increased attendance of large gatherings ( = 0.405, p < .001). LIMITATIONS: Temporal relationships were unable to be assessed due to the cross-sectional nature of the data used.

RESULTS After adjustment for confounding factors, compared with non-exposure to antineoplastic drugs, exposure to antineoplastic drugs was positively related to tail moment, olive moment, tail length and tail DNA per cent, and adjusted  or OR (95% CI) was 0.17 (0.08 to 0.26), 0.18 (0.10 to 0.27), 1.03 (0.47 to 1.60) and 1.16 (1.04 to 1.29) (all p<0.05). Moreover, similar significant relationships were observed for the biomarkers of the CBMN assay. Additionally, other than age, there was no interaction between antineoplastic drug exposure and other variables for the levels of biomarkers of the CBMN assay and the comet assay. CONCLUSIONS The present results showed that exposure to antineoplastic drugs was positively related to the risk of DNA damage in nurses. The results imply that occupational exposure to antineoplastic agents is an important global public health problem that requires urgent attention.","output":"Effect of occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs on DNA damage in nurses: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chronic cough can be triggered by respiratory and non-respiratory tract illnesses originating mainly from the upper and lower airways, and the GI tract (ie, reflux). Recent findings suggest it can also be a prominent feature in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), laryngeal hyperresponsiveness, and COVID-19. The classification of chronic cough is constantly updated but lacks clear definition. Epidemiological data on the prevalence of chronic cough are informative but highly variable. The underlying mechanism of chronic cough is a neurogenic inflammation of the cough reflex which becomes hypersensitive, thus the term hypersensitive cough reflex (HCR). A current challenge is to decipher how various infectious and inflammatory airway diseases and esophageal reflux, among others, modulate HCR. OBJECTIVES: The World Allergy Organization/Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (WAO/ARIA) Joint Committee on Chronic Cough reviewed the current literature on classification, epidemiology, presenting features, and mechanistic pathways of chronic cough in airway- and reflux-related cough phenotypes, OSA, and COVID-19. The interplay of cough reflex sensitivity with other pathogenic mechanisms inherent to airway and reflux-related inflammatory conditions was also analyzed. OUTCOMES: Currently, it is difficult to clearly ascertain true prevalence rates in epidemiological studies of chronic cough phenotypes. This is likely due to lack of standardized objective measures needed for cough classification and frequent coexistence of multi-organ cough origins. Notwithstanding, we emphasize the important role of HCR as a mechanistic trigger in airway- and reflux-related cough phenotypes. Other concomitant mechanisms can also modulate HCR, including type2/Th1/Th2 inflammation, presence or absence of deep inspiration-bronchoprotective reflex (lower airways), tissue remodeling, and likely cough plasticity, among others.","output":"WAO-ARIA consensus on chronic cough - Part II: Phenotypes and mechanisms of abnormal cough presentation  Updates inCOVID-19()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Women have a worse outcome after stroke compared with men, although in intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)-treated patients, women seem to benefit more. Besides sex differences, age has also a possible effect on functional outcome. The interaction of sex on the functional outcome in IVT-treated patients in relation to age remains complex. The purpose of this study was to compare outcome after IVT between women and men with regard to age in a large multicenter European cohort reflecting daily clinical practice of acute stroke care. METHODS Data were obtained from IVT registries of 12 European tertiary hospitals. The primary outcome was poor functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 3 to 6 at 3 months. We stratified outcome by age in decades. Safety measures were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality at 3 months. RESULTS In this cohort, 9495 patients were treated with IVT, and 4170 (43.9%) were women with a mean age of 71.9 years. After adjustments for baseline differences, female sex remained associated with poor functional outcome (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.31). There was no association between sex and functional outcome when data were stratified by age. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was similar in both sexes (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-1.19), whereas mortality was lower among women (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.99).

Methods A prospective study. Interviews investigated post-COVID-19 syndrome 6 and 12 months after the disease onset of all adult in- and outpatients with COVID-19 attending Udine Hospital (MarchCMay 2020). Vaccination status and two different serological assays to distinguish between response to vaccination (receptor-binding domain CRBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG) and/or natural infection (non-RBD- SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were also assessed. Results 479 individuals (52.6% female, mean age 53 years) were interviewed 13.5 months (0.6 SD) after acute infection. Post-COVID-19 syndrome was observed in 47.2% (226/479) of patients after one year. There were no significant differences in the worsening of post-COVID 19 symptoms (22.7% vs 15.8%, p = 0.209) among vaccinated (n=132) and unvaccinated (n=347) patients. The presence of non-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG induced by natural infection showed a significant association with post-COVID-19 syndrome (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11C1.64, p = 0.003), and median non-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres were significantly higher in long-haulers than in patients without symptoms 22 (IQR 9.7C37.2) vs 14.1 (IQR 5.4C31.3) kAU/L, p = 0.009) after one year. In contrast, the presence of RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG was not associated with the occurrence of post-COVID-19 syndrome (>2500 U/mL vs 0.9C2500 U/mL, OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.62C3.00, p = 0.441) and RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres were similar in long-haulers than in patients without symptoms (50% values > 2500 U/mL vs 55.6% values > 2500 U/mL, p = 0.451) Conclusions The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is not associated with the emergence of post-COVID-19 symptoms over one year after acute infection.

Site-directed mutagenesis showed the importance of the nucleolar localization signal embedded in a C4 zinc-finger domain in the VSR function and intrinsic stability of the p14 protein. Conversely, RNA silencing suppression appeared independent of the nucleolar localization of the protein, and a correlation between BNYVV VSR expression and long-distance movement was established.","output":"The benyvirus RNA silencing suppressor is essential for long-distance movement, requires both zinc-finger and NoLS basic residues but not a nucleolar localization for its silencing-suppression activity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of creating a better living environment that is conducive to public health has become increasingly prominent in the post-epidemic era. The restorative potential of urban streets has been emphasized recently, as these spaces of our everyday lives may provide people with restorative experiences. However, there is still no efficient way of delivering restorative street design, because no specific standard has been set to indicate the form such streets should take. A street has limited spaces but multiple uses;hence, the delivery of restorativeness is largely restricted by street contexts. This research proposes that this standard should be determined by the balance between street functions and restorative benefits. An expectation-current approach that involves street functions, street typologies, restorative evaluations and users expectations was developed in conjunction with its application to four pairs of streets. Each pair included one typical street type determined by its inherent function, and one corresponding case-study street. The restorative expectations and the streets current levels of restorativeness were evaluated, and their differences were used to indicate how and to what degree street-related restorative benefits should be optimized. Restorative design implications of the four case-study streets were then summarized accordingly. The expectationCcurrent approach not only serves as a rigorous and sustainable method by stressing the balance between street functions and restorativeness, but also has the potential for application in broader assessment studies, especially when multiple environmental qualities need to be considered, with the advantage of the extensive involvement of people.","output":"Balancing Street Functionality and Restorative Benefit: Developing an ExpectationCCurrent Approach to Street Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we reflect on the COVID-19 pandemic based on medical philosophy.

However, the precise molecular mechanism of this rare event is yet to be understood. Here, we hypothesize a potential anti-tumor immune response of SARS-CoV-2 and based on a computational approach show that: (i) SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD may bind to the extracellular domains of CD15, CD27, CD45, and CD152 receptors of cHL or FL and may directly inhibit cell proliferation. (ii) Alternately, upon internalization after binding to these CD molecules, the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein and ORF3a may bind to gamma-tubulin complex component 3 (GCP3) at its tubulin gamma-1 chain (TUBG1) binding site. (iii) The M protein may also interact with TUBG1, blocking its binding to GCP3. (iv) Both the M and ORF3a proteins may render the GCP2-GCP3 lateral binding where the M protein possibly interacts with GCP2 at its GCP3 binding site and the ORF3a protein to GCP3 at its GCP2 interacting residues. (v) Interactions of the M and ORF3a proteins with these gamma-tubulin ring complex components potentially block the initial process of microtubule nucleation, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. (vi) The Spike-RBD may also interact with and block PD-1 signaling similar to pembrolizumab and nivolumab- like monoclonal antibodies and may induce B-cell apoptosis and remission.

Recent evidence showed that pyroptosis was a form of inflammatory programmed cell death and is critical for atherosclerosis (AS). However, little is known about the effect of HDAC11 on endothelial cell pyroptosis in AS. Thus, this study aims to investigate the role of HDAC11 in vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis and its molecular mechanism. Firstly, we found that HDAC11 expression was up-regulated and pyroptosis occurred in the aorta of ApoE-/- mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 or 12 weeks. Then, in vitro study found the treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) resulted in pyroptosis, as evidenced by activation of caspase-1 and caspase-3 activation, cleavage of downstream gasdermin D (GSDMD) and gasdermin E (GSDME/DFNA5), the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and IL-18, as well as elevation of LDH activity and increase of propidium iodide (PI)-positive cells. Besides, TNF- increased HDAC11 expression and induced pyroptosis via TNFR1 in HUVECs. HDAC11 knockdown mitigated pyroptosis by suppressing both NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD and caspase-3/GSDME pathways in TNF--induced HUVECs. Moreover, GSDME knockdown by siRNA significantly decreased pyroptosis and inflammatory response, while treatment with disulfiram or necrosulfonamide (NSA) further augmented the inhibitory effects of GSDME siRNA on pyroptosis and inflammatory response. Further studies found HDAC11 formed a complex with ERG and decreased the acetylation levels of ERG. More importantly, ERG knockdown augmented vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis in TNF--induced HUVECs. Taken together, our study suggests that HDAC11 might promote both NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD and caspase-3/GSDME pathways leading to pyroptosis via regulation of ERG acetylation in HUVECs.

To ensure health care worker safety and limit nosocomial transmission of such infection, it is crucial to synthesize the evidence regarding the infection risk associated with different modalities of oxygen therapy used in treating patients with severe acute respiratory infection. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2000, to April 1, 2020, for studies describing the risk of infection associated with the modalities of oxygen therapy used for patients with severe acute respiratory infection. The study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by independent reviewers. The primary outcome measure was the infection of health care workers with a severe acute respiratory infection. Random-effect models were used to synthesize the extracted data. RESULTS: Of 22,123 citations, 50 studies were eligible for qualitative synthesis and 16 for meta-analysis. Globally, the quality of the included studies provided a very low certainty of evidence.

Preventive behavior is important for every individual to maintain their health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to determine the relationship between social support (family friends health workers) perceptions of the response to COVID-19 and exposure to social media for COVID-19 prevention behavior. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Jabodetabek area in May 2020 with a voluntary sampling technique. The participants were 424 respondents. The proportion of respondents with good COVID-19 prevention behavior was 45.2%. The results of the multivariate analysis showed family support (OR = 2.736;95% CI = 1.654 - 4.517) peer support (OR = 2.035;95% CI = 1.205 - 3436) support from health professionals (OR = 1.729;95% CI = 1.023 - 2923);and sources of information regarding COVID-19 (OR = 1692;95% CI = 1036 - 2764) had a significant relationship with COVID-19 prevention behavior (P <0.05). It can be concluded that family support has dominant influence on COVID-19 prevention behavior in Jabodetabek community. For this reason, social support from the smallest scale (family) and reliable sources of information related to COVID-19 are needed so that community can implement COVID-19 prevention behavior properly in daily life.

Objective: The aim of this study was to analyse the performance of pre-existing scores in predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU transfer at admission in an Acute Medical Unit. Methods: 106 consecutive patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 interstitial pneumoni admitted to Acute Medical Unit were enrolled. The performances of NEWS, SIRS, RAPS, REMS, qSOFA, APACHE II, CURB-65 and PSI were analysed by the Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (AUROCs) and standard indices of accuracy. Results: Considering in-hospital mortality PSI and APACHE II had the higher AUROCs, 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.91) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.71-0.88), followed by REMS, 0.77 (95% CI 0.67-0.86), and CURB-65, 0.73 (95% CI 0.63-0.82), whereas the AUROCs of the other scores were < 0.7. PSI and APACHE II had good sensitivity (0.92 and 0.97), negative predictive value (0.96 and 0.97) and negative likelihood ratio (0.1 and 0.1), accurately identifying patients at low risk to die. However, the low specificity (0.70 and 0.47) and positive likelihood ratio (3.1 and 1.8) could limit their usefulness in predicting in-hospital mortality. Considering ICU admissions all the scores, except NEWS, SIRS and qSOFA, showed a worse performance. Conclusions: PSI and APACHE II showed good prognostic results in predicting in-hospital mortality but no pre- existing score validated for acute care settings was totally satisfactory to predict adverse outcomes in COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia after admission to Acute Medical Unit.

Participants were Australian mothers (81%) and fathers aged 18 years and over who were parents of a child 0C18 years (N=2,365). Parents completed an online self-report survey assessing mental health, substance use, couple conflict, parenting, and family functioning during stage three COVID-19 restrictions in April 2020. Data were compared to pre-pandemic data from four Australian population-based cohorts. Compared to pre-pandemic estimates, during the pandemic period parents reported higher rates of parent mental health symptoms (Cohens d=0.26-.81, all p<.001), higher parenting irritability (d=0.17-.46, all p<.001), lower family positive expressiveness (d=-0.18, p<.001), and higher alcohol consumption (22% vs 12% drinking four or more days per week, p<.001). In multivariable analyses, pre-existing financial deprivation and COVID-19 stressors were associated with greater severity in parent and child mental health symptoms, parent emotion dysregulation, parenting irritability, couple conflict and family positive/negative expressiveness.

The COVID-19 has been known to increase the health risks of patients with psoriasis owing to patients immune dysregulation, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive drug use. A total of 423 psoriasis patients not infected with COVID-19 was recruited from the Department of Dermatology, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and China Medical University Hospital from May 2020 to July 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate the perceived threat, mental health, and psychological impact on psoriasis patients using the Perceived COVID-19-Related Risk Scale score for Psoriasis (PCRSP), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress-associated symptoms (DAISS) scales, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. Over 94% of 423 patients with psoriasis perceived threat to be  1 due to COVID-19; 18% of the patients experienced psychological symptoms more frequently  1, and 22% perceived psychological impact during the pandemic to be  1. Multivariable linear regression showed that the higher psoriasis severity and comorbidities were significantly associated with higher PCRSP, DAISS, and IES-R scores. The requirement for a prolonged prescription and canceling or deferring clinic visits for psoriasis treatment among patients are the two most common healthcare-seeking behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psoriasis patients who perceived a higher COVID-19 threat were more likely to require a prolonged prescription and have their clinic visits canceled or deferred.

RESULTS: Although low-ratio counties show the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, confirmed cases in high-ratio counties (more than 25% of the total population is 65 and older) increase exponentially with time in urban areas. High-ratio rural counties hit their peak later and recover more slowly compared to low- and medium-ratio rural counties. DISCUSSION: Both urban and rural counties with larger older populations are more vulnerable and their disadvantages in COVID-19 infections are more rapidly exacerbated over time in urban areas. This underscores the importance of early action in those counties for effective intervention and prevention.","output":"Are Older Populations at a Disadvantage?

Islands of the same archipelago have faced various challenges in terms of tourism growth and related impact. Primarily, tourism has been characterised by seasonality (the strong spatio-temporal concentration of tourists in a destination) especially in the most peripheral islands. In other cases, tourism has grown considerably resulting in overemphasis on mass tourism throughout part of the year. This is largely experienced due to Sand, Sun and Sea (3S) tourism. Fieldwork, including interviews with key stakeholders and ecotours off-season, was conducted in the Aegadian Archipelago, off the west coast of Sicily. Findings revealed that ecotourism not only is the preferred alternative form of tourism among stakeholders but is also possible and ideal as confirmed through the ecotours. This is because different ecotourism activities can be practised all year round, thus mitigating seasonality. In return, this can help ease the financial, social and environmental challenges associated with current tourism models improving the well-being of local communities. Marine ecotourism is considered as a means to give more value to marine protected areas and to make existing tourism activity in the peak season more sustainable.","output":"Mitigating seasonality patterns in an archipelago: the role of ecotourism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study aims to identify specific lab markers, complications, and treatments that may be associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS This study is retrospective in nature; it included 217 COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to a ProMedica Health System hospital in Northwest Ohio, United States, between March 25 - June 16, 2020. We collected various laboratory values, complications, and treatment courses. T-test and Chi-squared analyses were used to predict mortality. COVID-19 test was confirmed via PCR. RESULTS Of 217 patients included in the study, the mean age of the population was 63.13 (SD 17.8), of which 194 (89.4%, mean age 61.7 years) survived while 23 (10.6%, mean age 74.6 years) died. Among them, 53% were females and 47% male. Laboratory values that were associated with mortality were low hemoglobin (p-value 0.0046), elevated INR (p-value 0.0005), low platelets (p-value 0.0246) and elevated procalcitonin (p-value 0.0472). Marginally significant laboratory values included elevated troponin (p-value 0.0661), and elevated creatinine (p-value 0.0741). Treatment with either antibiotic, antifungals, antivirals, blood transfusion, steroids, and intubation were all statistically significant for mortality. COVID-19 related complications with either ARDS, myocarditis, elevated INR, septic shock, or age greater than 63 were significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION Low hemoglobin, elevated INR, Low platelet, elevated procalcitonin, treated with either antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, blood transfusion, steroids, and intubation are associated with high mortality related to COVID-19 infection.

Interventions to improve care outcomes post-incarceration have been characterized by substantial heterogeneity in approach, outcome metrics, and results. A large number of recently published interventions have not been systematically reviewed. METHODS We searched peer reviewed and scholarly databases for published and grey literature describing interventions to improve HIV care continuum outcomes among individuals released from prison or jail. We systematically screened quantitative and qualitative intervention reports published through 2018, then extracted and analyzed study data using a classification scheme that we developed for categorizing intervention levels and strategies. RESULTS We included 23 reports from peer-reviewed literature, two from grey literature, and two from conference abstracts (27 total). Seventeen studies were classified as individual-level, three as biomedical-level, two as organizational-level, and five as multilevel. Nine studies were randomized controlled trials, four of which reported power calculations. Fifteen studies were quasi-experimental; one was a case study. Eleven studies were conducted in prisons, seven in jails, and nine in both prisons and jails. Of 11 studies reporting hypothesis tests, five found statistically significant effect sizes on primary outcomes.

We assessed the efficacy of an informal virtual elective (IVE) for students interested in radiation oncology (RO). Materials/Methods We created a series of IVE activities (non-credit granting) related to RO. MSs interested in the formal RO away elective at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) were invited to participate. A pre- and post-IVE survey was performed in the Summer and Fall of 2020, respectively. Likert-type scores (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely) were reported as median [interquartile range]. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare pre/post values. Results The pre- and post-IVE surveys were completed by 22/27 (81%) and 20/27 (74%) students, respectively. Prior to the IVE, students reported their top reasons for participation: promote self in preparation for interview season (5, 23%), receive an introduction to the field of RO (4, 18%), interact with faculty/residents at MDACC (3, 14%), networking (3, 14%), initiate research collaborations (3, 14%), self-exposure in RO (2, 9%), explore research opportunities (1, 5%), explore learning opportunities (1, 5%). Students reported that resident mentors would be extremely beneficial (5 [4-5]) on the pre-IVE survey vs. quite beneficial (4 [4-5]) on the post-IVE survey (P = 0.42). Faculty mentors were rated slightly more beneficial after the IVE (5 [4-5]) compared to prior (4.5 [4-5]) (P = 0.79). Students rated preparing and delivering a virtual presentation as quite beneficial (4 [3-4]) prior to the IVE and extremely beneficial (3 [3-5]) after the IVE (P = 0.16). The MS lecture series was rated as quite beneficial both prior to (4 [4-5]) and after (4.5 [4-5]) the IVE (P = 0.86). The remote resident didactics were rated as quite beneficial on both the pre- and post-IVE survey (4 [4-5] vs 4 [3-4], respectively, P = 0.054). On the pre-IVE survey, MSs preferred a full onsite away elective (16, 73%) vs. an official virtual elective (3, 14%), or an IVE (3, 14%). On the post-IVE survey, fewer MSs preferred an official virtual elective (1, 5%), and most still preferred a full onsite away elective (16, 80%). On the post-IVE survey, students reported participating in an onsite elective at their home institution (14, 70%), a full virtual away elective (7, 35%), a full onsite away elective (4, 20%), and none (2, 10%).

Our study reviews reported cases to assess the pharmacological approach to managing seizures in SARS-CoV-2 patients and associated outcomes. Methods: : A systematic review of case reports on the incidence of seizures following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients that reported use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in management was performed by using the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) guidelines. Databases used included EMBASE, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar. Data was presented as qualitative and descriptive data. Results: : In total, 67 articles were selected for full-text assessment, of which 18 were included in the final review. Patients had a median age of 54 years, most of whom were male. Remdisivir, dexamethasone, Laninamivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and Lopinavir-ritonavir were common agents used in the management of COVID-19. Most patients presented with either generalized tonic-clonic seizures or status epilepticus. Most patients received levetiracetam as drug choice or as part of their regimen. Other AEDs commonly prescribed included midazolam and sodium valproate. Some patients received no antiepileptic drug therapy. Most of the patients who died had more than one comorbidity.

We aimed to describe the incidence of death or new disability, functional impairment and changes in health-related quality of life of patients after COVID-19 critical illness at 6 months. METHODS: In a nationally representative, multicenter, prospective cohort study of COVID-19 critical illness, we determined the prevalence of death or new disability at 6 months, the primary outcome. We measured mortality, new disability and return to work with changes in the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 12L (WHODAS) and health status with the EQ5D-5L(TM). RESULTS: Of 274 eligible patients, 212 were enrolled from 30 hospitals. The median age was 61 (51C70) years, and 124 (58.5%) patients were male. At 6 months, 43/160 (26.9%) patients died and 42/108 (38.9%) responding survivors reported new disability. Compared to pre-illness, the WHODAS percentage score worsened (mean difference (MD), 10.40% [95% CI 7.06C13.77]; p < 0.001). Thirteen (11.4%) survivors had not returned to work due to poor health. There was a decrease in the EQ-5D-5L(TM) utility score (MD, ? 0.19 [? 0.28 to ? 0.10]; p < 0.001). At 6 months, 82 of 115 (71.3%) patients reported persistent symptoms.

However, NETs that is not properly regulated can propagate inflammation and thrombosis. It was recognized that viruses can induce NETs. As a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded (ds) RNA, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] is known to induce inflammation and thrombosis. However, whether and how poly(I:C) modulates NETs remains unclear. Here, we have demonstrated that poly(I:C) induced extracellular DNA traps in human neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner. Further, poly(I:C) or dsRNA virus elevated the levels of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes and citrullinated histone H3, which are specific markers of NETs, in both neutrophil supernatants and mouse plasma. Interestingly, a potent peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) inhibitor, BB-CL-Amidine (BB-CLA) or PAD4 knockdown effectively prevented poly(I:C)-induced NETs formation and release. In addition, BB-CLA abrogated poly(I:C)-triggered neutrophil activation and infiltration, and vascular permeability in lungs. BB-CLA also attenuated poly(I:C)-induced thrombocytopenia in circulation, fibrin deposition and thrombus formation in tissues. Taken together, these results suggest that viral mimetic poly(I:C) may induce NETs-dependent inflammation and thrombosis through PAD4, and that inhibiting PAD4 may become a good strategy to protect against viral infection-caused inflammation/thrombosis-related pathological conditions of diseases.","output":"Viral mimetic poly(I:C) induces neutrophil extracellular traps via PAD4 to promote inflammation and thrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to over 170 million cases worldwide with over 33.2 million cases and 594,000 deaths in the US alone as of May 31st, 2021.The pandemic has also created severe shortages of PPE, particularly of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs).

The influenza A virus is capable of enormous genetic variation, both by continuous, gradual mutation and by reassortment of genome segments between viruses.

The virus containing an expressed HE protein (A59-DE-HE) was generated by infecting cells with MHV-A59, which does not express HE, and transfecting thein vitro-transcribed DI RNA containing the HE gene. A similar virus (A59-DE-CAT) expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was used as a control. These viruses were inoculated intracerebrally into mice, and the role of the HE protein in viral pathogenesis was evaluated. Results showed that all mice infected with parental A59 or A59-DE-CAT succumbed to infection by 9 days postinfection (p.i.), demonstrating that inclusion of the DI did not by itself alter pathogenesis. In contrast, 60% of mice infected with A59-DE-HE survived infection. HE- or CAT-specific subgenomic mRNAs were detected in the brains at days 1 and 2 p.i. but not later, indicating that the genes in the DI vector were expressed only in the early stage of viral infection. No significant difference in virus titer or viral antigen expression in brains was observed between A59-DE-HE- and A59-DE-CAT-infected mice, suggesting that virus replication in brain was not affected by the expression of HE. However, at day 3 p.i. there was a slight increase in the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration in the brains of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice. Surprisingly, virus titers in the livers of A59-DE-HE-infected mice were 3 log10lower than that of the A59-DE-CAT-infected mice at day 6 p.i. Also, substantially less necrosis and viral antigen were detected in the livers of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice. This may account for the reduced mortality of these mice. The possible contribution of the host immune system to this difference in pathogenesis was analyzed by comparing the expression of four cytokines. Results showed that both tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-6 mRNAs increased in the brains of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice at day 2 p.i., whereas interferon- and interleukin-1 mRNAs were similar between A59-DE-HE- and A59-DE-CAT-infected mice. These data suggest that the transient expression of HE protein enhances an early innate immune response, possibly contributing to the eventual clearance of virus from the liver. This study indicates the feasibility of the DI expression system for studying roles of viral proteins during MHV infection.","output":"Expression of Hemagglutinin/Esterase by a Mouse Hepatitis Virus Coronavirus DefectiveCInterfering RNA Alters Viral Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emergence of Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), quickly became one of the most severe disease outbreaks in modern history. This caused many aesthetic practices around the country to close temporarily and led to a unique time period to evaluate the impact neurotoxin has in the setting of an ongoing pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the administration of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX Cosmetic, Allergan plc, Coolock, Ireland), in regular users, synergistically amplifies the elevation in mood/happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance and overall satisfaction, in the context of the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: A randomized single-blind cross-over study was designed to evaluate the impact of neurotoxin treatment in the upper third of the face on mood, self-satisfaction with appearance, and overall satisfaction. The placebo group crossed over to treatment after 1 month. Surveys evaluating patient happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance and overall efficacy were completed among both groups, and again to the placebo group again following crossover to treatment. RESULTS: Forty-five subjects were enrolled with 30 in the treatment and 15 in the control/cross-over group. The placebo group demonstrated no change in happiness or self-satisfaction in appearance until cross-over to the treatment group. Both groups, once receiving, onabotulinumtoxinA reported increased happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance and overall treatment satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment to the upper face in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic was found to increase patient happiness, self-satisfaction with appearance, and overall treatment satisfaction.","output":"A Randomized, Single-Blind, Crossover Study Evaluating the Impact of OnabotulinumtoxinA Treatment on Mood and Appearance During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interventions from randomised controlled trials can only be replicated if they are reported in sufficient detail.

This review focuses primarily on mechanisms that contribute to acute cardiac injury and dysfunction, which are common in patients with severe disease. The etiology of cardiac injury is multifactorial, and the extent is likely enhanced by preexisting cardiovascular disease. Disruption of homeostatic mechanisms secondary to pulmonary pathology ranks high on the list, and there is growing evidence that direct infection of cardiac cells can occur. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a central role in COVID-19 and is a necessary receptor for viral entry into human cells. ACE2 normally not only eliminates angiotensin II (Ang II) by converting it to Ang-(1C7) but also elicits a beneficial response profile counteracting that of Ang II. Molecular analyses of single nuclei from human hearts have shown that ACE2 is most highly expressed by pericytes. Given the important roles that pericytes have in the microvasculature, infection of these cells could compromise myocardial supply to meet metabolic demand. Furthermore, ACE2 activity is crucial for opposing adverse effects of locally generated Ang II, so virus-mediated internalization of ACE2 could exacerbate pathology by this mechanism. While the role of cardiac pericytes in acute heart injury by SARS-CoV-2 requires investigation, expression of ACE2 by these cells has broader implications for cardiac pathophysiology.","output":"Role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and pericytes in cardiac complications of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For most pathogens, transmission is driven by interactions between the behaviours of infectious individuals, the behaviours of the wider population, the local environment, and immunity.

We apply it to geocoded dengue virus sequences from Thailand (N = 726 over 18 years). We find infected individuals spend 96% of their time in their home community compared to 76% for the susceptible population (mainly children) and 42% for adults. Dynamic pockets of local immunity make transmission more likely in places with high heterotypic immunity and less likely where high homotypic immunity exists.

The present pilot study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential and safety of MSCs isolated from healthy cord tissues in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Twelve patients with COVID-19 treated with MSCs plus conventional therapy and 13 treated with conventional therapy alone (control) were included. The efficacy of MSC infusion was evaluated by changes in oxygenation index, clinical chemistry and hematology tests, immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, and pulmonary computerized tomography (CT) imaging. The safety of MSC infusion was evaluated based on the occurrence of allergic reactions and serious adverse events. RESULTS: The MSC-treated group demonstrated significantly improved oxygenation index. The area of pulmonary inflammation decreased significantly, and the CT number in the inflammatory area tended to be restored. Decreased IgM levels were also observed after MSC therapy. Laboratory biomarker levels at baseline and after therapy showed no significant changes in either the MSC-treated or control group.

Current animal models lack many essential human characteristics (in addition to raising operational challenges and ethical concerns), and conventional in vitro models, in turn, are limited in their capacity to provide information regarding many functional and systemic responses. Indeed, these challenges may underlie the notoriously low success rates of CNS drug development efforts. During the past 5 years, there has been a leap in the complexity and functionality of in vitro systems of the CNS, which have the potential to overcome many of the limitations of traditional model systems. The availability of human-derived induced pluripotent stem cell technology has further increased the translational potential of these systems. Yet, the adoption of state-of-the-art in vitro platforms within the CNS research community is limited. This may be attributable to the high costs or the immaturity of the systems. Nevertheless, the costs of fabrication have decreased, and there are tremendous ongoing efforts to improve the quality of cell differentiation.

To date, data to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among pregnant U.S. women and determine whether signs and symptoms differ among pregnant and nonpregnant women are limited. During January 22-June 7, as part of COVID-19 surveillance, CDC received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15-44 years) who had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Data on pregnancy status were available for 91,412 (28.0%) women with laboratory-confirmed infections; among these, 8,207 (9.0%) were pregnant. Symptomatic pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19 reported similar frequencies of cough (>50%) and shortness of breath (30%), but pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea. Chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease were more commonly reported among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women. Among women with COVID-19, approximately one third (31.5%) of pregnant women were reported to have been hospitalized compared with 5.8% of nonpregnant women. After adjusting for age, presence of underlying medical conditions, and race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-1.8) and receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.4).

METHODS: Retrospective serial cross-sectional study in nine UK hospitals using hospital activity data from 28 October 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to 10 May 2020 (pre-easing of lockdown) and for the same weeks during 2018-2019. We analysed aggregate data for selected cardiovascular diseases before and during the epidemic. We produced an online visualisation tool to enable near real-time monitoring of trends. RESULTS: Across nine hospitals, total admissions and emergency department (ED) attendances decreased after lockdown (23 March 2020) by 57.9% (57.1%-58.6%) and 52.9% (52.2%-53.5%), respectively, compared with the previous year. Activity for cardiac, cerebrovascular and other vascular conditions started to decline 1-2 weeks before lockdown and fell by 31%-88% after lockdown, with the greatest reductions observed for coronary artery bypass grafts, carotid endarterectomy, aortic aneurysm repair and peripheral arterial disease procedures. Compared with before the first UK COVID-19 (31 January 2020), activity declined across diseases and specialties between the first case and lockdown (total ED attendances relative reduction (RR) 0.94, 0.93-0.95; total hospital admissions RR 0.96, 0.95-0.97) and after lockdown (attendances RR 0.63, 0.62-0.64; admissions RR 0.59, 0.57-0.60).

Rapid exchange of experience among caregivers led to changes in ECMO support strategies, and patient management that resulted in improved outcomes in recent pandemic waves. We present our 18 months experience comparing patient outcomes in 2020 vs 2021. Methods We present a single institution retrospective analysis of patients receiving ECMO for COVID-19 ARDS. Patient data include demographics, comorbidities, time from admission to intubation and to initiation of ECMO support, type and duration of ECMO support, major patient and ECMO circuit complications, and hospital survival to discharge, or acceptance/transfer to lung transplant center. Results A total of 20 patients were identified for analysis. The cohort was predominantly male (65%) with an age and body mass index (BMI) average of 49.210.2 years and 32.85.9 kg/m2, respectively The average length of stay was 44.816.3 days and 55%. Most common support mode was veno-venous ECMO (90%) with a right femoral vein/right internal jugular cannulation (60%), and 75% required ECMO-circuit exchange. Comparing patients supported in 2020 vs 2021, time from intubation-to-ECMO, admission-to-tracheostomy, and ECMO-to-discharge were statistically significant (p=0.015; 0.014; 0.05; CI 95%). Overall survival rate was 65%, with a significant increase to 83% in 2021. Congruently, 55% of all discharged patients underwent ambulatory physical therapy treatment.

Conclusion Changes in management of patients receiving ECMO for COVID19 ARDS, including anticoagulation with bivalirudin, early tracheostomy and physical therapy, conversion to VAV ECMO, and referral to lung transplant resulted in 60 day hospital survival of 83% in 2021.","output":"Shifting Paradigms in ECMO Support for Severe COVID-19 Respiratory Failure Result in over 80% Hospital Survival in 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Individuals recovering from COVID-19 are known to have antibodies against the Spike and other structural proteins. Antibodies against Spike have been shown to display viral neutralization. However, not all antibodies against Spike have neutralizing ability although they may be cross-reactive. There is a need for easy-to-use SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing assays for the determination of virus-neutralizing activity in sera of individuals. Here we describe a PCR-based micro\\\\neutralization assay that can be used to evaluate the viral neutralization titers of serum from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 strain used was isolated from a nasopharyngeal specimen of a COVID-19 case. The limiting dilution method was used to obtain a 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of Vero cells. For the micro\\\\neutralization assay, 19 serum samples, with positive IgG titers against Spike Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) were tested. After 24 hours, infected cells were inspected for the presence of a cytopathic effect, lysed and RNA RT-PCR conducted for SARS-CoV-2. PCR target Ct values were used to calculate percent neutralization/inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Out of 19 samples, 13 samples gave 100% neutralization at all dilutions, 1 sample showed neutralization at the first dilution, 4 samples showed neutralization at lower dilutions, while one sample did not demonstrate any neutralization. The RBD ODs and neutralization potential percentages were found to be positively correlated.

Uncertainty exists regarding the effectiveness and safety of these noninvasive respiratory strategies. Objective: To determine whether either CPAP or HFNO, compared with conventional oxygen therapy, improves clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Design, Setting, and Participants: A parallel group, adaptive, randomized clinical trial of 1273 hospitalized adults with COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The trial was conducted between April 6, 2020, and May 3, 2021, across 48 acute care hospitals in the UK and Jersey. Final follow-up occurred on June 20, 2021. Interventions: Adult patients were randomized to receive CPAP (n = 380), HFNO (n = 418), or conventional oxygen therapy (n = 475). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of tracheal intubation or mortality within 30 days. Results: The trial was stopped prematurely due to declining COVID-19 case numbers in the UK and the end of the funded recruitment period. Of the 1273 randomized patients (mean age, 57.4 [95% CI, 56.7 to 58.1] years; 66% male; 65% White race), primary outcome data were available for 1260. Crossover between interventions occurred in 17.1% of participants (15.3% in the CPAP group, 11.5% in the HFNO group, and 23.6% in the conventional oxygen therapy group). The requirement for tracheal intubation or mortality within 30 days was significantly lower with CPAP (36.3%; 137 of 377 participants) vs conventional oxygen therapy (44.4%; 158 of 356 participants) (absolute difference, -8% [95% CI, -15% to -1%], P = .03), but was not significantly different with HFNO (44.3%; 184 of 415 participants) vs conventional oxygen therapy (45.1%; 166 of 368 participants) (absolute difference, -1% [95% CI, -8% to 6%], P = .83). Adverse events occurred in 34.2% (130/380) of participants in the CPAP group, 20.6% (86/418) in the HFNO group, and 13.9% (66/475) in the conventional oxygen therapy group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19, an initial strategy of CPAP significantly reduced the risk of tracheal intubation or mortality compared with conventional oxygen therapy, but there was no significant difference between an initial strategy of HFNO compared with conventional oxygen therapy. The study may have been underpowered for the comparison of HFNO vs conventional oxygen therapy, and early study termination and crossover among the groups should be considered when interpreting the findings.

The COVID-19 disease includes, also damage to other organ systems as well as coagulopathy. The present report describes a case of COVID-19 presenting with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and subsequent acute limb ischemia (ALI). PRESENTATION OF CASE: An 84-years old hospitalized female patient presenting diabetes and recent COVID-19 reported acute onset of abdominal pain and typical findings of AMI. The CT-angiography confirmed the AMI secondary to a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion. The patient was managed through an endovascular approach using a SMA mechanical thrombectomy and stenting with a good result. DISCUSSION: Treatment of this life-threatening condition includes surgical resection of the necrotic bowel, restoration of blood flow to the ischemic intestine and supportive measure - gastrointestinal decompression, fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic support. Endovascular management of AMI is preferred over the standard surgical approach due to a reduced mortality and morbidity rates. Imaging findings of intestinal necrosis, however, represent an indication for AMI surgical treatment with explorative laparotomy. Different endovascular solutions have been employed to address AMI including mechanical thrombectomy, local thrombolysis, and PTA-stenting. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 clinical presentation can be atypical, including gastrointestinal symptoms. If a first embolic event occurs, an aggressive anticoagulation treatment could be inefficient to reduce the risk of subsequent embolization events. The limited life expectancy of such revascularization procedures should orientate towards less invasive treatments.","output":"Staged acute mesenteric and peripheral ischemia treatment in COVID-19 patient: Case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the transformation of urban sound environments during the COVID-19 pandemic in Montreal, Canada.

The analyses rely on continuous acoustic monitoring of three sites. The comparisons are presented in terms of (1) energetic acoustic indicators over different periods of time (L(den), L(d), L(e), L(n)), (2) statistical acoustic indicators (L(10), L(90)), and (3) hourly, daily, and weekly profiles of sound levels throughout the day. Preliminary analyses reveal sound level reductions on the order of 6C7 dB(A) during lockdown, with differences more or less marked across sites and times of the day. After lockdown, sound levels gradually increased following an incremental relaxation of confinement. Within four weeks, sound levels measurements nearly reached the pre-COVID-19 levels despite a reduced number of pedestrian activities. Long-term measurements suggest a new normal that is not quite as loud without festival activities, but that is also not characterizable as quiet.

In June 2020, 4 months after COVID-19 pandemic restrictions introduction, we reassessed (2nd observation) 74 and 75 participants from previously exposed and unexposed groups, respectively, using the same study protocol. We collected medical history, office and ambulatory BP, echocardiographic and arterial stiffness data. Results: In exposed to aircraft noise group the prevalence of arterial hypertension increased from 1st to 2nd observation (P&lt;0.05). During lockdown in the noise exposed group office and 24 hour diastolic BP (DBP, P&lt;0.022) decreased signifi-cantly, which was accompanied by a significant drop in annoyance (P=0.006). In this group in 2nd observation DBP was significantly lower than estimated DBP (i.e. calculated as a sum of DBP at 1st observation and parameter estimates of crosssectional association of DBP and age multiplied by 5.5 year-time period between observations) (P=0.047). The obtained decline in DBP from 1st to 2nd observation was grater in noise exposed than unexposed participants, even after adjustment for covariates. The carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), initially higher in noise exposed group, decreased from 1st to 2nd observation in both groups, however this was more pronounced in the exposed than unexposed group (P=0.003). In 1st observation PWV in noise exposed participants did not show any relationship with age (Parameter Estimate (PE)=0.01 m/s/year;P= 0.71), while in 2nd observation, during aircraft noise decline caused by COVID-19 lockdown, the expected positive relation of PWV with age was reinstituted (PE=0.15 m/s/year;P&lt;0.001).

METHODS: During the study period, 237 S. pneumoniae isolates were collected from non-duplicate patients, covering 15.0% of IPD cases in Taiwan. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using a Sensititre? system. A latex agglutination method (ImmuLex? Pneumotest Kit) was used to determine serotypes. RESULTS: Susceptibility rates were high for vancomycin (100%), teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%), followed by ceftaroline (non-meningitis) (98.3%), moxifloxacin (94.9%) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (89.9%).

In this review, we summarize the newest and most advanced platforms coupling optically active materials (noble metal nanoparticles) and flexible substrates giving rise to hybrid nanomaterials and/or nanocomposites, whose performances are comparable to the ones obtained with hard substrates (e.g., glass and semiconductors). We focus on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-based and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-based biosensors.

Contemporary synthetic biology is essentially composed of various research tribes with different methods, languages, metaphors and agendas willing to understand biological systems andin particularto engineer them for solving health, food, energy and environmental problems. Synthetic biology is not only an extension of traditional genetic engineering where Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are produced, but it is also endowed of various elements that allow the emergence of new artificial life forms. In this chapter, a brief history of synthetic biology is presented, followed by a description of its most prominent tribes and a proposition for categorising the various engineering approaches currently practiced in the field. An overview of existing and nascent GMOs is also given, including some of their applications as well as biosafety and biosecurity risks. Finally, some challenges, dilemmas and paradoxes in synthetic biology beyond the bench are very briefly examined, particularly with regard to global social justice, democratization of molecular biology, environmental concerns, policy regulation, the GMO debate, media hype, public acceptance, and the issue of resurrecting extinct life.","output":"The Synthetic Nature of Biology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the target tissue necrosis volume and the target tissue size during the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS The target tissues with four different sizes (dxy = 20, 25, 30 and 35 mm) were modelled using a two-compartment radiofrequency ablation model. Different voltages were applied to seek the maximum target tissue necrosis volume for each target tissue size. The first roll-off occurrence or the standard ablation time (12 min) was taken as the sign for the termination of the RFA procedure. RESULTS Four different maximum voltages without the roll-off occurrence were found for the four different sizes of target tissues (dxy = 20, 25, 30 and 35 mm), and they were 36.6, 35.4, 33.9 and 32.5 V, respectively. The target tissues with diameters of 20, 25 mm can be cleanly ablated at their own maximum voltages applied (MVA) but the same finding was not found for the 35-mm target tissue. For the target tissue with diameter of 30 mm, the 50 C isothermal contour (IT50) result showed that the target tissue can be cleanly ablated, but the same result did not show in the Arrhenius damage model result. Furthermore, two optimal RFA protocols with a minimal thermal damage to the healthy tissues were found for the target tissues with diameters of 20 and 25 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The study suggests that target tissues of different sizes should be treated with different RFA protocols. The maximum target tissue volume was achieved with the MVA without the roll-off occurrence for each target tissue size when a constant RF power supply was used.","output":"Study of the relationship between the target tissue necrosis volume and the target tissue size in liver tumours using two-compartment finite element RFA modelling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the way patients seek medical attention and how medical services are provided.

However, transplantation does play a role if TPN fails, with failure defined by Medicare as liver failure, frequent line sepsis, major central vein thrombosis, or recurrent dehydration. Of these complications, the relationship between liver failure and subsequent death in high-risk subgroups of long-term TPN patients has been shown clearly. Patients with less than 100 cm of postduodenal small bowel, an end-jejunostomy, no ileocecal valve or cecum, or persistently elevated liver function levels are at high risk for end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Early referral to experienced centers is suggested in these circumstances. High-risk patients may also take part in clinical trials of promising therapies to increase intestinal adaptation and prevent liver failure. Living donors should be considered for transplant candidates to minimize waiting time and optimize HLA matching. ESLD patients need a liver-intestine transplant. Because their waiting-list mortality is very high, their status on the liver waiting list should be elevated if possible. High incidence of early death from sepsis is reported after intestinal transplant, even at experienced centers. Aggressive measures should be taken if uncontrolled sepsis occurs, including discontinuing immunosuppression and removing the graft. Further research is needed in intestinal immunology and in development of strategies to decrease the need for aggressive immunosuppression in these transplant recipents.

Pre-existing geriatric conditions such as comorbidity and frailty seem related to worse hospital outcomes. AIMS: To assess the role of nutritional status as an independent prognostic factor for in-hospital death in elderly patients. METHODS: Consecutive elderly patients (age > 65 years) hospitalized for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were enrolled. Demographics, laboratory and comorbidity data were collected. Nutritional status was evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). Uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses to evaluate predictors for in-hospital death were performed. RESULTS: One hundred and nine hospitalized elderly patients (54 male) were consecutively enrolled. At univariate analysis, age (HR 1.045 [CI 1.008-1.082]), cognitive impairment (HR 1.949 [CI 1.045-3.364]), C-reactive protein (HR 1.004 [CI 1.011-1.078]), lactate dehydrogenases (HR 1.003 [CI 1.001-1.004]) and GNRI moderate-severe risk category (HR 8.571 [CI 1.096-67.031]) were risk factors for in-hospital death, while albumin (HR 0.809 [CI 0.822-0.964]), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (HR 0.996 [CI 0.993-0.999]) and body mass index (HR 0.875 [CI 0.782-0.979]) were protective factors.

We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection among people experiencing homelessness on a large city-wide scale in Marseille, France, taking into account different types of accommodation. METHODS: A consortium of outreach teams in 48 different locations including streets, slums, squats, emergency or transitional shelters and drop-in centres participated in the inclusion process. All participants consented to have a validated rapid antibody assay for immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG) and to answer a questionnaire on medical health conditions, comorbidities, and previous COVID-19 symptoms. Information on their housing conditions since the COVID-19 crisis was also collected from the participants. RESULTS: From June 01 to August 05, 2020, 1,156 homeless participants were enrolled in the study and tested. The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies was 5.6% (95%CI 2.3C7.0), ranging from 2.2% in people living on the streets to 8.1% in people living in emergency shelters (P = 0.009). Around one third of the seropositive participants reported COVID-19 symptoms. Compared to the general population in Marseille (3.6%), the homeless population living in the same urban area experienced a significantly increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (|z| = 3.65 > 1.96). CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the need for regular screening among the homeless to prevent clustering in overcrowded or inadequate accommodations. It is also necessary to provide essential resources to keep homeless people healthy, the vast majority of whom have cumulative risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among homeless people living rough, in shelters and squats: A large population-based study in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last few months, there have been numerous reports describing a variety of cutaneous signs associated with COVID-19.

The survey was designed to determine the impact of the pandemic at two specific time-points: June and October 2020 and compare them to the previously collected data. Materials: and Methods: A web-based questionnaire, in the same format as the April 2020 survey was disseminated to nuclear medicine facilities worldwide. Survey data was collected using a secure software platform hosted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA);it was made available for 6 weeks, from November 23 to December 31, 2020. Results: : From 505 replies from 96 countries, data was extracted from 355 questionnaires (of which 338 were fully completed). The responses came from centres evenly distributed in different regions of the world and with different income status. Regional differences and challenges across the world were identified and analysed. Globally, the volume of nuclear medicine procedures decreased by 73.3% in June 2020 and 56.9% in October 2020. Among the nuclear medicine procedures, oncological PET studies showed less of a decline in utilization compared to conventional nuclear medicine and particularly nuclear cardiology. The impact was also significantly less in high-income countries. A trend towards a return to the pre-COVID-19 situation of the supply chains of radioisotopes, generators, and other essential materials was evident. Conclusion: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significant reduction in nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic procedures throughout 2020.

A total of 4,483 patients were identified (PORT, n = 1,850; no PORT, n = 2,633). The impact of patient and treatment variables on OS was explored using Cox regression. RESULTS Median follow-up time was 22 months. On univariable analysis, improved OS correlated with younger age, treatment at an academic facility, female sex, urban population, higher income, lower Charlson comorbidity score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT. On multivariable analysis, improved OS remained independently predicted by younger age, female sex, urban population, lower Charlson score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT (hazard ratio, 0.886; 95% CI, 0.798 to 0.988). Use of PORT was associated with an increase in median and 5-year OS compared with no PORT (median OS, 45.2 v 40.7 months, respectively; 5-year OS, 39.3% [95% CI, 35.4% to 43.5%] v 34.8% [95% CI, 31.6% to 38.3%], respectively; P = .014).

TNF receptors in their soluble form (sTNFR) are involved in the immune cascade in other systemic inflammatory processes such as septic shock, and could mediate the inflammatory activation of distant organs. The aim of this study is to analyse plasma levels of sTNFR 1 and 2 in association with organ failure and outcome in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods After informed consent, we included 122 adult patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 at ICU admission. Demographic data, illness severity scores, organ failure and survival at 30 days were collected. Plasma sTNFR 1 and 2 levels were quantified during the first days after ICU admission. Twenty-five healthy blood donors were used as control group. Results Levels of sTNFR were higher in severe COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p<0.001). Plasma levels of sTNFR were associated to illness severity scores (SAPS 3 and SOFA), inflammation biomarkers such as IL-6, ferritin and PCT as well as development of AKI during ICU stay. sTNFR 1 higher than 2.29 ng/mL and? sTNFR 2 higher than 11.7 ng/mL were identified as optimal cut-offs to discriminate survivors and non-survivors 30 days after ICU admission and had an area under the curve in receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 and 0.67 respectively. Conclusion Plasma levels of sTNFR 1 and 2 were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls and were strongly associated with other inflammatory biomarkers, severity of illness and acute kidney injury development during ICU stay.

The objective of this study is to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19. In fact, to stop the spread of COVID-19, the vaccine of the disease is needed. However, in the absence of the vaccine, people must have to obey curfew and social distancing and follow the media alert coverage rule. In order to maintain these alternative factors, we must obey the modeling rule. Therefore, the impact of curfew, media alert coverage, and social distance between the individuals on the outbreak of disease is considered. Five ordinary differential equations of the first-order are used to represent the model. The solution properties of the system are discussed. The equilibria and the basic reproduction number are computed. The local and global stabilities are studied. The occurrence of local bifurcation near the disease-free equilibrium point is investigated. Numerical simulation is carried out in applying the model to the sample of the Iraqi population through solving the model using the RungeCKutta fourth-order method with the help of Matlab. It is observed that the complete application of the curfew and social distance makes the basic reproduction number less than one and hence prevents the outbreak of disease. However, increasing the media alert coverage does not prevent the outbreak of disease completely, instead of that it reduces the spread, which means the disease is under control, by reducing the basic reproduction number and making it an approachable one.

The concept of mini-fellowships has also emerged with the elimination of the oral American Board of Radiology examinations that had been administered in the final year of residency training prior to 2014. This paper seeks to assess the opinions of fellowship program directors, residency program directors, and chief residents regarding these recent changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a cross-sectional study using a web-based survey posed to fellowship program directors, residency program directors, and chief residents in 2020. Questions sought to explore current attitudes toward the following topics: (1) a common fellowship application timeline; (2) a common fellowship match; and (3) the status of mini-fellowships in diagnostic radiology. In addition, the number of fellowship positions for each subspecialty was estimated using subspecialty society directories, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) data, and individual program websites. RESULTS Deidentified responses were collected electronically and aggregated. The three respondent groups preferred a common fellowship application timeline at rates of 67% among fellowship program directors, 80% residency program directors, and 74% residents. A common match system across all subspecialties was preferred at rates of 50% fellowship program directors, 74% residency program directors, and 26% chief residents. There was widespread reported compliance with the SCARD fellowship timeline policy. Subspecialty programs using the match system reported interviewing greater numbers of applicants per position. Fellowship directors and chief residents reported that the most common duration of mini-fellowship experiences was 2 to 3 months. CONCLUSION There is a division between chief residents and program directors regarding the preference for a common radiology match. Adopting a radiology-wide fellowship match would increase the number of interviews required.

METHODS A total of 122 patients with primary or secondary liver malignancy (18 different cell types) underwent SPECT imaging after intraarterial injection of (99m)Tc macroaggregated albumin (TcMAA) as a simulation of subsequent (90)Y microsphere distribution, followed by administration of an excess of intravenous (99m)Tc-labelled sulphur colloid (TcSC) as a biomarker for functional liver, and a second SPECT scan. TcMAA distribution was used to estimate (90)Y radiation absorbed dose in tumour (D T) and in functional liver. Laboratory and clinical follow-up were recorded for 12 weeks after RE, and radiographic responses according to (m)RECIST were evaluated at 3 and 6 months. Dose-response relationships were determined for efficacy and toxicity. RESULTS Patients were treated with a median of 1.73 GBq activity of resin microspheres (98 patients) or glass microspheres (24 patients), in a whole-liver approach (97 patients) or a lobar approach (25 patients). The objective response rate was 41% at 3 months and 48% at 6 months. Response was correlated with D T (P < 0.01). Median overall survival was 10.1 months (95% confidence interval 7.4 - 12.8 months). Responders lived for 36.0 months compared to 8.7 months for nonresponders (P < 0.01). Stratified for tumour cell type, D T was independently associated with survival (P < 0.01). Absorbed dose in functional liver was correlated with toxicity grade change (P < 0.05) and RE-induced liver disease (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Fusion dual-tracer SPECT imaging offers a physiology-based functional imaging tool to predict efficacy and toxicity of RE. This technique can be refined to define dosing thresholds for specific tumour types and treatments, but appears generally predictive even in a heterogeneous cohort.","output":"Fusion dual-tracer SPECT-based hepatic dosimetry predicts outcome after radioembolization for a wide range of tumour cell types."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Manual dexterity and visual-spatial ability are considered key to the development of superior laparoscopic skills. Nevertheless, these abilities do not reliably explain all the variance found in the technical performance of surgical trainees. Consequently, we must look beyond these abilities to improve our understanding of laparoscopic skills and to better identify/develop surgical potential earlier on. PURPOSE: To assess the individual and collective impact of physical, cognitive, visual, and psychological variables on performance during and after basic simulation-based laparoscopic skills training. METHOD: Thirty-four medical students (laparoscopic novices) completed a proficiency-based laparoscopic skills training program (using either a 2D or 3D viewing mode). This was followed by one testing session, a follow-up testing session with new (yet similar) tasks, and a series of physical, cognitive, visual, and psychological measures. RESULTS: The statistical models that best predicted variance in training performance metrics included four variables: viewing mode (2D vs 3D), psychological flexibility, perceived task demands, and manual dexterity (bimanual). In subsequent testing, a model that included viewing mode and manual dexterity (assembly) best predicted performance on the pre-practiced tasks. However, for a highly novel, spatially complex laparoscopic task, performance was best predicted by a model that comprised viewing mode, visual-spatial ability, and perceived task demands. At follow-up, manual dexterity (assembly) alone was the best predictor of performance on new (yet similar) tasks. CONCLUSION: By focussing exclusively on physical/cognitive abilities, we may overlook other important predictors of surgical performance (e.g. psychological variables). The present findings suggest that laparoscopic performance may be more accurately explained through the combined effects of physical, cognitive, visual, and psychological variables. Further, the results suggest that the predictors may change with both task demands and the development of the trainee. This study highlights the key role of psychological skills in overcoming initial training challenges, with far-reaching implications for practice.","output":"Aptitude and attitude: predictors of performance during and after basic laparoscopic skills training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated effects of home confinement on physical activity (PA) in Team Handball during the COVID-19 outbreak A total of 1359 handball players participated (age: 23 +/- 6 years) Participants from Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa answered an online version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) considering \\"before\\" and \\"during\\" confinement COVID-19 home confinement has had a negative effect on PA (vigorous, moderate, walking, and overall) The largest decrease was in the sum parameter \\"all PA\\" (MET (metabolic equivalent of task)-min/week, etap2 = 0 903;min/week, etap2 = 0 861) Daily sitting time increased from 2 7 to 5 0 h per weekday (p p2 = 0 669) For gender, continent, country, level of handball league, and playing position, no significant differences (group and interaction effects) were observed The largest change in PA behavior was in walking (minutes per day: etap2 = 0 755), with males displaying the greatest decrease (from 62 +/- 11 to 30 +/- 14 min per weekday;d = 2 67) In terms of magnitude, difference between genders was greatest for sitting time (difference in d = 1 20) In conclusion, while COVID-19 measures were essential to preserve public health, PA was compromised and sedentary behavior increased because of these public health measures regardless of gender, playing position, and competition level","output":"Effects of Home Confinement on the Intensity of Physical Activity during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Team Handball According to Country, Gender, Competition Level, and Playing Position: A Worldwide Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To measure the correlation between single breath counting (SBC) and forced vital capacity (liters, FVCL) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and to define the utility of SBC for determining when patients meet the threshold for initiation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (FVC < 50% predicted [FVCpred]). Methods: Both patient paced (SBCpp) or externally paced (SBCep) counting along with FVCL+pred and standard clinical data were collected. Linear regression was used to examine SBCpp and SBCep as a predictor of FVCL. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of SBC categorically predicting FVCpred of 50%. Results: In 30 ALS patients, SBC explained a moderate proportion of the variance in FVCL (SBCpp: R2= 0.431, p < 0.001; SBCep: R2 = 0.511, p < 0.01); this proportion improved when including covariates (SBCpp: R2= 0.635, p < 0.01; SBCep: R2= 0.657, p < 0.01). Patients with minimal speech involvement performed similarly in unadjusted (SBCpp: R2 = 0.511, p < 0.01; SBCep: R2= 0.595, p < 0.01) and adjusted (SBCpp: R2 = 0.634, p < 0.01; SBCep: R2= 0.650, p < 0.01) models. SBCpp had 100% sensitivity and 60% specificity (area under curve (AUC) = 0.696) for predicting FVCpred <50%. SBCep had 100% sensitivity and 56% specificity (AUC = 0.696). With minimal speech involvement SBCpp and SBCep both had 100% sensitivity and 76.1% specificity (SPCpp: AUC = 0.845; SBCep: AUC = 0.857). Conclusions: SBC explains a moderate proportion of variance in FVC and is an extremely sensitive marker of poor FVC.

Information and communication technologies-led developments including social media have previously been discussed as instruments of democratization of knowledge.

The communication inequalities have only reinforced the existing societal fault lines of race, class and place. As the first pandemic of the social media age, COVID-19 has also given rise to an \\"infodemic\\", providing fertile ground for the spread of information, misinformation and disinformation. With limited gatekeeping, an immense amount of unprocessed scientific information is being put forward to publics not trained in science. In this commentary, we offer some propositions on how disinformation on COVID-19 has become mainstreamed through social media's spiral of amplification and what role public communication has in an emergency from a lens of equity. We raise the question of whether the tremendous flow of scientific information during the COVID-19 pandemic has a differential impact on different socioeconomic groups. We propose that more systematic research is urgently needed to understand how mis/disinformation originate, spread and what their consequences are.

The effective recovery of its kinetic energy is lucrative from economical and technical standpoints. This study is focused on recovering the kinetic energy of the exhaust gas without deteriorating the main ventilator's safe operation or increasing power dissipation. The related experiments and numerical simulations were performed for the conical diffusers with diffusing angles of 16 and inlet diameters of 220 and 320 mm, respectively. By examining the start-up and operation states of the wind turbines using inlet collectors with conical, circular arc, and cone-arc shapes, it was found that the wind speed at the inlet of the drainage tube exceeded 4 and 20 m/s at the minimal and maximal distances from the wind turbine, respectively. The wind speed at the overflow tube outlet was no less than 1.8 m/s, proving a certain recovery of kinetic energy by the wind turbine. Thus, the critical distance between the diffuser and the inlet collector should be at least four times the diffuser's inlet diameter. Finally, the velocity, pressure, and flow fields in the vortex core regions of the kinetic recovery system with different types of inlet collectors were simulated with the FLUENT commercial software package. The simulation results revealed that the circular-arc collector outperformed other three tested configurations in kinetic energy recovery. Implications statementThis study is focused on recovering the kinetic energy of the exhaust gas without deteriorating the main ventilator's safe operation or increasing power dissipation. China is a country with coal as its main energy source, which releases over ten billion cubic meters of the exhaust gas annually. In addition to low-concentration methane, there is also the exhaust gas released at a velocity of about 20 m/s, which kinetic energy recovery would be very lucrative.The significance of this study is that the mine's main ventilator outlet was simplified as two conical diffusers with parameters =16/n=2 and =16/n=2.5, and the optimal critical distance between the diffuser and the collector was determined as 4Di, where Di was the diffuser's inlet diameter. Under that optimal condition, the system can achieve the maximum power without affecting the ventilator's normal operation. It is instructive to make full use of and manage the exhaust gas in mine that fits the journal on the purpose of air waste management.Finally, we provide a statement serious that the article is original and unpublished and is not being considered for publication elsewhere.","output":"Experimental study and numerical simulation of the kinetic energy recovery of the mine's exhaust gas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Council of Legal Education, which is the regulatory body for the legal profession in Nigeria, has made it clear over the years that the training of lawyers cannot be adequately carried out through correspondence or distance learning, which can be interpreted as online learning or remote learning.

Emerging studies have evaluated the relationship of NLR with cardiovascular diseases and malignant conditions. However, rare studies regarded the association between NLR and long-term health status. This study aimed to evaluate the association of NLR with all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality among adults in the United States. METHODS: We obtained eight cycles data of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1999 to 2014, and enrolled 32328 participants after certain screening. By weighted chi-square test and linear regression analysis, we analyzed the correlation between NLR and baseline characteristics of the participants. KaplanCMeier curves and Cox regression models were used to assess the survival relevance of NLR. We conducted stratified analysis, interaction analysis, and sensitivity analysis to robustness of our results. RESULTS: Participants with high NLR levels had a higher risk of death. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, the hazard ratio comparing the higher vs lower NLR levels was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.18C1.73) for all-cause mortality, 1.27 (95% CI, 0.84C1.92) for cancer mortality, and 1.44 (95% CI, 0.96C2.16) for cardiovascular disease mortality.

Qualitative household data were collected from Guyana and Nigeria looking at household perspectives on their waste management issues since the emergence of COVID-19. Statistical models were developed using limited-dependent binary logistic regression. The models showed for each country, different factors contributing to the likelihood of self-disposing. For Guyana, the change in waste collection schedule and the household proximity to landfills increases the likelihood of self-disposing while in Nigeria, the increase in household waste increases the likelihood of self-disposing. The results also showed that households who regularly engage in recycling activities are less likely to self-dispose.

Estimates show that this testing cost more than 400 million EUR and thousands of euros were paid for one positively identified case. Thus, it is possible to state a high cost for such a project, which has been criticized by many parties. On the other hand, from a public health point of view, mass testing has helped fight the pandemic. Both the health and economic perspectives are important in assessing the success of a pandemic strategy, but the social perspective is equally important. In fact, the situation is perceived from the position of public leaders who make decisions, but also from the position of the society that bears individual political decisions. It is not appropriate to forget about the society that is most affected by restrictions, testing, health status, but also the burden on the state budget. The objective of the presented research was to examine the perception of testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Slovak population. Non-parametric difference tests and correspondence analysis were used for statistical processing. The research sample consisted of 806 respondents and data collection took place in February 2021. The main findings include significant differences in perceptions between the first and the last participation in testing in terms of gender, age, testing experience, and time aspect. The last participation in testing showed lower rates of positive aspects related to the internal motivation to test compared to the first participation. In contrast, external stimulation by government regulations related to restrictions in the absence of a negative result was higher in the last participation in testing. There were also differences between the first and the last test in the level of doubts about the accuracy of the test result, while a higher level was found at the last testing participation. It can be concluded that the frequency of testing and its requirements need to be approached very carefully over time, as it is likely that the positive perceptions may deteriorate.

Moreover, significantly higher prevalence of definite + highly suspected diagnosis of Covid-19 disease was found either in patients with various \\"connective tissue diseases\\" compared to \\"inflammatory arthritis group\\" (p < .000), or in patients without ongoing conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs treatments (p = .011). CONCLUSIONS: The finding of a higher prevalence of Covid-19 in patients with autoimmune systemic diseases is particularly important, suggesting the need to develop valuable prevention/management strategies, and stimulates in-depth investigations to verify the possible interactions between Covid-19 infection and impaired immune-system of autoimmune systemic diseases. Key Points a? Significantly higher prevalence of Covid-19 is observed in a large series of patients with autoimmune systemic diseases compared to the Italian general population, mainly due to patients' increased susceptibility to infections and favored by the high exposure to the virus at medical facilities before the restriction measures on individual movement. a? The actual prevalence of Covid-19 in autoimmune systemic diseases may be underestimated, possibly due to the wide clinical overlapping between the two conditions, the generally mild Covid-19 disease manifestations, and the limited availability of virological testing. a? Patients with \\"connective tissue diseases\\" show a significantly higher prevalence of Covid-19, possibly due to deeper immune-system impairment, with respect to \\"inflammatory arthritis group\\". a? Covid-19 is more frequent in the subgroup of autoimmune systemic diseases patients without ongoing conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, mainly hydroxyl-chloroquine and methotrexate, which might play some protective role against the most harmful manifestations of Covid-19.","output":"COVID-19 and rheumatic autoimmune systemic diseases: report of a large Italian patients series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Todays, COVID-19 has caused much death and its spreading speed is increasing, regarding virus mutation. This outbreak warns diagnosing infected people is an important issue. So, in this research, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system called COV-CAD is proposed for diagnosing COVID-19 disease. This COV-CAD system is created by a feature extractor, a classification method, and a content-based imaged retrieval (CBIR) system. The proposed feature extractor is created by using the modified AlexNet CNN. The first modification changes ReLU activation functions to LeakyReLU for increasing efficiency. The second change is converting a fully connected (FC) layer of AlexNet CNN with a new FC, which results in reducing learnable parameters and training time. Another FC layer with dimensions 1  64 is added at the end of the feature extractor as the feature vector. In the classification section, a new classification method is defined in which the majority voting technique is applied on outputs of CBIR, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest for final diagnosing. Furthermore, in retrieval section, the proposed method uses CBIR because of its ability to retrieve the most similar images to the image of a patient. Since this feature helps physicians to find the most similar cases, they could conduct further statistical evaluations on profiles of similar patients. The system has been evaluated by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and mean average precision and its accuracy for CT and X-ray datasets is 93.20% and 99.38%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient than other similar studies.","output":"Diagnosing COVID-19 disease using an efficient CAD system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Avoidable human error is a significant cause of transfusion adverse events. Adequately trained, laboratory staff in blood establishments and blood banks, collectively blood facilities, are key in ensuring high-quality transfusion medicine (TM) services. Gaps in TM education and training of laboratory staff exist in most African countries. We assessed the status of the training and education of laboratory staff working in blood facilities in Africa. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered pilot-tested questionnaire was performed. The questionnaire comprised 26 questions targeting six themes. Blood facilities from 16 countries were invited to participate. Individually completed questionnaires were grouped by country and descriptive analysis performed. RESULTS: Ten blood establishments and two blood banks from eight African countries confirmed the availability of a host of training programs for laboratory staff; the majority of which were syllabus or curriculum-guided and focused on both theoretical and practical laboratory skills development. Training was usually preplanned, dependent on student and trainer availability and delivered through lecture-based classroom training as well as formal and informal on the job training. There were minimal online didactic and self-directed learning. Teaching of humanistic values appeared to be lacking. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the availability of diverse training programs across a variety of African countries. Incorporation of virtual learning platforms, rather than complete reliance on didactic, in-person training programs may improve the education reach of the existing programs. Digitalization driven by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may provide an opportunity to narrow the knowledge gap in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).","output":"Transfusion medicine and blood banking education and training for blood establishment laboratory staff: A review of selected countries in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We investigated possible COVID-19 epidemic clusters and their common sources of exposure that led to a sudden increase in the incidence of COVID-19 in the Jewish community of Marseille between March 15 and March 20, 2020. METHODS: All data were generated as part of routine work at Marseille university hospitals. Biological diagnoses were made by RT-PCR testing. A telephone survey of families in which a laboratory confirmed case was diagnosed was conducted to determine possible exposure events. RESULTS: As of March 30, 2020, 63 patients were linked to 6 epidemic clusters. The 6 clusters were linked to religious and social activities: a ski trip, organized meals for the Purim Jewish celebration in community and family settings on March 10, a religious service and a charity gala. Notably, 40% of the patients were infected by index patients during the presymptomatic period, which was 2.5 days before symptom onset. When considering household members, all 12 patients who tested negative and who did not develop any relevant clinical symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were 1C16 years of age. The clinical attack rate (symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and biologically confirmed by PCR) in adults was 85% compared to 26% in children. CONCLUSIONS: Family and community gatherings for the Purim Jewish celebration probably accelerated the spread of COVID-19 in the Marseille Jewish community, leading to multiple epidemic clusters.

Given their increased susceptibility to COVID-19, the question arises whether individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other metabolic conditions can respond effectively to the mRNA-based vaccine. We aimed to evaluate the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies in people with T2DM and/or other metabolic risk factors (hypertension and obesity) compared to those without. This study included 262 people that took two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine. Both T2DM and non-diabetic individuals had a robust response to vaccination as demonstrated by their high antibody titers. However, both SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies titers were lower in people with T2DM. Their levels were 154{+/-}49.1 vs. 138{+/-}59.4BAU/mL for IgG and 87.1{+/-}11.6 vs. 79.7{+/-}19.5% for neutralizing antibodies in individuals without diabetes compared to those with T2DM, respectively.

This study aimed to explore experiences and challenges associated with combining clinical academic careers with family life. METHODS: Qualitative data were gathered from participants from 4 NHS Trusts and 2 universities in the East Midlands of England using online surveys and semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 67 nurses, midwives and allied health professionals, and 73 medical clinical academic trainees. Interviews were conducted with 16 participants from each group including equal numbers of men and women. Caring responsibilities differed between the two study populations. Medical clinical academic trainees were younger and either had young children or were yet to start a family. In contrast, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals tended to be older when they embarked on a clinical academic career and often waited until their children were school-age or older. Similar concerns were raised regarding working part-time and childcare, and how their career prospects might be affected in terms of fulfilling promotion criteria and being able to relocate for work purposes. The occupation of their partners also featured in participants experiences; those who shared childcare with someone who worked regular hours, appeared to be better supported to combine a clinical academic career with family life. Gender stereotyping was identified in some reported experiences highlighting a need for appropriate mentorship and for positive role models who were able to demonstrate that it is possible to survive and thrive as a clinical academic with family responsibilities.

The actual number of infections potentially exceeds the number of confirmed cases. DEVELOPMENT: We develop a demographic scaling model to estimate COVID-19 infections, based on minimal data requirements: COVID-19-related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As many countries lack IFR estimates, we scale them from a reference country based on remaining lifetime to better match the context in a target population with respect to age structure, health conditions and medical services. We introduce formulas to account for bias in input data and provide a heuristic to assess whether local seroprevalence estimates are representative for the total population. APPLICATION: Across 10 countries with most reported COVID-19 deaths as of 23 July 2020, the number of infections is estimated to be three [95% prediction interval: 2-8] times the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The estimated number of infections is 5.3 million for the USA, 1.8 million for the UK, 1.4 million for France, and 0.4 million for Peru, or more than one, six, seven and more than one times the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Our central prevalence estimates for entire countries are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence studies.

The picture is still not clear because of many limitations including testing tools, time of sampling, and the unclear impact of varying clinical status. In addition to these problems, antibody levels may not be equivalent to protective capacity. Objective: To define the key factor for the different patterns of COVID-19 antibody response. Design: We elucidated the antibody response with time-series throat and serum samples for viral loads and antibody levels, then used a neutralization test to evaluate protectiveness. Setting: A medical center that typically cares for patients with moderate to severe diseases. Because of the low prevalence of COVID-19 in Taiwan and local government policy, however, we also admit COVID-19 patients with mild disease or even those without symptoms for inpatient care. Participants: RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Results: We found that only patients with relative persistence of virus at pharynx displayed strong antibody responses that were proportional to the pharyngeal viral load. They also had proportional neutralization titers per unit of serum. Although antibody levels decreased around 2 weeks after symptom onset, the neutralization efficacy per unit antibody remained steady and even continued to increase over time. The antibody response in patients with rapid virus clearance was weak, but the neutralization efficacy per unit antibody in these patients was comparable to those with persistent presence of virus. The deceased were with higher viral load, higher level of antibody, and higher neutralization titers in the serum, but the neutralization capacity per unit antibody is relatively low. Conclusions and Relevance: Strong antibody response depends on the relative persistence of the virus, instead of the absolute virus amount. The antibody response is still weak if large amount of virus is cleared quickly. The neutralization efficacy per unit antibody is comparable between high and low antibody patterns. Strong antibody response contains more inefficient and maybe even harmful antibodies. Low antibody response is also equipped with a capable B cell pool of efficient antibodies, which may expand with next virus encounter and confer protection.","output":"Relative COVID-19 viral persistence and antibody kinetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep emotion traumas in societies around the globe are overcome by extreme human catastrophes such as natural disasters, social crises, war conflicts and infectious virus induced pandemic diseases, etc., can lead to enormous stress-related disorders.

Although NE activity is positively correlated to gingival crevicular fluid and clinical attachment loss in periodontitis, the underlying mechanisms by which NE aggravates periodontitis remain elusive. In this study, we investigated how NE induces periodontitis severity and whether NE inhibitors were efficacious in periodontitis treatment. In a ligature-induced murine model of periodontitis, neutrophil recruitment, NE activity, and periodontal bone loss were increased in the periodontal tissue. Local administration of an NE inhibitor significantly decreased NE activity in periodontal tissue and attenuated periodontal bone loss. Furthermore, the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines in the gingiva, which was significantly upregulated in the model of periodontitis, was significantly downregulated by NE inhibitor injection.

Thus, combating VH, requires adequate and updated training to the HCWs. With this objective, Project PRAKASH designed a meticulously planned training program, aimed to assess the effect of a one-day training on VH among in-service nurses. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The content and schedule of scientific sessions of the training program were decided by subject experts to improve knowledge, attitude and practice(KAP) related to VH among in-service nurses. A 54-item questionnaire divided into four domains: Transmission and Risk Factors; Prevention; Treatment; Pathophysiology and Disease Progression were used to assess the KAP related to VH. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: demographic details, knowledge(30-items), attitude(12-items) and practice(12-itmes) with a total score of 30, 60 and 24 respectively in each section. The pre-post knowledge assessment was done and impact assessment survey was undertaken among the participants who completed six months post-training period. Paired-t-test was used to assess the effect of training on knowledge using SPSSv-22. RESULTS: A total of 5253 HCWs were trained through 32 one-day trainings, however data for 4474 HCWs was included in final pre-post knowledge analysis after removing the missing/incomplete data. Mean age of participants was 33.78.4 with median experience of 8(IQR: 3C13). Mean improvement in knowledge score was found to be significant (p<0.001) with mean knowledge score of 19.34.4 in pre-test and 25.73.9 in the post-test out of 30. Impact assessment survey suggested change in attitude and practice of HCWs. CONCLUSION: The one-day training programs helped the in-service nurses to enhance their knowledge related to viral hepatitis.

Objective: We wanted to compare the socio-labor effect of confinement in two populations as different as Spain and China, in patients with MS. Method: Questionnaires were applied to a group of MS patients who have been reviewed in the MS unit of the Vithas hospital (DINAC Foundation) in Seville, and MS patients attended in various provinces of China during the month of April 2020, with the aim of analyzing the differences and similarities of the socio-labor effect between both populations. To carry out this analysis, a database was created and subsequently analyzed. Results: The Chinese population has a higher proportion of younger patients and there is no difference regarding gender. Most of the variables studied behaved the same way in both Spanish and Chinese MS patients. Spanish patients had less impact (30.7%) on their socio-economic situation than Chinese (44%), p <0.05. There were no important differences in the rest of the variables between the two populations. Social networks were widely used in the majority of patients in both populations. Conclusions: MS patients suffer in a very similar way from the consequences of the pandemic on their socio-labor situation and similarly use social networks and family support.

However, malaria is spatially and temporally heterogenous and no analyses have been performed at a subdistrict level throughout the course of a year. The WHO recommends mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) every 3 years, but a national longitudinal evaluation has never been conducted in Malawi to determine LLIN effectiveness lifespans. METHODS: Using District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) health facility data, available from January 2018 to June 2020, we assessed malaria risk before and after a mass distribution campaign, stratifying by age group and comparing risk differences (RDs) by LLIN type or annual application of indoor residual spraying (IRS). RESULTS: 711 health facilities contributed 20 962 facility reports over 30 months. After national distribution of 10.7 million LLINs and IRS in limited settings, malaria risk decreased from 25.6 to 16.7 cases per 100 people from 2018 to 2019 high transmission seasons, and rebounded to 23.2 in 2020, resulting in significant RDs of ?8.9 in 2019 and ?2.4 in 2020 as compared with 2018. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO)-treated LLINs were more effective than pyrethroid-treated LLINs, with adjusted RDs of ?2.3 (95% CI ?2.7 to ?1.9) and ?1.5 (95% CI ?2.0 to ?1.0) comparing 2019 and 2020 high transmission seasons to 2018. Use of IRS sustained protection with adjusted RDs of ?1.4 (95% CI ?2.0 to ?0.9) and ?2.8% (95% CI ?3.5 to ?2.2) relative to pyrethroid-treated LLINs. Overall, 12 of 28 districts (42.9%) experienced increases in malaria risk in from 2018 to 2020. CONCLUSION: LLINs in Malawi have a limited effectiveness lifespan and IRS and PBO-treated LLINs perform better than pyrethroid-treated LLINs, perhaps due to net repurposing and insecticide-resistance. DHIS2 provides a compelling framework in which to examine localised malaria trends and evaluate ongoing interventions.","output":"Effectiveness of a national mass distribution campaign of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying on clinical malaria in Malawi, 2018C2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is emerging as a driver of greater reliance on wireless technologies, including intelligent assistive technologies, such as robots and artificial intelligence.

In this situation, the success of a CRM implementation highly depends on information technology and the applications used. To harmonize this new business context with the development of information systems (IS), a suitable CRM ontology and enterprise architecture (EA) is needed. While an ontology-based conceptual model provides a unifying framework, aids sharing and reusing knowledge, and facilitates communication within a domain, an EA-based model unequivocally describes, analyzes, and visualizes how an organization should operate from the perspective of business, application, and technology.

During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, fully online classes have also caused additional challenges to using conventional teaching methods. To explain a vector concept of more than 2 dimensions, visualization becomes a problem. Although Microsoft PowerPoint can integrate animation, the illustration is still in 2-dimensions. Augmented reality (AR) technology is recommended to aid educators and students in teaching-learning vectors, namely via a vector personal computer augmented reality system (VPCAR), to fulfil the demand for tools to support the learning and teaching of vectors. Methods: A PC learning module for vectors was developed in a 3-dimensional coordinate system by using AR technology. Purposive sampling was applied to get feedback from educators and students in Malaysia through an online survey. The supportiveness of using VPCAR based on six items (attractiveness, easiness, visualization, conceptual understanding, inspiration and helpfulness) was recorded on 5-points Likert-type scales. Findings are presented descriptively and graphically. Results: Surprisingly, both students and educators adapted to the new technology easily and provided significant positive feedback that showed a left-skewed and J-shaped distribution for each measurement item, respectively. The distributions were proven significantly different among the students and educators, where supportive level result of educators was higher than students. This study introduced a PC learning module other than mobile apps as students mostly use laptops to attend online class and educators also engage other IT tools in their teaching. Conclusions: Based on these findings, VPCAR provides a good prospect in supporting educators and students during their online teaching-learning process.

Until now, more than 20 genes have been implicated to be associated with this phenotype and TGM6 is one of these genes, associated with spinocerebellar ataxia-35 (SCA-35). The majority of disease-causing variants in the TGM6 gene predominantly have been reported from China and Taiwan and the association with Parkinson's disease (PD) have also been reported recently. Methods We report the first Indian case with SCA-35 in a 16-year-old-boy with atypical age of onset at 9 years, prominent extrapyramidal features, intellectual disability, and a novel missense mutation in the TGM6 gene. We also reviewed and collated all previously published cases with pathogenic TGM6 variants. Results Including the index case, 54 cases were identified from 10 relevant articles in literature and 48 cases had adequate clinical details to be included in the pooled analysis. Around two-thirds of reported cases had SCA-35 phenotype, with cerebellar atrophy. Onset in the majority of cases was the fourth decade of life onwards. A proportion of SCA-35 cases also had spasmodic torticollis, impaired proprioception, extrapyramidal features, and myoclonic jerks. The patients with PD had often early-onset milder symptoms, slower progression, and favorable response to levodopa/carbidopa. One patient each presented with episodic ataxia and dystonic tremor of the upper limb. Most of the cases had missense mutations, without any definite hotspot or genotype-phenotype correlation. Conclusions TGM6 mutation should be suspected in patients with SCA like presentation, especially when it is accompanied by extrapyramidal features, spasmodic torticollis, impaired proprioception, or myoclonus.","output":"Clinical Spectrum of TGM6-Related Movement Disorders: A New Report with a Pooled Analysis of 48 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Close to two decades of NASA Earth Observing System satellite data and algorithms refinements present unique opportunity to revisit the attributions of variability of tropospheric pollutants to economic activity, as well as pollutants contribution to the anthropogenic radiative forcing The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the top pollutants produced by industrial and power plants and traffic That long data record now covers events of economic variability like the recession of 2008/2009, as well as the effects of COVID-19 closures of 2019/2020 In particular, the COVID-19 lockdowns in the winter of 2019/2020 and the spring of 2020 resulted in contracting economies around the world While numerous imageries of reduced nitrogen dioxide (NO2) appeared to be popular, few studied gave numerical assessment of how much of the anomalies is attributable to the economic slowdown Furthermore, few studies touched on the possible climate offsets under the reduced emissions Using principal component (PC) analysis of 16 years of NO2 monthly series data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on the Aura satellite, we show that it is the third PC (PC3) from the deseasonalized hierarchy of principal modes that is best coupled with the economic indicators This coupling is positive, i e PC3 and economic indicators manifest positive covariance However, the economic variability can explain only 40% of the information in PC3 Furthermore, this mode by itself explains only 3% of the total deseasonalized NO2 variability We therefore conclude that, while having an unambiguous impact, the economy can be awarded at best third order of importance in the NO2 departures from the seasonal averages Once we identified PC3 as the NO2 mode that is coupled with the economic variability, we use this mode as an indicator and look for rapid climate adjustments to that part of the NO2 variability that we are confident is coupled with the economic variability We focus on observational data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on board the NASA Aqua satellite, decompose the series of surface skin temperature and clear-sky outgoing longwave radiances (OLR) into principal components, and identify potential impacts of the NO2 PC3 on these climate variables","output":"NO2 anomalies - Economy attribution and rapid climate response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the need to find the determinants for its correct distribution is created, with health personnel being an essential group where coverage must be ensured.

We sought to prospectively assess the presence of aortic inflammation and its time-dependent trend by measuring the 18-FDG uptake in PET/CT in patients with severe or critical COVID-19. Methods: In this pilot case control study, we recruited 20 patients, who were admitted with severe or critical COVID-19 illness. Patients underwent imaging between 20 to 120 days after hospital admission. Ten age- and sex-matched individuals with prior history of malignancy but free of active disease served as the control group. Arterial inflammation was assessed by measuring 18-FDG uptake in PET/CT and calculating aortic target to blood ratio (TBR). Results: There was a significant correlation between aortic TBR values and time distance from diagnosis to 18F-FDG PET/CT scan (-rho- =0.547, p=0.015) even after adjustment for confounders (p=0.002). Patients who were scanned less than 60 days (median) from diagnosis had significantly higher TBR values compared to patients examined more than 60 days post-diagnosis (1.55 [1.47-1.61] vs 1.40 [1.33-1.45], respectively, p=0.013).

This study was aimed at defining the demographic, social, clinical, and laboratory factors that affect antibiotic prescriptions in children discharged from the emergency department. We performed a retrospective observational study of children aged younger than 18 years discharged from a pediatric university hospital between Jan. 1, 2015 and Dec. 31, 2020. We determined the proportion and type of antibiotic prescription according to demographic, social, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data, as well as doctors expertise. Fifty-one thousand six hundred thirty-three children were included, and 13,167 (25.5%) received an antibiotic prescription. Amoxicilline/clavulanate (Am/Cl) was the most prescribed antibiotic (8453, 64.2% of all prescriptions). Factors independently associated with an antibiotic prescription were older age (OR = 1.62 [1.53C1.73] for age 2C5 years, OR = 1.77 [1.64C1.91] for age 6C10 years, OR = 1.36 [1.25C1.49] for age 11C18 years, p < 0.001 for all groups); being evaluated by a physician with > 3 years of pediatric expertise (OR = 1.22 [1.13C1.31], p < 0.001); fever peak higher than 40 C (OR = 1.37 [1.21C1.54], p < 0.001); abnormal findings on auscultation (OR = 1.95 [1.75C2.17], p < 0.001), CRP values (OR = 1.63 [1.26C2.10] for CRP < 50 mg/L, and OR = 3.78 (2.75C5.21) for CRP  50 mg/L with respect to CRP not requested; p < 0.01); CXR results whatever positive (OR = 4.47 [3.62C5.52], p < 0.001) or negative (1.82 [1.62C2.04], p < 0.001); being diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infections (OR = 4.27 [4.04C4.51], p < 0.001), lower respiratory tract infections (OR = 5.35 [4.88C5.85]; p < 0.001), and UTI (OR = 9.33 [8.14C10.71], p < 0.001).

This has resulted in an urgent need to obtain information regarding its pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical manifestations. More specifically, skin manifestations, seldom reported initially, have been increasingly described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a literature search in the PubMed database, regarding cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This article describes the clinical and histological findings of the main skin lesions observed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. DISCUSSION: Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been described in multiple retrospective and prospective studies, case series and case reports. The reported incidence reached 20.4%. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in terms of clinical patterns, the main ones include: erythematous/maculopapular, urticarial, papulovesicular, and purpuric/petechial eruptions, chilblain-like lesions and livedoid/acro-ischemic lesions. In the vast majority, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not fully understood, although histopathological findings and biomolecular studies can add relevant data. CONCLUSION: The recognition of cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 is of utmost importance. They may help establishing an early diagnosis, namely in oligosymptomatic patients or when confirmatory tests are impossible to perform. Moreover, chilblain-like lesions and acro-ischemia, also seem to play an important role in terms of prognosis.","output":"[Cutaneous Manifestations Associated with COVID-19: A Narrative Review]./ Manifestaes Cutaneas Associadas  COVID-19: Uma Revis?o Narrativa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aims to compare the anxiety levels of COVID-19 patients, individuals under quarantine, and healthy individuals in society.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used an electronic health record data set aggregated from many national sources in the United States and licensed from Optum with current and historical data on patients tested for COVID-19 in 2020. Three psychiatric cohorts (patients with schizophrenia, mood disorders, or anxiety disorders) were compared with a reference group with no major psychiatric conditions. Statistical analysis was performed from March to April 2021. EXPOSURE: The exposures observed include lab-confirmed positivity for COVID-19 and mortality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The odds of testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020 and the odds of death from COVID-19 were measured. RESULTS: The population studied included 2 535 098 unique persons, 3350 with schizophrenia, 26 610 with mood disorders, and 18 550 with anxiety disorders.

Rate constants and branching ratios for single electron transfer (SET), two H-abstractions (HA), and seven radical adduct formation (RAF) reactions of a?OH with 2AP were evaluated using transition state theory (TST). The RAF at the C8-position of 2AP is noted as the dominant process, which constitutes almost 46.1% of overall reaction routes. The SET mechanism accounts for the second major pathway (39.6%) followed by RAF at the C6-position (14.3%). Formations of 14 transformation products (TPs, i.e., the nonradical end products) in the sonochemical reactions of a?OH with 2AP have been identified by means of the LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS technique. Among the 14 TPs (designated as TP1 to TP14), the lowest and highest mass to charge ratio (m/z) were respectively observed at 129 and 269 in ESI-MS positive ionization mode. The identities of all TPs have been proposed on the basis of elemental composition of [M + H]+ ions and their respective MS-MS fragmentation pattern. Four TPs (including guanine) are considered as obtained directly from primary transients by radical elimination, radical-radical combination/disproportionation reactions. The remaining 10 TPs are postulated as a result of successive self- and/or cross-reactions of primary transients/four first generation TPs with reagents such as a?OH, O2, and solvent H2O molecules.","output":"Insights into the Mechanism of Hydroxyl Radical Mediated Oxidations of 2-Aminopurine: A Computational and Sonochemical Product Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review compares the clinical features, laboratory aspects and treatment options of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). RECENT FINDINGS Bats are the natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses (CoVs) and are likely the reservoir of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although a small number of camels have been found to have positive nasal swabs by real-time polymerase chain reaction and to carry antibody against MERS-CoV, the transmission route and the intermediary animal source remain uncertain amongst the sporadic primary cases. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may cause severe respiratory failure and extrapulmonary features such as diarrhoea, whereas mild or asymptomatic cases also occur in both conditions. In comparison with SARS, patients with MERS are older with male predominance, more comorbid illness and relatively lower human-to-human transmission potential. Although the viral kinetics of MERS-CoV remain unknown, nosocomial infections of MERS occur early within the first week of illness of the index case, whereas those of SARS occurred mainly in the second week of illness when the patient's upper airway viral load peaks on day 10 of illness. In-vitro data suggest that interferon (IFN) with or without ribavirin and mycophenolic acid may inhibit MERS-CoV, whereas protease inhibitors and IFN have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV. SUMMARY Although there are some similarities in the clinical features, MERS progresses to respiratory failure much more rapidly than SARS. The higher case fatality rate of MERS is likely related to older age and comorbid illness.

Treatment has been with glucocorticoids (GCs) alone for many decades but recently Tocilizumab (TCZ) has demonstrated efficacy in reducing GC dose and flare rates in patients with GCA. Therefore, both early diagnosis and regular monitoring are necessary for the correct management of GCA. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to decisions by the governments of the countries involved, aimed above all at reducing the contagion. This has also led to reductions in health activities, limiting them to those of urgency by reducing or canceling checkups involving the risk of a time gap which for the GCA meant the interruption of clinical monitoring and therapeutic adjustment. At the same time, the pandemic situation has stimulated remote monitoring activities, through telephone contacts or video calls carried out by the rheumatologist. EULAR identified a minimal data set aimed at research and for clinical use, which includes the main clinical and instrumental data to be taken into consideration in monitoring the patient. For many data a clinical examination is not necessary but an interview is sufficient. We activated the TELEMACOV protocol (TELEmedicine and Management of the patient affected by giant cell arteritis during the COVid-19 pandemic) monitoring the follow-up of patients affected by GCA through telemedicine tools in order to maintain an effective and risk-free follow-up in a pathology with a high risk of relapse. Objectives: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of telemedicine in the follow-up of the patient with GCA. Methods: We evaluated patients (pts) with a clinical diagnosis of GCA (received in previous periods) who were admitted to the our Rheumatology Unit. They were monitored monthly by telephone from 9 March to 9 June 2020 (during lockdown). All patients were asked questions divided according to the sub-groups listed below: -Onset of new symptoms or their recurrence -Exams carried out -Current therapy -Satisfaction of telephone call Results: We performed 148 remote monitoring visits in 37 pts. The cohort was mainly composed by female (77,8%) and had a mean age of 71,85  9,25 years. They were affected by GCA, with a mean duration of 5,32,3 months. The characteristics of these pts and the course of the disease are reported in Table 1. Pts treated with TCZ reduced their GC dose more than patients treated with GC alone (p: 0.032). Only one patient (treated with GC alone) had an ocular flare with the need to increase the dosage of the GC with good response and rapid improvement. Furthermore, all patients considered this type of monitoring very satisfactory according to the Likert scale (1-5) with mean 4,40,2. Conclusion: Our study has shown how telemedicine can be well used in pts with GCA as a possible alternative, for a limited period, to traditional visits, especially in a fragile population such as the elderly and more exposed to the risk of SARSCOV2 infection.","output":"Telemedicine and management of the patient affected by giant cell arteritis during the COVID-19 pandemic-telemacov"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In late December 2019, Covid-19 emerged as clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause in a province of china, Wuhan. Etiological agent was identified as novel coronavirus that resembles severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and has zoonotic transmission. Covid pneumonia can remain asymptomatic, present as mild infection, severe pneumonia or respiratory failure. Diagnosis is based on rRT-PCR carried out on respiratory secretions. Covid related mortality exceeds 50% once patient requires ICU admission . Objective: To study the characteristics of ICU population admitted to ICU of Shifa International hospital. Results: : we prospectively analysed 74 patients which included 43.3% females and 56.7% males. Commonest symptoms were shortness of breath (94.5%), fever (74.3%) and cough (74.3%). Most of our study population consisted of non-smokers (79.7%) and had hypertension (59.4%) followed by diabetes (47.2%). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin combination is superior to hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline in reducing mortality (p=0.023) whereas Doxycycline alone resulted in increased mortality (p=0.009). Those who did not require antibiotics or required only narrow spectrum antibiotics had increased survival and reduced requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (p=< 0.0001). in our study population, (44.9%) developed acute kidney injury, 2.7% needed re-intubations 10.8% developed surgical emphysema and 2.7 % thromboembolic events despite full anticoagulation. ICU mortality was 41.8% and was higher in females (59.4%, p=0.008), those who had SOFA score > 3.5 at time of admission, raised D-Dimers > 931 ng/ml, NLR > 9.2. It was further high in those who required invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support (58.1% mortality p=< 0.001). ICU stay was more prolonged in those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation as compared to those who did not. (23 days vs 6 days, p=0.001). Mean plateau pressure was 19.6  7.6;mean Driving pressures 14.4  4.6;mean PaO2/FiO2 150.7  73.9;mean SPO2/FiO2 173.9  106.9;mean PEEP was 8.2 4.33. Conclusion: We concluded that severe covid pneumonia is common amongst males, non-smokers those who had comorbid. HCQ and azithromycin combination is superior to combination of HCQ and doxycycline or doxycycline alone and QT prolongation is a rare complication. Baseline NLR, APACHI II, SOFA, SAPS II, NUTRIC scores, D-Dimers, invasive ventilation and vasopressor support are important tools to predict ICU mortality. Invasive mechanical ventilation carries higher mortality and associated with more prolonged ICU stay. AKI is most common complication followed by shock and surgical emphysema.

C. perfringens have been classified in the seven toxinotypes based on the secreted toxins that cause different diseases in humans and animals. Perfringolysin O (PFO), a cholesterol-dependent pore-forming cytolysin, is one of the potent toxins secreted by almost all C. perfringens isolates. The PFO acts in synergy with -toxin in the progression of gas gangrene in humans and necrohemorrhagic enteritis in the calves. C. perfringens infections spread very fast, and the animals die within a few hours of the onset of infection. This necessitates the use of vaccines to control clostridial infections. Though the vaccine potential of other toxins has been reported, PFO has remained unexplored. The present study describes the immunogenic and protective potential of native recombinant PFO (WTrPFO). Since the PFO is toxic to the host cells, the non-toxic C-terminal domain of PFO (rPFOC-ter) was also assessed for its immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Immunization of mice with the purified soluble recombinant histidine-tagged WTrPFO and rPFOC-ter, expressed in E. coli, generated robust mixed immune response and T cell memory. Pre-incubation of the WTrPFO with anti-WTrPFO and rPFOC-ter antisera negated its hemolytic activity in mice RBCs, as well as its cytotoxic effect in mice peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Thus, immunization with the WTrPFO and its non-toxic C-terminal domain generated neutralizing antibodies, suggesting their vaccine potential against the PFO. Thus, the non-toxic C-terminal domain of PFO could serve as an alternative to PFO as a vaccine candidate.

The growth factor of infection and death cases significantly and positively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type A and negatively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type B. Compared with the lower blood type A population (<30%), the higher blood type A population (a30%) showed more infection and death cases, higher growth factors and shorter case doubling times for infections and deaths and thus higher epidemic dynamics.

METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the VCs from 18(th) March 2020 to 1st July 2020 and compared them to F2F clinics in the same period in 2019. Clinical outcomes were compared, and potential financial savings were estimated to see if VCs can be incorporated into future practice. RESULTS: 1317 patients were reviewed in 2020 as compared to 1941 in 2019. We noted similar rates of discharges [25.4% (2020) v/s 24.1% (2019)], follow-ups (48.7% (2020) v/s 48.4% (2019)] and patients who did not attend/answer (6.8% (2020) v/s 6.6% (2019)].

Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in acute respiratory distress syndrome has increased. Occasionally, both are used. We hypothesized that methylprednisolone could improve lung compliance and ease weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients in our veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation unit treated with methylprednisolone over a 20 month period. Methylprednisolone was initiated for inability to wean off veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was calculated at cannulation, methylprednisolone initiation, and decannulation. Demographics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-specific data, and ventilator data were collected. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for differences in dynamic compliance. RESULTS A total of 12 veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients received methylprednisolone. Mean age was 50 (15) years. Seven had influenza. Methylprednisolone was started on median Day 16 (interquartile range: 11-22) of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In total, 10 patients had veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation on median Day 12 (7-22) after methylprednisolone initiation. Two patients died before decannulation. The 10 decannulated patients had initial median dynamic compliance (mL  cm H2O-1) of 12 (7-23), then 16 (10-24) at methylprednisolone initiation, and then 44 (34-60) at decannulation. Dynamic compliance was higher at decannulation than methylprednisolone initiation (p = 0.002), and unchanged from cannulation to methylprednisolone initiation for all patients (p = 0.97). A total of 10 patients had significant infections. None had significant gastrointestinal bleed or wound healing issues. CONCLUSION Methylprednisolone may be associated with improved compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome allowing for decannulation from veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Influenza A (H7N9) virus, a novel reassortant virus to human population, possesses the surface hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from duck and wild-bird influenza viruses and internal genes from poultry H9N2 viruses.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 carries dozens of new mutations in its genome. Herein, we made an effort to find new antiviral peptides (AVPs) against SARS-CoV-2. Gladly, with the help of Machine Learning algorithms, and Supported Vector Machine, we have invented three new AVPs against the SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral peptides viz. , Seq12, Seq12m, and Seq13m can block the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2, necessary for communication with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In addition, these AVPs retain their antiviral properties, even after the insertion of dozens of new mutations (Rosetta, and FoldX based) in the RBD. Further, Seq12, and Seq12m showed negligible cytotoxicity. Besides, the binding free energy calculated using MM-PB/GBSA method is also in agreement with the molecular docking studies performed using HADDOCK. Furthermore, the molecular interactions between AVPs and the viral membrane protein (M) also showed a thermodynamically favorable interaction, suggesting it could eventually inhibit the viral re-packaging process. In conclusion, this study suggests AVPs viz. , Seq12, Seq12m, and Seq13m embrace importance as a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic. These AVPs could also aid virus diagnostic tools in the future.","output":"A novel peptide analogue of spike glycoprotein shows antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2: An in silico approach through molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PB/GBSA calculations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many schools introduced distance learning as a result of the school closings due to the Corona pandemic in March 2020.

We aimed at evaluating fatigue during cycling and immediately after exhaustion in normoxia, moderate and severe hypoxia at relative and absolute intensities. METHODS Thirteen subjects completed three sessions in normoxia, moderate and severe hypoxia with intensity based on percentage of normoxic maximal power output (NOR, MODABS, SEVABS) plus two sessions where intensity was based on the corresponding environmental condition (MODREL, SEVREL). Arterial saturation was clamped at 85% and 70% in moderate and severe hypoxia, respectively. Before, during cycling, and at exhaustion, maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), peripheral fatigue [high-frequency doublet (Db100), twitch (Pt)], and central fatigue [cortical voluntary activation (VATMS)] were evaluated without delay using an innovative ergometer. RESULTS Time to exhaustion declined with hypoxia level at absolute but also relative intensities compared to NOR. At isotime, MVC, Pt and Db100 were similarly depreciated in NOR, MODREL and SEVREL. At exhaustion, there was a similar reduction among conditions in MVC (-26 to -31%), Db100 (-25 to -35%) and VATMS (-9 to -13%). However, Pt was less decreased in SEVREL compared to NOR (-3317 vs. -4616%). CONCLUSION The shorter time to EXH in relative hypoxia, and yet lower peripheral fatigue and similar central fatigue compared to normoxia suggests that hypoxia per se may affect brain areas not directly implicated in quadriceps motor function.","output":"Neuromuscular Fatigue of Cycling Exercise in Hypoxia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: International travel is a major driver of the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2. Aim: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity in the region of a major transport hub in Germany, we characterized the viral sequence diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in Frankfurt am Main, the city with the largest airport in Germany, from the end of October to the end of December 2020. Methods: In total, we recovered 136 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from nasopharyngeal swab samples. We isolated 104 isolates that were grown in cell culture and RNA from the recovered viruses and subjected them to full-genome sequence analysis. In addition, 32 nasopharyngeal swab samples were directly sequenced. Results and conclusion: We found 28 different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating during the study period, including the variant of concern B.1.1.7 (69/70, N501Y). Six of the lineages had not previously been observed in Germany. We detected the spike protein (S) deletion 69/70 in 15% of all sequences, a four base pair (bp) deletion (in 2.9% of sequences) and a single bp deletion (in 0.7% of sequences) in ORF3a, leading to ORF3a truncations. In four sequences (2.9%), an amino acid deletion at position 210 in S was identified. In a single sample (0.7%), both a 9 bp deletion in ORF1ab and a 7 bp deletion in ORF7a were identified. One sequence in lineage B.1.1.70 had an N501Y substitution while lacking the 69/70 in S. The high diversity of sequences observed over two months in Frankfurt am Main highlights the persisting need for continuous SARS-CoV-2 surveillance using full-genome sequencing, particularly in cities with international airport connections.","output":"Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Frankfurt am Main from October to December 2020 Reveals High Viral Diversity Including Spike Mutation N501Y in B.1.1.70 and B.1.1.7"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, a zoonotic bacterial pathogen caused a series of outbreaks with high mortality affecting swine herds in multiple locations of the USA and Canada in 2019. Further genetic analysis revealed that this agent clustered with ATCC 35246, a S. zooepidemicus strain associated with high mortality outbreaks in swine herds of China originally reported in 1977. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is absolutely critical for controlling and limiting further spread of this emerging disease of swine. Currently available diagnostic methods including bacteriological examination and PCR assays do not distinguish between the virulent strains and avirulent commensal strains of S. zooepidemicus, which is critical given that this pathogen is a normal inhabitant of the swine respiratory tract. Based on comparative analyses of whole genome sequences of the virulent isolates and avirulent sequences, we identified a region in the SzM gene that is highly conserved and restricted to virulent S. zooepidemicus strains. We developed and validated a novel probe-based real-time PCR targeting the conserved region of SzM. The assay was highly sensitive and specific to the virulent swine isolates of Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. No cross reactivity was observed with avirulent S. zooepidemicus isolates as well as other streptococcal species and a panel of porcine respiratory bacterial and viral pathogens. The PCR efficiency of the assay was 96.64 % and was able to detect as little as 20 fg of the bacterial DNA. We then validated the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the new PCR assay using a panel of clinical samples (n = 57) and found that the assay has 100% sensitivity and specificity as compared to bacteriological culture method.

OBJECTIVES: The current cross-sectional study characterizes post COVID-19 sequelae and persistent symptoms in patients in an outpatient rehabilitation program. METHODS: Thirty patients [16 post-ICU and 14 non-ICU; median agea=a54(43.8-62) years; 19 men] presenting sequelae and/or persistent symptoms (>3 months after acute COVID-19) were selected of 41 patients referred for neurorehabilitation. Patients underwent physical, neuropsychological and respiratory evaluation and assessment of impact of fatigue and quality of life. RESULTS: The main reasons for referral to rehabilitation were: fatigue (86.6%), dyspnea (66.7%), subjective cognitive impairment (46.7%) and neurological sequelae (33.3%). Post-ICU patient presented sequelae of critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy, stroke and encephalopathy and lower forced vital capacity compared to non-ICU patients. Cognitive impairment was found in 63.3% of patients, with a similar profile in both sub-groups. Increased physical fatigue, anxiety and depression and low quality of life were prevalent irrespective of acute COVID-19 severity.

An integrated, multidisciplinary care setup involving different healthcare professionals is the mainstay in the holistic management of PD. Many challenges in delivering multidisciplinary team (MDT) care exist, such as insufficient expertise among different healthcare professionals, poor interdisciplinary collaboration, and communication. The need to attend different clinics, incurring additional traveling and waiting time for allied health therapies can also make MDT care more burdensome. By shifting MDT care to local community settings and into patients' homes, patient-centered care can be achieved. In Singapore, the National Neuroscience Institute created the Community Care Partners Programme in 2007 to bring the allied MDT team to the community and nurse-led Integrated Community Care Programme for Parkinson's Disease in 2012 to provide care in community and at patient's home. However, attaining MDT care in the community setting is difficult to achieve where there is a shortage of PD-trained professionals. As such, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary management would be other best practice options to deliver patient-centric care in PD.

First, this paper reviews existing responsible investment strategies and products used in practice and highlight their shortcomings in terms of optimising sustainable development outcomes. Second, drawing from the minimal standards theory, this study explores how emerging impact management practices may strengthen impact integrity in investment decision-making and mitigate shortcomings in existing responsible investment approaches to increase their contribution to sustainable development outcomes.FindingsCurrent responsible investment approaches often do not optimise sustainable development outcomes and may facilitate impact washing. The theoretically grounded framework demonstrates standardised impact management practices based on a bounded flexibility approach C adaptable to different contexts within limits and assessed by skilled analysts C along with incorporating shared language and conventions supported by appropriate accountability mechanisms that can be used to mitigate shortcomings in current responsible investment approaches. The authors further propose accountability mechanisms to systematically involve stakeholders (including rightsholders) in decisions that impact them with effective grievance and reparation mechanisms.

Cluster randomised controlled trials in two endemic localities for Ae. aegypti of south Mexico, showed that ITS conferred both, immediate and sustained (~2 yr) impact on indoor-female Ae. aegypti infestations. Such encouraging results require further validation with studies quantifying more epidemiologically-related endpoints, including arbovirus infection in Ae. aegypti. We evaluated the efficacy of protecting houses with ITS on Ae. aegypti infestation and arbovirus infection during a Zika outbreak in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial evaluated the entomological efficacy of ITS compared to the absence of ITS (with both arms able to receive routine arbovirus vector control) in the neighbourhood Juan Pablo II of Merida. Cross-sectional entomological surveys quantified indoor adult mosquito infestation and arbovirus infection at baseline (pre-ITS installation) and throughout two post-intervention (PI) surveys spaced at 6-month intervals corresponding to dry/rainy seasons over one year (2016C2017). Household-surveys assessed the social reception of the intervention. Houses with ITS were 79C85% less infested with Aedes females than control houses up to one-year PI. A similar significant trend was observed for blood-fed Ae. aegypti females (76C82%). Houses with ITS had significantly less infected female Ae. aegypti than controls during the peak of the epidemic (OR = 0.15, 95%CI: 0.08C0.29), an effect that was significant up to a year PI (OR = 0.24, 0.15C0.39). Communities strongly accepted the intervention, due to its perceived mode of action, the prevalent risk for Aedes-borne diseases in the area, and the positive feedback from neighbours receiving ITS.

Pyramid schemes have existed for over a century, but there have been no in-depth studies of their dynamics and communities because of the opacity of participants' transactions. In this paper, we present an empirical study of Forsage, a pyramid scheme implemented as a smart contract and at its peak one of the largest consumers of resources in Ethereum. As a smart contract, Forsage makes its (byte)code and all of its transactions visible on the blockchain. We take advantage of this unprecedented transparency to gain insight into the mechanics, impact on participants, and evolution of Forsage. We quantify the (multi-million-dollar) gains of top-level participants as well as the losses of the vast majority (around 88%) of users. We analyze Forsage code both manually and using a purpose-built transaction simulator to uncover the complex mechanics of the scheme. Through complementary study of promotional videos and social media, we show how Forsage promoters have leveraged the unique features of smart contracts to lure users with false claims of trustworthiness and profitability, and how Forsage activity is concentrated within a small number of national communities.","output":"Forsage: Anatomy of a Smart-Contract Pyramid Scheme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is significantly causing unprecedented clinical, socioeconomic, and public health challenges globally.

Surgical gowns are worn as one of the intraoperative strategies for infection prevention. The present study investigated whether the gowns remained sterile during the surgical procedure. Furthermore, this study examined which parts of the surgical gown were more prone to contamination. Methods The sterility of the gowns was investigated during eight total joint arthroplasties all of which were performed by four surgeons. The samples were taken from the arms and frontal part of the sterile gowns pre- and postoperatively. In the anterior surface of the gown, the sampling was initiated at a strip with 50 cm height from the ground followed by the strips with 15 cm distances from caudal to cephalad. Furthermore, the frontal part of the gown was divided into three parts in relation to the operating room table. Finally, the contamination rate was evaluated in each part. A semiquantitative method was used for the analysis of bacterial culture. Results Before the operation, there were four samples tested positive for bacterial culture (1.06%). All of these samples were taken from the most proximal strip near the neckline. After the surgery, the rate of contamination in the strips on the frontal part of the gown was reported as 3.1% to 53%. Based on the operating table, the contamination rate was 35.9%, 8.9%, and 47.3% in the distal, middle, and proximal parts of the gown, respectively. The contamination rate at the elbow crease was 23%, and at 5 and 10 cm above the creases were 24% and 36%, respectively. Conclusion The high rate of gown contamination during the operation is concerning. However, part of the gown that was in contact with the operating room table remained clean most of the time.

Many studies on teleworking have been carried out with employees who have been teleworking for years. However, it is unclear which consequences a sudden shift to teleworking has. This article examines to what extent the use of teleworking and the possibility of its flexible usage are associated with work-related variables such as job satisfaction, social support, affective commitment and work interruptions. A total of 477 employees of a medium sized public agency took part in the online survey. Our analyses show that more teleworking is associated with fewer work interruptions. We did not find any significant association between the extent of teleworking and job satisfaction, affective commitment and social support. However, there were positive relationships between the perceived flexibility of the place of work with all outcomes with the exception of work interruptions. The findings provide evidence of the importance of the flexible use of teleworking and thus the perceived opportunity to decide for oneself whether to work from home.

LOCAL PROBLEM: The local community was identified as having the highest rate of chlamydia infections in North Carolina. Concerns regarding disease transmission within the community were amplified as the project site began experiencing a critical shortage of chlamydia and gonorrhea testing kits. METHODS: This quality improvement (QI) project, conducted in an emergency department, located in an underserved area with high STD infection rates, offered a prioritized approach to STD testing and treatment during a critical time with limited testing capabilities. INTERVENTIONS: Program analysis evaluated the management of 227 patients preintervention and 218 patients postintervention with confirmed or suspected infection, using a testing and treatment algorithm to identify and treat those most likely to be infected while preserving testing supplies for those at higher risk for complications from infections. RESULTS: Test utilization decreased by 25% (p-value = .003 via t-test), whereas a significant improvement in empiric treatment, increasing from 59% (133/227) to 73% (158/218), was also observed (p-value = .002 via chi-square analysis).

On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%).

The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses.

Knowledge about the enzymes (writers and erasers) that attach and remove post-translational modifications, the targets that are modified and the functional consequences elicited by specific modifications, is crucial for understanding cell biological processes. Moreover detailed knowledge about these mechanisms and pathways helps to elucidate the molecular causes of various diseases and in defining potential targets for therapeutic approaches. Intracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation refers to the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent modification of proteins with ADP-ribose and is catalyzed by enzymes of the ARTD (ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin like, also known as PARP) family as well as some members of the Sirtuin family. Poly-ADP-ribosylation is relatively well understood with inhibitors being used as anti-cancer agents. However, the majority of ARTD enzymes and the ADP-ribosylating Sirtuins are restricted to catalyzing mono-ADP-ribosylation. Although writers, readers and erasers of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosylation have been identified only recently, it is becoming more and more evident that this reversible post-translational modification is capable of modulating key intracellular processes and signaling pathways. These include signal transduction mechanisms, stress pathways associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and stress granules, and chromatin-associated processes such as transcription and DNA repair.

The pooled prevalence of pre-existing PAD in COVID-19 patients was calculated using a random effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the MantelCHaenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Eight investigations, enrolling 13,776 COVID-19 patients (mean age: 67.1 years, 3.863 males), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing PAD was 5.7% of cases (95% CI: 3.8C8.4%, p < 0.0001), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 84.5%), which was directly correlated with age (p < 0.0001), previous hypertension (p = 0.003), and dyslipidaemia (p = 0.02) as demonstrated by the meta-regression.

At 1-2 mg/kg sustained-release buprenorphine, statistically significant analgesic efficacy occurred only at time points up to 2 h. These animals showed no changes in von Frey thresholds on the contralateral side, i.e. no centrally-mediated opioid hyperalgesia. To establish whether acute onset opioid tolerance resulted from a single sustained-release buprenorphine administration, we used the tail flick assay, exposing mice to sustained-release buprenorphine or saline on Day 1 and buprenorphine on Day 2.

Meta-analysis of studies focused on follow-up showed a 2.94% higher risk of incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in entrusted newborns than in separated newborns (95% confidence interval: 0.39-22.25), but this was not significant (p = 0.30). CONCLUSION: A vertical transmission in utero cannot be totally excluded. Since in newborns, the disease is often ambiguous with mild or absent symptoms, it is important to define the most efficient joint management for infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers, being aware that the risk of horizontal transmission from a positive mother, when protective measures are applied, does not seem to increase the risk of infection or to affect the development of newborns from birth to first four weeks of life, and encourages the benefits of breastfeeding and skin-to-skin practice. KEY POINTS:  Entrusting the newborn to the positive mother does not increase the risk of infection..  Our follow-up shows that newborns have good growth and outcome at one month of life..  Applying protective measures we suggest breastfeeding and skin-to-skin practice..","output":"Neonates Born to COVID-19 Mother and Risk in Management within 4 Weeks of Life: A Single-Center Experience, Systematic Review, and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has created tremendous operational difficulties for law enforcement agencies, with substantial portions of their staff quarantined for either exposure or infection With the rollout of a vaccine beginning in early 2021, there is hoped for relief on the horizon However, to date, no study has reported the vaccine's effect on infection rates within the law enforcement workforce We address that gap with a report on a single large agency's experience, using data on officer positivity rates gathered over 341 days During the immunization period, employees accepted vaccination at over 70% uptake Results show the vaccine eliminated new cases of COVID-19 among the agency's nearly 700 employees within weeks As other agencies consider their vaccination programs, they should consider communicating early and often about the impact of the pandemic on operations and the efficacy of vaccination, including the results reported here","output":"COVID-19 vaccine program eliminates law enforcement workforce infections: a Bayesian structural time series analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proactive and coordinated action to mitigate and adapt to climate change will be essential for achieving the healthy, resilient, safe, sustainably harvested and biodiverse ocean that the UN Decade of Ocean Science and sustainable development goals (SDGs) seek. Ocean-based mitigation actions could contribute 12% of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to keep warming to less than 1.5 oC but, because substantial warming is already locked in, extensive adaptation action is also needed. Here, as part of the Future Seas project, we use a foresighting/hindcasting technique to describe two scenarios for 2030 in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation for ocean systems. The business-as-usual future is expected if current trends continue, while an alternative future could be realised if society were to effectively use available data and knowledge to push as far as possible towards achieving the UN SDGs. We identify three drivers that differentiate between these alternative futures: (i) appetite for climate action, (ii) handling extreme events, and (iii) climate interventions. Actions that could navigate towards the optimistic, sustainable and technically achievable future include: (i).. proactive creation and enhancement of economic incentives for mitigation and adaptation; (ii).. supporting the proliferation of local initiatives to spur a global transformation; (iii).. enhancing proactive coastal adaptation management; (iv).. investing in research to support adaptation to emerging risks; (v).. deploying marine-based renewable energy; (vi).. deploying marine-based negative emissions technologies; (vii).. developing and assessing solar radiation management approaches; and (viii).. deploying appropriate solar radiation management approaches to help safeguard critical ecosystems.

Additionally, risk factors of worst severity and fatality were studied. Moreover, factors were compared based on three points: early severity, worst severity and fatality. DESIGN: An observational cohort study using data entered in a Japan nationwide COVID-19 inpatient registry, COVIREGI-JP. SETTING: As of 28 September 2020, 10480 cases from 802 facilities have been registered. Participating facilities cover a wide range of hospitals where patients with COVID-19 are admitted in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Participants who had a positive test result on any applicable SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were admitted to participating healthcare facilities. A total of 3829 cases were identified from 16 January to 31 May 2020, of which 3376 cases were included in this study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was severe or nonsevere on admission, determined by the requirement of mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy, SpO2 or respiratory rate. Secondary outcome was the worst severity during hospitalisation, judged by the requirement of oxygen and/orinvasive mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: Risk factors for severity on admission were older age, men, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, renal disease or dialysis, solid tumour and hyperlipidaemia did not influence severity on admission; however, it influenced worst severity. Fatality rates for obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia were relatively lower. CONCLUSIONS: This study segregated the comorbidities influencing severity and death. It is possible that risk factors for severity on admission, worst severity and fatality are not consistent and may be propelled by different factors. Specifically, while hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and obesity had major effect on worst severity, their impact was mild on fatality in the Japanese population. Some studies contradict our results; therefore, detailed analyses, considering in-hospital treatments, are needed for validation.

Here, we present a case series of professional and semiprofessional ice hockey players to demonstrate the mechanism and nature of laryngeal injuries they sustain during play, and to recommend best practices for treatment, prevention, and return to the ice. Methods A retrospective case review was done of hockey-related laryngeal injuries between 2016 and 2019 at a tertiary laryngology practice. Only semiprofessional and professional hockey players were included. Results In total, four cases were included. All cases involved trauma from a hockey puck to the neck. No cases were the result of punching, fighting, high sticks or routine checking. Notably, 1 of 4 presented with severe airway compromise, requiring urgent intubation, whereas most presented with pain or a significant voice complaint. Two patients required operative intervention with open reduction and internal fixation of significantly displaced fractures. One patient experienced significant mucosal disruption with cartilaginous exposure at the posterior vocal complex requiring microflap. The average return to ice was 6 weeks for those who required operative intervention and 4 weeks for those who were managed conservatively. One patient had persistent mild dysphonia and all others had a return to baseline phonation. None were wearing neck guards or other protective equipment at the time of injury. Conclusion Though voice and airway injuries are rarely sustained by ice hockey players, they may require urgent intervention.

The effective implementation of this online learning method depends on various factors affecting learners' satisfaction. The current study examines the relationship between learners' satisfaction on distance learning and factors (online learning self-efficacy, anxiety, fear of COVID-19) that impact students' remote learning experience among undergraduate engineering students in Jordanian public and private universities. Data was collected via an online survey measuring students' baseline of distance learning satisfaction, online learning self-efficacy, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 which was distributed between June to August 2020. The participants in this study were 505 undergraduate engineering students (353 males, 152 females) who were mostly Jordanian (92.6%) with an average age of 21 (SD = 1.86). There were 298 participants from public universities (59%) and 207 from private universities (41%). Findings reported a significant gap between public and private universities students' distance learning satisfaction, online learning self-efficacy, and anxiety level while the students' scores on fear of COVID-19 was insignificant. Students in private universities were also reported to have higher baseline rates for all the constructs involved in this study. Furthermore, the online learning self-efficacy scores significantly predicted the distance learning satisfaction level among undergraduate engineering students when other constructs were treated as a constant. The findings of this study offer important implications for instructors in considering self-efficacy skills when working with undergraduate students.

Clinicians and public health experts should be aware of emerging infectious causes of encephalitis, mechanisms by which they are transmitted, and clinical manifestations of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of arthropod-borne viral infections -- transmitted chiefly by mosquitoes and ticks -- have emerged in recent years to cause outbreaks of encephalitis. Examples include Powassan virus in North America, Chikungunya virus in Central and South America, and tick-borne encephalitis virus in Europe. Many of these viruses exhibit complex life cycles and can infect multiple host animals in addition to humans. Factors thought to influence emergence of these diseases, including changes in climate and land use, are also believed to underlie the emergence of the rickettsial bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, now recognized as a major causative agent of acute encephalitis syndrome in South Asia. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of bats as carriers of viruses. Recent studies have begun to uncover mechanisms by which the immune systems of bats are poised to allow for viral tolerance. Several bat-borne infections, including Nipah virus and Ebola virus, have resulted in recent outbreaks of encephalitis.

And how has the enforced Working-From-Home mode impacted their ability to continue to deliver software? We hear that some managers are concerned that their engineers are not working effectively from home, or even lack the motivation to work in general, that teams lose touch and that managers do not notice when things go wrong.

SU evolves rapidly under strong selective conditions, resulting in seemingly unrelated SU structures in highly divergent retroviruses. Structural modeling of the SUs of several retroviruses and related endogenous retroviral elements with AlphaFold 2 identifies a TM-proximal SU -sandwich structure that has been conserved in the orthoretroviruses for at least 110 million years. The SU of orthoretroviruses diversified by the differential expansion of the -sandwich core to form domains involved in virus-host interactions. The -sandwich domain is also conserved in the SU equivalent GP1 of Ebola virus although with a significantly different orientation in the trimeric envelope protein structure relative to the -sandwich of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120, with significant evidence for divergent rather than convergent evolution. The unified structural view of orthoretroviral SU and filoviral GP1 identifies an ancient, structurally conserved, and evolvable domain underlying the structural diversity of orthoretroviral SU and filoviral GP1. IMPORTANCE The structural relationships of SUs of retroviral groups are obscured by the high rate of sequence change of SU and the deep-time divergence of retroviral lineages. Previous data showed no structural or functional relationships between the SUs of type C gammaretroviruses and lentiviruses. A deeper understanding of structural relationships between the SUs of different retroviral lineages would allow the generalization of critical processes mediated by these proteins in host cell infection. Modeling of SUs with AlphaFold 2 reveals a conserved core domain underlying the structural diversity of orthoretroviral SUs. Definition of the conserved SU structural core allowed the identification of a homologue structure in the SU equivalent GP1 of filoviruses that most likely shares an origin, unifying the SU of orthoretroviruses and GP1 of filoviruses into a single protein family. These findings will allow an understanding of the structural basis for receptor-mediated membrane fusion mechanisms in a broad range of biomedically important retroviruses.","output":"Deep-Time Structural Evolution of Retroviral and Filoviral Surface Envelope Proteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is estimated that 4-8% of youth in Europe carry out substantial care for a family member or significant other.

Subsequent studies found that only a few passages of WT strain FVV in HeLa cells resulted in an attenuated virus. In the current study, the genome sequence of FVV following five passages in HeLa cells (FVV HeLa p5) was determined through Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) with the aim to investigate the molecular basis of viral attenuation.

Surprisingly, the genetic diversity and Ribavirin resistance of the FVV HeLa p5 virus were not statistically different to WT parent FVV. These findings suggest that while FVV HeLa p5 is attenuated, this is not dependent on a high-fidelity replication complex, characterized by reduced genetic diversity or increased Ribavirin stability, as seen with FNV and 17D vaccines.","output":"Genetic Diversity Does Not Contribute to Attenuation of HeLa Passaged Wild-Type Yellow Fever Virus Strain French Viscerotropic Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is enormous interest in utilizing biologically active fatty acids and monoglycerides to treat phospholipid membrane-related medical diseases, especially with the global health importance of membrane-enveloped viruses and bacteria.

The present study examined the effects of high temperature pulsed heat via an experimental device in a real-world In-Home Use Trial (IHUT) over a sixty-day period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This in-home study recruited 34 subjects with chronic low back pain, provided them with an experimental device that delivered treatment session of high temperature pulsed heat up to 45C, and followed them for eight weeks. Subjects were allowed to use the device as needed. Primary outcome was pain rating as measured by the 11-point Numeric Pain Scale at baseline, four and eight weeks of treatment. The secondary outcome measures were the interference with daily living components of the Brief Pain Inventory at baseline versus eight weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-two subjects completed the study. Pain levels were 5.81 at baseline, 2.79 at four weeks and 2.25 at eight weeks. All changes in pain levels between baseline and four weeks, baseline, and eight weeks and between four and eight weeks were statistically significant (p < 0.05). At eight weeks, the seven components of pain interference with activities of daily living and pain interference with walking were statistically reduced (P < 0.05).

Some 50 years after Brehm introduced the paradigm, Chen and Risen (2010) published an influential critique arguing that what the paradigm measures is not necessarily a choice-induced preference change, but possibly an artifact of the choice revealing existing preferences. They showed that once the artifact is experimentally controlled for, there is either no or very little evidence for choice-induced preference change. Given the prominence of the paradigm, this critique meant that much of what we thought we knew about the psychological process of cognitive dissonance might not be true. Following the critique, research using the paradigm applied various corrections to overcome the artifact. The present research examined whether choice truly changes preferences, or rather merely reflects them. We conducted a meta-analysis on 43 studies (N = 2,191), all using an artifact-free free-choice paradigm.

One such target is the inhibition of the checkpoint protein programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand (PD-L1) by monoclonal antibodies. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. SEARCH METHODS We performed a Cochrane Rapid Review, limiting our search to published studies in the English language. We searched databases of the medical literature, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE, as well as trial registries including ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). Our search extended from January 2000 to June 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials except cross-over trials and cluster randomised trials. We excluded all other study designs. Participants included had locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, with disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy (synonymous with second-/third-/fourth-line therapy). This review focused on pembrolizumab (synonyms: MK-3475, lambrolizumab, Keytruda). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included study. The certainty of evidence was rated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. MAIN RESULTS We identified one randomised controlled trial that included 542 participants, which compared the use of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Results were reported after a median follow-up of 14.1 months (range 9.9 to 22.1 months).Primary outcomesPembrolizumab probably reduces the risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio (HR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.90; moderate certainty evidence). This corresponds to 115 fewer deaths (191 fewer to 38 fewer) per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab at 12 months. We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for imprecision.Pembrolizumab may slightly improve quality of life (change from baseline to week 15 assessed with the Core Quality of Life Questionnaire; higher value reflects better quality of life; scale 0 to 100) with a mean difference (MD) of 9.05, 95% CI 4.61 to 13.50; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision.Secondary outcomesPembrolizumab may have little or no effect on disease progression (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to three fewer patients (42 fewer to 24 more) whose disease progressed per 1000 participants at 12 months. We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision.Pembrolizumab probably improves treatment response (based on complete or partial radiologic response) with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.85, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.77; moderate certainty evidence). This corresponds to 97 more respondents (27 more to 202 more) per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab. We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for imprecision.Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on treatment-related mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.79; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to one fewer (12 fewer to 44 more) treatment-related deaths per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab. We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision.Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on discontinuations due to adverse events (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.10). This corresponds to 54 fewer discontinuations per 1000 participants (95% CI 79 fewer to 7 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision.Pembrolizumab may reduce serious adverse events (RR 0.83, 95 CI 0.72 to 0.97; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to 107 fewer serious averse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 19 fewer to 176 fewer). We downgraded two levels for study limitations and imprecision. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The use of pembrolizumab in men with advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy probably improves overall survival when compared with chemotherapy alone. At 12 months follow-up about 70% of those in the chemotherapy group had died, compared with 59% of those treated with pembrolizumab. We are very uncertain about the effects of pembolizumab on quality of life. Pembolizumab may also improve treatment response rates, and reduce the risk of serious adverse events, but may make little or no difference to discontinuations of treatment due to adverse events. These conclusions are based on a single trial that was sponsored by the producer of pembrolizumab.","output":"Pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy.

In this setting different job resources are offered for its employees, including social support or flexibility in terms of working hours, tasks or pace of work. However, to date, only limited evidence exists on the work and health situation of supervisors in social firms. Therefore, the study aims to explore job demands and resources of supervisors in social firms to increase knowledge in a little researched field and to develop recommendations for action on workplace health promotion. METHODS: Sixteen semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with supervisors of social firms in the North of Germany within July and November 2020. Different sectors such as gastronomy or cleaning services as well as employment opportunities for people with different types of disabilities were included. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed following the qualitative content analysis according to Mayring (deductive-inductive approach). RESULTS: Overall, a heterogeneous composition was aimed for in terms of age and gender distribution (68.75% were male and between 32 and 60 years old). Supervisors reported various job demands in social firms, including for instance emotional demands, conflicts between social and economic objectives, conflict management, exposure to heat, heavy lifting or constant standing. In contrast, a high meaning of work, possibilities in shaping the structure of the social firm, social support of colleagues or the management and the provision of an ergonomic work environment were highlighted as job resources. Further person-related demands (e.g. own expectations) and resources (e.g. patience) were underlined as well. CONCLUSION: First exploratory insights were provided with reference to job demands and resources for supervisors in social firms.

The Canary Islands have the highest incidence of type 1 DM (T1DM) reported in Spain (30-35/100,000 children under 14 years/year). In 2020-2021 we observed the highest incidence so far on the island of Gran Canaria, as a result of which we decided to evaluate the possible role of COVID-19 in the increased number of onsets. METHODS: We examined the presence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in children with new onset T1DM between October 2020 and August 2021. We compared recent T1DM incidence with that of the previous 10 years. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were diagnosed with T1DM (48.1/100,000 patients/year), representing a nonsignificant 25.7% increase from the expected incidence. Of the 33 patients who consented to the study, 32 presented negative IgG values, with only one patient reflecting undiagnosed past infection. Forty-four percent of patients presented with ketoacidosis at onset, which was similar to previous years. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is no direct relationship between the increased incidence of T1DM and SARS-CoV-2 in the region.

A one-step RT-ddPCR multiplex assay was developed for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 E, RdRp and N viral RNA, and human Rpp30 DNA and GUSB mRNA, for internal nucleic acid (NA) extraction and RT-PCR control. Dilution series of viral RNA transcripts were prepared in water and total NA extract of Covid-19-negative patients. As reference assay, an E-GUSB duplex RT-PCR was used. GUSB mRNA detection was used to set validity criteria to assure viral RNA and RT-PCR assay quality and to enable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In a background of at least 100 GUSB mRNA copies, 5 copies of viral RNA are reliably detectable and 10 copies viral RNA copies are reliably quantifiable. It was found that assay sensitivity of the RT-ddPCR was not affected by the total NA background while assay sensitivity of the gold standard RT-PCR assay is drastically decreased when SARS-CoV-2 copies were detected in a background of total NA extract compared with water. The present study describes a robust and sensitive one-step ddRT-PCR multiplex assay for reliable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily attacks pulmonary tissues and impairs gas exchange leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic hypoxia. The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 largely rely on supportive and anti-thrombi treatment and the repurposing of antimalarial and antiviral drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. For a better mechanistic understanding of COVID-19, our present review focuses on its primary pathophysiologic features: hypoxia and cytokine storm, which are a prelude to multiple organ failure and lethality. We discussed a possible link between the activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, since HIF-1 is shown to suppress the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and upregulate disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17). In addition, the protein targets of HIF-1 are involved with the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and the subsequent inflammatory process. Furthermore, we hypothesized a potential utility of so-called hypoxic conditioning to activate HIF-1-induced cytoprotective signaling for reduction of illness severity and improvement of vital organ function in patients with COVID-19. Taken together, we would propose further investigations into the hypoxia-related molecular mechanisms, from which novel targeted therapies can be developed for the improved management of COVID-19.","output":"Hypoxia, HIF-1, and COVID-19: from pathogenic factors to potential therapeutic targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased plastic uses during COVID-19 pandemic challenges efforts to reduce marine plastic debris.

The disappearance of these structures observed under scanning electron microscopy or in cryofracture preparations in vivo and in vitro cannot be reversed by the action of cytochalasin B on the microfilament network.

However, the proportion of people who participate in the recommended amount of physical activity is low, with common barriers including competing interests and inclement weather. In people with chronic cardiorespiratory conditions, participation in physical activity is reduced further by disease-specific barriers; time-burden of treatment and unpleasant symptoms during physical activity. Addressing these barriers during adolescence and early adulthood may promote greater physical activity participation into older age. The aim of this review was, in people aged 15 to 45 years with chronic cardiorespiratory conditions, to classify interventions aimed at optimising participation in physical activity as 'promising' or 'not promising', and categorise the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) within these interventions. Nine databases and registries were searched (October 2017) for studies that reported objective measures of physical activity before and after an intervention period. Interventions were classified as 'promising' if a between-group difference in physical activity was demonstrated. Michie et al.'s (2013) v1 Taxonomy was used to unpack the BCTs within interventions. Across the six included studies (n = 396 participants), 19 (20%) of 93 BCTs were described. The interventions of three studies were classified as 'promising'. The most commonly used BCTs comprised goal setting, action planning and social support. Five BCTs were solely used in 'promising' interventions.

During COVID-19, most workers were affected and many liberal welfare states introduced new temporary wage subsidies to protected workers' earnings and employment (OECD, 2021). New wage subsidies marked a departure from the structure of traditional income support payments and required reform. This paper uses simulated datasets to assess the structure and incentives of the Irish COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme (CWS) under five designs. We use a nowcasting approach to update 2017 microdata, producing a near real time picture of the labour market at the peak of the crisis. Using microsimulation modelling, we assess the impact of different designs on income replacement, work incentives and income inequality. Our findings suggest that pro rata designs support middle earners more and flat rate designs support low earners more. We find evidence for strong work disincentives under all designs, though flat rate designs perform better. Disincentives are primarily driven by generous unemployment payments and work related costs. The impact of design on income inequality depends on the generosity of payments. Earnings related pro rata designs were associated to higher market earnings inequality. The difference in inequality levels falls once benefits, taxes and work related costs are considered. In our discussion, we turn to transaction costs, the rationale for reform and reintegration of CWS. We find some support for the claim that design changes were motivated by political considerations. We suggest that establishing permanent wage subsidies based on sectorial turnover rules could offer enhanced protection to middle-and high-earners and reduce uncertainty, the need for reform, and the risk of politically motivated designs.","output":"The Structure and Incentives of a COVID related Emergency Wage Subsidy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Lockdown is an effective nonpharmaceutical intervention to reduce coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission, but it restricts daily activity.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Delhi, Kanpur, Kolkata and Bangalore from July to September 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected in Hindi using a structured questionnaire via telephonic interviews. Minimum 200 drivers were included from each location. OUTCOME MEASURES: Sociodemographic profile, awareness regarding COVID-19, knowledge regarding infection sources, disease spread and vulnerable populations, prevention practices followed and challenges faced. Information sources were also assessed. RESULTS: Fishers exact test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test were used to check for significant differences across proportions. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Overall, 1246 drivers were included, with 72% response rate. Of 1246 drivers, 65% were 30C50 years of age. A majority correctly answered knowledge questions regarding communicability (95%) and fatality (66%). Fifty per cent drivers were aware of treatability of the disease, while only 43% and 24% correctly reported all signs and symptoms and routes of transmission, respectively. No driver was aware of all high-risk populations. Overall Knowledge Score is significantly associated with region. Mobile phones were the primary source of information across all regions. Over two-third drivers follow all prevention practices regularly, which differed significantly across regions. Following standard prevention practices was positively correlated with higher knowledge scores and was significantly correlated with mask use. Worry about the disease was common. Less than 40% drivers received full payment for work during this period, while 25% drivers were unable to return home due to the pandemic.

We sought to explore the effects of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on disparities in cervical cancer incidence between high- and low-poverty U.S. counties. METHODS We calibrated a dynamic simulation model of HPV infection to reflect average counties in the highest and lowest quartile of poverty (percent of population below federal poverty level), incorporating data on HPV prevalence, cervical cancer screening, and HPV vaccination. We projected cervical cancer incidence through 2070, estimated absolute and relative disparities in incident cervical cancer for high- versus low-poverty counties, and compared incidence with the near-elimination target (4 cases/100,000 women annually). RESULTS We estimated that, on average, low-poverty counties will achieve near-elimination targets 14 years earlier than high-poverty counties (2029 vs. 2043). Absolute disparities by county poverty will decrease, but relative differences are estimated to increase. We estimate 21,604 cumulative excess cervical cancer cases in high-poverty counties over the next 50 years. Increasing HPV vaccine coverage nationally to the Healthy People 2020 goal (80%) would reduce excess cancer cases, but not alter estimated time to reach the near-elimination threshold. CONCLUSIONS High-poverty U.S. counties will likely be delayed in achieving near-elimination targets for cervical cancer and as a result will experience thousands of potentially preventable cancers.

This study aimed to assess the level of fear of death and associated factors in medical students at a Peruvian university. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted during March 2021 in human medicine students from the first to the seventh year. A validated survey including the ColletCLester fear-of-death scale was applied. Factors associated with the fear-of-death score were evaluated by calculating linear regression coefficients (). A total of 284 students were included. The median age was 22 years, and 58.1% were female. The mean ColletCLester scale score was 2.79, and it was higher in the dimensions related to the death of others. Adjusted analysis showed that the score on this scale was lower in students aged 24C40 years compared to 17C21 years (: ?0.25; 95% CI: ?0.46 to ?0.04) and those who had no religious beliefs (: ?0.29; 95% CI: ?0.53 to ?0.04).

Activities of sandblasting and painting with metal-based paints occurred for decades at this urban brownfield, polluting the soil with metal(loid)s and organic contaminants, e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in addition to past backfilling. Total topsoil metal(loid)s (e.g., 54,700 mg Zn and 5060 mg Cu kg(?1)) exceeded by seven- to tenfold the background values for French sandy soils, but the soil pH was 7.9, and overall, the 1M NH(4)NO(3) extractable soil fractions of metals were relatively low. Leaf area, water content of shoots, and total chlorophyll (Chl) progressively decreased with the soil contamination, but the Chl fluorescence remained constant near its optimum value. Foliar Cu and Zn concentrations varied from 17.8  4.2 (0%) to 27  5 mg Cu kg(?1) (100%) and from 60  15 (0%) to 454  53 mg Zn kg(?1) (100%), respectively. Foliar Cd concentration peaked up to 1.74  0.09 mg Cd kg(?1), and its bioconcentration factor had the highest value (0.2) among those of the metal(loid)s. Few nutrient concentrations in the aboveground plant parts decreased with the soil contamination, e.g., foliar P concentration from 5972  1026 (0%) to 2861  334 mg kg(?1) (100%). Vulnerability to drought-induced embolism (P50) did not differ for the tobacco stems across the soil series, whereas their hydraulic efficiency (Ks) declined significantly with increasing soil contamination. Overall, this tobacco cultivar grew relatively well even in the Borifer soil (100%), keeping its photosynthetic system healthy under stress, and contaminant exposure did not increase the vulnerability of the vascular system to drought. This tobacco had a relevant potential to annually phytoextract a part of the bioavailable soil Zn and Cd, i.e., shoot removals representing here 8.8% for Zn and 43.3% for Cd of their 1M NH(4)NO(3) extractable amount in the potted Borifer soil.

Methods We retrospectively retrieved data for 152 severe inpatients with COVID-19 including 60 young patients in the Eastern Campus of Wuhan University affiliated Renmin Hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 31, 2020 to February 20, 2020. We recorded and analyzed patients' demographic, clinical, laboratory, and chest CT findings, treatment and outcomes data. Results Of those 60 severe young patients, 15 (25%) were died. Male was more predominant in deceased young patients (12, 80%) than that in recovered young patients (22, 49%). Hypertension was more common among deceased young patients (8, 53%) than that in recovered young patients (7, 16%). Compared with the recovered young patients, more deceased young patients presented with sputum (11, 73%), dyspnea (12, 80%) and fatigue (13, 87%). Only sputum, PSI and neutrophil counts were remained as independent predictors of death in a multivariate logistic regression model. Among ARDS patients, the recovered were administrated with corticosteroid earlier and anticoagulation. The addition of neutrophil counts >6.3109/L to the SMART-COP score resulted in improved area under the curves. Conclusions Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection in young deceased patients appears to cause exuberant inflammatory responses, leading to compromised oxygen exchange, coagulation and multi-organ dysfunction. In addition, young patients with ARDS could benefit from adjuvant early corticosteroid and anticoagulation therapy.

Because of the need to administer a timely second dose in subjects who reported a reaction to their first dose, a panel of health-care professionals developed a safe triage of the employees and health care providers (EHCP) at a large health-care system to consider administration of future dosing. Methods: There were 28,544 EHCPs who received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccines between December 15, 2020, and March 8, 2021. The EHCPs self-reported adverse reactions to a centralized COVID-19 command center (CCC). The CCC screened and collected information on the quality of reaction, symptoms, and timing of the onset of the reaction. Results: Of 1253 calls to the CCC, 113 were identified as requiring consideration by a panel of three (American Board of Allergy and Immunology) ABAI-certified allergists for future dosing or formal in-person assessment. Of the 113 EHCPs, 94 (83.2%) were recommended to get their second dose. Eighty of 94 received their second planned dose without a severe or immediate reaction. Of the 14 of 113 identified as needing further evaluation, 6 were evaluated by a physician and subsequently received their second dose without a serious adverse reaction. Eight of 14 did not receive their second dose. Only 5 of the 113 EHCPs reported reactions (4.4%) were recommended to not take the second dose: 3 (2.6%) because of symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis, and 2 because of neurologic complications (seizure, stroke).

Commonly used phylogenetic trees based on alignments can be used to visualize only a limited number of protein sequences. DGraph, introduced here, is an application developed to generate 2-dimensional (2D) maps based on similarity scores for sequences. The program automatically calculates and graphically displays property distance (PD) scores based on physico-chemical property (PCP) similarities from an unaligned list of FASTA files. Such PD-graphs show the interrelatedness of the sequences, whereby clusters can reveal deeper connectivities. RESULTS: Property distance graphs generated for flavivirus (FV), enterovirus (EV), and coronavirus (CoV) sequences from complete polyproteins or individual proteins are consistent with biological data on vector types, hosts, cellular receptors, and disease phenotypes. Property distance graphs separate the tick- from the mosquito-borne FV, cluster viruses that infect bats, camels, seabirds, and humans separately. The clusters correlate with disease phenotype. The PD method segregates the -CoV spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) sequences from other human pathogenic CoV, with clustering consistent with cellular receptor usage. The graphs also suggest evolutionary relationships that may be difficult to determine with conventional bootstrapping methods that require postulating an ancestral sequence.","output":"DGraph Clusters Flaviviruses and -Coronaviruses According to Their Hosts, Disease Type, and Human Cell Receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relationship between chronic medical conditions and PTSD within-race in Black adults is not well understood and there exists a dearth of empirical research investigating the gender differences.

This study aimed to determine the epidemiological, demographic and clinical characteristics that distinguished cases of MERS contracted during outbreaks from those contracted sporadically (ie, non-outbreak) between 2012 and 2015 in Saudi Arabia. DESIGN: Data from the Saudi Ministry of Health of confirmed outbreak and non-outbreak cases of MERS coronavirus (CoV) infections from September 2012 through October 2015 were abstracted and analysed. Univariate and descriptive statistical analyses were conducted, and the time between disease onset and confirmation, onset and notification and onset and death were examined. RESULTS: A total of 1250 patients (aged 0C109 years; mean, 50.825 years) were reported infected with MERS-CoV. Approximately two-thirds of all MERS cases were diagnosed in men for outbreak and non-outbreak cases. Healthcare workers comprised 22% of all MERS cases for outbreak and non-outbreak cases. Nosocomial infections comprised one-third of all Saudi MERS cases; however, nosocomial infections occurred more frequently in outbreak than non-outbreak cases (p<0.001). Patients contracting MERS during an outbreak were significantly more likely to die of MERS (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: To date, nosocomial infections have fuelled MERS outbreaks.

Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated chest radiographs and chest CT studies for thoracic abnormalities. The findings from chest radiography and chest CT were compared to evaluate the added diagnostic value of chest CT for affecting patient management. Interobserver agreement was measured with Cohen's  statistics. RESULTS: Eleven (19.6%) of 56 patients had abnormal chest radiographic findings, including ground\\\\glass opacity (GGO) in 5/11 (45.4%) and combined GGO and consolidation in 6/11 (54.5%). On chest CT, 26 (46.4%) of 56 patients had abnormal CT findings, including combined GGO and consolidation in 19/26 (73.1%), GGO in 6/26 (23.1%), and consolidation in 1/26 (3.8%). Chest CT detected all thoracic abnormalities seen on chest radiography in 11/26 (42.3%) cases. In 15/26 (57.7%), chest CT detected lung abnormalities that were not observed on chest radiography, which included GGO and consolidation in 9/15 (60%), GGO in 5/15 (33.3%), and consolidation in 1/15 (6.6%) cases.

Courses employing multiple educational methods have been shown to be effective in easing learners into new clinical roles during transition periods but, to date, there is limited evidence for courses to support trainees returning to practice (RTP). METHODS A 2-day course, named Springboard, was developed, specifically to address the needs of trainee physicians RTP. It employed a blended, multi-modal approach to learning, including lectures, workshops, case-based sessions, interactive panel discussions, small group teaching, peer-led practical advice sessions and simulation training. Springboard was delivered eight times between 2014 and 2019 with a total of 540 doctors attending. We analysed participant pre-and post-course questionnaire feedback. RESULTS Reasons for doctors taking time out of training included parental leave, research, fellowships in education and leadership, health-related absence and career breaks. Time out of training ranged between 3 months and 6 years. A significant pre/post-course increase in candidates' self-reported leadership skills and confidence in being prepared to return to practice was demonstrated alongside an appreciation of a multi-modal, 'boot camp' course delivered by expert faculty and a networking experience.

It is essential to assess the psychological distress experienced by healthcare trainees during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study with 4184 healthcare trainees at Sichuan University in China was implemented during 7-13 February 2020. Participants were grouped by training programmes (medicine, medical technology and nursing) and training stages (undergraduate, postgraduate and residency). MAIN OUTCOMES: COVID-19-related psychological distress and acute stress reaction (ASR) were assessed using the Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. We estimated the ORs of distress by comparing trainees across programmes and training stages using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Significant psychological distress was found in 1150 (30.90%) participants and probable ASR in 403 (10.74%). Compared with the nursing trainees, the medical trainees (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.95) reported a higher burden of psychological distress during the outbreak, while the medical technology trainees (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.62) reported similar symptom scores. Postgraduates (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.08) in medicine had higher levels of distress than their undergraduate counterparts did, whereas the nursing residents (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.71) reported a lower burden than did nursing undergraduates. A positive association was found between having active clinical duties during the outbreak and distress (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.39), particularly among the medical trainees (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.33) and undergraduates (OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.61 to 11.70).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study of aggregated third-party, anonymized ED patient data. This data included 501,369 patient visits from twelve EDs in Massachusetts from 1/1/2019-9/9/2019, and 1/1/2020-9/8/2020. We analyzed the total arrivals and hospital admissions and calculated confidence intervals for the change in admissions for each characteristic. We then developed a Poisson regression model to estimate the relative contribution of each characteristic to the decrease in admissions after the statewide lockdown, corresponding to weeks 11 through 36 (3/11/2020-9/8/2020). RESULTS: We observed a 32% decrease in admissions during weeks 11 to 36 in 2020, with significant decreases in admissions for chronic respiratory conditions and non-orthopedic needs.

Its use rapidly expanded thereafter to include human medical treatments for a variety of acute and chronic disorders. Due to reports of severe adverse effects, the US Food and Drug Administration withdrew levamisole's approval for human use in 2000; however, medical options outside the US and illicit options worldwide allow continued accessibility to levamisole. The compound is rapidly metabolized in the body, with at least two known active metabolites. Levamisole has a broad range of immunomodulatory effects, including both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on immune responses. It is generally well tolerated at therapeutic concentrations, although a variety of autoimmune-related adverse effects have been reported, including agranulocytosis, leukopenia, purpura, and visible necrotized skin tissue. Individuals with levamisole-compromised immune systems are more susceptible to infections, including COVID-19. Since the early 2000's, levamisole has been frequently used as an adulterating agent in illicit street drugs, especially cocaine, fentanyl, and heroin. Although its prevalence has varied over time and geographically, levamisole has been detected in up to 79% of the street supply of cocaine at levels up to 74% by weight. Its presence in illicit drug markets also raises concern over the potential for exposure of children and neonates, although this is supported by only limited anecdotal evidence. Levamisole is not currently included in routine drug testing panels, although a variety of confirmatory testing techniques exist across a range of antemortem and postmortem specimen options. Because of its varying presence in illicit drug markets, both the medical and forensic communities need to be aware of levamisole and its potential impact on toxicological investigations.","output":"Levamisole - A Toxic Adulterant in Illicit Drug Preparations: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the era of artificial intelligence, the healthcare industry is undergoing tremendous innovation and development based on sophisticated AI algorithms. Focusing on diagnosis process and target disease, this study theoretically proposed an integrated model to optimize traditional medical expense system, and ultimately helps medical staff and patients make more reliable decisions. From the new perspective of total expense estimation and detailed expense analysis, the proposed model innovatively consists of two intelligent modules, with theoretical contribution. The two modules are SVM-based module and SOM-based module. According to the rigorous comparative analysis with two classic AI techniques, back propagation neural networks and random forests, it is demonstrated that the SVM-based module achieved better capability of total expense estimation. Meanwhile, by designing a two-stage clustering process, SOM-based module effectively generated decision clusters and corresponding cluster centers were obtained, that clarified the complex relationship between detailed expense and patient information. To achieve practical contribution, the proposed model was applied to the diagnosis process of coronary heart disease. The real data from a hospital in Shanghai was collected, and the validity and accuracy of the proposed model were verified with rigorous experiments. The proposed model innovatively optimized traditional medical expense system, and intelligently generated reliable decision-making information for both total expense and detailed expense. The successful application on the target disease further indicates that this model is a user-friendly tool for medical expense control and therapeutic regimen strategy.","output":"An integrated model for medical expense system optimization during diagnosis process based on artificial intelligence algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To analyse the measures adopted by countries that have shown control over the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and how each curve of accumulated cases behaved after the implementation of those measures. METHODS The methodology adopted for this study comprises three phases: systemizing control measures adopted by different countries, identifying structural breaks in the growth of the number of cases for those countries, and analyzing Brazilian data in particular. RESULTS We noted that China (excluding Hubei Province), Hubei Province, and South Korea have been effective in their deceleration of the growth rates of COVID-19 cases. The effectiveness of the measures taken by these countries could be seen after 1 to 2 weeks of their application. In Italy and Spain, control measures at the national level were taken at a late stage of the epidemic, which could have contributed to the high propagation of COVID-19. In Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and S?o Paulo adopted measures that could be effective in slowing the propagation of the virus. However, we only expect to see their effects on the growth of the curve in the coming days. CONCLUSION Our results may help decisionmakers in countries in relatively early stages of the epidemic, especially Brazil, understand the importance of control measures in decelerating the growth curve of confirmed cases.","output":"Progression of confirmed COVID-19 cases after the implementation of control measures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Future nursing education needs to build a cutting-edge technology-based educational environment to provide a variety of consumer-oriented education. Thus, the sharing of information in nursing education needs to be considered, especially given the advancement of internet of things (IoT) technology. Before developing a horizontal platform, understanding previously developed IoT platforms is necessary to establish services and devices compatible with each other in different service areas. This scoping review aims to explore the technology used in the IoT platform for the education of nursing students in the undergraduate nursing curriculum. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A preliminary search was completed to find initial search terms, on which a full-search strategy was developed. Search results yielded from PubMed (NCBI) were screened to ensure articles were peer-reviewed, published in English from January 1999 to August 2021, and relevant to developing, applying and evaluating IoT platforms at educational institutions for students in undergraduate nursing programmes.

Variants of concern have supplanted wild-type virus. In transplant recipients, data are limited on 2-dose or 3-dose vaccine immunogenicity against variant viruses. OBJECTIVE: To assess neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants in transplant recipients after 2 and 3 vaccine doses. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of a third dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine versus placebo. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04885907) SETTING: Single-center transplant program. PATIENTS: Organ transplant recipients. INTERVENTION: Third dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine versus placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Sera were analyzed for neutralization against wild-type virus and the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants using a surrogate virus neutralization assay and a spike-pseudotyped lentivirus assay. RESULTS: A total of 117 transplant recipients were analyzed (60 in the mRNA-1273 group and 57 in the placebo group). Sera were obtained before and 4 to 6 weeks after the third dose. After 2 doses, the proportion of patients with positive neutralization for all 3 variants was small compared with wild-type virus. After the third dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine, the proportion with a positive neutralization response versus placebo was improved for all 3 variants as measured by both assays. Based on the pseudovirus neutralization assay against the Delta variant, 33 of 60 (55%) patients were positive in the mRNA-1273 group versus 10 of 57 (18%) in the placebo group (difference, 37 [95% CI, 19 to 53] percentage points). The differences were 36 (CI, 17 to 51) percentage points for the Alpha variant and 31 (CI, 15 to 46) percentage points for the Beta variant. In the mRNA-1273 group, lower neutralization values were observed for variants compared with wild-type virus, especially the Beta variant. LIMITATIONS: There is no clear correlate of protection for neutralizing antibody. This was a secondary analysis. CONCLUSION: In organ transplant recipients, a third dose of mRNA vaccine increases neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 variants compared with placebo.

Methods:During the SARS outbreak, a dedicated paramedic surveillance and quarantine program was developed. The authors determined the number of paramedics on quarantine each day, the type of quarantine (either home quarantine [HQ] or work quarantine [WQ]), and the development of SARS\\\\like symptoms. Results: During the SARS outbreak, there were five cases of probable SARS and three cases of suspect SARS. SARS\\\\1 lasted 30 days, during which 234 paramedics were placed on HQ. The total number of HQ days was 1,615. During the five peak days of SARS\\\\1, the total number of HQ days was 664. SARS\\\\2 lasted 18 days, during which 292 paramedics were placed on either HQ or WQ, for a combined number of quarantine days of 1,637. During the five peak days of SARS\\\\2, the combined number of quarantine days was 910. Of these, paramedics were available for duty on 708 days (78%) due to the WQ program. The primary reason for quarantine was unprotected exposure to a health care institution experiencing a SARS outbreak. Under quarantine, SARS\\\\like symptoms developed in 68 paramedics, including cough (53 [78%]), myalgia (33 [48%]), fatigue (30 [44%]), headache (29 [43%]), fever (11 [16%]), and shortness of breath (7 [10%]). Conclusions: Paramedics were among the health care workers who developed SARS. During SARS\\\\2, WQ optimized the number of days on which paramedics were available for duty. Many paramedics developed SARS\\\\like symptoms without being diagnosed as having SARS. A dedicated paramedic surveillance and quarantine program provided a useful means to manage the paramedic resource during the SARS outbreak.","output":"Loss of Paramedic Availability in an Urban Emergency Medical Services System during a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most serious transboundary, contagious viral diseases of cloven-hoofed livestock, because it can spread rapidly with high morbidity rates when introduced into disease-free herds or areas.

Spatial analysis, a study of the distributions of events in space, can be applied to an area to investigate the spread of animal disease. Hypothetical FMD outbreaks can be spatially analyzed to evaluate the effect of the event under different control strategies. The main objective of this paper is to review FMD-related articles on FMD epidemiology, epidemiological simulation modeling and spatial analysis with the focus on disease control.

This study evaluated if axillary ultrasound (US) coupled with fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) can accurately predict clinically relevant node metastasis in patients with breast cancer, and thus assist clinical decisions METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with retrospective data collection of 241 individuals (239 women and 2 men) with unilateral operable breast cancer who were submitted to preoperative axillary assessment by physical exam, US and FNAC if suspicious nodes by imaging. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the methods. We compared the patient's characteristics using chi-square test, parametrics and non-parametrics statistics according to the variable. RESULTS The most sensible method was US (0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.69), and the most specific was US coupled with FNAC (0.97; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99). Only 2.7% of the patients with normal axillary US had more than 2 metastatic nodes in the axillary lymph node dissection, against 50% of the patients with suspicious lymph nodes in the US and positive FNAC. CONCLUSIONS Axillary US coupled with FNAC can sort patients who have a few metastatic nodes at most from those with heavy axillary burden and could be one more tool to initially evaluate patients and define treatment strategies.","output":"Axillary ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytology to predict clinically relevant nodal burden in breast cancer patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to urgent needs for reliable diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current guideline is using RT-PCR for testing. As a complimentary tool with diagnostic imaging, chest Computed Tomography (CT) has been shown to be able to reveal visual patterns characteristic for COVID-19, which has definite value at several stages during the disease course. To facilitate CT analysis, recent efforts have focused on computer-aided characterization and diagnosis with chest CT scan, which has shown promising results. However, domain shift of data across clinical data centers poses a serious challenge when deploying learning-based models. A common way to alleviate this issue is to fine-tune the model locally with the target domains local data and annotations. Unfortunately, the availability and quality of local annotations usually varies due to heterogeneity in equipment and distribution of medical resources across the globe. This impact may be pronounced in the detection of COVID-19, since the relevant patterns vary in size, shape, and texture. In this work, we attempt to find a solution for this challenge via federated and semi-supervised learning. A multi-national database consisting of 1704 scans from three countries is adopted to study the performance gap, when training a model with one dataset and applying it to another. Expert radiologists manually delineated 945 scans for COVID-19 findings. In handling the variability in both the data and annotations, a novel federated semi-supervised learning technique is proposed to fully utilize all available data (with or without annotations). Federated learning avoids the need for sensitive data-sharing, which makes it favorable for institutions and nations with strict regulatory policy on data privacy. Moreover, semi-supervision potentially reduces the annotation burden under a distributed setting. The proposed framework is shown to be effective compared to fully supervised scenarios with conventional data sharing instead of model weight sharing.","output":"Federated semi-supervised learning for COVID region segmentation in chest CT using multi-national data from China, Italy, Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Point of care ultrasound is important to the specialty of physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of neuromusculoskeletal conditions commonly seen in practice.
