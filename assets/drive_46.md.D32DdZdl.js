Additionally, a large proportion of patients with asthma suffer from obesity. These patients exhibit poor asthma control and reduced therapy response, increasing utilization of healthcare resources. Pulmonary symptoms improve after bariatric surgery (BS), and we hypothesized that asthma medication usage would decrease following BS. METHODS A retrospective data analysis was performed in adult patients from a single institution's database. Patients with obesity using at least one asthma medication pre-operatively who underwent BS were studied for up to 3-years post-operation. Poisson generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to evaluate the effects of time and procedure type on the number of asthma medication. RESULTS Bariatric patients with at least one prescribed asthma medication (mean 1.4  0.6) were included (n = 751). The mean age at time of operation was 46.8  11.6 years, mean weight was 295.9  57 lbs, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 49  8.2 kg/m2; 87.7% were female, 33.4% had diabetes, 44.2% used gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) medication, and 64.4% used hypertension medication. The most common procedure was Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (79%), followed by sleeve gastrectomy (10.7%), adjustable gastric banding (8.1%), and duodenal switch (2.3%). The mean number of prescribed asthma medications among all procedures decreased by 27% at 30 days post-operation (p < 0.0001), 37% at 6 months (p < 0.0001), 44% at 1 year (p < 0.0001), and 46% at 3 years (p < 0.0001) after adjusting for risk factors. No significant differences in medication use over time between procedure types were observed. In the adjusted analysis, the mean number of asthma medications was 12% higher in patients using at least one GERD medication (p = 0.015) and 8% higher with 10-unit increase in pre-operative BMI (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION BS significantly decreases asthma medication use starting 30 days post-operation with a sustained reduction for up to 3 years.","output":"Asthma medication usage is significantly reduced following bariatric surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prompt and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been important during public health responses for containing the spread of COVID-19, including in hospital settings (1-3). In vitro diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be expensive, have relatively long turnaround times, and require experienced laboratory personnel.* Antigen detection tests can be rapidly and more easily performed and are less expensive. The performance? of antigen detection tests, compared with that of NAATs, is an area of interest for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Quidel Sofia 2 SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) (Quidel Corporation) received Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for use in symptomatic patients within 5 days of symptom onset (4). The reported test positive percentage agreement between this test and an RT-PCR test result is 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 83.3%-99.4%), and the negative percentage agreement is 100.0% (95% CI = 97.9%-100.0%) in symptomatic patients.? However, performance in asymptomatic persons in a university setting has shown lower sensitivity (5); assessment of performance in a clinical setting is ongoing. Data collected during June 30-August 31, 2020, were analyzed to compare antigen test performance with that of RT-PCR in a hospital setting. Among 1,732 paired samples from asymptomatic patients, the antigen test sensitivity was 60.5%, and specificity was 99.5% when compared with RT-PCR. Among 307 symptomatic persons, sensitivity and specificity were 72.1% and 98.7%, respectively. Health care providers must remain aware of the lower sensitivity of this test among asymptomatic and symptomatic persons and consider confirmatory NAAT testing in high-prevalence settings because a false-negative result might lead to failures in infection control and prevention practices and cause delays in diagnosis, isolation, and treatment.","output":"Diagnostic Performance of an Antigen Test with RT-PCR for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a Hospital Setting - Los Angeles County, California, June-August 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The enzyme cGAS functions as a sensor that recognizes the cytosolic DNA from foreign pathogen. The activation of the protein triggers the transcription of inflammatory genes, leading into the establishment of an antipathogen state. An interesting new discovery is that the detection of DNA by cGAS induced the formation of liquid-like droplets. However how cells regulate the formation of these droplets is still not fully understood. In order to unravel the molecular mechanism beneath the DNA-mediated phase separation of cGAS, we developed a polymer-based coarse-grained model which takes into accounts the basic structural organization in DNA and cGAS, as well as the binding properties between these biomolecules. This model was further integrated into a hybrid simulation algorithm. With this computational method, a multi-step kinetic process of aggregation between cGAS and DNA was observed. Moreover, we systematically tested the model under different concentrations and binding parameters. Our simulation results show that phase separation requires both cGAS dimerization and protein-DNA interactions, whereas polymers can be kinetically trapped in small aggregates under strong binding affinities. Additionally, we demonstrated that supramolecular assembly can be facilitated by increasing the number of functional modules in protein or DNA polymers, suggesting that multivalency and intrinsic disordered regions play positive roles in regulating phase separation. This is consistent to previous experimental evidences. Taken together, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational model to study condensation of cGAS-DNA complexes. While the method can reach the timescale beyond the capability of atomic-level MD simulations, it still includes information about spatial arrangement of functional modules in biopolymers that is missing in the mean-field theory. Our work thereby adds a useful dimension to a suite of existing experimental and computational techniques to study the dynamics of phase separation in biological systems.","output":"Coarse-grained simulations of phase separation driven by DNA and its sensor protein cGAS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a complication that may cause neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Various radiological subtypes of HT can be distinguished. Their influence on functional outcome is currently unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the associations between HT subtypes and functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients with proven large vessel occlusion included in the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic stroke in The Netherlands). METHODS All patients with follow-up imaging were included. HT was classified on follow-up CT scans according to the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II classification. Functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 90 days after stroke onset. Ordinal logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders was used to determine the association of HT subtypes with functional outcome. RESULTS Of 478 patients, 222 had HT. Of these, 76 (16%) patients were classified as hemorrhagic infarction type 1, 71 (15%) as hemorrhagic infarction type 2, 36 (8%) as parenchymal hematoma type 1, and 39 (8%) as parenchymal hematoma type 2. Hemorrhagic infarction type 2 (adjusted common OR (acOR) 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.89) and parenchymal hematoma type 2 (acOR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.78) were significantly associated with a worse functional outcome. Hemorrhagic infarction type 1 and parenchymal hematoma type 1 were not significantly associated, although their point estimates pointed in the direction of worse outcome. CONCLUSION This study suggests that parenchymal hematoma type 2 is relevant for functional outcome after an acute ischemic stroke, and smaller HTs might also influence long term functional outcome.

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic put a heavy strain on the healthcare system of many countries. Governments chose different approaches to face the spread of the virus and the contact tracing apps were considered the most effective ones. In particular, by leveraging on the Bluetooth Low-Energy technology, mobile apps allow to achieve a privacy-preserving contact tracing of citizens. While researchers proposed several contact tracing approaches, each government developed its own national contact tracing app. In this paper, we demonstrate that many popular contact tracing apps (e.g., the ones promoted by the Italian, French, Swiss government) are vulnerable to relay attacks. Through such attacks people might get misleadingly diagnosed as positive to SARS-CoV-2, thus being enforced to quarantine and eventually leading to a breakdown of the healthcare system. To tackle this vulnerability, we propose a novel and lightweight solution that prevents relay attacks, while providing the same privacy-preserving features as the current approaches. To evaluate the feasibility of both the relay attack and our novel defence mechanism, we developed a proof of concept against the Italian contact tracing app (i.e., Immuni).

Hospitals and health systems faced significant burdens during this time, particularly in New York City. APPROACH: Third- and fourth-year medical students at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai formed the COVID-19 Student WorkForce to connect students to essential roles in the Mount Sinai Hospital System and support physicians, staff members, researchers, and hospital operations. With the administration's support, the WorkForce grew to include over 530 medical and graduate students. A methodology was developed for clinical students to receive elective credit for these volunteer activities. OUTCOMES: From March 15, 2020 to June 14, 2020, student volunteers recorded 29,602 hours (2,277 hours per week) in 7 different task forces which operated at 7 different hospitals throughout the health system. Volunteers included students from all years of medical school as well as PhD, master's, and nursing students. The autonomous structure of the COVID-19 Student WorkForce was unique and contributed to its ability to quickly mobilize students to necessary tasks. The group leaders collaborated with other medical schools in the New York City area, sharing best practices and resources and consulting on a variety of topics.

BACKGROUND: GBS is the most frequent cause of pediatric acute flaccid paralysis. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric GBS is unclear in the literature. METHODS: We conducted an ambispective, multicentric, cohort study involving 12 of 27 centres in GBS Consortium, during two periods: pre-COVID-19 (March-August 2019) and during COVID-19 (March-August 2020). Children 12 years who satisfied National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke criteria for GBS/variants were enrolled. Details pertaining to clinical/laboratory parameters, treatment and outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge, GBS Disability score at discharge and 3 months) were analysed. RESULTS: We enrolled 33 children in 2019 and 10 in 2020. Children in 2020 were older (median 10.4 [interquartile range 6.75C11.25] years versus 5 (2.5C8.4) years; P = 0.022) and had more sensory symptoms (50% versus 18.2%; P = 0.043).

We determined the levels of inflammatory cytokines in patients with COVID-19 and their relationships with ARDS and extrapulmonary MOD. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 94 COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS were analyzed. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor &#945; [TNF-&#945;]) were measured on days 1, 3, and 5 following admission. Seventeen healthy volunteers were recruited as controls. Correlations in the levels of inflammatory cytokines with clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed, furthermore, we also explored the relationships of different cytokines with ARDS and extrapulmonary MOD. RESULTS: The ARDS group had higher serum levels of all 4 inflammatory cytokines than the controls, and these levels steadily increased after admission. The ARDS group also had higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 than the non-ARDS group, and the levels of these cytokines correlated significantly with coagulation parameters and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The levels of IL-6 and TNF-&#945; correlated with the levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen, and were also higher in ARDS patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).

METHODS: We examined the associations of haloperidol use with intubation or death and time to discharge home among adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at Assistance Publique-H?pitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Greater Paris University hospitals. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death and the secondary endpoint was discharge home among survivors in time-to-event analyses. In the primary analyses, we compared these two outcomes between patients receiving and not receiving haloperidol using univariate Cox regression models in matched analytic samples based on patient characteristics and other psychotropic medications. Sensitivity analyses included propensity score analyses with inverse probability weighting and multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: Of 15,121 adult inpatients with a positive COVID-19 PT-PCR test, 39 patients (0.03%) received haloperidol within the first 48 hours of admission. Over a mean follow-up of 13.8 days (SD = 17.9), 2,024 patients (13.4%) had a primary end-point event and 10,179 patients (77.6%) were discharged home at the time of study end on May 1(st).

Although making the diagnosis rapidly and accurately is crucial in preventing antibiotic resistance development, bacterial identification techniques include some challenging processes. To address this challenge, we proposed a deep neural network (DNN) that can discriminate antibiotic-resistant bacteria using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Stacked autoencoder (SAE)-based DNN was used for the rapid identification of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) bacteria using a label-free SERS technique. The performance of the DNN was compared with traditional classifiers. Since the SERS technique provides high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data, some subtle differences were found between MRSA and MSSA in relative band intensities. SAE-based DNN can learn features from raw data and classify them with an accuracy of 97.66%. Moreover, the model discriminates bacteria with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.99. Compared to traditional classifiers, SAE-based DNN was found superior in accuracy and AUC values. The obtained results are also supported by statistical analysis. These results demonstrate that deep learning has great potential to characterize and detect antibiotic-resistant bacteria by using SERS spectral data.","output":"Drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria detection by combining surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and deep learning techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019, the Covid\\\\19 pandemic spread caused restrictions in business and social spheres. Higher education was also severely affected: universities and medical schools moved online to distance learning and laboratory facilities closed. Questions arise about the long\\\\term effects of this pandemic on anatomical education. In this systematic review, the authors investigated whether or not anatomical educators were able to deliver anatomical knowledge during this pandemic. They also discuss the challenges that anatomical education has faced over the last year. The search strategy was conducted between July 2020 and July 2021. Two hundred and one records were identified, and a total of 79 studies were finally included. How best to deliver anatomy to students remains a moot point. In the last years, the advent of new technologies has raised the question of the possible overcoming of dissection as the main instrument in anatomical education. The Covid\\\\19 pandemic further sharpened the debate. Remote learning enhanced the use of technologies other than cadaveric dissection to teach anatomy. Moreover, from the analyzed records it appears that both from students' perspective as well as teachers' there is a clear tear between those who endorse dissection and those who believe it could be easily overcome or at least integrated by virtual reality and online learning. The authors strongly believe that the best anatomy teaching practice requires the careful adaptation of resources and methods. Nevertheless, they support cadaveric dissection and hope that it will not be replaced entirely as a result of this pandemic.","output":"One year of anatomy teaching and learning in the outbreak: Has the Covid\\\\19 pandemic marked the end of a century\\\\old practice?

Social exchange theory suggests that stronger social exchange relationships increase trust between people and their level of commitment. From this perspective, organizational justice has its own significance. This study empirically analyzed the dual mediation effect of organizational trust (OT) and organizational commitment (OC) to examine an influential relationship between procedural justice (PJ) and work engagement in an organization. The following analytic results were obtained. First, PJ had positive effects on OT, OC, and work engagement. Second, OT had significantly positive effects on OC, whereas it did not have significant effects on work engagement. Third, OC had significantly positive effects on work engagement. Fourth, OC had significant mediation effects with regard to the influence of PJ on work engagement. In addition, organization trust and OC had significant dual mediation effects. The results verified the importance of PJ in an organization. Furthermore, these results provided theoretical and practical implications that PJ can increase OT, OC, and ultimately organizational performance.","output":"Realization of a Sustainable High-Performance Organization through Procedural Justice: The Dual Mediating Role of Organizational Trust and Organizational Commitment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Species-rich pastures naturally contain potentially toxic plants such as common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea L.), whose pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) impose a risk, mainly for cattle and horses. Although in vitro studies showed detoxification capacity of PA in sheep, few field data are available to ascertain whether grazing sheep can both tolerate and reduce ragwort. In a two-year study in a ragwort-rich pasture with a stocking density of 12 sheep/hectare, we documented (1) the extent of voluntarily ingested ragwort, (2) the correlation of nutritional parameters and feeding behavior, and (3) the impact of grazing on the yield proportion and number of flowers of dominant plants. Every six weeks the vegetation underwent a botanical survey and a chemical analysis. Sheep continuously ingested ragwort between 1.2 and 4.9 kg (2020) and 1.0 and 2.2 kg (2021) per individual per day without any impact on animal health. The more biomass ragwort produced, the more it contained sugar (r = 0.59-0.74), and the more sheep ingested it (r = 0.94-0.95). Other herbs increased their yield proportion from 23.3 to 36.5%, while that of ragwort decreased from 26.3 to 18.8% (2020/2021), doubling its flowers.

We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Of the 213 individuals with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1%; 69/172), followed by hyposmia (39.5%; 68/172) and sputum (39.5%; 68/172). Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea. Fever (>37.5C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%) individuals. CONCLUSIONS: As much as one-fifth of individuals with COVID-19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, but fever was not.

In this study 50 clinically normal and 50 cats with cutaneous and/or systemic signs that lived in an endemic area and had been previously examined for infection by L. infantum using PCR in four different tissues were serologically tested for the presence of anti-Leishmania IgG (IFAT and ELISA) and IgM (IFAT). The aim was to compare the results of IFAT, ELISA and PCR and to investigate the possible associations between seropositivity to Leishmania spp and signalment, living conditions, season of sampling, health status of the cats, and seropositivity to other infectious agents. Low concentrations of anti-Leishmania IgG were detected by IFAT in 10% of the cats and by ELISA in 1%, whereas anti-Leishmania IgM were detected by IFAT in 1%. There was disagreement between the results of IFAT and ELISA for anti-Leishmania IgG (P = 0.039) and between all serological tests and PCR (P < 0.001). The diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests, using PCR as the gold standard, was very low, but ELISA and IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgM had 100% specificity. The diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests could not be improved by changing the cut-off values. Seropositivity for Leishmania spp was not associated with signalment, living conditions, season of sampling and health status of the cats or with seropositivity to feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii and Bartonella henselae.

Hidradenitis Suppurativa (H.S) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the hair follicles, resulting in painful lesions of apocrine-bearing skin. Several inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of H.S including IL-17. The role of MAIT cells in H.S is currently unknown. In this study we show for the first time, that MAIT cells are altered in the peripheral blood of patients with H.S, with reduced frequencies and an IL-17 cytokine bias. We show that CCL20 expression is elevated in lesions of patients with H.S, and MAIT cells can actively traffic towards lesions via CCL20. We show that MAIT cells can accumulate in the lesions from patients with H.S. when compared to adjacent skin, with an IL-17 bias. We show that elevated IL-17, can be linked to the activation of dermal fibroblasts, promoting the expression of chemotactic signals including CCL20 and CXCL1.

The current study aimed to evaluate if insecticide applications using micro-sprinklers can be used as an alternative method to protect the fruit from D. suzukii egg-laying. Modeling was used as an additional tool to parameterize the relative insecticide efficacy on oviposition. Field measurements of different treatments were conducted over periods of eleven days on commercial-standard highbush blueberry. Cyantraniliprole and spinetoram were applied using both a micro-sprinkler and a backpack sprayer. Treatments of Chromobacterium subtsugae and zeta-cypermethrin were only applied using a backpack sprayer. Both cyantraniliprole and spinetoram treatments resulted in moderate suppression of D. suzukii egg-laying.

The lack of structural information for intermediary forms of Mpro is a setback for the understanding its self-maturation process. Herein, we used X-ray crystallography combined with biochemical data to characterize multiple forms of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. For the immature form, we show that extra N-terminal residues caused conformational changes in the positioning of domain-three over the active site, hampering the dimerization and diminishing its activity. We propose that this form preludes the cis and trans-cleavage of N-terminal residues. Using fragment screening, we probe new cavities in this form which can be used to guide therapeutic development. Furthermore, we characterized a serine site-directed mutant of the Mpro bound to its endogenous N and C-terminal residues during dimeric association stage of the maturation process.

The aim of this paper is to identify the nexus between temperature and three different causes of mortality (i.e., cardiological, respiratory, and cardiorespiratory) for three countries (Scotland, Spain, and Greece) and eleven cities (i.e., Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee, Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, Attica, and Thessaloniki), emphasizing the differences among these cities and comparing them to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship. To quantify the association between temperature and mortality, temperature thresholds are defined for each city using a robust statistical analysis, namely threshold regression analysis. In a more detailed perspective, the threshold used is called Minimum Mortality Temperature (MMT), the temperature above or below which mortality is at minimum risk. Afterward, these thresholds are compared based on the geographical coordinates of each city. Our findings show that concerning all-causes of mortality under examination, the cities with higher latitude have lower temperature thresholds compared to the cities with lower latitude. The inclusion of the relationship between mortality and temperature in the array of upcoming climate change implications is critical since future climatic scenarios show an overall increase in the ambient temperature.","output":"Mortality Related to Air Temperature in European Cities, Based on Threshold Regression Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The health impacts of COVID-19 are not evenly distributed in societies. Chronic patients are highly affected and develop dangerous symptoms of COVID-19. Understanding their information seeking about COVID-19 may help to improve the effectiveness of public health strategies in the future, the adoption of safety measures, and minimize the spread of the pandemic. However, there is little evidence on information seeking specifically on COVID-19 in this study setting. Therefore, this study aimed to assess information seeking about COVID-19 and associated factors among chronic patients. METHOD: An institutional-based cross-sectional study supplemented with qualitative data was conducted at Bahir Dar city public hospitals in Northwest Ethiopia from April 8 to June 15, 2021. A total of 423 chronic patients were selected using systematic random sampling techniques with an interval of 5. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify factors associated with information seeking about COVID-19. A p-value < 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Qualitative data were analyzed using a thematic approach. Finally, it was triangulated with quantitative findings. RESULT: The proportion of information seeking about COVID-19 among chronic patients was 44.0% (95% CI = 39.0, 49.0). Being living in urban [AOR = 4.4, 95% CI (2.01, 9.58)], having high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 [AOR = 3.4, 95%CI (1.98, 5.70)], having high perceived severity to COVID-19 [AOR = 1.7, 95%CI (1.04, 2.91)], having high self-efficacy to COVID-19 [AOR = 4.3, 95%CI (2.52, 7.34)], and having adequate health literacy [AOR = 1.8, 95%CI (1.10, 3.03)] were significant factors associated with information-seeking about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The overall proportion of information seeking about COVID-19 among chronic patients was low. Thus, health promotion programs should emphasize the chronic patients living in a rural area; enhance perceived risk and severity of COVID-19, enhancing self-efficacy and health literacy interventions to improve information seeking.

Simple, objective indicators for predicting long-term outcomes are needed to select optimal perioperative treatment and appropriate follow-up for patients with esophageal cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) and the survival of patients with esophageal cancer, by performing time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The results were compared to those of traditional inflammation-based markers. METHODS This study enrolled 495 patients who underwent thoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer as the primary treatment between 2000 and 2019 in our department. We investigated the predictability of the LCR for oncological outcomes compared to that of other traditional inflammatory markers. RESULTS The 3-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 72.6% and 57.5%, respectively. Low LCR was significantly associated with higher cancer stage, included depth of invasion (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001) and cStage (p < 0.001). The LCR had the highest AUC value (0.675) for predicting OS compared to the other examined inflammatory markers. In multivariate analysis, the LCR (optimal cutoff threshold = 19,000) was identified as a significant predictor of death (hazard ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-3.12; p < 0.001) and recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95%CI, 1.48-2.63; p < 0.001).

There is also no information as to whether the expression of these mediators is altered in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia or preterm birth. This is important because the expression of decidual and placental angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 across gestation may affect the susceptibility of pregnancies to vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 cell entry genes, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2, in the placenta across human pregnancy and in paired samples of decidua and placenta in pregnancies complicated by preterm birth or preeclampsia compared with those in term uncomplicated pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, 2 separate cohorts of patients, totaling 87 pregnancies, were included. The first cohort was composed of placentae from first- (7-9 weeks), second- (16-18 weeks), and third-trimester preterm (26-31 weeks) and third-trimester term (38-41 weeks) pregnancies (n=5/group), whereas the second independent cohort included matched decidua and placentae from pregnancies from term uncomplicated pregnancies (37-41 weeks' gestation; n=14) and pregnancies complicated by preterm birth (26-37 weeks' gestation; n=11) or preeclampsia (25-37 weeks' gestation; n=42). Samples were subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing or RNA sequencing for next-generation RNA sequencing for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 mRNA expression quantification, respectively. RESULTS: In the first cohort, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2, exhibited a gestational age-dependent expression profile, that is, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 mRNA was higher (P<.05) in the first-trimester placenta than in second-trimester, preterm birth, and term placentae (P<.05) and exhibited a negative correlation with gestational age (P<.05). In the second cohort, RNA sequencing demonstrated very low or undetectable expression levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in preterm birth, preeclampsia, and term decidua and in placentae from late gestation. In contrast, transmembrane protease serine 2 was expressed in both decidual and placental samples but did not change in pregnancies complicated by either preterm birth or preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: The increased expression of these severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 cell entry-associated genes in the placenta in the first trimester of pregnancy compared with those in later stages of pregnancy suggests the possibility of differential susceptibility to placental entry to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 across pregnancy.

Aim To investigate the association between COVID-19 lockdown and GDM. Subjects and Methods Medical records of 140844 pregnant women during 2015-2020 were extracted from 5 hospitals in Guangdong Province, China. Pregnant women who underwent the COVID-19 Level I lockdown (1/23 - 2/24/2020) during pregnancy were defined as the exposed group (N=20472) and pregnant women who underwent the same calendar months during 2015-2019 (1/23 - 2/24) were defined as the unexposed group (N=120372). Subgroup analyses were used to explore the potential susceptible exposure window of COVID-19 lockdown on GDM. Cumulative exposure is quantitatively estimated by assigning different weights to response periods with different exposure intensities. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between COVID-19 lockdown exposure and GDM. Results The rates of GDM in the exposed and unexposed groups were 15.2% and 12.4%, respectively. The overall analyses showed positive associations (odds ratio, OR=1.22, 95%CI: 1.17, 1.27) between lockdown exposure and GDM risk in all pregnant women.

The aim of this study was to measure rates and predictors of sampling errors for biopsy specimens attained at flexible lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, and to determine whether these events lead to a delay in surgical care. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of patients who underwent elective resection for colorectal adenocarcinoma between January 2007 and June 2020. Primary outcomes were proportion of incorrectly diagnosed colorectal adenocarcinomas at index endoscopy by histopathology, and time between endoscopy and surgery. Secondary outcomes were predictors of sampling error, and diagnostic yield of repeat endoscopy. RESULTS: Sampling errors occurred in 217/962 (22.6%) flexible endoscopies for colorectal adenocarcinomas. Negative biopsies were associated with a longer median time to surgery (87.6 days, IQR 48.8C180.0) compared to true positive biopsies (64.0 days, IQR 38.0C119.0), p < 0.001. Controlling for lesion location, neoadjuvant therapy, endoscopist specialty, year, and repeat endoscopies, time to surgery remained 1.40-fold longer (p < 0.001) following sampling error. Repeat endoscopy occurred following 62/217 (28.6%) cases of sampling errors, yielding a correct diagnosis of cancer in 38/62 (61.3%) cases. On multivariable analysis, sampling errors were less likely to occur for lesions endoscopists described as suspicious for malignancy (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.07C0.21) or simple polyps (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08C0.70) compared to endoscopically unresectable polyps.

A novel antigenic epitope would be specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and can distinguish infections caused by common cold viruses. In this study two approaches are employed to identify both continuous and conformational B-cell antigenic epitopes. To achieve this goal, we modeled a complete structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein using recently deposited coordinates (6vxx, 6vsb, and 6w41) in the protein data bank.

Supporting this view, several studies have shown that oral care can improve health outcomes for hospitalized older adults. However, despite oral care being an essential nursing intervention that restores oral function and promotes patient wellness, it is one of the most neglected nursing interventions. Missed oral care occurs due to staff's limited awareness of its significance for care-dependent older adults in hospital settings.

We obtained, by an innovative phage display selection strategy, specific binders recognizing different epitopes of Spike. The novel human antibodies specifically bind to Spike-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in a nanomolar range and interfere in the interaction of Spike with the ACE-2 receptor.

Since anti-Spike mAbs, used individually, might be unable to block the virus cell entry especially in the case of resistant variants, we investigated the possibility to combine D3 with the antibody in clinical use Sotrovimab, and we found that they recognize distinct epitopes and show additive inhibitory effects on the interaction of Omicron-RBD with ACE-2 receptor.

METHODS: For this purpose, a screening via the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire is planned during the regular health check-ups (U9CU11) of approximately 3500 children aged 5C10 years in about 53 medical practices within a 20 km radius of Dresden (Germany). The parents receive feedback concerning the results from the pediatrician and, in case of borderline results on the subscales emotional problems and behavioral problems, a recommendation for an indicative prevention program. Children and parents will be assessed at four points in time with standardized and project-specific questionnaires. Furthermore, guided interviews with the health professional and the parents will be conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility, utility and acceptance of a screening for emotional and behavioral problems of children and recommendations for their prevention in pediatricians practices will be evaluated in a preCpost comparison and after 12 months. Beneficial and inhibiting factors for the utilization are to be identified and used to derive recommendations for the implementation of preventive measures in standard care, identify emotional and behavioral problems at an early stage and prevent the development of mental disorders.","output":"Wie gelingt die Pr?vention psychischer Beschwerden?: Von der Vorsorgeuntersuchung zur indikativen Pr?ventionsma?nahme bei emotionalen und Verhaltensauff?lligkeiten im Vor- und Grundschulalter: eine prospektive Implementationsstudie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE A simple, patient-specific biomechanical model (PSBM) is proposed in which the main surgical tools and actions can be simulated, which enables clinicians to evaluate different strategies for an optimal surgical planning. A prospective and comparative clinical study was performed to assess early clinical and radiological results. METHODS From January 2019 to July 2019, a PSBM was created for every operated acetabular fracture (simulation group). DICOM data were extracted from the pre-operative high-resolution CT scans to build a 3D model of the fracture using segmentation methods. A PSBM was implemented in a custom software allowing a biomechanical simulation of the surgery in terms of reduction sequences. From July 2019 to December 2019, every patient with an operated for acetabular fracture without PSBM was included in the standard group. Surgery duration, blood loss, radiological results and per-operative complications were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were included, 10 in the simulation group and 12 in the standard group. The two groups were comparable regarding age, time to surgery, fracture pattern distribution and surgical approaches. The mean operative time was significantly lower in the simulation group: 113 min  33 (60-180) versus 184  58 (90-260), p = 0.04. The mean blood loss was significantly lower in the simulation group, p = 0.01. No statistical significant differences were found regarding radiological results (p = 0.16). No per-operative complications were recorded. CONCLUSION This study confirms that pre-operative planning in acetabular surgery based on a PSBM results in a shorter operative time and a reduction of blood loss during surgery. This study also confirms the feasibility of PSBM planning in daily clinical routine.

PURPOSE: A case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) occurring as a reaction to ustekinumab therapy is reported. SUMMARY: After starting ustekinumab for treatment of psoriatric arthritis, a 46-year-old female presented with flu-like symptoms and cough with blood-tinged sputum that had begun 1 week previously. Her initial computed tomography scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities. On bronchoscopy, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) return became bloodier from sample 1 to samples 2 and 3. Her BAL fluid was more than 90% hemosiderin-laden macrophages, a finding consistent with DAH. We ruled out infectious etiologies and other common vasculitis conditions that can cause DAH. A diagnosis of ustekinumab-induced DAH was made due to a temporal relationship between initiation of the drug and the patient's presentation and the absence of infection and other alternate diagnosis. Prior case reports including ustekinumab-induced pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease with a granulomatous component, and lupus syndrome have been reported, with this being the first case of DAH in a patient undergoing treatment of psoriatic arthritis. CONCLUSION: A 46-year-old woman developed DAH during ustekinumab treatment. Symptoms abated after drug discontinuation and supportive treament. Clinicians must remain mindful of this rare complication of ustekinumab use in order to avoid potential delays in appropriate DAH treatment.","output":"Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage associated with ustekinumab treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study was designed to identify factors associated with death by 6 months post-intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and to develop a practical mortality risk score for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-treated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. We also assessed long-term survivors health-related quality of life (HRQL), respiratory symptoms, and anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequencies. METHODS: Data from 140 ECMO-treated ARDS patients admitted to three French ICUs (2008C2012) were analyzed. ICU survivors contacted >6 months post-ICU discharge were assessed for HRQL, psychological and PTSD status. RESULTS: Main ARDS etiologies were bacterial (45 %), influenza A[H(1)N(1)] (26 %) and post-operative (17 %) pneumonias. Six months post-ICU discharge, 84 (60 %) patients were still alive. Based on multivariable logistic regression analysis, the PRESERVE (PRedicting dEath for SEvere ARDS on VV-ECMO) score (0C14 points) was constructed with eight pre-ECMO parameters, i.e. age, body mass index, immunocompromised status, prone positioning, days of mechanical ventilation, sepsis-related organ failure assessment, plateau pressure andpositive end-expiratory pressure. Six-month post-ECMO initiation cumulative probabilities of survival were 97, 79, 54 and 16 % for PRESERVE classes 0C2, 3C4, 5C6 and 7 (p < 0.001), respectively. HRQL evaluation in 80 % of the 6-month survivors revealed satisfactory mental health but persistent physical and emotional-related difficulties, with anxiety, depression or PTSD symptoms reported, by 34, 25 or 16 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The PRESERVE score might help ICU physicians select appropriate candidates for ECMO among severe ARDS patients. Future studies should also focus on physical and psychosocial rehabilitation that could lead to improved HRQL in this population.

In response to Hooper's book, The River (1999), the Royal Society in London held a conference to debate the origins of HIV. Examination of the quick dismissal of the OPV theory opens a space for legitimately challenging the widely held belief that the vaccine contamination question was convincingly resolved. This article interrogates the relationship between historiography and the making of scientific facts and history, suggesting that historians have been too credulous of scientists' testimony. The further result of the lack of a thorough analysis of the evidence backing the OPV hypothesis has resulted in a missed opportunity to read The River as one of the few detailed accounts of the immense social, political, technological, and interspecies infrastructure constituted by Cold War vaccine production. This biomedical infrastructure dramatically changed the geographic and interspecies mobility of viruses in ways that may be impossible to reconstruct. Yet these potential transmission routes remain crucial to acknowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the critical importance of studying The WetNet, a concept coined by the author to name the conceptual and material infrastructures of inter- and intraspecies fluid bonding.","output":"The WetNet: What the Oral Polio Vaccine Hypothesis Exposes about Globalized Interspecies Fluid Bonds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infection which can present itself by the involvement of various organs, but the most common manifestations are respiratory symptoms, fever and dyspnea with a high mortality rate. In order to study the prognosis of patients and also to determine the treatment plan, we need non-invasive methods which can be easily used in the triage of patients. In this study, we investigated the diagnostic value of electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and troponin levels in patients with this disease. Methods: This is a descriptive study. Confirmed COVID-19 patients participated in the present study. Data were collected by taking history and referring to medical records. We analyzed data by using chi square, t test and logistic regression through SPSS software version 22. Results: One hundred and five patients with COVID-19 disease were examined. Most patients were men (53.3%) and the mean age was 54.53 years. The most common underlying diseases were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Ninety-five patients had abnormal electrocardiography including eleven with long QT;seven with arrhythmia;78 with sinus tachycardia;7 with hemi-block;1 with hemi-block and first degree atrioventricular block;4 with abnormal axis and 28 with ischemic changes. Eleven patients (10.5%) had positive troponin level, whose length of hospital stay was higher (12.73 vs. 12.07 days). Furthermore, their mean length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was also higher. In addition, among the troponin-positive group, 100% had abnormal electrocardiography. Conclusion: The findings of the present study showed that ECG abnormalities and troponin levels could provide good information about the prognosis of patients. Moreover, it seems that ECG changes in COVID-19 patients, whether indicative of underlying heart disease or resulted from infection, can affect the prognosis of patients. Therefore, considering ECG findings and troponin levels can help select patients at a higher risk for triage. ? 2022, Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

Aim of the study was to assess the mid-term impact of mild-moderate COVID-19 on cardiorespiratory fitness evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in lite athletes. METHODS 13 elite cross-country skiers with previous mild-moderate COVID-19 symptoms underwent CPET before resuming seasonal training (COVID athletes). 13 lite detrained cross-country skiers, matched for principal confounding factors, were taken as controls (control group). Resting peripheral oxygen saturation, pulmonary function test, echocardiography, bioelectrical impedance analysis and CPET (modified XELG2, Woodway, USA) were performed in all participants. RESULTS Median recovery time in COVID athletes was 34 days (IQR 33-38 days). COVID athletes reached earlier the onset of the aerobic threshold (4'48\\" vs 6'28\\", R2=0.15, F=4.37, p<0.05)than controls, whereas the time to anaerobic threshold and maximal efforts did not significantly differ between groups. Oxygen consumption was lower at the aerobic threshold in COVID athletes than controls (VO2/kg 28.6 mL/min vs. 38.9 mL/min, R2=0.39, F=15.34, p<0.01), whereas no significant difference between groups was found both at the aerobic threshold and at peak exercise (all p<0.05). Findings from resting echocardiography and pulmonary function test were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS lite cross-country athletes, previously affected by mild-moderate COVID-19, reached earlier the aerobic threshold than controls, whereas the remaining CPET parameters did not differ between groups. Such changes were not associated with any detectable difference in resting pulmonary and cardiac examination.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have coined the persistent cluster of symptoms as post-COVID syndrome. This has been further sub-categorised into acute post-COVID syndrome for symptoms persisting three weeks beyond initial infection and chronic post-COVID syndrome for symptoms persisting beyond twelve weeks. The aim of this review was to detail the prevalence of clinical features and identify potential predictors for acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome. METHODS: A systematic literature search, with no language restrictions, was performed to identify studies detailing characteristics and outcomes related to survivorship of post-COVID syndrome. The last search was performed on 6 March 2021 and all pre-dating published articles included. A means of proportion meta-analysis was performed to quantify characteristics of acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome. Study quality was assessed with a specific risk of bias tool. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42020222855 FINDINGS: A total of 43 studies met the eligibility criteria; of which, 38 allowed for meta-analysis. Fatigue and dyspnoea were the most prevalent symptoms in acute post-COVID (037 and 035) and fatigue and sleep disturbance in chronic post-COVID syndrome (048 and 044), respectively.

Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities, which are more widely available and accessible, can be beneficial as an alternative diagnostic tool. In this study, an Artificial Intelligence model for Detection of COVID-19 (AIDCOV) is developed to classify chest radiography images as belonging to a person with either COVID-19, other infections, or no pneumonia (i.e., normal). The hierarchical structure in AIDCOV captures the dependencies among features and improves model performance while an attention mechanism makes the model interpretable and transparent. We used several publicly available datasets of both computed tomography (CT) and X-ray modalities. The main public dataset for chest X-ray images contains 475 COVID-19 samples, 3949 samples from other viral/bacterial infections, and 1583 normal samples. Our model achieves a mean cross-validation accuracy of 98.4%. AIDCOV has a sensitivity of 99.8%, a specificity of 100%, and an F1-score of 99.8% in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images on that dataset. Using a large dataset of CT images, our model obtained mean cross-validation accuracy and sensitivity of 98.8% and 99.4%, respectively. Additionally, our interpretable model can distinguish subtle signs of infection within each radiography image. Assuming these results hold up in larger datasets obtained from a variety of patients over the world, AIDCOV can be used in conjunction with or instead of RT-PCR testing (where RT-PCR testing is unavailable) to detect and isolate individuals with COVID-19, prevent onward transmission to the general population and healthcare workers, and highlight the areas in the lungs that show signs of COVID-related damage.","output":"AIDCOV: An Interpretable Artificial Intelligence Model for Detection of COVID-19 from Chest Radiography Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Akathisia tends to develop as an early complication of antipsychotic treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Although withdrawal akathisia has been reported after the discontinuation or dose reduction of typical antipsychotic drugs, akathisia following atypical antipsychotic drug withdrawal remains a rare phenomenon. CASE PRESENTATION A 24-year-old woman with an acute psychotic episode was admitted and initially treated with aripiprazole. The aripiprazole dose was titrated up to 30 mg/day over 9 days and maintained for the next 3 days; however, her psychotic symptoms persisted without change. She was switched to amisulpride, with the dose increased over 2 weeks to 1000 mg/day. Subsequently, although the patient's psychotic episode subsided, her serum prolactin levels increased markedly. After discharge, the amisulpride dose was increased to 1200 mg/day owing to auditory hallucinations and was maintained with quetiapine (100-200 mg/day) and benztropine (1 mg/day) for 13 weeks. Given the potential for hyperprolactinemia as a side effect, the amisulpride dose was reduced to 800 mg/day concurrently with the discontinuation of benztropine; however, these changes resulted in severe restlessness without other extrapyramidal symptoms. The withdrawal akathisia disappeared over 2 weeks after switching to aripiprazole (10 mg/day) with propranolol (40 mg/day) and the patient's prolactin levels had normalized after 6 months of aripiprazole monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS The present case highlights the potential for the development of withdrawal akathisia when the dose of amisulpride is tapered abruptly. Thus, a slow tapering and careful monitoring are recommended when switching from amisulpride to other antipsychotic drugs. Furthermore, this case suggests that changing the regimen to aripiprazole with propranolol may be a potential option for amisulpride withdrawal akathisia superimposed on pre-existing hyperprolactinemia.","output":"Amisulpride withdrawal akathisia responding to aripiprazole with propranolol in first-onset psychosis: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper focuses on the use of latent corpus from the internet to explore HR professionals work experience when Portugal first declared a state of emergency in March 2020 due to the pandemic outbreak Given that little is known about the experience of human resources (HR) professionals in managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in organisations and work, we conducted a study with a qualitative design, using latent corpus from HR specialty magazines and journals, retrieved from March to June 2020 Data was analysed with the support of NVivo, using a categorical content analysis to identify recurring themes and patterns The analysis resulted in five main key themes, namely (1) responses to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, (2) impact of the pandemic, (3) the orientation of HRM, (4) learnings, and (5) difficulties for the HRM Results show that HRM professionals were mainly focused on employees and the community They were also oriented to guaranteeing the future of the business In this paper, we explore the use of data retrieved from the internet and through technologies, particularly in times of a societal crisis, which has become a major issue among qualitative researchers ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"The COVID-19 Crisis in the Words of Human Resources Professionals: The Use of Internet Latent Corpus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the rapid development of light weight EEG devices which we have witnessed the past decade, it is reasonable to ask to which extent neuroscience could now be taken outside the lab In this study, we have designed an EEG paradigm well suited for deployment 'in the wild' The paradigm is tested in repeated recordings on 20 subjects, on eight different occasions (4 in the laboratory, 4 in the subject's own home) By calculating the inter subject, intra subject and inter location variance, we find that the inter location variation for this paradigm is considerably less than the inter subject variation We believe the paradigm is representative of a large group of other relevant paradigms This means that given the positive results in this study, we find that if a research paradigm would benefit from being performed in less controlled environments, we expect limited problems in doing so","output":"EEGs Vary Less Between Lab and Home Locations Than They Do Between People"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Capitalizing on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), existing deep learning methods (especially convolutional neural networks, CNNs) have been widely and successfully applied to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment, MCI).

Missing from this conception, however, is arguably the very essence of genuinely constituted authority: the capacity to mobilise fiscal resourcesmost importantly via taxationin a legitimate and compulsory fashion, a power the EU obviously lacks on its own. We can call this the metabolic constitution of the EU, a term meant to focus our attention on the capacity of a polity to convert resources into work toward public ends. The EUs metabolic constitution is fractured in several ways, most importantly because of its complete dependence on the taxing power of the Member States severally. This dependence has limited the EUs autonomous capacities to address a range of challenges over the last decade, from the Eurozone crisis, to the climate emergency, to the coronavirus pandemic response. This article surveys the evolution of the EUs metabolic constitution over the many crises of the last decade and then considers whether and to what extent the most recent initiative in this regardthe common borrowing in the Next Generation EU recovery fund in response to the coronavirus pandemiccan be understood as a critical juncture in the EUs capacity to mobilise resources on its own, unmediated through the Member States.","output":"Europes Fractured Metabolic Constitution: From the Eurozone Crisis to the Coronavirus Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facemask use may promote face touching.

Purpose: We hypothesized that we could successfully support stroke survivors & caregivers through a virtual platform during the pandemic & improve accessibility regardless of participant location or transportation. Methods: Group leaders assessed stroke survivors & caregivers ongoing needs through weekly outreach identifying the importance of the support group and a need for continued group access during the Covid-19 pandemic. Attendee's indicated an interest in virtual support & a willingness to learn the required virtual platform. Leaders collaborated across the system to organize efforts in reaching survivors & caregivers at each hospital while sharing group curriculum & education systemwide;thus, allowing groups to meet at different times and increasing overall accessibility. Facilitators worked with individuals to problem solve potential issues navigating a virtual format. Results: The virtual format successfully provided support from the comfort & safety of home. Attendance increased in comparison to an in-person format. When asked about preference for an in-person setting only vs. a combination of in-person & virtual format, 80% selected a combination format. Working together across the system, stroke coordinators & group facilitators benefitted from a broader range of resources and connected the greater stroke community across Colorado.

Endoscopy has become evasive since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate methods that use the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-jejunostomy (PEG-J) tubes without endoscopy. METHODS: We included 19 patients in this study. The contrast agent was injected into the PEG-J tube to clarify the AEs related to the use of the tube. When the kink of the PEG-J tube was found, it was pulled approximately 5C10 cm. When placing or replacing the PEG-J tube, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was pushed into the gastrostomy hole to bring its tip closer to the pylorus before a new PEG-J tube was inserted into it. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 63.1  9.9 years, while the mean duration of PD was 16.7  6.3 years. Tube-related AEs included PEG-J tube kinks (32 events), connector failures (20 events), and PEG-J tube entanglements without/with bezoars (9 events/5 events). All PEG-J tube kinks were resolved by tube manipulation with a fluoroscopic guide. In 66 of 85 events (77.6%), the PEG-J tube was placed or replaced without endoscopy. We believe that the use of the antispasmodic agent just before PEG-J operation reduced this rate. CONCLUSION: Our methods were able to resolve most AEs associated with PEG-J tube use without endoscopy.","output":"Operation of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-jejunostomy tube without endoscopy in patients with Parkinsons disease on levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic, which has numerous global implications, has led people to believe that nothing will be the same as before.

METHODS: The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and its Omicron, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Mu variants were subjected to pairwise sequence matrix evaluation, antigenic epitope prediction, and phylogenetic relationship and structural dynamics analyses. RESULTS: The Omicron RBD contained 13C15 amino acid mutations, of which 12 were new and three conserved with other variants. In addition, two mutations found in the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Mu variants were not found in the Omicron RBD. The ultrametric clustering unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean identified Omicron as a novel monophyletic class, but the neighbor-joining method clustered Omicron with Alpha and Delta variants. In the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, five main antigenic epitopes were predicted, and these epitopes were conserved across all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested. Surprisingly, the additional mutations in the Omicron variant increased the size of the expected antigenic sites in two of these antigenic epitopes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed higher root-mean-square deviation in the Omicron RBD, greater residue fluctuation at residues 32C42 and 140C160, and increased solvent-accessible surface area. CONCLUSIONS: The Omicron RBD mutations indicate the variant is within a new phylogenetic class of SARS-CoV-2 and significantly impact RBD structure, conformation, and molecular dynamics. However, conserved anticipated antigenic sites may imply partial changes in receptor affinity and response to immune reactions.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1)-producing preproglucagon (PPG) neurons within the lower brainstem caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) are particularly sensitive to stressful stimuli and are implicated in multiple physiological and behavioural responses to interoceptive and psychogenic threats. However, the afferent inputs driving stress-induced activation of PPG neurons are largely unknown, and the role of PPG neurons in anxiety-like behaviour is controversial. Through chemogenetic manipulations we reveal that cNTS PPG neurons have the ability to moderately increase anxiety-like behaviours in mice in a sex-dependent manner. Using an intersectional approach, we show that a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-rich input from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) drives activation of both the cNTS as a whole and PPG neurons in particular in response to acute stress. Finally, we demonstrate that NTS-projecting PVN neurons are necessary for the ability of acute stress to suppress food intake.

Themes of stress and coping were discerned from volunteered responses. Patients also completed the standard Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale/PROMIS Anxiety surveys. Anxiety scores were independent variables in multivariable analyses with stress and coping themes as combined dependent variables. RESULTS: Of the 112 patients interviewed (86% women; mean age, 50 years), 72 volunteered COVID-19-related stress on their rheumatic condition, home, work, and finances. Patients volunteering stress were younger, had disease longer, were taking more than 1 medication, had worse GAD-7 scores and a positive anxiety screen, and had worse PROMIS scores that were significantly worse than population norms (all comparisons, p &#8804; 0.01; all variables remained associated in multivariable analyses).

Neural networks were identified through independent components analysis. Dual regression was used to characterize within-network functional connectivity alterations associated with individual differences in anhedonia. Modulation of between-network functional connectivity by anhedonia was tested using region-of-interest to region-of-interest correlational analyses. Anhedonia was associated with visual network hyperconnectivity and expansion of the visual, dorsal attention, and default networks. Additionally, anhedonia was associated with decreased between-network connectivity among default, salience, dorsal attention, somatomotor, and visual networks. Findings suggest that anhedonia is associated with aberrant connectivity and structural alterations in resting-state networks that contribute to impairments in reward learning, low motivation, and negativity bias characteristic of depression.

One hundred sixty-nine (46.8%) of the study participants reported that their hospital has personal safety policies and procedures. One hundred sixty-one (44%) reported that they perceived no support, while only 35 (9.7%) participants reported that they perceived full support from their hospital. Furthermore, the participants perceived that their local concerned bodies took fewer necessary measurements to defend physical integrity in the workplace (mean 2.86 SD = 3.34). CONCLUSION: There are many healthcare workers who have limited access to the majority of essential PPE. The majority of study participants perceived limited support from their health facilities, hospitals and local concerned bodies. Therefore, hospitals and local public health authorities should increase access to PPE to protect healthcare workers.","output":"Access to Essential Personal Safety, Availability of Personal Protective Equipment and Perception of Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 in Public Hospital in West Shoa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV. Similar to other coronaviruses, spike (S)-glycoprotein of the virus interacts with a cellular receptor and mediates membrane fusion to allow viral entry into susceptible target cells. Accordingly, S-protein plays an important role in virus infection cycle and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. To begin to understand its biochemical and immunological properties, we expressed both full-length and ectodomain of the protein in various primate cells. Our results show that the protein has an electrophoretic mobility of about 160C170 kDa. The protein is glycosylated with high mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides, which account for approximately 30 kDa of the apparent protein mass. The detection of S-protein by immunoassays was difficult using human convalescent sera, suggesting that the protein may not elicit strong humoral immune response in virus-infected patients. We were able to pseudotype murine leukemia virus particles with S-protein and produce SARS pseudoviruses. Pseudoviruses infected Vero E6 cells in a pH-independent manner and the infection could be specifically inhibited by convalescent sera. Consistent with low levels of antibodies against S-protein, neutralizing activity was weak with 50% neutralization titers ranging between 1:15 to 1:25. To facilitate quantifying pseudovirus-infected cells, which are stained blue with X-Gal, we devised an automated procedure using an ELISPOT analyzer. The high-throughput capacity of this procedure and the safety of using SARS pseudoviruses should make possible large-scale analyses of neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV.","output":"Development of a safe neutralization assay for SARS-CoV and characterization of S-glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes an improved ResU-Net framework for automatic liver CT segmentation. By employing a new loss function and data augmentation strategy, the accuracy of liver segmentation is improved, and the performance is verified on two public datasets LiTS17 and SLiver07. Firstly, to speed up the convergence of the model, the residual module is used to replace the original convolution module of U-Net. Secondly, to suppress the problem of pixel imbalance, the opposite number of Dice is proposed to replace the cross-entropy loss function, and the morphological method is introduced to weigh the pixels. Finally, to improve the generalization ability of the model, random affine transformation and random elastic deformation are employed for data augmentation. From 20 training datasets of Sliver07, 16 sets were selected as the training set, two sets were used for verification, and two sets were used for the test; meanwhile, from 131 training datasets of LiTS2017, eight sets were selected as the test set. In the experiment, four evaluation metrics, including DICE global, DICE per case, VOE, and RVD, were calculated, with the accuracies of 94.28, 94.24  2.07, 10.83  3.70, and -0.25  2.74, respectively. Compared with U-Net and ResU-Net, the performance of the proposed method is significantly improved. The experimental results show that, although the method's complexity is high, it has a faster convergence speed and stronger generalization ability. The segmentation effect on the 2D image is significantly improved, and the scalability on 3D data is also robust. In addition, the proposed method performs well in the case of low-contrast neighboring organs, which proves the robustness of the proposed method.","output":"An improved residual U-Net with morphological-based loss function for automatic liver segmentation in computed tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome focuses on identifying the causes for respiratory failure and on following best practices for supportive care with oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation.

Despite maximal surgical and medical care, gynecologic malignancies have a high rate of recurrence following surgery. Current machine learning models use advanced pathology data that is often inaccessible within low-resource settings and are specific to singular cancer types. There is currently a need for machine learning models to predict non-clinically evident residual disease using only clinically available health data. Here we developed and tested multiple machine learning models to assess the risk of residual disease post-hysterectomy based on clinical and operative parameters. Data from 3656 hysterectomy patients from the NSQIP dataset over 14 years were used to develop models with a training set of 2925 patients and a validation set of 731 patients. Our models revealed the top postoperative predictors of residual disease were the initial presence of gross abdominal disease on the diaphragm, disease located on the bowel mesentery, located on the bowel serosa, and disease located within the adjacent pelvis prior to resection. There were no statistically significant differences in performances of the top three models. Extreme gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models had comparable AUC ROC (0.90) and accuracy metrics (87C88%). Using these models, physicians can identify gynecologic cancer patients post-hysterectomy that may benefit from additional treatment.

Due to its limitations in pediatric populations and interferences with monitoring, bivalirudin is being utilized more frequently in these settings. For bivalirudin, other tests have emerged such as dilute thrombin time (dTT) and ecarin chromogenic assay (ECA); however, their utilities in pediatrics are unexplored. Development of suitable, accurate testing for bivalirudin monitoring is paramount to prevent complications. We sought to compare aPTT, aPTT with heparinase (HPTT), dTT1:4, modified dTT1:10, and ECA for monitoring of pediatric ECLS patients anticoagulated with bivalirudin. METHODS aPTT, HPTT, dTT1:4, dTT1:10, and ECA were measured in 51 specimens from 17 children on bivalirudin-anticoagulated ECLS. Normal pooled plasma was spiked with various bivalirudin concentrations, and aPTT, dTT1:4, dTT1:10, and ECA were measured. In addition, dTT assays were performed using plasma from normal donors spiked with bivalirudin, heparin, and cryoprecipitate. RESULTS dTT1:4 showed excellent correlation with ECA, while dTT1:4 correlated moderately with aPTT or HPTT. Fifty to 75% of specimens showed discordant results between dTT1:4 and HPTT. We found that dTT1:4 and ECA prolongations are associated with bivalirudin infusion rate; however, there are age-based differences that should be accounted for. The performance of dTT1:10 was similar to dTT1:4, though it was less sensitive to interfering factors (heparin or hyperfibrinogenemia). CONCLUSION dTT1:10 appears to be more suitable for routine practice due to fewer variations and lower cost for monitoring bivalirudin in pediatric ECLS.","output":"How to best monitor bivalirudin anticoagulant effect for ECMO and VAD-Comparison of four assay methods."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Currently, two effective therapeutic options for severe aortic stenosis (AS) are available, one catheter-based [transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)], the other open surgical approach [surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR)]. The COVID-19 pandemic has limited the availability of medical procedures. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess if this pandemic had any impact on the treatment strategy of severe AS in a single cardiac center. Methods This study involved AS patients treated in 3-month periods (February through April) over 3 consecutive years 2018, 2019 [defined as COV(-) group] and 2020 [COV(+)]. We assessed if there were any differences regarding patients' clinical profile, applied therapeutic method, procedure complexity and early clinical outcomes. Results In the years 2018 through 2019, approximately 50% of AS patients were treated classically (SAVR) while in 2020 this rate dropped to 34%. The preoperative clinical characteristic of TAVI subjects was comparable irrespective of the year. Regarding SAVR, more patients in COV(+) underwent urgent and more complex procedures. More of them were found in NYHA class III or IV, and had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (51.9%14.4% vs. 58.3%8.1%; P=0.021) than in COV(-) individuals. During the pandemic, a change in applied therapeutic methods and differences in patients' clinical profile did not have an unfavorable impact on in-hospital mortality (2.0% before vs. 3.6% during pandemic) and morbidity. Of note, intubation time and in-hospital stay were significantly shorter (P<0.05) in 2020 (4.2 hours and 7.5 days) than in the previous years (7.5 hours and 9.0 days, respectively). Conclusions The coronavirus pandemic has changed substantially the management of severe AS. The shift into less invasive treatment method of AS patients resulted in shortening of in-hospital stay without compromise of short-term outcomes.","output":"How the COVID-19 pandemic changed treatment of severe aortic stenosis: a single cardiac center experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary artery sling (PAS) is a rare congenital vascular anomaly.

Using the account @IDJClub, an ID physician leads a 1-hour open-access Twitter discussion of a recent publication. All participants use the hashtag #IDJClub. Sessions started monthly, but increased due to demand during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We used Symplur 's Healthcare Hashtag project to track engagement of #IDJClub per 60-minute discussion plus the following 30 minutes to capture ongoing conversations. We also conducted an online anonymous survey using Likert scales and open-ended questions to assess educational impact. RESULTS In its first 20 months, 31 journal clubs were held, with medians of 42 (interquartile range [IQR], 28.5-60) participants and 312 (IQR, 205-427.5) tweets per session. 134 participants completed the survey, of whom 39% were ID physicians, 19% pharmacists, 13% ID fellows, and 10% medical residents.

This study retrospectively analyzed the significance of lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, lung function, smoking history, corticosteroids, antiviral treatment, viral subtypes, and RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies for the progression to LRD in 181 HCT recipients with RSV URI. Results. In multivariable models, smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation, and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) 100/mm(3) at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with disease progression. No progression occurred in patients with ALCs of >1000/mm(3) at URI onset. Lymphocyte engraftment dynamics were similar in progressors and nonprogressors. Pre- and posttransplant donor and posttransplant recipient RSV subtype-specific neutralizing antibody levels, RSV viral subtypes, and corticosteroids also were not significantly associated with LRD progression.

Clinical and demographic information was collected from the medical records. Categorical variables were expressed by frequency and percentage. To explore the risk factors associated with mortality, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Results and discussions: All non-survivors (n = 100) and 100 survivors (out of 1,018) were analyzed. Male gender (67.4%) was the independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection. Advanced age group, diabetes, cardiovascular, neurological, and hypertensive co-morbidities were statistically associated with mortality. Cardiac arrest and acute kidney injury (AKI) were the most common complications. Mortality is significantly associated with lymphopenia and raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as shown by higher odds. In addition, raised neutrophils, monocytes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum creatinine, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are also significantly associated with mortality.

This pandemic has led to the spread of online misinformation, closure of schools, postponement of re-opening of schools, and restrictions on healthy outdoor activities. These, in turn, have caused a disruption in the daily life of middle school students. This study aimed to identify the relationships between eHealth literacy, awareness of pandemic infectious diseases, and healthy lifestyle in middle school students. For this purpose, we conducted a descriptive, correlational study in two cities in the capital of South Korea. A total of 138 middle school students completed self-reported questionnaires about eHealth literacy, awareness of pandemic infectious diseases, and healthy lifestyle. Middle school students displayed moderate levels of eHealth literacy (3.72  0.97), awareness of pandemic infectious diseases (3.33  0.92), and healthy lifestyle (2.98  0.72). Positive correlations were found between eHealth literacy and awareness of pandemic infectious diseases (r = 0.44, p < 0.001), between eHealth literacy and healthy lifestyle (r = 0.52, p < 0.001), and between awareness of pandemic infectious diseases and healthy lifestyle (r = 0.38, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that eHealth literacy may be an important aspect of increasing the awareness about pandemic infectious diseases and forming healthy lifestyle habits in Korean middle school students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"eHealth Literacy, Awareness of Pandemic Infectious Diseases, and Healthy Lifestyle in Middle School Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the iPad-mediated cognitive assessment gaining popularity with school districts and the need for alternative modes for training and instruction during this COVID-19 pandemic, school psychology training programs will need to adapt to effectively train their students to be competent in administering, scoring, an interpreting cognitive assessment instruments.

Tremendous unstructured COVID-19 publications make it challenging for policymakers to obtain relevant evidence. Knowledge graphs (KGs) can formalize unstructured knowledge into structured form and have been used in supporting decision-making recently. Here, we introduce a novel framework that can extract the COVID-19 public health evidence knowledge graph (CPHE-KG) from papers relating to a modelling study. We screen out a corpus of 3096 COVID-19 modelling study papers by performing a literature assessment process. We define a novel annotation schema to construct the COVID-19 modelling study-related IE dataset (CPHIE). We also propose a novel multi-tasks document-level information extraction model SS-DYGIE++ based on the dataset. Leveraging the model on the new corpus, we construct CPHE-KG containing 60,967 entities and 51,140 relations. Finally, we seek to apply our KG to support evidence querying and evidence mapping visualization. Our SS-DYGIE++(SpanBERT) model has achieved a F1 score of 0.77 and 0.55 respectively in document-level entity recognition and coreference resolution tasks. It has also shown high performance in the relation identification task. With evidence querying, our KG can present the dynamic transmissions of COVID-19 pandemic in different countries and regions. The evidence mapping of our KG can show the impacts of variable non-pharmacological interventions to COVID-19 pandemic.

We conducted a comparative study to analyze the pandemics consequence on microsurgical reconstructions at a reconstructive plastic surgery center in Sweden. METHOD: All free flaps performed at a single center between March 2019 and 2021 were analyzed. The patient cohort was divided into two groups, with a period of 1 year in each group: non-COVID-19 year and COVID-19 year. The periods were compared regarding the number and type of surgeries and patient characteristics. RESULTS: In the year prior to the pandemic, 123 free flap surgeries were performed, compared with 103 surgeries during the COVID-19 year. There was a significant shift in the most common site for free flap reconstruction: from the breast [which decreased by 42% (66C38)] to head and neck [which increased by 22% (41C50); OR 0.53 (P = 0.02)]. This was also reflected by a significant increase in hospital stay for free flap patients during the COVID-19 year (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shift was seen from breast reconstructions toward head and neck reconstructions as the most common free flap procedure performed. An increasing backlog of elective breast reconstructions demands increased resources and tougher priorities, which challenge the healthcare system in the post-COVID-19 era.","output":"The COVID-19 Pandemic Consequences on Microsurgical Reconstructions: A Single Centers Shift of Indications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parliamentary intern Gabrielle Laing describes the role of lobbyists in parliament and explains why she thinks vets would make good influencers.","output":"Diary of a parliamentary intern."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has been recently reported after vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Here, we aim to identify the risk factors for COVID-19 severity and compare patients between the firstCthird waves and the fourth wave. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective study of COVID-19 cases at the National Hospital Organization Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center. RESULTS: We identified 404 patients (median age: 71.0 years [interquartile range: 56.0C80.0]), of whom 199 (49.1%) had mild disease, 142 (35.2%) had moderate disease, and 63 (15.6%) had severe disease. The overall mortality rate was 5.4% (22/404). Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, cardiovascular disease, fever, dyspnea, and several inflammatory biomarkers were independent risk factors for moderate to severe disease. For every 1 mg/dL increase in C-reactive protein, 10 IU/L increase in lactate dehydrogenase, and 100 ng/mL increase in ferritin, the risk for moderate to severe disease increased by 18.3%, 12.9%, and 8.9%, respectively. Overall disease severity in the fourth wave was higher than in the firstCthird waves. However, there was no significant difference in mortality. Because of a shortage of beds, four of the 28 severe patients (14.3%) in the fourth wave could not be transferred to the advanced hospital.

This attitude has changed, and autopsies are now recognized as indispensable tools for elucidating COVID-19; despite this, the true risk of infection for autopsy staff is still debated. To elucidate the rate of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs were taken at nine locations of the PPE of one physician and an assistant each from 11 full autopsies performed at four different centers. Further samples were obtained for three minimally invasive autopsies (MIA) conducted at a fifth center. Lung/bronchus swabs of the deceased served as positive controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-qPCR. In 9/11 full autopsies PPE samples were tested RNA positive with PCR, in total 21% of all PPE samples taken. The main contaminated parts of the PPE were the gloves (64% positive), the aprons (50% positive), and the upper sides of shoes (36% positive) while for example the fronts of safety goggles were only positive in 4.5% of the samples and all face masks were negative. In MIA, viral RNA was observed in one sample from a glove, but not in other swabs. Infectious virus isolation in cell culture was performed in RNA positive swabs from full autopsies. Of all RNA positive PPE samples, 21% of the glove samples were positive for infectious virus taken in 3/11 full autopsies. In conclusion, in >80% of autopsies, PPE was contaminated with viral RNA. In >25% of autopsies, PPE was found to be even contaminated with infectious virus, signifying a potential risk of infection among autopsy staff.

An Operation Proves to Be the Most Effective Therapy for Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus.\\" This was based on their observation that bariatric surgery rapidly normalized blood glucose levels in obese people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 10 years later, almost 90% remained diabetes free. Pories et al. suggested that caloric restriction played a key role and that the relative contributions of proximal intestinal nutrient exclusion, rapid distal gut nutrient delivery, and the role of gut hormones required further investigation. These findings of T2DM improvement/remission after bariatric surgery have been widely replicated, together with the observation that bariatric surgery prevents or delays incident T2DM. Over the ensuing two decades, important glucoregulatory roles of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract have been firmly established. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial glycemic effects of bariatric surgery remain incompletely understood. In addition to the mechanisms proposed by Pories et al., changes in bile acid metabolism, GI tract nutrient sensing and glucose utilization, incretins, possible anti-incretin(s), and the intestinal microbiome are implicated. These changes, acting through peripheral and/or central pathways, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, increased tissue glucose uptake, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced -cell function. A constellation of factors, rather than a single overarching mechanism, likely mediate postoperative glycemic improvement, with the contributing factors varying according to the surgical procedure. Thus, different bariatric/metabolic procedures provide us with experimental tools to probe GI tract physiology. Embracing this approach through the application of detailed phenotyping, genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome studies will enhance our understanding of metabolic regulation and help identify novel therapeutic targets.","output":"Mechanisms of Diabetes Improvement Following Bariatric/Metabolic Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Testing of symptomatic persons for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is occurring worldwide. We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out jointly in test settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the test-negative case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only requires collecting information about potential risk factors for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population controls. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be identified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional case-control studies. We describe two options for population control groups: one composed of accompanying persons to the test facilities, the other drawn from existing country-wide healthcare databases. We also describe other possibilities for population controls. Combining the TND with population controls yields a triangulation approach that distinguishes between exposures that are risk factors for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, and exposures that are risk factors for just COVID-19.

Because these patients have increased morbidity and mortality risks, they require immediate attention to determine the causes in order to provide appropriate treatment. This study aimed to investigate the causes and predictive factors of syncope as well as the methods used to diagnose syncope in cardiac pacemaker patients. METHODS: Patients with pacemakers implanted owing to sinus node disease or atrioventricular block were evaluated with standardized questionnaires, endocavitary electrograms, and other tests based on the suspected causes of syncope. Mann- Whitney U tests were used to analyze continuous variables and Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analyses. Statistical significance was P<0.05. RESULTS: The study included 95 patients with pacemakers: 47 experienced syncope in the last 12 months and 48 did not. Of the 100 documented episodes of syncope, 48.9% were vasovagal syncopes, 17% had cardiac-related causes, 10.6% had unknown causes, and 8.5% had pacemaker failure. The multivariate analysis showed that a New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II was a significant factor for developing syncope (P<0.01).

Currently, the therapy benefits of antiviral experimental drugs are still uncertain. The main aim of this study is to describe the experience of a level III hospital regarding therapeutic management of hospitalized children with COVID-19 and to characterize clinical features and evolution. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a descriptive study of patients with COVID-19 in a level III pediatric hospital in Portugal between March and June 2020. Experimental drugs were administered according to the best scientific evidence at the time as 'off-label use'. RESULTS Among 200 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 37 were admitted due to COVID-19. Median age was one year (23 days - 18 years), 43% had comorbidities and 20/37 (54%) received antiviral therapy. Hydroxychloroquine was administered in 13 patients, in monotherapy or combined with lopinavir/ritonavir or azithromycin. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered in eight patients and three children were treated with remdesivir. The patients who were treated had pneumonia (14), multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (2), sepsis (2), myocarditis (1), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1), and mild illness with comorbidities (3). Other therapies included methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin (3), enoxaparin (2), antibiotics (16), oxygen (7), corticosteroids, and other inhaled therapy (16). DISCUSSION Several treatment approaches have been proposed for severe COVID-19, even though none of them had been proven effective or approved for small children. Currently, remdesivir is approved for children aged above 12 years-old. Although 54% of our patients were treated with antivirals, it is important to understand that the favorable clinical evolution could be related with the natural course of the disease. CONCLUSION A significant proportion of our population presented severe and critical disease, was hospitalized and received treatment according to the most recent data, although most patients had mild disease.

METHODS We compared the prevalence of difficulty walking and difficulty attending medical appointments alone among adults with and without CVD using national survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2015-2019. We used logistic regression and Rao-Scott 2 analysis while controlling for several social determinants of health as covariates. RESULTS Of 2 212 973 respondents, 200 087 (9.04%) had CVD. The odds of individuals with CVD experiencing either difficulty walking or difficulty attending medical appointments alone were >3 times greater than the odds for individuals without CVD. In all adults with CVD, 42% reported difficulty walking and 20% reported dependence on another person to attend medical appointments. In all adults with CVD, 46% reported difficulty with one or both difficulties compared with 14% of adults without CVD. CONCLUSIONS We estimate that 11.9 million Americans with self-reported CVD have difficulty walking, or are dependent on another person to attend medical appointments, or both.

The disease mainly affects the respiratory system of the patient, in particular, the lungs, which leads to patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute respiratory failure, with 5-15% of patients requiring observation in the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory support in the form of ventilation. This study was aimed at identifying the role of biochemical markers in the risk stratification of invasive and non-invasive ventilation of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods The study was conducted as a prospective, observational study of all admitted COVID-19 patients. A comparative analysis was performed of the survivors who were on invasive versus (vs) non-invasive ventilation and the non-survivors similarly. After computing the descriptive statistics, a multinomial logistic regression model was applied to obtain an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence interval (CI), with Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test used to predict the fitness of the data. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were obtained for each of the laboratory investigations predicting survival along with the intensive care stay and invasive ventilation. A log-rank test was carried out to compare the survival distributions. Results A total of 373 included patients in the study had a mean age of 52.78  15.76 years with females younger than males, and indifference amongst invasive vs non-invasively ventilated (p=0.821). Females were slightly more prone to invasive ventilation (p=0.097). Overall, 39% of the subjects did not need respiratory support, while 13% were on a ventilator, 16% on bilevel positive airway pressure/continuous positive airway pressure (BiPAP/CPAP), and 31% on supplemental oxygen therapy. Among the laboratory markers, mean hemoglobin was evidently lower in the invasive group, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia were present in both invasively ventilated and non-surviving patients, while neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia were statistically indifferent among the mode of ventilation. Elevated urea, creatinine, and sodium were also significantly deranged laboratory markers amongst the invasively ventilated group. C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were elevated significantly in the invasive group, while serum ferritin was more frequently raised in the non-invasively ventilated group. Procalcitonin (PCT) was significantly associated with invasive ventilation as opposed to the non-invasive group. D-dimer was equally raised in both the groups at admission but significantly elevated in the invasive group at discharge. A multinomial regression model signified D-dimer (OR: 16.301), hypernatremia (OR: 12.738), creatinine (OR: 12.589), urea (OR: 12.576), and LDH (OR: 12.245) most significantly associated with death, while those for invasive ventilation were D-dimer (OR: 8.744), hypernatremia (OR: 4.532), PCT (OR: 3.829), neutrophilia (OR: 3.804), leukocytosis (OR: 3.330), and serum urea (OR: 3.312). Kaplan-Meier curves conclude total leucocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, urea, creatinine, sodium, CRP, LDH, PCT, and D-dimer all significantly contributing to an early death. Conclusion The most significant marker for mortality was D-dimer, followed by serum sodium, urea/creatinine, LDH, ICU stay, and invasive ventilation.","output":"Role of Biochemical Markers in Invasive Ventilation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients: Multinomial Regression and Survival Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the first point of contact for the virus to recognize and bind to host receptors, is the focus of biomedical research seeking to effectively prevent and treat coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Studies have been shown that different expression cell systems alter protein glycosylation of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase in the influenza virus. However, it is not clear whether the cellular system affects the spike protein glycosylation. In this work, we investigated the effect of an expression system on the glycosylation of the spike glycoprotein and its receptor-binding domain. We found that there are significant differences in the glycosylation and glycans attached at each glycosite of the spike glycoprotein obtained from different expression cells. Since glycosylation at the binding site and adjacent amino acids affects the interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the host cell receptor, we recognize that caution should be taken when selecting an expression system to develop inhibitors, antibodies, and vaccines.","output":"Impact of Expressing Cells on Glycosylation and Glycan of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we examine the direction of causal relationships among migration-related fear, economic policy uncertainty, tourism, and economic growth in the panel economies of France, Germany, the UK, and the USA.

With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. MHC tetramers were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead 'left out' to serve as a test of whether T-REX identifies biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4+ T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by &#8805;95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots with virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either after clearing the infection (Day 28) or samples taken prior to infection (Day 0). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-REX analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context.","output":"Unsupervised machine learning reveals key immune cell subsets in COVID-19, rhinovirus infection, and cancer therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objective To describe the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We recruited 73 patients with COVID-19 [49 men and 24 women; average age: 58.36 years (SD: 14.31)] admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from December 30, 2019 to February 16, 2020. Demographics, underlying diseases, and laboratory test results on admission were collected and analyzed. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Results The non-survivors were older (65.46 [SD 9.74] vs 46.23 [12.01]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses. Non-survivors tend to develop more severe lymphopenia, with higher C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and hs-Troponin I(hs-TnI) levels. Patients with elevated hs-TnI levels on admission had shorter duration from symptom onset to death. Increased hs-TnI level was related to dismal prognosis. Death risk increased by 20.8% when the hs-TnI level increased by one unit. After adjusting for inflammatory or coagulation index, the independent predictive relationship between hs-TnI and death disappeared. Conclusions Cardiac injury may occur at the early stage of COVID-19, which is associated with high mortality.

Clinical Case: A 64-year-old man (BMI 25kg/m2, weight 75kg) with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (on metformin and sitagliptin; glycated haemoglobin 51 mmol/mol, n<42mmol/mol), hypertension, G6PD deficiency and gout was admitted to hospital with COVID pneumonitis and type 1 respiratory failure giving 5 days history of cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and tiredness. As per hospital guidelines, the patient was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate 625mg three times daily and doxycycline 100mg once daily. Hydroxycholoroquine was not given in view of G6PD deficiency. There was no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis and a short-acting insulin sliding scale was initiated at 2U/hr. Continuous positive pressure ventilation was offered for next 72 hours, however the patient failed to improve and required transfer to intensive care unit for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Computer tomography scan of pulmonary artery excluded embolism. The patient was fed via nasogastric tube post intubation. On day 8, the patient experienced a sudden drop in haemoglobin levels from 132 g/dl on day 1 to 68 g/dl, requiring multiple blood transfusions. The blood results demonstrated evidence of haemolysis with a rise in total and direct bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The peripheral blood smear showed numerous bite cells with polychromasia suggesting an acute haemolytic crisis in the context of G6PD deficiency. A medication review revealed no evidence of drug-induced haemolysis. Later the patient was started on dexamethasone 6mg once daily (day 11) and on remdesivir 100mg once daily (day 15). During this time, the patients insulin infusion requirements had progressively increased from 2U/hr to 8U/hr (equivalent to 192 units/24 hr). On day 22, the patients clinical condition deteriorated with septicaemia requiring extended course of antibiotics. At this time, continuous insulin infusion was stopped and intermediate acting insulin (insulatard 36U twice daily; later increased to 48U twice daily) was started. In the next 10 days, the patient made good clinical recovery from sepsis with stable haemoglobin and blood sugar levels. He was extubated and transferred for rehabilitation. The patient was successfully weaned off insulin in the community with optimal diabetes control.

Quality FFRs for use during outbreaks remains a priority to protect frontline and essential workers. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of three relatively inexpensive methods to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and ensuring respirator performance. Methods: Seven FFRs inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 were decontaminated with moist heat incubation (MHI), vapourised hydrogen peroxide (VHP), and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). G.stearothermophilus bioindicator was used as a control. FFR integrity, efficiency and user fit were assessed on 27 participants for 30 decontamination cycles. Ethical clearance was acquired from the University of the Witwatersrand (M200684). Results: Most participants failed fit testing for KN95 irrespective of method used except for two individuals. Participants completed more cycles after UVGI compared to VHP decontamination. Only KN95 failed filtration post-MHI, VHP and UVGI treatment. A  3 log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 was achieved using UVGI for worn FFRs (Greenline 5200 FFP2 and Makrite 9500 N95 using MHI;3M 8810SSA FFP2 using VHP;Greenline 5200 FFP2). UVGI and VHP methods achieved a 6 log reduction of G.stearothermophilus. Conclusion: Some FFRs could withstand 30 cycles of UVGI and VHP processing without diminishing filtration efficiency or fit.

In contrast to the classical PII encoding genes, in L. hilgardii genome the gene for PII homologue is located within the potABCD operon, encoding the ABC transporter for polyamines. Based on the unique genetic context and low sequence identity with genes of any other so-far characterized PII subfamilies, we termed this gene potN (Pot-protein, Nucleotide-binding). The second specific feature of L. hilgardii genome is that many genes encoding the proteins with similar function are present in two copies, while with low mutual identity. Thus, L. hilgardii LMG 7934 genome carries two genes of glutamine synthetase with 55% identity.

This will assess frailty, quality of life and medical complications.Our primary analysis will be short-term and long-term mortality by CFS, adjusted for age (18-64, 65-80 and >80) and gender. We will carry out a secondary analysis of the primary outcome by including additional clinical mediators which are determined statistically important using a likelihood ratio test. All analyses will be presented as crude and adjusted HR and OR with associated 95% CIs and p values.

We, therefore, aimed to examine Urinary C-Peptide to Creatinine Ratio levels among groups of people with different types of diabetes in a sub-Saharan African population. METHODS: A total of 47 adults with diabetes; 10 with type 1 diabetes, 26 with type 2 diabetes, 11 with ketosis-prone diabetes, and 22 healthy control individuals, were recruited from Yaound Central Hospital in Cameroon. Fasting blood glucose and C-peptide were measured in venous blood and urine. Stimulated Urinary C-Peptide to Creatinine Ratio was determined in all subjects after ingestion of a standardized mixed meal. We compared the stimulated Urinary C-peptide to Creatinine Ration concentration in subjects with type 1 diabetes to the other groups. RESULTS: The basal C-peptide and HOMA- were lower in T1D than in the T2D group [median 57 (34, 69) vs. 398 (335, 502) pmol/l; p  0.001] and [median 3.0 (1.63, 5.25) vs. 30.6 (17.94, 45.03); p < 0.001] respectively. Also, basal C-peptide and HOMA- were lower in T1D than in those with KPD [median 57 (34, 69) vs. 330 (265, 478) pmol/l; p = 0.003] and [median 3.0 (1.63, 5.25) vs. 47.1 (16.2, 63.1), p = 0.001] respectively. Basal C-peptide was not different between participants with T2D and KPD; 398 (335, 502) vs. 330 (265, 478) pmol/l, p = 0.19. Stimulated UCPCR was lower in T1D compared to T2D, KPD and control participants; [median 0.29 (0.14, 0.68) vs. 0.89 (0.40, 1.69) nmol/moll; p = 0.009], [median 0.29 (0.14, 0.68) vs. 1.33 (0.84, 1.59) nmol/mol; p = 0.006] and [median 0.29 (0.14, 0.68) vs. 1.21 (0.85, 1.21) nmol/mol; p = 0.005] respectively. However, stimulated UCPCR was similar between the T2D and KPD study participants; 0.89 (0.40, 1.69) vs. 1.33 (0.84, 1.59) nmol/mol, p = 0.36. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulated Urinary C-Peptide to Creatinine Ratio (UCPCR) is lower in participants with type 1 diabetes compared to those with other types of diabetes in this population. This means stimulated UCPCR could potentially differentiate type 1 diabetes from other diabetes types among people with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa.","output":"Stimulated UCPCR Levels Are Lower in People With Type 1 Diabetes Than in Other Diabetes Types in Sub-Saharan Africa: Results From a Preliminary Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the effects of social distancing in controlling the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic using a simple susceptible-infected-removed epidemic model.

Presently, there is a paucity of studies that have utilized interactive e-lectures as a model for remote flipped learning. Objectives: To compare educational outcomes for the remote interactive flipped e-learning (iFEEL) activity versus paper-based in-class group learning (PICkLE). Methods: During the spring 2021 semester, tutorials in pharmaceutical quality control and good manufacturing practice were remotely delivered to students by two different approaches: PICkLE and iFEEL. In the latter activity, interactive e-lectures were software-designed and included several audiovisual enhanced illustrations to encourage students to interact with the lecture material prior to attending the virtual class. The class time was reserved for in-class quizzes and discussion. Mean exam scores were compared and voluntary questionnaires were distributed among the participating students as well as healthcare faculty members in 29 Saudi universities. Data from the remotely-delivered course was compared with data from previous course offerings (2018C2020) that used the live PICkLE method. Results: The mean score of post-lecture tests significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared to pre-lecture tests in remote PICkLE and iFEEL, respectively. iFEEL activity showed higher mean post-tests score (95.2%) compared to live PICkLE (90.2%, p = 0.08) and remote PICkLE (93.5%, p = 0.658). Mean comprehensive exam scores increased from 83.8% for remote PICkLE to 89.2% for iFEEL (p = 0.449). On average, 92% of students and 85% of faculty members reported positive feedback on the five quality attributes of the e-lecture. Over 75% of students preferred the iFEEL over PICkLE activity for future course offerings and 84% of faculty members recommend the integration of interactive e-lectures in their future courses.

METHODS: A telephone interview study was conducted at the end of April 2020. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was chosen to identify themes and concepts and a semi-structured interview guide was developed. The analysis was structured according to constructs from the theory of planned behaviour, including attitudes to breast cancer screening, norms and motivations to comply with breast cancer screening, perceived control and anticipated regret. RESULTS: Interviews were carried out with 33 women aged 50-69 (mean 62) years. The women felt that screening was of secondary importance during the height of the pandemic and they felt low perceived control over transportation to the screening clinic and over the screening situation itself, where social distancing was impossible. They perceived messages from the authorities as conflicting regarding the request for social distancing and a lack of recommendations about using face masks at the screening clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Women who postponed or cancelled breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic felt that public recommendations appeared contradictory. Uncertainty about the 'new norm(al)' of COVID-19 made them stay at home, although the screening clinics remained open. The findings point to the importance of addressing perceived inconsistency between recommendations from the World Health Organization and the national management of these recommendations, and to secure univocal information from the authorities about the recommended use of healthcare services in a time of crisis.","output":"Balancing risks: Qualitative study of attitudes, motivations and intentions about attending for mammography during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: People with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are more likely to experience loneliness, have poorer diets and be less physically active than people without AMD.

The objective of this study was to use toxicogenomics in the context of human health risk assessment. We explore the utility of toxicogenomics in risk assessment, using published gene expression data from C57BL/6 mice exposed to 18, 54 and 162 g Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles (CBNP). Analysis of CBNP-perturbed pathways, networks and transcription factors revealed concomitant changes in predicted phenotypes (e.g., pulmonary inflammation and genotoxicity), that correlated with dose and time. Benchmark doses (BMDs) for apical endpoints were comparable to minimum BMDs for relevant pathway-specific expression changes. Comparison to inflammatory lung disease models (i.e., allergic airway inflammation, bacterial infection and tissue injury and fibrosis) and human disease profiles revealed that induced gene expression changes in Printex 90 exposed mice were similar to those typical for pulmonary injury and fibrosis. Very similar fibrotic pathways were perturbed in CBNP-exposed mice and human fibrosis disease models. Our synthesis demonstrates how toxicogenomic profiles may be used in human health risk assessment of nanoparticles and constitutes an important step forward in the ultimate recognition of toxicogenomic endpoints in human health risk. As our knowledge of molecular pathways, doseCresponse characteristics and relevance to human disease continues to grow, we anticipate that toxicogenomics will become increasingly useful in assessing chemical toxicities and in human health risk assessment.","output":"Gene expression profiling to identify potentially relevant disease outcomes and support human health risk assessment for carbon black nanoparticle exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education: The pathogenetic mechanism of renal involvement in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is still unclear.

All of these viruses, which are responsible for causing acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), are highly contagious in nature and/or have caused high mortalities. The recently emerged COVID-19 disease is a highly transmittable viral infection caused by another zoonotic novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Similar to the other two coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also likely to have originated from bats, which have been serving as established reservoirs for various pathogenic coronaviruses. Although, it is still unknown how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from bats to humans, the rapid human-to-human transmission has been confirmed widely. The disease first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread across the globe, infected 48,539,872 people, and caused 1,232,791 deaths in 215 countries, and the infection is still spreading at the time of manuscript preparation.

Decision regret is one of the most prevalent outcomes reported by informal caregivers who have made such decisions. OBJECTIVE: To examine levels of decision regret and its predictors among informal caregivers who have made health-related decisions for a loved one. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to November 2018. Participants were informal caregivers, and the outcome was decision regret as measured using the Decision Regret Scale (DRS). REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We performed a narrative synthesis and presented predictors of decision regret using a conceptual framework, dividing the predictors into decision antecedents, decision-making process, and decision outcomes. RESULTS: We included 16 of 3003 studies identified. Most studies (n = 13) reported a mean DRS score ranging from 7.0 to 32.3 out of 100 (median = 14.3).

It was first identified in Wuhan City in China in December 2019. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the top 15 countries with spatial mapping of the confirmed cases. A comparison was done between the identified top 15 countries for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and an advanced autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used for predicting the COVID-19 disease spread trajectories for the next 2 months. METHODS: The comparison of recent cumulative and predicted cases was done for the top 15 countries with confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. The spatial map is useful to identify the intensity of COVID-19 infections in the top 15 countries and the continents. The recent reported data for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the last 3 months was represented and compared between the top 15 infected countries. The advanced ARIMA model was used for predicting future data based on time series data. The ARIMA model provides a weight to past values and error values to correct the model prediction, so it is better than other basic regression and exponential methods. The comparison of recent cumulative and predicted cases was done for the top 15 countries with confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. RESULTS: The top 15 countries with a high number of confirmed cases were stratified to include the data in a mathematical model. The identified top 15 countries with cumulative cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19 were compared. The United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, China, and Russia saw a relatively fast spread of the disease. There was a fast recovery ratio in China, Switzerland, Germany, Iran, and Brazil, and a slow recovery ratio in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Russia, and Italy. There was a high death rate ratio in Italy and the United Kingdom and a lower death rate ratio in Russia, Turkey, China, and the United States. The ARIMA model was used to predict estimated confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the top 15 countries from April 24 to July 7, 2020. Its value is represented with 95%, 80%, and 70% confidence interval values. The validation of the ARIMA model was done using the Akaike information criterion value; its values were about 20, 14, and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19, respectively, which represents acceptable results. CONCLUSIONS: The observed predicted values showed that the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries will double in all the observed countries except China, Switzerland, and Germany. It was also observed that the death and recovery rates were rose faster when compared to confirmed cases over the next 2 months. The associated mortality rate will be much higher in the United States, Spain, and Italy followed by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

To date, symptomatic supportive care has been the most common treatment. It has been reported that the mechanism of COVID-19 is related to cytokine storms and subsequent immunogenic damage, especially damage to the endothelium and alveolar membrane. Vitamin C (VC), also known as L-ascorbic acid, has been shown to have antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. A high dose of intravenous VC (HIVC) was proven to block several key components of cytokine storms, and HIVC showed safety and varying degrees of efficacy in clinical trials conducted on patients with bacterial-induced sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, we hypothesise that HIVC could be added to the treatment of ARDS and multiorgan dysfunction related to COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The investigators designed a multicentre prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial that is planned to recruit 308 adults diagnosed with COVID-19 and transferred into the intensive care unit. Participants will randomly receive HIVC diluted in sterile water or placebo for 7 days once enrolled. Patients with a history of VC allergy, end-stage pulmonary disease, advanced malignancy or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency will be excluded. The primary outcome is ventilation-free days within 28 observational days. This is one of the first clinical trials applying HIVC to treat COVID-19, and it will provide credible efficacy and safety data.

Clinical sensitivity was estimated with the SARS--CoV--2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test as the gold standard using manufacturer recommended cutoff. Specificity was estimated using pre-pandemic sera samples. The median time between positive PCR test results and antibody tests was 21 weeks. Measures of concordance were calculated against the microneutralization test (MNA).Sensitivity was equal to 91.1% (95% confidence intervbal [CI]: 78.8-97.5), 90% (95% CI: 76.4-96.4), and 63.1% (95% CI [50.2-74.7]) for ELISA Coronapass, ELISA Vector-Best, and CMIA Abbott, respectively.

We also estimated the risk of hospitalisation by vaccination status. MethodsWe conducted a cohort study on laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway, diagnosed between 3 May and 15 August 2021. We calculated adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable binomial regression, accounting for variant, vaccination status, demographic characteristics, week of sampling and underlying comorbidities. ResultsWe included 7,977 cases of Delta and 12,078 cases of Alpha. Overall, 347 (1.7%) cases were hospitalised. The aRR of hospitalisation for Delta compared to Alpha was 0.97 (95%CI 0.76-1.23). Partially vaccinated cases had a 72% reduced risk of hospitalisation (95%CI 59%-82%), and fully vaccinated cases had a 76% reduced risk (95%CI 61%-85%), compared to unvaccinated cases. ConclusionsWe found no difference in the risk of hospitalisation for Delta cases compared to Alpha cases in Norway. Further research from a wide variety of settings is needed to better understand the association between the Delta variant and severe disease.

(Shull's colpopexy) in 2000, is one of the most frequently performed non-mesh pelvic floor reconstructive surgical procedures. Despite its excellent anatomical outcomes, ureteral injury and difficulty in uterosacral ligament detection (especially in patients with severe POP) are typical issues with this procedure. METHOD This video demonstrates the procedure in a 58-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 2, with POP-Q stage II uterine prolapse and stage I cystocele. At the beginning of the operation, the bilateral uterosacral ligaments were confirmed and separated from the ureters after entering the retroperitoneal space. The inferior hypogastric nerve and pelvic nerve plexus were also separated from the uterosacral ligament. After total laparoscopic hysterectomy, three ipsilateral delayed absorbable monofilament sutures were placed between the uterosacral ligament and the vaginal cuff. Retroperitonealization was then performed using a continuous suture with closure of the Douglas pouch. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic Shull's colpopexy for POP is a secure procedure with the advantages of laparoscopy (magnification and sharing the operative field). This may become one of the most useful operations for apical support as native tissue repair.","output":"Laparoscopic fixation of the vaginal cuff to the uterosacral ligaments at the time of hysterectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adult respiratory distress syndrome is a life-threatening complication from severe COVID-19 infection resulting in severe hypoxic respiratory failure. Strategies at improving oxygenation have evolved over the course of the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Although non-invasive respiratory support reduces the need for intubation, a significant number of patients with COVID-19 progress to invasive mechanical ventilation. Once intubated, a lung protective ventilation strategy should be employed that limits tidal volumes to 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight and employs sufficient positive end-expiratory pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the fraction of inspired oxygen. Intermittent prone positioning is effective at improving survival, and there is a growing body of evidence that it can be safely performed in spontaneously breathing patients to reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators have not been shown to improve survival or cost-effectiveness in COVID-19 and should be used selectively.

The evaluation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line and three in vitro spectrophotometric assays were performed to determine the antioxidant activity of the samples. Characterization of coffee composition was also assessed through a Q-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis. The results highlighted that the levels of polyphenols in the digested coffee brews were higher than those of the non-digested ones. All assayed samples decreased the levels of intracellular ROS when compared to untreated cells, while digested coffee samples exhibited higher antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content than not-digested coffee samples. Digested coffee samples showed a higher reduction in interleukin-6 levels than the not-digested samples in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated HT-29 cells treated for 48 h and fewer cytotoxic effects in the MTT assay. Overall, our findings suggest that coffee may exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and the digestion process may be able to release compounds with higher bioactivity.","output":"Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Coffee Brew Evaluated after Simulated Gastrointestinal Digestion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes more economic losses in the swine industry than any other virus. This study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of PRRSV to assist in evaluating the effectiveness of PRRS vaccines. Twenty-eight samples from clinical cases were collected from 19 farms in seven provinces of Vietnam in 2021. Full-length PRRSV ORF5 genes from the 19 samples were amplified, sequenced, and compared to the corresponding sequences of referenced PRRSV strains from Genbank. The genetic analysis showed that 12 isolates were the highly pathogenic PRRSV subtype (HPPRRSV) lineage 8, sublineage 8.7; six isolates were the classical North American PRRSV subtype (US-PRRSV), NADC-like group, lineage 1, sublineage 1.4, which were reported in Vietnam for the first time; and the final isolate was a vaccine-like strain. The field isolates of HP-PRRSV had relatively higher genetic diversity with US-PRRSV vaccine strains (84.0C94.5%) than HP-PRRSV vaccine strains (95.3C98.6%). Meanwhile, the six NADC-like isolates had low nucleotide similarity with US-PRRSV and HP-PRRSV vaccine strains (83.4C85.4% and 83.2C84.0%, respectively). Many amino acid substitutions were found in antigenic regions of GP5 involved in response to early antibody production, neutralizing antibodies, and viral immune evasion between these field strains and PRRSV vaccine strains. These findings provide insights into the molecular characteristics, genetic diversity, antigenicity, and evolution of PRRSV strains in Vietnam and postulate a compelling explanation for the limitations of current vaccination efforts.

Molecular tests that detect viral RNAs or antigens will be unable to rise to this challenge unless testing capacity increases by at least an order of magnitude while decreasing turnaround times. Here, we evaluate an alternative strategy based on the monitoring of olfactory dysfunction, a symptom identified in 76C83% of SARS-CoV-2 infectionsincluding those with no other symptomswhen a standardized olfaction test is used. We model how screening for olfactory dysfunction, with reflexive molecular tests, could be beneficial in reducing community spread of SARS-CoV-2 by varying testing frequency and the prevalence, duration, and onset time of olfactory dysfunction. We find that monitoring olfactory dysfunction could reduce spread via regular screening, and could reduce risk when used at point-of-entry for single-day events. In light of these estimated impacts, and because olfactory tests can be mass produced at low cost and self-administered, we suggest that screening for olfactory dysfunction could be a high impact and cost-effective method for broad COVID-19 screening and surveillance.","output":"Modeling the effectiveness of olfactory testing to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Large-scale multisite trauma registries with broad geographic coverage in low-income countries are rare. This lack of systematic trauma data impedes effective policy responses. METHODS: All patients presenting with trauma at 10 hospitals in Malawi from September 2018 to March 2020 were enrolled in a prospective registry. Using data from 49,241 cases, we analyze prevalence, causes, and distribution of trauma in adult patients, and timeliness of transport to health facilities and treatment. RESULTS: Falls were the most common mechanism of injury overall, but road traffic crashes (RTCs) were the most common mechanism of serious injury, accounting for (48%) of trauma admissions. This pattern was consistent across all central and district hospitals, with only one hospital recording < 40% of admissions due to RTCs. 49% of RTC-linked trauma patients were not in motorized vehicles at the time of the crash. 84% of passengers in cars/trucks/buses and 48% of drivers of cars/trucks/buses from RTCs did not wear seatbelts, and 52% of motorcycle riders (driver and passenger) did not wear helmets. For all serious trauma cases (defined as requiring hospital admission), median time to hospital arrival was 5 h 20 min (IQR 1 h 20 min, 24 h). For serious trauma cases that presented on the same day that trauma occurred, median time to hospital arrival was 2 h (IQR 1 h, 11 h). Significant predictors of hospital admission include being involved in an RTC, age > 55, Glasgow Coma Score < 12, and presentation at hospital on a weekend. CONCLUSIONS: RTCs make up almost half of hospitalized trauma cases in this setting, are equally common in referral and district hospitals, and are an important predictor of injury severity. Pedestrians and cyclists are just as affected as those in vehicles. Many of those injured in vehicles do not take adequate safety precautions. Most trauma patients, including those with serious injuries, do not receive prompt medical attention. Greater attention to safety for both motorized and especially non-motorized road users, and more timely, higher quality emergency medical services, are important policy priorities for Malawi and other developing countries with high burdens of RTC trauma.

We present a mechanism based on animal studies, clinical data, and epidemiological data by which protein-energy status in the acute stroke and immediate postinjury periods may affect outcome by regulating glutathione (GSH), a key component of antioxidant defense. As cysteine is the limiting amino acid for GSH synthesis, the GSH concentration of a number of nonneural tissues has been shown to be decreased by fasting, low-protein diets, or diets limiting in sulfur amino acids. The mechanism may also be relevant in brain since GSH in some brain regions is responsive to dietary sulfur amino acid supply and to the pro-cysteine drug, L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate. The latter is an intracellular cysteine delivery system used to overcome the toxicity associated with cysteine supplementation. These findings may provide the mechanism to explain both the inverse correlation between dietary protein and stroke mortality and the documented association between suboptimal protein-energy status and diminished functional status following a stroke. Future investigations should examine the role of nutritional intervention in neuroprotective strategies aimed at improving stroke outcome. Pharmacological interventions such as L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate should be investigated in animal models of stroke, as well as the impact of nutritional status on the response to these agents. Finally, micronutrient deficiencies that may accompany protein-energy malnutrition, such as selenium, should also be investigated for their role in antioxidant defense in cerebral ischemia.","output":"Nutritional regulation of glutathione in stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loss and changes in taste and smell are well-reported symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus targets cells for entry by high affinity binding of its spike protein to cell-surface angiotensin-converting enzyme- 2 (ACE2). It was not known whether ACE2 is expressed on taste receptor cells (TRCs) nor if TRCs are infected directly. Using an in-situ hybridization (ISH) probe and an antibody specific to ACE2, it seems evident that ACE2 is present on a subpopulation of specialized TRCs, namely, PLC(2) positive, Type II cells in taste buds in taste papillae. Fungiform papillae (FP) of a SARS-CoV-2+ patient exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including taste changes, were biopsied. Based on ISH, replicating SARS-CoV-2 was present in Type II cells of this patient. Therefore, taste Type II cells provide a portal for viral entry that predicts vulnerabilities to SARS-CoV-2 in the oral cavity. The continuity and cell turnover of the FP taste stem cell layer of the patient were disrupted during infection and had not fully recovered 6 weeks post symptom onset. Another patient suffering post-COVID-19 taste disturbances also had disrupted stem cells. These results indicate that a COVID-19 patient who experienced taste changes had replicating virus in their taste buds and that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in deficient stem cell turnover needed for differentiation into TRCs.","output":"Human Taste Cells Express ACE2: a Portal for SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The U-Net architecture, built upon the fully convolutional network, has proven to be effective in biomedical image segmentation. However, U-Net applies skip connections to merge semantically different low- and high-level convolutional features, resulting in not only blurred feature maps, but also over- and under-segmented target regions. To address these limitations, we propose a simple, yet effective end-to-end depthwise encoder-decoder fully convolutional network architecture, called Sharp U-Net, for binary and multi-class biomedical image segmentation. The key rationale of Sharp U-Net is that instead of applying a plain skip connection, a depthwise convolution of the encoder feature map with a sharpening kernel filter is employed prior to merging the encoder and decoder features, thereby producing a sharpened intermediate feature map of the same size as the encoder map. Using this sharpening filter layer, we are able to not only fuse semantically less dissimilar features, but also to smooth out artifacts throughout the network layers during the early stages of training. Our extensive experiments on six datasets show that the proposed Sharp U-Net model consistently outperforms or matches the recent state-of-the-art baselines in both binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, while adding no extra learnable parameters. Furthermore, Sharp U-Net outperforms baselines that have more than three times the number of learnable parameters.","output":"Sharp U-Net: Depthwise convolutional network for biomedical image segmentation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge of the host response to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 remains limited, hindering the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies During the course of a viral infection, host cells release exosomes and other extracellular vesicles carrying viral and host components that can modulate the immune response The present study used a shotgun proteomic approach to map the host circulating exosomes' response to SARS-CoV-2 infection We investigated how SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates exosome content, exosomes' involvement in disease progression, and the potential use of plasma exosomes as biomarkers of disease severity A proteomic analysis of patient-derived exosomes identified several molecules involved in the immune response, inflammation, and activation of the coagulation and complement pathways, which are the main mechanisms of COVID-19-associated tissue damage and multiple organ dysfunctions In addition, several potential biomarkers-such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, complement C1r subcomponent and serum amyloid P-component-were shown to have a diagnostic feature presenting an area under the curve (AUC) of almost 1 Proteins correlating with disease severity were also detected Moreover, for the first time, we identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the exosomal cargo, which suggests that the virus might use the endocytosis route to spread infection Our findings indicate circulating exosomes' significant contribution to several processes-such as inflammation, coagulation, and immunomodulation-during SARS-CoV-2 infection The study's data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD021144","output":"Circulating Exosomes Are Strongly Involved in SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physics lab instructors were forced to adapt their courses in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We previously demonstrated that patients with H5N1 disease had unusually high serum levels of IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10). Furthermore, when compared with human influenza virus subtype H1N1, the H5N1 viruses in 1997 (A/Hong Kong/483/97) (H5N1/97) were more potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-a) and chemokines (e.g. IP-10) from primary human macrophages in vitro, which suggests that cytokines dysregulation may play a role in pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. Since respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target cell for replication of influenza viruses, it is pertinent to investigate the cytokine induction profile of H5N1 viruses in these cells. METHODS: We used quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA to compare the profile of cytokine and chemokine gene expression induced by H5N1 viruses A/HK/483/97 (H5N1/97), A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04 (both H5N1/04) with that of human H1N1 virus in human primary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. RESULTS: We demonstrated that in comparison to human H1N1 viruses, H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses were more potent inducers of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in primary human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Recent H5N1 viruses from Vietnam (H5N1/04) appeared to be even more potent at inducing IP-10 than H5N1/97 virus. CONCLUSION: The H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human respiratory epithelial cells than subtype H1N1 virus.

In this study, we investigate changes in drug use patterns, utilization of NEP associated health services, COVID-19 health literacy and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among NEP clients in Stockholm during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: NEP visits and services provided (needles/syringes, HIV and hepatitis C tests and treatment, naloxone distributed) and overall mortality among NEP clients between January 1 and October 31, 2020, were used for trend analyses in comparison with corresponding 2019 data. Between July 27 and October 2, 2020, NEP clients (n = 232) responded to a 27 item COVID-19 Health Literacy Questionnaire. SARS CoV-2 IgG antibody tests (n = 779) were performed between June 15 and October 31, 2020. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic number of clients, client visits, naloxone distribution and HCV tests remained stable compared to 2019, while distribution of needles/syringes increased (p < 0.0001); number of HIV tests and HCV treatments decreased (p < 0.05); and mortality decreased (< 0.01). Overall, the level of health literacy concerning transmission routes and protective measures was high. SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was 5.4% (95% CI 4.0-7.2). CONCLUSIONS: The Stockholm NEP managed to maintain a high level of clients and services during the pandemic. In general, COVID-19 health literacy was adequate and the overall SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was low compared to the general population, which highlights a need for prioritized and targeted COVID-19 vaccination among PWID.","output":"Health literacy and changes in pattern of drug use among participants at the Stockholm Needle Exchange Program during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are many unknowns for pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Clinical experience of pregnancies complicated with infection by other coronaviruses e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, has led to pregnant woman being considered potentially vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Physiological changes during pregnancy have a significant impact on the immune system, respiratory system, cardiovascular function, and coagulation. These may have positive or negative effects on COVID-19 disease progression. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy remains to be determined, and a concerted, global effort is required to determine the effects on implantation, fetal growth and development, labor, and neonatal health. Asymptomatic infection presents a further challenge regarding service provision, prevention, and management. Besides the direct impacts of the disease, a plethora of indirect consequences of the pandemic adversely affect maternal health, including reduced access to reproductive health services, increased mental health strain, and increased socioeconomic deprivation.

Here we analyzed a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of early SARS-CoV-2 infection in a humanized in vitro model, to elucidate key mechanisms by which the virus triggers a cell-systems-level response in the bronchial epithelium. We find that SARS-CoV-2 virus preferentially enters the tissue via ciliated cell precursors, giving rise to a population of infected mature ciliated cells, which signal to basal cells, inducing further rapid differentiation. This feed-forward loop of infection is mitigated by further cell-cell communication, before interferon signaling begins at three days post-infection. These findings suggest hijacking by the virus of potentially beneficial tissue repair mechanisms, possibly exacerbating the outcome.

This can be further generalized for other socially connected platforms involving information exchange. In our research, we have proposed a diffusion methodology for tracking the rate with which information spread over underlying social interaction structure, with variation in time and other social parameters.

With the immediate need for remote care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care systems have rapidly incorporated digital technologies to support the delivery of remote care options, including medication treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). In responding to the opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials and scientific communities strongly support and advocate for greater use of TM-based medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to improve access to care and have suggested that broad use of TM during the pandemic should be sustained. Nevertheless, research on the implementation and effectiveness of TM-based MOUD has been limited. To address this knowledge gap, the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) funded (via the NIH HEAL Initiative) a study on Rural Expansion of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (Rural MOUD; CTN-0102) to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of adding TM-based MOUD to rural primary care for expanding access to MOUD. In preparation for this large-scale, randomized controlled trial incorporating TM in rural primary care, a feasibility study is being conducted to develop and pilot test implementation procedures. In this commentary, we share some of our experiences, which include several challenges, during the initial two-month period of the feasibility study phase. While these challenges could be due, at least in part, to adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic and new workflows to accommodate the study, they are notable and could have a substantial impact on the larger, planned pragmatic trial and on TM-based MOUD more broadly. Challenges include low rates of identification of risk for OUD from screening, low rates of referral to TM, digital device and internet access issues, workflow and capacity barriers, and insurance coverage. These challenges also highlight the lack of empirical guidance for best TM practice and quality remote care models. With TM expanding rapidly, understanding implementation and demonstrating what TM approaches are effective are critical for ensuring the best care for persons with OUD.","output":"Is telemedicine the answer to rural expansion of medication treatment for opioid use disorder?

Although social distancing regulations were quickly strengthened, the outbreak continued to grow, causing increasing delays in tracing and testing. Further regulations were introduced, plus targeted testing services for at-risk groups. Estimating the impact of individual NPIs could provide lessons about how outbreaks can be controlled without radical lockdown. However, the changing delays in confirmation time challenge current modelling methods. We used a novel approach aimed at disentangling and quantifying the effects of individual interventions. METHODS: We incorporated the causes of delays in tracing and testing (i.e. load-efficiency relationship) and the consequences from such delays (i.e. the proportion of un-traced cases and the proportion of traced-cases with confirmation delay) into a deterministic transmission model, which was fitted to the daily number of cases with and without an epi?link (an indication of being contact-traced). The effect of each NPI was then calculated. FINDINGS: The model estimated that after earlier relaxation of regulations, Re rose from 0.7 to 3.2. Restoration of social distancing to the previous state only reduced Re to 1.3, because of increased delay in confirmation caused by load on the contact-tracing system. However, Re decreased by 20.3% after the introduction of targeted testing and by 17.5% after extension of face-mask rules, reducing Re to 0.9 and suppressing the outbreak. The output of the model without incorporation of delay failed to capture important features of transmission and Re. INTERPRETATION: Changing delay in confirmation has a significant impact on disease transmission and estimation of transmissibility. This leads to a clear recommendation that delay should be monitored and mitigated during outbreaks, and that delay dynamics should be incorporated into models to assess the effects of NPIs.

It was not until the onset of COVID-19 that a disruption in our lifetimes achieved a global magnitude. In order to contain the pandemic, governments around the world resorted to closing borders, shutting down manufacturing plants, and imposing lockdowns, which resulted in disrupted production capabilities and weakened consumer spending. The effects of these measures have been clearly visible in global transport networks, where disruptions ripple through the system and serve as a precursor to the disruptions in the broader economy. In this study, we use liner shipping schedule cancellations, a form of serious transport network disruption, as distress signals of the pandemic's impact on global supply chains. Our study applies a three-stage approach and provides insights into operator behaviors when under distress. We show that the pandemic challenged service network integrity and that network disruptions first clustered in Asia before rippling along main trade routes.

Small molecules targeting the angiogenic process may be an effective anti-GBM therapeutic strategy. We previously demonstrated that RhoJ promoted the progression and invasion of GBM. RhoJ has also been shown to be expressed in endothelial cells and plays an important role in regulating endothelial cell migration and tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the role and mechanism of actions of RhoJ in GBM angiogenesis. We analyzed the expression of RhoJ in different grade gliomas and investigated its role in GBM angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. Furtherly, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to identify the molecular mechanism of RhoJ in regulating endothelial cell behavior and GBM angiogenesis. Here, we found that silencing RhoJ resulted in inhibition of HUVEC cell migration and blood vessel formation. Overexpression of RhoJ promoted the expression of CD31, EpCAM and moesin, suggesting RhoJ facilitated angiogenesis and the malignant progression of GBM. RNA-seq data showed that VEGF/TNF signaling pathway positively regulated RhoJ. The expression levels of RhoJ was upregulated with the stimulation of VEGF, and reduced by the treatment of JNK inhibitor SP600125. It was also found that the activity of PAK-BRAF-ERK was down-regulated upon RhoJ and JNK knockdown. In conclusion, these results suggested that RhoJ plays an essential role in regulating GBM angiogenesis through the JNK/VEGFR2-PAK-ERK signaling pathway and there might exist a VEGF-JNK/ERK-VEGF circuitry. Thus, RhoJ may be a candidate therapeutic target for anti-angiogenesis treatment in GBM.","output":"RhoJ facilitates angiogenesis in glioblastoma via JNK/VEGFR2 mediated activation of PAK and ERK signaling pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade, the growing interest in targeted lung cancer therapy has guided researchers toward the cutting edge of controlled drug delivery, particularly magnetic particle targeting. Targeting of tissues by magnetic particles has tackled several limitations of traditional drug delivery methods for both cancer detection (e.g., using magnetic resonance imaging) and therapy. Delivery of magnetic particles offers the key advantage of high efficiency in the local deposition of drugs in the target tissue with the least harmful effect on other healthy tissues. This review first overviews clinical aspects of lung morphology and pathogenesis as well as clinical features of lung cancer. It is followed by reviewing the advances in using magnetic particles for diagnosis and therapy of lung cancers: (i) a combination of magnetic particle targeting with MRI imaging for diagnosis and screening of lung cancers, (ii) magnetic drug targeting (MDT) through either intravenous injection and pulmonary delivery for lung cancer therapy, and (iii) computational simulations that models new and effective approaches for magnetic particle drug delivery to the lung, all supporting improved lung cancer treatment. The review further discusses future opportunities to improve the clinical performance of MDT for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer and highlights clinical therapy application of the MDT as a new horizon to cure with minimal side effects a wide variety of lung diseases and possibly other acute respiratory syndromes (COVID-19, MERS, and SARS).","output":"Magnetic particle targeting for diagnosis and therapy of lung cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Back pain is one of the most costly disorders among the worldwide working population.

This paper presents a study protocol that aims to evaluate the relationship between peak anterior to peak posterior displacements of the center of pressure (CoP) and corresponding time from peak anterior to peak posterior displacements of the CoP after sudden external perturbations and peak force during a maximum voluntary isometric contraction of the back and hamstring muscles in physiotherapists with non-specific back pain in its early stages. Participants will complete the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire. Those that rate their back pain on the 0-10 Low Back Pain Scale in the ranges 1-3 (mild pain) and 4-6 (moderate pain) will be considered. They will undergo a perturbation-based balance test and a test of the maximal isometric strength of back muscles and hip extensors. We assume that by adding tests of reactive balance and strength of related muscle groups in the functional testing of physiotherapists, we would be able to identify back problems earlier and more efficiently and therefore address them well before chronic back disorders occur.","output":"The Relationship between Reactive Balance Control and Back and Hamstring Strength in Physiotherapists with Non-Specific Back Pain: Protocol for a Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We derive a novel hybrid approach, a combination of neural networks and inverse problem, in order to forecast COVID-19 cases, and more generally any infectious disease.

The neural network and inverse problems are used to compute the trial functions for total cases and the model parameters, respectively. The number of suspected and infected individuals can be found using the trial function of total confirmed cases. We divide the time domain into two parts, training interval (first 365/395 days) and test interval (first 366 to 395/ 396 to 450 days), and train the neural networks on the preassigned training zones. To examine the efficiency and effectiveness, we apply the proposed method to Canada, and use the Canadian publicly available database to estimate the parameters of the trial function involved with total cases. The trial functions of model parameters show that the basic reproduction number was closed to unity over a wide range, the first from 100 to 365 days of the current pandemic in Canada.

Ligusticum chuanxiong (CX) has been shown to have a certain curative effect on osteoarthritis in traditional Chinese medicine therapy. This study is based on network pharmacology and molecular docking technology to explore the potential mechanism of CX. Methods: Components of CX to treat osteoarthritis were screened in the TCMSP database and targets were predicted by the PharmMapper database, the osteoarthritis targets were collected from the GeneCards database, and intersection genes were found to be the possible targets of CX anti-OA. The STRING database and Cytoscape software were utilized for protein-protein interaction analysis and further screening of core targets. The Metascape database was used for KEGG and GO enrichment analyses. Then, the top 10 pathways were selected to construct drug-compound-target-pathway-disease network analysis. Finally, molecular docking was used to analyze the binding affinity of seven compounds with core targets and TNF-. Results: Seven compounds with 253 non-repetitive targets of CX were screened from the TCMSP database and 60 potential intersection targets of CX anti-OA were found. PPI network analysis showed that the core targets were ALB, AKT1, IGF1, CASP3, MAPK1, ANXA5, and MAPK14, while GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that the relevant biological processes involved in the treatment of osteoarthritis by CX might include the MAPK cascade and reactive oxygen species metabolic process. The KEGG pathway analysis result was mainly associated with the MAPK signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. We further docked seven ingredients with MAPK1 and MAPK14 enriched in the MAPK pathway, and TNF- as the typical inflammatory cytokine. The results also showed good binding affinity, especially FA, which may be the most important component of CX anti-OA.

This research attempts to explore COVID-19-related depression, anxiety, and stress among quarantine hotel employees in China. The mental health of quarantine hotel employees, who have faced unprecedented changes, is paramount while they provide hospitality and care for healthcare workers and quarantine guests during mandatory quarantine periods. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that applied convenience sampling to collect questionnaire samples from 170 quarantine hotel employees in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic, from May 20 to June 10, 2020. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to collect data. The study uses descriptive analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The results reveal that 43.5% of respondents report moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression; 68.2% have moderate to extremely severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.2% indicated moderate to extremely severe stress symptoms. Quarantine hotel employees who have a higher level of education are less likely to experience anxiety, and those with higher incomes are less likely to experience depression. Discussion: In order to mitigate the increasing levels of anxiety and depression among their staff, quarantine hoteliers or managers urgently need to implement mental health assistance programs, such as providing extra training in hygiene and knowledge about COVID-19, offering online counseling and psychological support services, training in positive thinking, encouraging staff to keep in touch with their personal support networks, and constructing a resilience model.","output":"Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 on Quarantine Hotel Employees in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a familial cluster of 24 individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Herpesviruses are responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from skin and mucosal lesions to blindness and life-threatening encephalitis, and some of them, such as Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and EpsteinCBarr virus (EBV), are known to be oncogenic. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that some herpesviruses may be associated with developing neurodegenerative diseases. These viruses can establish lifelong infections in the host and remain in a latent state with periodic reactivations. To achieve infection and yield new infectious viral particles, these viruses require and interact with molecular host determinants for supporting their replication and spread. Important sets of cellular factors involved in the lifecycle of herpesviruses are those participating in intracellular membrane trafficking pathways, as well as autophagic-based organelle recycling processes. These cellular processes are required by these viruses for cell entry and exit steps. Here, we review and discuss recent findings related to how herpesviruses exploit vesicular trafficking and autophagy components by using both host and viral gene products to promote the import and export of infectious viral particles from and to the extracellular environment. Understanding how herpesviruses modulate autophagy, endolysosomal and secretory pathways, as well as other prominent trafficking vesicles within the cell, could enable the engineering of novel antiviral therapies to treat these viruses and counteract their negative health effects.","output":"Modulation of Endosome Function, Vesicle Trafficking and Autophagy by Human Herpesviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conventional bidding strategies for online display ad auction heavily relies on observed performance indicators such as clicks or conversions.

TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The authors searched electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar) for studies focused on dysgeusia, ageusia, and other taste disorders and their relationship to local and systemic causes. RESULTS: The authors found pertinent literature explaining the normal physiology of taste sensation, proposals for suggested new tastes, presence of gustatory receptors in remote tissues of the body, and etiology and pathophysiology of taste disorders, in addition to the valuable knowledge gained about gustatory disorders in the context of COVID-19. Along with olfactory disorders, taste disorders are one of the earliest suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 infection.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy with our unique staining procedure made it possible to visualize HTLV-1Cspecific CTLs infiltrating the CNS of the HAM/TSP patients. The frequency of HTLV-1Cspecific CTLs was more than 20% of CD8-positive cells infiltrating the CNS. In addition, HTLV-1 proteins were detected in CD4-positive infiltrating T lymphocytes but not CNS resident cells. Although neurons were generally preserved, apoptotic oligodendrocytes were frequently in contact with CD8-positive cells; this likely resulted in demyelination. These findings suggest that the immune responses of the CTLs against HTLV-1Cinfected CD4-positive lymphocytes migrating into the CNS resulted in bystander neural damage.","output":"Visualization of HTLV-1CSpecific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes in the Spinal Cords of Patients With HTLV-1CAssociated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a major impact on child abuse and neglect (CAN) in the U.S. leading to a change in the number of reported screened-in CAN investigations, missed prevention cases, and missed CAN cases. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the deficit number of CAN investigations and resultant estimated number of missed prevention and CAN cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. from March 2020 to December 2020. METHODS: Secondary data analyses of administrative child welfare data from January 2013 to December 2020 from New York City, Florida, New Jersey and Wisconsin were conducted. Spline regression modeling controlling for autocorrelation was utilized to explore any significant changes once the pandemic began in March 2020 in the number of screened-in CAN investigations. The seven-year monthly average of screen-in CAN investigations for March through December from 2013 to 2019 was calculated and compared to the numbers of CAN investigations for March 2020 to December 2020. The resultant number of missed prevention cases and CAN cases was estimated for the four jurisdictions and used to approximate the number of missed prevention cases and CAN cases in the U.S., as well as the projected estimation of national lifetime economic costs. RESULTS: Prior to the pandemic, there were insignificant monthly increases of 0.7 CAN investigations in NYC and 6.2 CAN investigations in Florida, a significant monthly increase 4.2 CAN investigations in New Jersey and an insignificant monthly decrease in 0.6 CAN investigations in Wisconsin. Once the pandemic began, there were significant monthly decreases (p < .001) in each of the four jurisdictions, including 1425.6 fewer CAN investigations in NYC, 3548.0 fewer CAN investigations in Florida, 963.0 fewer CAN investigations in New Jersey and 529.1 fewer CAN investigations in Wisconsin. There were an estimated 60,791 fewer CAN investigations in these four jurisdictions from March 2020 to December 2020 of which there were approximately 18,540 missed prevention and CAN cases suggesting up to $4.2 billion in lifetime economic costs. It was estimated that were 623,137 children not investigated for CAN in the U.S. during the same 10-month period. This suggests that there were an estimated 85,993 children were missed for prevention services and about 104,040 children were missed for CAN with a potential lifetime economic impact of up to $48.1 billion in the U.S. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a precipitous drop in CAN investigations where almost 200,000 children are estimated to have been missed for prevention services and CAN in a 10-month period. There are opportunities for the child welfare jurisdictions to work with partner education, public health, social service and other providers to strategically approach this very grave issue in order to mitigate its impact on this very vulnerable population.","output":"Calculating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on child abuse and neglect in the U.S"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The specific underlying mechanisms supporting the association between erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) are still not completely clarified. To summarize and discuss all available data supporting the relationship between PE and ED. METHODS: A comprehensive narrative review was performed. In addition, to better clarify the specific factors underlining ED and PE, a meta-analytic approach of the selected evidence was also performed. In particular, the meta-analytic method was selected in order to minimize possible sources of bias derived from a personal interpretation of the data. RESULTS: Current data confirm the close association between ED and PE and the bidirectional nature of their relationship. In particular, PE was associated with a fourfold increased risk of ED independently of the definition used. In addition, the risk increased in older patients and in those with lower education, and it was associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conversely, ED-related PE was characterized by lower associations with organic parameters such as diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and with smoking habit. Finally, when ED was defined according to the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire, the presence of a stable relationship increased the risk. CONCLUSIONS: ED and PE should be considered in a dimensional prospective way considering the possibility that both clinical entities can overlap and influence each. Correctly recognizing the underlying factors and sexual complaint can help the clinician in deciding the more appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic work-up.

An online questionnaire was used to explore the passage of time during the day, week and the 11 months since the first period of covid-19 restrictions were imposed in Iraq. The questionnaire also measured affective and demographic factors, and task-load. The results showed that distortions to the passage of time were widespread in Iraq. Participants consistently reported a slowing of the passage of time for the day and the week during the pandemic in comparison to normal (i.e. before the pandemic). Participants also reported that it felt like longer than 11-months since the first lockdown began. The passage of time during the day and week were not predicted by any demographic, affective or task-load measures taken in the study. The perceived length of time since the first lockdown was however predicted by stress and change of life due to covid, with greater stress and greater change of life being associated with greater subjective lengthening of the pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further catalyzed the need for reforms, offering unprecedented opportunities to pilot novel changes. However, a comprehensive collation of all proposed and implemented orthopaedic reforms is currently lacking. Thus, we aimed to characterize proposed orthopaedic-specific resident selection reforms in the context of reforms implemented by other specialties. METHODS: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for references proposing reforms to the orthopaedic resident selection process published from 2005 to 2020. An inductive approach to qualitative content analysis was used to categorize reforms. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles proposing 13 unique reforms to the orthopaedic resident selection process were identified. The most commonly proposed reforms included noncognitive assessments (n = 8), application caps (n = 7), standardized letters of recommendation (n = 5), program-specific supplemental applications (n = 5), creation of a centralized database of standardized program information (n = 4), use of a standardized applicant composite score (n = 4), and a moratorium on postinterview communication (n = 4). Importantly, nearly all of these reforms have also been proposed or implemented by other specialties. DISCUSSION: Numerous reforms to the orthopaedic resident selection process have been suggested over the past 15 years, several of which have been implemented on a program-specific basis, including noncognitive assessments, supplemental applications, and standardized letters of recommendation. Careful examination of applicant and program experiences and Match outcomes after these reforms is imperative to inform future directions.","output":"The Orthopaedic Resident Selection Process: Proposed Reforms and Lessons From Other Specialties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) cases after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been reported, but the frequency is unknown. We aimed to determine the frequency and diagnostic features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)Crelated AE. METHODS: Residual sera from 556 consecutive Mayo Clinic Rochester patients (laboratory cohort) who underwent autoimmune encephalopathy neural immunoglobulin G (IgG) evaluation were tested for total antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein using a Food and Drug AdministrationCauthorized chemiluminescence assay (October 2019CDecember 2020). Clinical records from patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody result and available research consent were reviewed. This laboratory cohort was cross-referenced with the Department of Neurology's COVID-19Crelated consultative experience (encephalopathy cohort, n = 31). RESULTS: Eighteen of the laboratory cohort (3%) were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive (AprilCDecember 2020). Diagnoses were as follows: AE, 2; postacute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC), 3; toxic-metabolic encephalopathy during COVID-19 pneumonia, 2; diverse nonCCOVID-19 relatable neurologic diagnoses, 9; unavailable, 2. Five of the encephalopathy cohort had AE (16%, including the 2 laboratory cohort cases that overlapped), representing 0.05% of 10,384 patients diagnosed and cared for with any COVID-19 illness at Mayo Clinic Rochester in 2020. The 5 patients met definite (n = 1), probable (n = 1), or possible (n = 3) AE diagnostic criteria; median symptom onset age was 61 years (range, 46C63); 3 were women. All 5 were neural IgG negative and 4 tested were SARS-CoV-2 PCR/IgG index negative in CSF. Phenotypes (and accompanying MRI and EEG findings) were diverse (delirium [n = 5], seizures [n = 2], rhombencephalitis [n = 1], aphasia [n = 1], and ataxia [n = 1]). No acute disseminated encephalomyelitis cases were encountered. The 3 patients with possible AE had spontaneously resolving syndromes. One with definite limbic encephalitis was immune therapy responsive but had residual mood and memory problems. One patient with probable autoimmune rhombencephalitis died despite immune therapy. The remaining 26 encephalopathy cohort patients had toxic-metabolic diagnoses. DISCUSSION: We encountered occasional cases of AE in our 2020 COVID-19 experience. Consistent with sporadic reports and small case series during the COVID-19 pandemic, and prior experience of postinfectious AE, our cases had diverse clinical presentations and were neural IgG and CSF viral particle negative.

In non-coronavirus cohorts, evidence has accumulated of an interaction between the complement and coagulation systems, with one amplifying activation of the other. A pressing question is therefore if COVID-19 associated thrombosis could be caused by overactivation of the complement cascade? In this review, we summarize the literature on thrombotic complications in COVID-19, complement activation in coronavirus infections, and the crosstalk between the complement and coagulation systems. We demonstrate how the complement system is able to activate the coagulation cascade and platelets, inhibit fibrinolysis and stimulate endothelial cells. We also describe how these interactions see clinical relevance in several disorders where overactive complement results in a prothrombotic clinical presentation, and how it could be clinically relevant in COVID-19.","output":"Is COVID-19 associated thrombosis caused by overactivation of the complement cascade?

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed between two groups A and B, who presented with acute appendicitis three months prior to and after initiation of lockdown on March 24 2020 respectively in one of the tertiary centers of Nepal. These two cohorts were compared in demographics, clinicopathological characteristics and surgical aspects of acute appendicitis. RESULTS: There were 42 patients in group A and 50 patients in group B. Mean age of the patients was 31.3217.18 years with male preponderance in group B (N = 29). Mean duration of pain increased significantly in group B [57.825.9(B) vs 42.325.0(A) hours, P = 0.004] along with mean duration of surgery [51.069.4(B) vs 45.2711.8(A) minutes, P = 0.015].

It is also of interest of policy makers to identify those areas with higher infectivity rate of TB for possible preventions. Therefore, we need to analyze this data properly to address those concerns. In this article, the expectation conditional maximization algorithm is proposed for estimating the parameters of GD-ILMs to be able to predict the areas with the highest average infectivity rates of TB.

This study discusses the information-seeking behavior of parents related to face-to-face school policies and the decision-making. The method used is descriptive survey. Data collected through online surveys and interviews. The results showed that parents did the active and passive behavior on information seeking. The school (teachers homeroom teachers principals etc.) is the most frequently referred source of information by parents and is considered the most trusted source of information. The most important information needed by parents is regarding the readiness of the school in the implementation of face-to-face learning during the pandemic.

This study aimed to investigate the association between changes in shunt, low and high ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, and computed tomography-measured lung aeration following an increase in PEEP in patients with ARDS. METHODS: In this preliminary study, 12 ARDS patients were subjected to recruitment maneuvers followed by setting PEEP at 5 and then either 15 or 20 cmH(2)O. Lung aeration was measured by computed tomography. Values of pulmonary shunt and low and high V/Q mismatch were calculated by a model-based method from measurements of oxygenation, ventilation, and metabolism taken at different inspired oxygen levels and an arterial blood gas sample. RESULTS: Increasing PEEP resulted in reduced values of pulmonary shunt and the percentage of non-aerated tissue, and an increased percentage of normally aerated tissue (p < 0.05). Changes in shunt and normally aerated tissue were significantly correlated (r = ? 0.665, p = 0.018). Three distinct responses to increase in PEEP were observed in values of shunt and V/Q mismatch: a beneficial response in seven patients, where shunt decreased without increasing high V/Q; a detrimental response in four patients where both shunt and high V/Q increased; and a detrimental response in a patient with reduced shunt but increased high V/Q mismatch. Non-aerated tissue decreased with increased PEEP in all patients, and hyperinflated tissue increased only in patients with a detrimental response in shunt and V/Q mismatch. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that improved lung aeration following an increase in PEEP is not always consistent with reduced shunt and V/Q mismatch. Poorly matched redistribution of ventilation and perfusion, between dependent and non-dependent regions of the lung, may explain why patients showed detrimental changes in shunt and V/Q mismatch on increase in PEEP, despite improved aeration.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at King Abdullah Hospital in Bisha Province, Saudi Arabia, from March 20 to June 30, 2020. Patients of different age groups were confirmed as having COVID-19 infection using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the patients were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 132 patients, 85 were male and 47 were female, with a mean age of 50.9 years (SD16.7). The patients were elderly (n = 29) and adults (n = 103). Of these, 54 (40.9%) had comorbidities, (25%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 12 (9.1%) died. On admission, the main clinical manifestations were fever (84.1%), cough (64.4%), shortness of breath (25%), chest pain (20.5%), and fatigue (18.2%). In all patients, increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes were observed. Patients lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 48.5%, D-dimer in 43.2%, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 40.9% of patients.

However, little is known about the roles of temperate phages in attenuation of bacterial virulence.

METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatments, complications, and clinical outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records of 168 COVID-19 patients admitted into ICU of two COVID-19 dedicated hospitals of Chattogram, Bangladesh and compared between diabetes (n = 88) and non-diabetes (n = 80) groups. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was high among 51C70 years old patients. All the diabetic patients had at least one other comorbidity, with a significantly higher incidence of hypertension (53.4% vs 27.5%, P < 0.05). Prevalence of male patients (74/88; 84.1%) was slightly higher among diabetic patients than the non-diabetic patients (60/80; 75%). Even though not significant, Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a shorter overall survival time than those without diabetes. In subgroup analysis, diabetic patients were classified into insulin-requiring and non-insulin-requiring groups based on their requirement of insulin during the stay in ICU. COVID-19 infected diabetic patients requiring insulin have high risk of disease progression and shorter survival time than the non-insulin required group.

The severity and distribution of morphological lesions associated with SARS-CoV-2 and how they relate to clinical, laboratory, and radiological data have not yet been studied systematically. The main goals of the present study were to objectively identify pathological phenotypes and factors that, in addition to SARS-CoV-2, may influence their occurrence. Lungs from 26 patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory failure were comprehensively analysed. Robust machine learning techniques were implemented to obtain a global pathological score to distinguish phenotypes with prevalent vascular or alveolar injury. The score was then analysed to assess its possible correlation with clinical, laboratory, radiological, and tissue viral data. Furthermore, an exploratory random forest algorithm was developed to identify the most discriminative clinical characteristics at hospital admission that might predict pathological phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2. Vascular injury phenotype was observed in most cases being consistently present as pure form or in combination with alveolar injury. Phenotypes with more severe alveolar injury showed significantly more frequent tracheal intubation; longer invasive mechanical ventilation, illness duration, intensive care unit or hospital ward stay; and lower tissue viral quantity (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in this phenotype, superimposed infections, tumours, and aspiration pneumonia were also more frequent (p < 0.001). Random forest algorithm identified some clinical features at admission (body mass index, white blood cells, D-dimer, lymphocyte and platelet counts, fever, respiratory rate, and PaCO2 ) to stratify patients into different clinical clusters and potential pathological phenotypes (a web-app for score assessment has also been developed; https://r-ubesp.dctv.unipd.it/shiny/AVI-Score/).

Even before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak infectious diseases represented one of the major causes of death of older adults. Loss of immune function and reduced protection from infectious agents with age - immunosenescence - is a result of complex mechanisms affecting production and maintenance of immune cells as well as the initiation, maintenance and termination of properly directed immune responses.

The resulting electrochemical biosensor was validated towards glucose oxidation in real samples and further electrochemical measurement associated with the generated H2O2. The electrochemical biosensor showed an excellent sensitivity (42.7 A mM-1 cm-2), limit of detection (7.6 M), linear range (20 M-2.3 mM), and good selectivity towards glucose determination. Furthermore, and most importantly, the detection of glucose was performed at a low potential (0.2 V vs. Ag). The high performance of the electrochemical biosensor was explained through surface exploration using field emission SEM, XPS, and impedance measurements. The electrochemical biosensor was successfully applied to glucose quantification in several real samples (commercial juices and a plant cell culture medium), exhibiting a high accuracy when compared with a classical spectrophotometric method.

Measurement . The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) developed an expedited amendment process for research shifting to remote data collection. For the Cohort 3, 14-month data collection period, we adapted our protocol to allow data collection via telephone and e-mail. We were unable to collect certain measures that required face-to face contact. Results . For measures that could be collected remotely, 14-month retention was similar for Cohort 3 and earlier cohorts: data were collected for 86.9% of cohort 3 (remote) and 87.9% of cohorts 1 and2 (face to face), p = .84. Conclusions . In order to preserve the integrity of our clinical trial and ensure the safety of our participants and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to carefully and efficiently adapt our data collection procedures.

We have previously shown that endotoxemia, presumably from the gut, may complicate COVID-19. However, the role of endotoxin adsorbent (EA) therapy to mitigate organ dysfunction in COVID-19 has not been explored. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study in COVID-19 patients who received EA therapy at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between March 13 and April 17, 2020. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were collected by inpatient chart review. RESULTS: Among 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 6 patients received EA therapy. All of the 6 patients had severe COVID-19 infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among these, 5 of them were mechanically ventilated and 4 had complications of secondary bacterial infection. The endotoxin activity assay (EAA) results of pre-EA therapy ranged from 0.47 to 2.79. The choices of EA therapy were at the discretion of attending physicians. One patient was treated with oXiris? along with continuous renal replacement therapy, and the others received polymyxin B hemoperfusion sessions. All patients have survived and were finally free from the mechanical ventilation as well as had improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and decreased EAA level after EA therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the clinical improvement of severe COVID-19 patients with elevated EAA level upon receiving EA therapy.

Variability in length of hospital stay (LOS) was evident in this population. The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to prompt discharge of effected patients in order to reduce contagion risk. LOS and discharge destination in COVID-19 negative patients has not been studied. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the LOS and discharge destination during the COVID-19 outbreak and compare it with a similar cohort in preceding years. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted comparing a total of 182 consecutive fragility hip fracture patients operated on during the first COVID-19 outbreak to patients operated on in 2 preceding years. Data regarding demographic, co-morbidities, surgical management, hospitalization, as well as surgical and medical complications were retrieved from electronic charts. RESULTS During the pandemic 67 fragility hip fracture patients were admitted (COVID group); 55 and 60 patients were admitted during the same time periods in 2017 and 2018, respectively (control groups). All groups were of similar age and gender. Patients in the COVID group had significantly shorter LOS (7.2  3.3 vs. 8.9  4.9 days, P = 0.008) and waiting time for a rehabilitation facility (7.2  3.1 vs. 9.3  4.9 days, P = 0.003), but greater prevalence of delirium (17.9% vs. 7% of patients, P = 0.028). In hospital mortality did not differ among groups. CONCLUSIONS LOS and time to rehabilitation were significantly shorter in the COVID group.

Preclinical investigations in animals and retrospective studies in patients have suggested that inhibition of platelets may improve the outcome of sepsis. In this study we investigated whether chronic antiplatelet therapy impacts on the presentation and outcome of sepsis, and the host response. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study in 972 patients admitted with sepsis to the mixed intensive care units (ICUs) of two hospitals in the Netherlands between January 2011 and July 2013. Of them, 267 patients (27.5 %) were on antiplatelet therapy (95.9 % acetylsalicylic acid) before admission. To account for differential likelihoods of receiving antiplatelet therapy, a propensity score was constructed, including variables associated with use of antiplatelet therapy. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association of antiplatelet therapy with mortality. RESULTS: Antiplatelet therapy was not associated with sepsis severity at presentation, the primary source of infection, causative pathogens, the development of organ failure or shock during ICU stay, or mortality up to 90 days after admission, in either unmatched or propensity-matched analyses. Antiplatelet therapy did not modify the values of 19 biomarkers providing insight into hallmark host responses to sepsis, including activation of the coagulation system, the vascular endothelium, the cytokine network, and renal function, during the first 4 days after ICU admission.

Study designs and methods were not always clearly described, but 74 (93%) were quantitative (including one randomised trial), five (6%) were mixed-methods, and one was qualitative. Most sources reported research from India (39%) or Bangladesh (31%), followed by Pakistan (9%), Nepal (9%), Bhutan and Sri Lanka (6% each). Topically, most focused on rabies (18; 23%), Nipah virus (16; 20%) or leptospirosis (11; 14%), while 12 (15%) did not focus on a disease but instead on knowledge in communities. People generally did not seek post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies even when vaccination programmes were available and they understood that rabies was fatal, instead often relying on traditional medicines. Similarly, people did not take precautions to protect themselves from leptospirosis infection, even when they were aware of the link with rice cultivation. Nipah was correlated with presence of bats near human habitation. Official information on diseases, modes of transmission and prevention was lacking, or shared informally between friends, relatives, and neighbours. Behaviour did not correspond to disease knowledge. This review identifies various human behaviours which may drive zoonotic disease risk in the Indian subcontinent. Increasing community knowledge and awareness alone is unlikely to be sufficient to successfully change these behaviours.

Yet, over the long-term, questions about the order of distribution will be displaced by questions about how to achieve high levels of vaccination rates. Historically, absent incentives or mandates, Americans have shown ambivalence, if not general antipathy, towards vaccinations, and vaccination rates have generally been low for many vaccines. There is evidence that vaccination requirements across educational settings are an effective policy instrument to increase vaccination rates. We administered a large national survey to assess American's attitudes towards vaccination requirements across three educational settings (daycare, K-12 schools, and universities) in general and for COVID-19 specifically. Partisanship, gender, race, rurality, and perceptions about the appropriate role schools should play in providing health services are substantive predictors of public opinion. While Americans generally support vaccination mandates across all three settings for both types of requirements, support is consistently and significantly lower for COVID19 requirements. The effect of partisanship is accentuated for COVID-19 requirements as compared to general requirements. Drop off in support between general and COVID-19 specific requirements are driven by partisanship, gender, political knowledge, rurality, and having children in the household. Nonetheless, mandates are supported by a majority of Americans. Assessing Americans' opinions of vaccination requirements in educational settings offers an important opportunity to explore the potential of mandates as policy instrument in the government's arsenal against COVID-19 and guide public policy on the issues.","output":"Joining the herd?

The aim of this study was to examine the managerial and clinical challenges of nurse managers in mental health centers during the current COVID\\\\19 pandemic. DESIGN: A mixed\\\\methods study based on an analysis of data obtained in focus groups with 25 nurse managers from two mental health centers in Israel. METHODS: The quantitative phase was conducted prior to the group sessions using a structured self\\\\administered questionnaire that examined the nurse managers (a) background data, (b) communication with the staff nurses, (c) perceptions of nurses functioning, (d) perceptions of their own functioning, and (e) management as impacted by the pandemic. The qualitative phase included three sessions of focus groups in which the nurse managers discussed both their challenging and positive issues during the pandemic. FINDINGS: The most important challenges were related to the need to protect patients from infection and communicating with families and primary caregivers. Work policies and procedures were less well adapted to pandemic conditions; nevertheless, nurse managers felt a sense of purpose, duty, and pride in their work. Three themes emerged: (a) \\"management complexity\\" included the change from a familiar routine to a new reality, working in capsules, protecting against infection, functional confusion, and insights into future epidemics; (b) \\"challenging communication\\" included communication with patients through glass walls and communication with staff through screens and (c) \\"bright spots\\" referred to staff cohesion and the provision of respectful care. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health nurse managers have experienced during the pandemic a change in their roles from being less managerial to focusing more on clinical work. Communication between nurse managers and staff nurses and between mental health patients and staff were the main challenges. Nurse managers favorably noted the uniformity and humanity of the staff, sense of cohesion, and shared responsibility. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the first wave of the pandemic, there was confusion as to the functional role of ward nurse managers, as the focus of their activities became more clinical and less managerial.

Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at one-year. Cluster analysis was performed using clustering large applications (CLARA) k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at five-months. Inflammatory protein profiling from plasma at the five-month visit was performed. Findings2320 participants have been assessed at five months after discharge and 807 participants have completed both five-month and one-year visits. Of these, 35{middle dot}6% were female, mean age 58{middle dot}7 (SD 12{middle dot}5) years, and 27{middle dot}8% received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between five months 501/1965 (25{middle dot}5%) and one year 232/804 (28{middle dot}9%). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at one year were: female sex OR 0{middle dot}68 (95% CI 0{middle dot}46-0{middle dot}99), obesity OR 0{middle dot}50 (95%CI 0{middle dot}34-0{middle dot}74) and IMV OR 0{middle dot}42 (95%CI 0{middle dot}23-0{middle dot}76). Cluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters: very severe, severe, moderate/cognitive, mild relating to the severity of physical, mental health and cognitive impairments at five months in a larger sample. There was elevation of inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate/cognitive clusters compared to the mild cluster including interleukin-6 which was elevated in both comparisons. Overall, there was a substantial deficit in median (IQR) EQ5D-5L utility index from pre-COVID (retrospective assessment) 0{middle dot}88 (0{middle dot}74-1{middle dot}00), five months 0{middle dot}74 (0{middle dot}60-0{middle dot}88) to one year: 0{middle dot}74 (0{middle dot}59-0{middle dot}88), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at one-year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters.

Added value of this studyIn a diverse population of adults post-hospital admission with COVID-19, our large UK prospective multi-centre study reports several novel findings: the minority felt fully recovered at one year with minimal recovery from five months across any health domain; female sex and obesity are associated with being less likely to feel fully recovered at one year; several inflammatory mediators were increased in individuals with the most severe physical, mental health, and cognitive impairments compared to individuals with milder ongoing impairments. Implications of all the available evidenceBoth pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are urgently needed to improve the ongoing burden following hospitalisation for COVID-19 both for individuals and healthcare systems; our findings support the use of a precision medicine approach with potential treatable traits of systemic inflammation and obesity.","output":"Clinical characteristics with inflammation profiling of Long-COVID and association with one-year recovery following hospitalisation in the UK: a prospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Young peoples mental health during COVID-19 pandemic has been identified as a priority. However, studies to date are largely simple surveys and lacking any meaningful involvement from patients and the public in their design, planning and delivery. The study aim was to examine the mental health status and coping strategies of young people (aged 16-24) during and after COVID-19 lockdown using co-production methodology. Methods: We utilised a sequential co-produced mixed methods design. Participants were aged 16-24 and lived in the UK. The primary outcome was mental health status, measured using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), anxiety coronavirus impact sub-scale (CIS) and reported self-harm. Predictors included sociodemographic variables, coping strategies (Brief COPE), sleep (Sleep Condition Indicator), personality traits (Ten-Item Personality Inventory) and optimism (Life-Orientation Test - Revised). Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with a purposive sample of survey participants. The study was registered with COVID MINDS. Results: Seven-hundred and ninety-six participants (mean age 19.6 [SD 2.7]) took part in the first survey in April 2020. Survey data showed 26.6% had poor mental health and 10% had self-harmed since lockdown. Young people identifying as Black/Black British ethnicity in our study had the highest increased odds of experiencing poor mental health. Logistic regression showed behavioural disengagement, self-blame and substance misuse coping strategies, negative affect, sleep problems and reduced conscientiousness were all significantly associated with poor mental health. Eighteen participants were followed up and interviewed. There were three main interlinking themes: (1) pre-existing and developed helpful coping strategies employed during lockdown, (2) mental health difficulties worsened during lockdown and (3) the need for mental health and non-mental health support during and after lockdown. Interpretation: To our knowledge this is the first sequential co-produced mixed methods study to examine mental health status and coping strategies of young people during COVID-19 lockdown. On average, young peoples mental health has significantly worsened since lockdown, and dysfunctional coping strategies are associated with this. However, young people have found innovative and adaptive ways to cope, including distraction and having a good routine. Going forward, appropriate and effective mental health support adapted to lockdown conditions is needed to help young people during and after lockdown.Trial Registration: The study was registered with COVID MINDS.Funding Statement: NIHR Patient Safety Translational Research Centre programme grant (Ref: PSTRC-2016-004) and Institute of Global Health Innovation.

Furthermore, CT imaging appearances are correlated with patients presenting with different clinical scenarios, such as early versus advanced stages, asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients, and severe versus nonsevere situations. However, its role as a screening and diagnostic tool in COVID-19 remains to be clarified. This article provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature on chest CT imaging findings with the aim of highlighting the contribution and judicious use of CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19. A search of PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Scopus was performed to identify studies reporting chest imaging findings in COVID-19. Chest imaging abnormalities associated with COVID-19 were extracted from the eligible studies and diagnostic value of CT in detecting these abnormal changes was compared between studies consisting of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. A random-effects model was used to perform meta-analysis for calculation of pooled mean values and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of abnormal imaging findings. Fifty-five studies met the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. Pulmonary lesions more often involved bilateral lungs (78%, 95% CI: 45-100%) and were more likely to have a peripheral (65.35%, 95% CI: 25.93-100%) and peripheral plus central distribution (31.12%, 95% CI: 1.96-74.07%), but less likely to have a central distribution (3.57%, 95% CI: 0.99-9.80%). Ground glass opacities (GGO) (58.05%, 95% CI: 16.67-100%), consolidation (44.18%, 95% CI: 1.61-71.46%) and GGO plus consolidation (52.99%, 95% CI: 19.05-76.79%) were the most common findings reported in 94.5% (52/55) of the studies, followed by air bronchogram (42.50%, 95% CI: 7.78-80.39%), linear opacities (41.29%, 95% CI: 7.44-65.06%), crazy-paving pattern (23.57%, 95% CI: 3.13-91.67%) and interlobular septal thickening (22.91%, 95% CI: 0.90- 80.49%).

METHODS: Observational and prospective cohort of patients admitted to a tertiary hospital from June 2020 to November 2020. Persistence of chest CT scan alterations, desaturation in the six-minute walk test (6MWT), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), lung carbon monoxide diffusion (DLCO), and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) were measured 6 months after hospital discharge. Additionally, the Barthel index (BI) and the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale were used to determine the impact of lung dysfunction in activities of daily living (ADL). RESULTS: It was included 44 patients. Sixty percent had persistent lung CT scan abnormalities. From 18 to 43% of patients had at least one pulmonary function dysfunction, a decrease in FEV1 was the least prevalent (18%), and a reduction in DLCO and MIP was the most frequent (43%). In general, female gender, comorbidity index, and age were associated with worse lung function. Additionally, the presence of lung dysfunction could predict worse BI (r-square 0.28) and mMRC (r-square 0.32).

The aim of this study was to examine social inequalities in Covid-19 vaccination uptake as of 17th May 2021 among Swedish adults aged  60 years. METHODS: The study population comprised a general population cohort aged 60 years or older (n = 350,805), representative of the Swedish population. Data were collected through the nationwide linked multi-register observational study SCIFI-PEARL, and associations between sociodemographic determinants and Covid-19 vaccination uptake were analysed using logistic regression. Intersectional analyses of sociodemographic heterogeneity were performed by taking several overlapping social dimensions into account. Data availability extended to 17 May 2021. FINDINGS: The overall vaccination coverage was 872% by 17th May 2021. Younger age, male sex, lower income, living alone, and being born outside Sweden, were all associated with a lower uptake of vaccination. The lowest Covid-19 vaccination uptake was seen in individuals born in low-or middle-income countries, of which only 60% had received vaccination, with an odds ratio (OR) of not being vaccinated of 605 (95% CI: 585C626) compared to individuals born in Sweden. These associations persisted after adjustments for possible confounding factors. The intersectional analyses showed even larger variations in vaccination in cross-classified sociodemographic subgroups (ranging from 44% to 97%) with marked differences in uptake of vaccination within sociodemographic groups. INTERPRETATION: The uptake of Covid-19 vaccine during the spring of 2021 in Sweden varied substantially both between and within sociodemographic groups. The use of an intersectional approach, taking several overlapping social dimensions into account at the same time rather than only using one-dimensional measures, contributes to a better understanding of the complexity in the uptake of vaccination.

Biopsies of the olfactory mucosa in patients that complain of dysosmia after viral infection fall into two categories: one in which no olfactory epithelium is seen and another in which the epithelium is disordered and populated mainly by immature neurons. We have used intranasal inoculation with an olfactory bulb line variant of MHV to study the consequences of viral infection on peripheral olfactory structures. MHV OBLV has little direct effect on the olfactory epithelium, but causes extensive spongiotic degeneration and destruction of mitral cells and interneurons in the olfactory bulb such that the axonal projection from the bulb via the lateral olfactory tract is markedly reduced. Moreover, surviving mitral cells apparently remain disconnected from the sensory neuron input to the glomerular layer, judging from retrograde labeling studies using Dil. The damage to the bulb indirectly causes a persistent, long-term increase in the turnover of sensory neurons in the epithelium, i.e. the relative proportion of immature to mature sensory neurons and the rate of basal cell proliferation both increase. The changes that develop after inoculation with MHV OBLV closely resemble the disordering of the olfactory epithelium in some patient biopsies. Thus, damage to the olfactory nerve or bulb may contribute to a form of post-viral olfactory dysfunction and MHV OBLV is a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of this form of dysosmia.","output":"Intranasal Inoculation with the Olfactory Bulb Line Variant of Mouse Hepatitis Virus Causes Extensive Destruction of the Olfactory Bulb and Accelerated Turnover of Neurons in the Olfactory Epithelium of Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical research involving participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) presents challenges to recruitment that may be further compounded by concerns when delivering a behavioral intervention via the Internet.

However, to date, there has been no evidence regarding the possible changes in cognitive stimulation treatments on these oscillations. This paper sets out to verify whether cognitive stimulation treatments based on progressive increases in cognitive load can be effective in triggering changes in alpha-band power in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. With this objective, we compared a cognitive stimulation treatment (n = 12) to a placebo treatment (n = 14) for 12 weeks (36 sessions of 15 min) in child patients (8C11 years old) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Two magnetoencephalographic recordings were acquired for all participants. In order to extract the areas with changes in alpha power between both magnetoencephalographic recordings, the differences in the power ratio (pre/post-condition) were calculated using an analysis of covariance test adjusted for the age variable. The results show an increase in the post-treatment alpha power in the experimental group versus the placebo group (P < 0.01) in posterior regions. In addition, these changes were related to measures of attention, working memory and flexibility. The results seem to indicate that cognitive stimulation treatment based on progressive increases in cognitive load triggers alpha-band power changes in children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in the direction of their peers without this disorder.","output":"Alpha-band power increases in posterior brain regions in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after digital cognitive stimulation treatment: randomized controlled study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of corticosteroids therapy on the inflammatory response in a critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient. METHODS A 55-year old female patient with critical ill COVID-19 was admitted in Taizhou Hospital on January 19, 2020. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 80 mg on the 2nd day after admission. Thereafter, the dose was adjusted in a timely manner and the therapy lasted for 13 days. The peripheral lymphocyte subsets (CD3+T, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NK cells, B cells), as well as serum levels of lymphocyte factors (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-) were dynamically monitored. RESULTS On D1 of admission, the numbers of peripheral blood CD3+ T, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells were significantly lower than the normal range. With the improvement of the disease, the numbers of CD3+ T, CD8+ T and CD4 + T cells gradually recovered and showed a linear growth trend (linear fitting equation: Y=18.59X+109.4, P<0.05). On D2 of admission, the patient's IL-6 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher than normal values, IFN- was at a normal high value, and then rapidly decreased; IL-2, IL-4, and TNF- were all in the normal range. On the D6 and D7, the IL-6 and IL-10 decreased to the normal range for the first time. On the D18, the sputum virus nucleic acid test was negative for the first time, and the fecal virus nucleic acid test was still positive; on the D20 the sputum and fecal virus nucleic acid test were both negative. On D34, the patient recovered and was discharged. At the discharge the muscle strength score of the patient was 44 and the daily life ability evaluation was 90.

As such, it is challenging to predict the complex hydrological processes and biophysical dynamics. This challenge increases in areas with limited data availability. The key objective of this study was to evaluate the direct integration of remotely sensed Leaf Area Index (LAI) data into a hydrological model to improve streamflow, ET, and crop yield estimates. We also demonstrated how an improved model integrated with remotely sensed LAI data can inform water managers by predicting water productivity (WP) under different irrigation schemes. We took agricultural-dominated San Joaquin Watershed in California, United States, as our testbed and integrated the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m resolution 4-day total LAI data into the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. Results showed that, compared to conventional SWAT model that relies on semi-empirical equations and user inputs for simulating biophysical processes, direct LAI integration into SWAT model (SWAT-LAI) notably captured the actual vegetation dynamics and improved ET and crop yield estimations. The WP simulated by the improved SWAT-LAI model for almond and grape yields varied within a range from 0.363 to 3.81 kg/m3 and 0.32 to 4.76 kg/m3 across different irrigation applications. The outcomes of this study showed that deficit irrigation application could be a viable option in water stressed regions, since it can save a substantial amount of irrigation water and maintain the higher water productivity required for both almond and grape yield production.

An unprecedented ongoing global initiative is producing hundreds of thousands of sequences worldwide. However, the complex circumstances in which viruses are sequenced, along with the demand of urgent results, causes a high rate of incomplete and, therefore, useless sequences. Viral sequences evolve in the context of a complex phylogeny and different positions along the genome are in linkage disequilibrium. Therefore, an imputation method would be able to predict missing positions from the available sequencing data. RESULTS: We have developed the impuSARS application, which takes advantage of the enormous number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available, using a reference panel containing 239,301 sequences, to produce missing data imputation in viral genomes. ImpuSARS was tested in a wide range of conditions (continuous fragments, amplicons or sparse individual positions missing), showing great fidelity when reconstructing the original sequences, recovering the lineage with a 100% precision for almost all the lineages, even in very poorly covered genomes (<20%). CONCLUSIONS: Imputation can improve the pace of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing production by recovering many incomplete or low-quality sequences that would be otherwise discarded.

Using time and motion methodology, we quantified HCP time and opportunity costs (time and materials) associated with nebulized COPD therapy in inpatient and LTC settings and estimated efficiencies of changing to once-daily therapy. METHODS: A case report form was built to reflect local nebulization workflow. Primary outcomes were mean active HCP time per predefined task and mean total active HCP time associated with short-acting beta agonist (SABA) and SABA/short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) combination nebulization processes. RESULTS: Twenty observations occurred within each setting. Inpatient observations included three SABA and 17 SABA/SAMA (from 18 different patients), and LTC observations included five SABA and 15 SABA/SAMA (from eight different patients). Mean total process time was 16.12 min in the inpatient setting (95% CI 14.48C17.76) and 21.0 min in the LTC setting (95% CI 18.8C23.2), with the actual nebulization comprising over 50% of process time for both. In LTC, CIs suggest a difference by cognitive impairment status: mean 24.1 min (95% CI 21.3C26.9) if cognitively impaired versus 19.0 min (95% CI 16.1C21.8) if not. In the inpatient setting, the estimated process time/admission was 7.8 h; a once-daily nebulized drug would require only 2.3 h. In LTC, the estimated process time was 32.1 h/month; a once-daily nebulized drug would require only 13.7 h/month. Estimated nebulization cost was $243/admission for current versus $72 for once-daily dosing in inpatient, and $1177/month versus $504 in LTC. CONCLUSIONS: The nebulization process for COPD patients in both inpatient and LTC settings consumes considerable HCP time.

There is a broad range of COVID-19 illness, ranging from milder disease to a rapidly progressive respiratory disease and ARDS. The causes of this different clinical course and the drivers for severe disease are currently unknown. A fulminant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines is thought to play a role in causing a rapid disease evolution, however the immune correlates of severe COVID-19 remain unclear. METHODS: To gain insight into relationship between immune responses and disease severity we built a longitudinal cohort of 40 adult patients with known COVID-19. Samples were collected at diagnosis and every 7 days until hospital discharge or death. As controls we also included a group of convalescent patients, and subjects who tested negative for COVID-19 by PCR. Clinical and laboratory data and were also collected. Multicolor flow cytometry was used to determine the presence and phenotype of B, T and natural killer (NK) cells. We also identified specific sub-populations (Tfh, activated/cytotoxic CD8 and NK) and assessed lymphoid exhaustion of different cell types such as na?ve, memory T cells, or NK over time. Anti-Sars-CoV2 IgG and IgM antibody were detected using lateral flow method. RESULTS: We found that the absolute number of lymphocytes and monocytes was decreased starting at diagnosis and correlated with disease severity. Disease severity correlated with decreased NK and T cell. In severe COVID-19 cases, NK cell populations were strongly decreased over time in intubated patients while they recovered in patients who improved and were discharged. CD8+ were also decreased at disease onset and seemed to correlate with disease severity. A high percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed an exhausted phenotype. All patients tested at admission had IgM antibody responses irrespective of the course of the disease. Further analyses are ongoing. CONCLUSION: The characterization and role of the immune responses in COVID-19 evolution is still under investigation. Further characterization of viral and immune factors will help in identifying subjects at high risk of severe disease and targets for intervention.

QS regulates a range of bacterial behaviors, including biofilm formation, virulence, drug resistance mechanisms, and antibiotic tolerance. Enzymes capable of degrading signaling molecules can interfere in QS - a process termed quorum quenching (QQ). Remarkably, previous work reported some cases where enzymatic interference in QS was synergistic to antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The premise of combination therapy is attractive to fight against multidrug-resistant bacteria, yet comprehensive studies are lacking. Here we evaluate the effects of QS signal disruption on the antibiotic resistance profile of P. aeruginosa by testing 222 antibiotics and antibacterial compounds from 15 different classes. We found compelling evidence that QS signal disruption does indeed affect antibiotic resistance (40% of all tested compounds; 89/222), albeit not always synergistically (not synergistic for 48% of compounds with an effect (43/89)). For some tested antibiotics, like sulfathiazole and trimethoprim, we were able to relate the changes in resistance caused by QS signal disruption to the modulation of the expression of key genes of the folate biosynthetic pathway. Moreover, using a P. aeruginosa-based Caenorhabditis elegans killing model, we confirm that enzymatic QQ modulates the effects of antibiotics on P. aeruginosas pathogenicity in vivo. Altogether, these results show that signal disruption has profound and complex effects on the antibiotic resistance profile of P. aeruginosa. This work suggests that combination therapy including QQ and antibiotics should not be discussed globally but rather in case-by-case studies. IMPORTANCE Interference in bacterial Quorum Sensing (QS) is a promising approach to control microbial behavior. Of particular interest is the potential of this strategy to reduce biofilms and virulence of antibiotic resistant strains. Interestingly, several studies report synergistic interactions between antibiotic treatments and interference in QS. However, it is unclear whether this is a generality, let alone the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed synergies. Here, we provide a comprehensive description of combination treatment in the model organism, opportunistic human pathogen P. aeruginosa. Screening > 200 antimicrobials, and combining them to QS signals and disruption strategies, we show that there is no systematic synergy between these approaches in vitro, as well as in vivo, in a C. elegans infection model. Altogether, this work show that QS has complex connections to the antibiotic resistance profile of P. aeruginosa, and that combination treatment should not be discussed globally, but rather in case-by-case studies.","output":"Evidence for complex interplay between quorum sensing and antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The inconclusive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result causes confusion and delay for infection prevention precautions and patient management. We aimed to develop a quantitative algorithm to assess and interpret these inconclusive results. METHODS: We created a score-based algorithm by combining laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic data to evaluate 69 cases with inconclusive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assay (18 cases) and the TaqPath assay (51 cases). RESULTS: We determined 5 (28%) of 18 (CDC assay) and 20 (39%) of 51 (TaqPath assay) cases to be false positive. Lowering the cycle threshold cutoff from 40 to 37 in the TaqPath assay resulted in a dramatic reduction of the false-positive rate to 14%. We also showed testing of asymptomatic individuals is associated with a significantly higher probability of having a false-positive result. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial percentage of inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results can be false positive, especially among asymptomatic patients. The quantitative algorithm we created was shown to be effective and could provide a useful tool for clinicians and hospital epidemiologists to interpret inconclusive COVID-19 PCR results and provide clinical guidance when additional PCR or antibody test results are available.","output":"Clinical and Epidemiologic Evaluation of Inconclusive COVID-19 PCR Results Using a Quantitative Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Collaborative efforts between public and private entities such as academic institutions, governments, and pharmaceutical companies form an integral part of scientific research, and notable instances of such initiatives have been created within the life science community.

This calls for novel strategies when assessing and controlling a building's indoor air quality (IAQ). IAQ can generally be controlled by ventilation and/or policies to regulate human-building-interaction. However, in a building, occupants use rooms in different ways, and it may not be obvious which measure or combination of measures leads to a cost- and energy-effective solution ensuring good IAQ across the entire building. Therefore, in this article, we introduce a novel agent-based simulator, ArchABM, designed to assist in creating new or adapt existing buildings by estimating adequate room sizes, ventilation parameters and testing the effect of policies while taking into account IAQ as a result of complex human-building interaction patterns. A recently published aerosol model was adapted to calculate time-dependent carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and virus quanta concentrations in each room and inhaled $CO_2$ and virus quanta for each occupant over a day as a measure of physiological response. ArchABM is flexible regarding the aerosol model and the building layout due to its modular architecture, which allows implementing further models, any number and size of rooms, agents, and actions reflecting human-building interaction patterns. We present a use case based on a real floor plan and working schedules adopted in our research center.

In Alaska enzootic rabies persist in northern and western coastal areas. Only sporadic cases have occurred in areas outside of the regions considered enzootic for the virus, such as the interior of the state and urbanized regions. RESULTS: Here we examine the distribution of diagnosed rabies cases in Alaska, explicit in space and time. We use a geographic information system (GIS), 20 environmental data layers and provide a quantitative non-parsimonious estimate of the predicted ecological niche, based on data mining, machine learning and open access data. We identify ecological correlates and possible drivers that determine the ecological niche of rabies virus in Alaska. More specifically, our models show that rabies cases are closely associated with human infrastructure, and reveal an ecological niche in remote northern wilderness areas. Furthermore a model utilizing climate modeling suggests a reduction of the current ecological niche for detection of rabies virus in Alaska, a state that is disproportionately affected by a changing climate.

We assessed task- and domain-level dysfunction and relationships between clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Results. Patients scored significantly lower on delayed verbal memory, attention, and executive functioning than healthy controls and in each of these domains, 10-20% of patients scored below cutoff. Delayed Memory was particularly affected and a rather small proportion of its variace was explained by hospitalization ({beta} = -.67, p < .01) and age ({beta} = -.03, p < .01; R2adj. = .06).

BACKGROUND: The emergence of COVID-19 has affected the psychological and professional quality of life of the frontline health care workers, especially nurses. DESIGN: An online cross-sectional multicultural study. METHODS: A total of 1071 nurses from Turkey, Brazil, Spain and Italy were selected by convenience sampling. All participants were invited to complete the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and Professional Quality of Life Scale through online form from October 2020 to January 2021. RESULTS: It has been seen that nurses' fear of COVID-19 has been above the average and their professional quality of life has been affected negatively during the pandemic. Almost one out of three nurses (28.6%) thought of quitting their job during the pandemic. The majority of nurses (91.0%) thought their professional quality of life changed during the pandemic. The mean score of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale is higher in nurses who are working in Brazil, are female, have a chronic illness and are working in an outpatient clinic. Professional quality of life is even lower in nurses who are younger than 40, have a professional experience of less than 15 years, are working in Brazil and have concerns about themselves and their relatives because of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that there was a relationship between fear of COVID-19 and professional quality of life subscales of nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse leaders have an important role in supporting nurses actively during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and providing them with good working conditions, sufficient resources and rewards. In order for nurses to be able to cope with the challenges brought about by the pandemic, particularly the fear of COVID-19, and to avoid thoughts of quitting the profession, it would be beneficial to take certain administrative measures on institutional and territorial basis. It is recommended that employees with a chronic disease work in low-risk clinics, the number of nurses be increased in busier clinics, working hours be reduced and nurses be provided with psychosocial support by experts to cope with stress.

Especially in this urgent solution, where the workload of teachers has increased, some application difficulties have been identified in foreign language teaching. From this point of view, considering the foreign language education policy and planning, this study deals with the distance education practices of English teachers, the difficulties they encounter in the process, and their solution proposals. The research, which was designed as a qualitative study, was conducted with a case study design. The participants of the research are 13 English teachers working at the secondary school level in different districts of Northern Cyprus determined by the homogeneous sampling method. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews developed by the researchers. The qualitative data were analyzed with descriptive analysis. As a result of the interviews with the teachers, it has been determined that there are problems related to technology, students, online classes, and planning in English teaching carried out with distance education applications. Accordingly, the teachers offered their recommendations that could be a solution to the existing problems.","output":"Opinions of Teachers on Distance Education Applications in English Language Teaching Policies in Northern Cyprus During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To outline changes made to a neurology residency program in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) METHODS: In early March 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were announced in the United States New York City quickly became the epicenter of a global pandemic, and our training program needed to rapidly adapt to the increasing number of inpatient cases while being mindful of protecting providers and continuing education Many of these changes unfolded over days, including removing residents from outpatient services, minimizing the number of residents on inpatient services, deploying residents to medicine services and medical intensive care units, converting continuity clinic patient visits to virtual options, transforming didactics to online platforms only, and maintaining connectedness in an era of social distancing We have been able to accomplish this through daily virtual meetings among leadership, faculty, and residents RESULTS: Over time, our program has successfully rolled out initiatives to service the growing number of COVID-related inpatients while maintaining neurologic care for those in need and continuing our neurologic education curriculum CONCLUSION: It has been necessary and feasible for our residency training program to undergo rapid structural changes to adapt to a medical crisis The key ingredients in doing this successfully have been flexibility and teamwork We suspect that many of the implemented changes will persist long after the COVID-19 crisis has passed and will change the approach to neurologic and medical training","output":"Student's Perception of Online Learning during COVID Pandemic Training in neurology: Flexibility and adaptability of a neurology training program at the epicenter of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases are an important cause of human death. The study of the pathogenesis, spread regularity, and development trend of infectious diseases not only provides a theoretical basis for future research on infectious diseases, but also has practical guiding significance for the prevention and control of their spread. In this paper, a controlled differential equation and an objective function of infectious diseases were established by mathematical modeling. Based on cellular automata theory and a compartmental model, the SLIRDS (Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Susceptible) model was constructed, a model which can better reflect the actual infectious process of infectious diseases. Considering the spread of disease in different populations, the model combines population density, sex ratio, and age structure to set the evolution rules of the model. Finally, on the basis of the SLIRDS model, the complex spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was simulated. The simulation results are similar to the macroscopic characteristics of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in real life, thus the accuracy and rationality of the SLIRDS model are confirmed.","output":"Spread of Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis of Different Factors on Spread of Infectious Disease Based on Cellular Automata"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We design a very simple private-key encryption scheme whose decryption function is a rational function.

Preliminary data suggests treatment with rehabilitative exercise is beneficial, but most programs require frequent in-person visits, which is challenging for youth in rural areas, and has been made more difficult for all youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have adapted an exercise intervention to be delivered via telehealth using Zoom and personal fitness devices, which could ensure access to this type of treatment. Objective: The goal of this study was to assess feasibility and acceptability of a telehealth delivered exercise intervention for concussion, the Mobile Subthreshold Exercise Program (MSTEP), and collect pilot data regarding efficacy. Materials and Methods: All youth received the 6-week MSTEP intervention which included wearing a Fitbit and setting exercise heartrate and duration goals weekly over Zoom with the research assistant. Youth completed standardized measures of concussive symptoms (Health Behavior Inventory, HBI), fear-avoidance (Fear of Pain Questionnaire, FOPQ) and health-related quality of life (Pediatric Quality of life Assessment, PedsQL), as well as a structured qualitative exit interview. We examined change in measures over time using mixed effects modeling, controlling for age, sex, prior concussion and duration of symptoms. We coded qualitative interviews using Thematic analysis. Results: We recruited 19 subjects, 79% female with average age 14.3 (SD 2.2) and mean duration of symptoms 75.6 days (SD 33.7). Participants wore the Fitbit on 80% of days, and completed 94% of surveys and 96% of Zoom calls. Concussive symptoms (HBI) decreased significantly over the 6 week intervention (?10.6, 95%CI: ?16.0 to ?5.1) as did fear-avoidance (?21.6, 95%CI: ?29.8 to ?13.5). PedsQL improved significantly during the same time period (+15.1, 95%CI: 8.6C21.6). Approximately three-quarters (76%) of youth rated their care as excellent.

In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of Covid-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R_0). This also enables us to estimate the daily transmission rate ({beta}) that determines the effect of social distancing. We further estimate the reported fraction of symptomatic cases. The models are applied to the NCDC data on Covid-19 symptomatic and death cases from 27 February 2020 and 7 May 2020. In this period, the effective reproduction number is estimated with a minimum value of 0.18 and a maximum value of 1.78. Most importantly, the R(t) is strictly greater than one from April 13 till 7 May 2020. The R_0 is estimated to be 2.42 with credible interval: (2.37, 2.47). Comparing this with the R(t) shows that control measures are working but not effective enough to keep R(t) below one. Also, the estimated fractional reported symptomatic cases are between 10 to 50%.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study in all public schools in Catalonia was conducted using publicly available data assessing the association between the number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases among students and staff in weeks 1C2 (Sept 14-27th, 2020) of the academic year with school SARS-CoV-2 incidence among students in weeks 4C5. A multilevel Poisson regression model adjusted for the community incidence in the corresponding basic health area (BHA) and the type of school (primary or secondary), with random effects at the sanitary region and BHA levels, was performed. RESULTS: A total of 2184 public schools opened on September 14th with 778,715 students. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association between the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in a centre in weeks 1C2 and the SARS-CoV-2 school incidence among students in weeks 4C5 (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.074, 95% CI 1.044C1.105, p-value <0.001). The adjusted BHA incidence in the first two weeks was associated with school incidence in weeks 4C5 (RR 1.002, 95% CI 1.002C1.003, p-value <0.001). Secondary schools showed an increased incidence in weeks 4 and 5 (RR primary vs secondary 1.709 95% CI 1.599C1.897, p-value <0.001).

We aimed to assess how interventional radiology services (IR services) were impacted by the pandemic and describe adaptations to services and working patterns across the first two waves. METHODS: An anonymous six-part survey created using an online service was distributed as a single-use web link to 7125 members of the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe via email. Out of 450 respondents, 327 who completed the survey at least partially including 278 who completed the full survey were included into the analysis. RESULTS: Interventional radiologists (IRs) reported that the overall workload decreased a lot (18%) or mildly (36%) or remained stable (29%), and research activities were often delayed (30% in most/all projects, 33% in some projects). Extreme concerns about the health of families, patients and general public were reported by 43%, 34% and 40%, respectively, and 29% reported having experienced significant stress (25% quite a bit; 23% somewhat). Compared to the first wave, significant differences were seen regarding changes to working patterns, effect on emergency work, outpatient and day-case services in the second wave. A total of 59% of respondents felt that their organisation was better prepared for a third wave. A total of 19% and 39% reported that the changes implemented would be continued or potentially continued on a long-term basis. CONCLUSION: While the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected IR services in terms of workload, research activity and emotional burden, IRs seem to have improved the own perception of adaptation and preparation for further waves of the pandemic.

We investigated the degree to which adiposity modified the association between dietary inflammatory potential and incident T2DM. Methods Data from 6,016 US men in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study who completed a 3-day diet record were used. The inflammatory potential of diet was characterized by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII?), and adiposity was assessed with body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage (BF) and waist-to-height ratio. Inverse probability weights were used in modified Poisson regression models to examine whether adiposity modifies the relationship between the DII and T2DM, while accounting for selection bias from participants who were lost to follow-up. Results There were 336 incident cases of T2DM after a mean follow-up of 6.5 years. DII scores were not significantly associated with T2DM incidence in multivariable models, but point estimates were consistently elevated across increasing DII quartiles compared to the most anti-inflammatory DII quartile. In the model that evaluated BF, the term for overall effect modification was significant (p = 0.02), but there was no evidence of effect modification on the multiplicative and additive scales when examined further. Effect modification was not present for any other adiposity measures.

Strategies to mitigate the risk of potential aerosol-generating procedures(AGPs) have been promoted at a feverish pace, and significant effort has been made to optimize guidelines limitingaerosolization. This review summarizes the use of topical therapies as a perioperative infection control strategy, detailingefficacy, safety, and delivery options. Methods: A PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus database review of articles was conducted querying topical therapies, includingpovidone-iodine (PVP-I), chlorhexidine, saline, surfactants, alcohols, and interferon activity against coronaviruses, andsafety for peri-operative use. Results: Few clinical studies specifically investigate the in vivo viricidal activity of topical agents against SARS-CoV-2 in theperioperative setting. Of topical agents with viricidal potential, PVP-I is supported by the most robust investigations-invitro studies have shown that PVP-I solutions as low as 0.5% can completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 with 15 seconds ofcontact time, and solutions as low as 0.23% may neutralize SARS-CoV-2 homologues. Regarding safety, PVP-Iconcentrations of 2.5% and greater are associated with ciliotoxicity effects on human respiratory epithelial cells, but can betolerated up to 5% when administered intraorally, and up to 1% as a sinus irrigation formulation. As for other agents,preliminary studies show that chlorhexidine mouthwash may transiently decrease the SARS-CoV-2 virus load below thedetectable limit in saliva for 2 to 4 hours, but in isolation it is less effective than PVP-I in vitro studies. Furthermore,chlorhexidine and other antiseptics including ethanol have a worse safety profile than PVP-I, including increasedflammability and ototoxicity. Studies also show that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling leads to decreasedduration of illness, transmission, and viral shedding among patients with the common cold, including coronaviruses, andwas well tolerated barring some reports of nasal irritation, epistaxis, and headache. Conclusions: Several topical therapies, including PVP-I and hypertonic saline, may be at least temporarily effective atinactivating SARS-CoV-2 in the perioperative setting. However, these interventions are not without potential risks, includingciliotoxicity, which adversely impacts the mucociliary clearance of pathogens, and the efficacy of these agents is limited byavailable clinical data. However, thoughtful, evidence-based approaches should be considered as a sustainable option toreduce the risk of respiratory viral particle aerosolization in AGPs, such as endonasal skull base surgery.","output":"Topical therapies to prevent aerosolization of respiratory viral particles during endonasal skull base surgery: A practical review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research has suggested that sharing autobiographical memories in a coherent manner has a beneficial impact on consequent social reactions of listeners. In this experimental study, we were able to replicate earlier findings by demonstrating that listeners (N = 107) showed significantly more willingness to interact with, more social support towards, and a more positive attitude towards coherent than incoherent narrators. Remarkably, these beneficial effects of coherence were observed only for narratives about positive memories. Results are explained in the light of the relevance of positive memories for the social bonding function of autobiographical memory. Furthermore, earlier work was extended and refined by investigating effects of the individual constituting dimensions of coherence (context, chronology, theme) on social responses. In line with our predictions, the dimensions of chronology and theme were most important in impacting social responses of listeners. Possibly a reduction of the attraction effect due to increased effortful processing and reduced credibility due to insufficient emotional elaboration might explain these results respectively. Furthermore, social responses were worse when narratives were incoherent with regard to more than one dimension, in line with the expected additive effect. Overall, fully incoherent narratives, which had had low scores on context, chronology, and theme, had the most adverse effect on listeners' social responses.

Microbial investigations comprised sputum routine and mycobacterial cultures, blood and urine cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirate viral culture and polymerase chain reaction tests. Suspected aspiration pneumonitis was arbitrarily defined as NHAP without pathogens identified. RESULTS: After excluding lone bacteriuria, 108 episodes of NHAP in 94 patients were included. Twelve APs were detected in 11 patients. There was no clinical feature to distinguish between infections caused by APs and other pathogens. The commonest APs were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (3). No Legionella pneumophila was detected by urinary antigen test.

Main Outcome and Measures: We first examined biological sex, gender, and sexual identity differences (both components of the ampler concept of gender) in sleep, empathy, and mood disturbances. Then, we assessed changes in sleep and mood over the course of the isolation period and tested for significant relationships between sleep variables, mood, and empathy. Results: We analyzed complete data for 573 participants (112 males and 459 females, 2 undisclosed, mean  SD age = 25.9  10.5 years, mean  SD education = 16.2  2.9 years). As compared to males, female participants reported lower quality of sleep, lower sleep efficiency, and greater symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and trauma.

Sleep and mood disturbances increased over the course of the isolation period in the whole sample. The most significant predictors of poor quality of sleep and insomnia were depression, anxiety, and trauma scores, especially in females; higher empathy trait was associated with higher depression, anxiety, and trauma scores, perhaps indicating a more positive role of fear and anxiety responses to the pandemic crisis.

METHODS: Using PubMed, the authors searched for articles containing information on the utilization of MNs in inflammatory disorders as assessed from in vitro and animal studies, and in clinical trials, in terms of exerting anti-inflammatory actions. RESULTS: The retrieved literature provided evidence relating acute pathologic conditions, such as sepsis and pneumonia, with a number of redox endpoints of biological and clinical relevance. Among these findings, both ALA and CARN were effective in counteracting inflammation-associated redox biomarkers, while CoQ10 showed decreased levels in proinflammatory conditions. MN-associated antioxidant actions were applied in a number of acute disorders, mostly using one MN. The body of literature assessing the safety and the complementary roles of MNs taken together suggests an adjuvant role of MN combinations in counteracting oxidative stress in sepsis and other acute disorders, including COVID-19-associated pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The present state of art in the use of individual MNs in acute disorders suggests planning adjuvant therapy trials utilizing MN combinations aimed at counteracting proinflammatory conditions, as in the case of pneumonia and the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Potential roles of mitochondrial cofactors in the adjuvant mitigation of proinflammatory acute infections, as in the case of sepsis and COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Everyone is talking about coronavirus from last couple of months due to its exponential spread throughout the globe.

Major aim of the present research study is to look for possibilities and extents to which the SIR model fits the real data for the cases chosen from 01 April to 15 March, 2020, Pakistan. To further analyze qualitative behavior of the Caputo SIR model, uniqueness conditions under the Banach contraction principle are discussed and stability analysis with basic reproduction number is investigated using Ulam-Hyers and its generalized version. Best parameters have been obtained via nonlinear least-squares curve fitting technique. The infectious compartment of the Caputo SIR model fits the real data better than classical version of the SIR model [4]. Average absolute relative error under the Caputo operator is about 48% smaller than the one obtained in the classical case ( = 1).

In this study, we aimed to assess the dynamics of IgG antibody titers in recovered COVID-19 patients over 14 months after mild and moderately severe infection using two FDA-approved immunoassays against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (NCP)and anti-spike-receptor binding domain (S-RBD) through sequential serological tests at different time points. The demographics and clinical profile, that might be associated with the magnitude and longevity of antibody response were also analyzed. Our results suggest antibody persistency in 31 out of 32 (96.8%) subjects at 14 months post-infection. A significant positive association was observed between disease severity and anti-S-RBD IgG titers at 14 months. Patients who reported a loss of smell and taste during the clinical course of the disease also developed significantly better antibody titers. Patients who were seronegative for anti-NCP IgG (n=7) at 10 months, were found to be seropositive for anti-S-RBD IgG at 12,13 and 14 months emphasizing on higher false-negative rate for N protein-based antibody assays when compared with the anti-S-RBD assays. This study calls for prioritizing vaccination for naive individuals (with no previous history of COVID-19 infection) and recovered but antibody-negative individuals instead of vaccination for all. This strategy would be helpful in low-resource settings and areas experiencing vaccine shortages by saving time, effort, and assets that could be sourced for the vulnerable populations.","output":"Longitudinal observation of antibody responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection at 14 months"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conventional approaches to isolate and characterize nanobodies are laborious.

A prospective, 2-arm, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase I-II clinical trial including 214 patients was performed. The following two outcomes were evaluated during the 20-day follow-up: i) The number of patients with disease progression; and ii) the patient acceptable symptom state. Serial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 naso/oro-pharyngeal detection by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR was performed in certain patients of the experimental group. Biochemical and hematologic parameters, as well as adverse effects, were also evaluated in the experimental group. The experimental treatment decreased the risk of hospitalization by 89% [adjusted relative risk (RR)=0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-0.37, P<0.001] and the risk of death by 96% (adjusted RR=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.42, P=0.007) and also resulted in an 18-fold higher probability of achieving an acceptable symptom state on day 5 (adjusted RR=18.14, 95% CI: 7.29-45.09, P<0.001), compared with usual medical care alone. Overall, neutral electrolyzed saline solution was better than usual medical care alone. Of the patients analyzed, >50% were negative for the virus as detected by RT-qPCR in naso/oro-pharyngeal samples on day 4, with only a small number of positive patients on day 6. Clinical improvement correlated with a decrease in C-reactive protein, aberrant monocytes and increased lymphocytes and platelets. Cortisol and testosterone levels were also evaluated and a decrease in cortisol levels and an increase in the testosterone-cortisol ratio were observed on days 2 and 4. The experimental treatment produced no serious adverse effects. In conclusion, neutral electrolyzed saline solution markedly reduced the symptomatology and risk of progression in ambulatory patients with COVID-19.

In this work, the reviews of previous research on the quality of water produced by passive solar stills and their productivities in initial basin water temperatures were first presented and discussed. The next review discussed some recent studies on the performances of small-scale solar stills integrated with SDCs (with and without sun-tracking systems (STSs)) to observe the operating temperatures from early hours until the end of operations, daily water yield, and cost per liter. Based on these findings, it was revealed that SDCs with STSs indicated an instant increase in the absorber water temperature up to 70 C at the starting point of the experiments in which this temperature range marked the unbearable survival of the pathogenic organisms and viruses, particularly the recent SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, disinfection was also observed when the absorbers water temperature reached beyond the boiling point until the end of operations. This indicates the effectiveness of SDCs with STS in reflecting a large amount of suns rays and heat to the small-scale absorbers and providing higher operating absorbers temperatures compared to immobile SDCs. Daily productivities and costs per liter of the SDCs with STSs were found to be higher and lower than those of the other previous passive and active solar stills. Therefore, it is recommended that small-scale absorbers integrated with SDCs and STS can be used as a cost-effective and reliable method to produce hygienic pathogen-free water for the communities in remote and rural areas which encounter water scarcity and abundant annual bright sunshine hours.","output":"Clean Water Production Enhancement through the Integration of Small-Scale Solar Stills with Solar Dish Concentrators (SDCs)A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Digital teaching formats have seen increased use, and not just since the beginning of the pandemic.

Studies were identified from existing meta-analyses performed by the World Health Organization. Main outcomes and measures For both drugs, we calculated the posterior probabilities of an absolute decrease in mortality versus control patients by subgroups based on oxygen requirements. To contextualize, we quantified the probability of at least a 1, 2, or 5% absolute mortality decrease. Results Among patients requiring ventilation, remdesivir had only a 4% probability of 1% or greater mortality benefit compared to 93% for corticosteroids. For patients requiring supplemental oxygen, the probability of 1% or greater survival benefit was 81% for remdesivir compared to 93% for dexamethasone. Finally, for patients without oxygen requirements, the probabilities of 1% or greater mortality benefit were 29% for remdesivir and 4% for dexamethasone. Conclusions and relevance Using a Bayesian analytic approach, remdesivir had a low probability of achieving a clinically meaningful reduction in mortality, except for patients requiring supplemental oxygen.

The drug did not disrupt the morphology of the Golgi complex in PtK1 cells, as judged by immunofluorescence using antibodies to 58- (58K) and 110-kD (beta-COP) Golgi proteins, and by fluorescence microscopy of live cells labeled with C6-NBD-ceramide. In addition, BFA did not inhibit protein secretion, not alter the kinetics or extent of glycosylation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G-protein) in VSV- infected PtK1 cells. To explore the mechanism of resistance to BFA, PtK1 cells were fused with BFA-sensitive CV-1 cells that had been infected with a recombinant SV-40 strain containing the gene for VSV G- protein and, at various times following fusion, the cultures were exposed to BFA. Shortly after cell fusion, heterokaryons contained one Golgi complex associated with each nucleus. Golgi membranes derived from CV-1 cells were sensitive to BFA, whereas those of PtK1 origin were BFA resistant. A few hours after fusion, most heterokaryons contained a single, large Golgi apparatus that was resistant to BFA and contained CV-1 galactosyltransferase. In unfused cells that had been perforated using nitrocellulose filters, retention of beta-COP on the Golgi was optimal in the presence of cytosol, ATP, and GTP. In perforated cell models of the BFA-sensitive MA104 line, BFA caused beta- COP to be released from the Golgi complex in the presence of nucleotides, and either MA104 or PtK1 cytosol. In contrast, when perforated PtK1 cells were incubated with BFA, nucleotides, and cytosol from either cell type, beta-COP remained bound to the Golgi complex. We conclude that PtK1 cells contain a nondiffusible factor, which is located on or very close to the Golgi complex, and confers a dominant resistance to BFA. It is possible that this factor is homologous to the target of BFA in cells that are sensitive to the drug.","output":"PtK1 cells contain a nondiffusible, dominant factor that makes the Golgi apparatus resistant to brefeldin A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has provided yet more evidence that misinformation can have devastating consequences, writes Annalee Newitz","output":"Should social media come with a health warning?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus that is identified as the cause of pandemic situation inFebruary2020 and affects adults and children with variable presentation and outcome.

Public mental health clinicians face increased demands, experience economic stress, and treat underresourced patients disproportionately burdened by trauma. The authors sought to understand clinicians' current economic and psychological conditions and the relationship of these conditions to the delivery of an evidence-based intervention (EBI) designed to treat posttraumatic stress disorder among youths. METHODS In July 2020, 49 public mental health clinicians from 16 Philadelphia clinics who were trained in an EBI, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), were surveyed by e-mail. Respondents reported on their economic precarity, financial strain, burnout, secondary traumatic stress (i.e., the stress response associated with caring for people exposed to trauma), and TF-CBT use. Associations between clinicians' job-related stressors and their use of TF-CBT were examined with mixed models. Content coding was used to organize clinicians' open-ended responses to questions regarding financial strain related to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Clinicians' economic precarity, financial strain, and job-related stress were high; 37% of clinicians were independent contractors, 44% of whom wanted a salaried position. Of 37 clinicians with education debt, 38% reported owing $100,000. In the past year, 29% of clinicians reported lack of personal mental health care because of cost, and 22% met the cutoff for experiencing secondary traumatic stress symptoms. Education debt was negatively associated with use of TF-CBT (p<0.001).

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce fibroblast proliferation and differentiation through activation of phosphoinositide3-Kinase (PI3-K) pathway. However, the detail mechanism by which LPS contributes to the development of lung fibrosis is not clearly understood. To investigate the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a PI3-K pathway suppressor, on LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, collagen secretion and activation of PI3-K, we transfected PTEN overexpression lentivirus into cultured mouse lung fibroblasts with or without LPS treatment to evaluate proliferation by MTT and Flow cytometry assays. Expression of PTEN, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) and phosphorylation of Akt were determined by Western-blot or real-time RT-PCR assays. The PTEN phosphorylation activity was measured by a malachite green-based assay. The content of C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) in cell culture supernatants was examined by ELISA. RESULTS: We found that overexpression of PTEN effectively increased expression and phosphatase activity of PTEN, and concomitantly inhibited LPS-induced fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion. Phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta protein expression levels in the LPS-induced PTEN overexpression transfected cells were significantly lower than those in the LPS-induced non-transfected cells, which can be reversed by the PTEN inhibitor, bpV(phen). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results show that overexpression and induced phosphatase activity of PTEN inhibits LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion through inactivation of PI3-K-Akt-GSK3beta signaling pathways, which can be abrogated by a selective PTEN inhibitor. Thus, expression and phosphatase activity of PTEN could be a potential therapeutic target for LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Compared with PTEN expression level, phosphatase activity of PTEN is more crucial in affecting lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion.","output":"Overexpression of PTEN suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion through inhibition of the PI3-K-Akt-GSK3beta pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning creates new opportunities to design digital health interventions for youth at risk for acquiring HIV (YARH), capitalizing on YARH's health information seeking on the internet. To date, researchers have focused on descriptive analyses that associate individual factors with health-seeking behaviors, without estimating of the strength of these predictive models. We developed predictive models by applying machine learning methods (i.e., elastic net and lasso regression models) to YARH's self-reports of internet use. The YARH were aged 14-24 years old (N = 1287) from Los Angeles and New Orleans. Models were fit to three binary indicators of YARH's lifetime internet searches for general health, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and social service information. YARH responses regarding internet health information seeking were fed into machine learning models with potential predictor variables based on findings from previous research, including sociodemographic characteristics, sexual and gender minority identity, healthcare access and engagement, sexual behavior, substance use, and mental health. About half of the YARH reported seeking general health and SRH information and 26% sought social service information. Areas under the ROC curve (&#8805; .75) indicated strong predictive models and results were consistent with the existing literature. For example, higher education and sexual minority identification was associated with seeking general health, SRH, and social service information. New findings also emerged. Cisgender identity versus transgender and non-binary identities was associated with lower odds of general health, SRH, and social service information seeking. Experiencing intimate partner violence was associated with higher odds of seeking general health, SRH, and social service information.

The governments alone cannot prevent the spread of this pandemic without creating a sensitive public opinion and cooperation. Therefore, this study analyzed the knowledge, behavior, and precautionary measures taken by the general public to protect themselves from COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY For this purpose, snowball sampling technique was used to collect data from 401 respondents through an online survey in the Punjab province of Pakistan. A Multivariate Probit Model was used to determine the factors affecting the choice of precautionary measures to avoid COVID-19 infection. RESULTS Majority of the respondents (58.1%) belonged to urban areas in this study. The urban respondents had higher knowledge about Coronavirus disease as compared to rural respondents. Similarly, the hygienic behavior of urban respondents was better than rural respondents. But unavailability of hygienic material (mask and hand sanitizer) was the main problem faced by the general public. Public transportation was considered the most risk-prone place to COVID-19 by the respondents. Majority of the respondents perceived medium to highest risk from COVID-19, and it was found one of the most influential factors affecting the adoption of precautionary measures along with knowledge of this pandemic.

Considering the need, this study has analyzed the gender wise pattern of symptoms, morbidity, multimorbidity, and mortality due to COVID-19 in Karnataka, India. Methods: We used patient-level raw data from 09th March to 05th September 2020. We have used descriptive statistics such as frequency, and percentage distribution along with the latent class analysis (LCA) to carry out this analysis. Findings: A total of 78,983 COVID-19 patients comprising of 63.6% males and 36.4% females were included in the study. Out of total patients, 10.1% were reported as deceased from which 68.4% were males and 31.6% females.

Males tend to have a higher risk of severe infection and mortality in general while females suffering from comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension are at higher risk of mortality due to COVID-19 than male counterparts. Latent class analysis further reflected a higher proportion of females with two or more symptoms whereas more males were found having more than two comorbidities.Interpretation: Given the differences in lethality between the two genders, we believe that studying gender differentials extensively will help in finding the root causes of the gender differentials in COVID-19 pandemic and help policymakers in finding suitable interventions to reduce the spread.","output":"Gendered Differentials in Symptoms, Morbidity, and Case Fatality Rate in COVID-19 Pandemic in India: A Study of Karnataka State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improving employee performance is one of the main levers for companies to achieve their goals.

BackgroundThe distribution of the duration that clinical cases of COVID-19 occupy hospital beds (the length of stay) is a key factor in determining how incident caseloads translate into health system burden as measured through ward and ICU occupancy. ResultsUsing data on the hospital stays of 19,574 individuals, we performed a competing-risk survival analysis of COVID-19 clinical progression. During the mixed Omicron-Delta epidemic, we found that the mean length of stay for individuals who were discharged directly from ward without an ICU stay was, for age groups 0-39, 40-69 and 70+ respectively, 2.16 (95% CI: 2.12-2.21), 3.93 (95% CI: 3.78-4.07) and 7.61 days (95% CI: 7.31-8.01), compared to 3.60 (95% CI: 3.48-3.81), 5.78 (95% CI: 5.59-5.99) and 12.31 days (95% CI: 11.75-12.95) across the preceding Delta epidemic (15 Jul 2021 - 15 Dec 2021).

Flu vaccination is one of the major strategies for preventing it, especially among healthcare workers (HCWs), to avoid onward transmission to patients and colleagues. The aim of this research is to analyze the flu vaccination coverage rate among HCWs and to study which factors conditioned their adherence. The observational study was conducted in an Italian teaching hospital located in Rome (Italy) and data were collected from October to December 2020. A total of 6,568 HCWs was included considering physicians, nurses and other HCWs as job categories. Age class, gender and job category variables were analyzed. Statistically significant differences among groups were tested through 2 test. Univariate analyses and a multivariate logistic regression (p < 0.05) were performed to assess differences in flu vaccination adherence. The flu vaccination coverage rate was 60.94%. Considering the job categories, physicians reached the highest coverage (76.09%) followed by others HCWs (64.25%) and nurses (49.09%). According to the logistic regression, belonging to 20-40 age class was significantly associated with higher flu vaccination adherence, as well as being nurses (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.22-0.31) or other HCWs (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.40-0.58). Findings showed an encouraging vaccination coverage rate among HCWs. Deeper knowledge of the value of vaccination among younger HCWs could be probably a reason for higher adherence as well as the wrong perception of being at low risk of illness or transmitting infections may explains job categories differences.

The COVID-19-related restrictions on visiting the hospital for antenatal check-up and procedures may be distressing for them. The present study aims at assessing the level of anxiety and risk perception of pregnant women during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study included all pregnant women who were above 18 years of age, irrespective of their gestational age. They were administered the pre-designed, pre-tested questionnaire via face-to-face interview. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and its influence on womens experience including her worries were collected. Data analysis was done using SPSS software version 22. RESULTS: A total of 130 pregnant women with a mean maternal age of 26.1  6.5 years were enrolled in the study. The mean gestational age of the women was 19  4.7 weeks and most of them were in the second trimester (48.5%). Most of the pregnant women encountered the adverse socioeconomic influence of COVID-19 on their daily life (55.6% somewhat, 9.1% moderately so, 1.1% very much). Majority of them reported that they had limited their social activities (78.5%) and amorous relationship with their partner (30.8%). Also, around 59.2% of antenatal women experienced a moderate level and 40.7% had a mild level of anxiety.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately affected marginalized populations. Older adults, people experiencing unstable housing, racial and ethnic minorities and immigrants are potentially at increased risk for infection and severe complications from COVID-19. The direct and societal effects of the pandemic may increase risk of incident kidney disease and lead to worse outcomes for those with kidney disease. The rapid transition to telemedicine potentially limits access to care for older adults, immigrants, and people experiencing unstable housing. The economic impact of the pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on women, minorities and immigrants, which may limit their ability to manage kidney disease, and lead to complications or kidney disease progression.

This longitudinal study investigated the social participation, social inclusion and psychological well-being in adults with and without mental disorders before the beginning of the pandemic, as well as during and after strict lockdown restrictions in Germany. METHODS: The sample (n = 106) consisted of three groups: participants with a chronic mental disorder, with an acute mental disorder, and without a mental disorder at the time of the initial survey. Parameters of interest were assessed using the Measure of Participation and Social Inclusion for Use in People with a Chronic Mental Disorder (F-INK), the Index for the Assessment of Health Impairments (IMET) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). RESULTS: The perceived impairments in social participation and the associated changes in behaviour varied depending on the presence of a mental disorder at the time of the initial survey and were largely temporary, i.e. limited to the period of strict lockdown restrictions. We found no further detrimental effects on mental health 4 weeks after lockdown or later, when a policy of physical distancing was in place. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings suggest a general resilience to the official restrictions and measures as well as the pandemic itself. However, further efforts are needed to improve the situation of people with chronic mental disorders and their limited opportunities for social participation.","output":"A longitudinal study on the COVID-19 pandemic and its divergent effects on social participation and mental health across different study groups with and without mental disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the popularity of the term impression management (IM) in the literature, there is no consensus as how different types of IM (direct vs. indirect) and modes of interaction (face-to-face vs. online) promote career-related outcomes. While most empirical studies focus on direct IM, individuals engage in both types of IM and interaction modes, particularly indirect IM in the online context. Indeed, recent developments suggest that online interactions now prevail over face-to-face interactions, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, this study presents the first systematic literature review that differentiates between types of IM (direct vs. indirect) and modes of interaction (face-to-face vs. online) in a career development perspective. The review shows that direct IM is more widely studied in the face-to-face than online interaction mode, while indirect IM is neglected in both interaction modes.

This pattern of race-ethnic disparities emerging throughout the United States raises the question of what social factors may influence spread of a highly transmissible novel coronavirus. The purpose of this study is to describe race-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities associated with COVID-19 in patients in our community in Orange County, California and understand the role of individual-level factors, neighborhood-level factors, and access to care on outcomes. Methods: This is a case-series of COVID-19 patients from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) across six-weeks between 3/12/2020 and 4/22/2020. Note, California's shelter-in-place order began on 3/19/2020. Individual-level factors included race-ethnicity status were recorded. Neighborhood-level factors from census tracts included median household income, mean household size, proportion without a college degree, proportion working from home, and proportion without health insurance were also recorded. Results: A total of 210-patients tested were COVID-19 positive, of which 73.3% (154/210) resided in Orange County. Hispanic/Latinx patients residing in census tracts below the median income demonstrated exponential growth (rate = 55.9%, R2 = 0.9742) during the study period. In addition, there was a significant difference for both race-ethnic (p < 0.001) and income bracket (p = 0.001) distributions prior to and after California's shelter-in-place. In addition, the percentage of individuals residing in neighborhoods with denser households (p = 0.046), lower levels of college graduation (p < 0.001), health insurance coverage (p = 0.01), and ability to work from home (p < 0.001) significantly increased over the same timeframe.

Methods A retrospective analysis of the records of the Information System of the Epidemiological Surveillance of Influenza of the Health Ministry of Brazil was performed. It included the data of female patients aged 10 to 49 years hospitalized because of severe COVID-19 disease (RT-PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2), from February 17, 2020, to January 02, 2021. They were separated into 3 groups: pregnant, puerperal, and neither pregnant nor puerperal. General comparisons and then adjustments for confounding variables (propensity score matching [PSM]) were made, using demographic and clinical characteristics, disease progression (admission to the intensive care unit [ICU] and invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support), and outcome (cure or death). Deaths were analyzed in each group according to comorbidities, invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support, and admission to the ICU. Results As many as 40,640 reproductive age women hospitalized for COVID-19 were identified: 3,372 were pregnant, 794 were puerperal, and 36,474 were neither pregnant nor puerperal. Groups were significantly different in terms of demographic data and comorbidities. Pregnant and puerperal women were less likely to be symptomatic than the women who were neither one nor the other. Pregnant women, however, had a higher frequency of cough, anosmia, and ageusia. Puerperal women had a worse prognosis than pregnant women with respect to admission to the ICU, invasive ventilatory support, and death.

Demographic and baseline health information, including concomitant conditions; clinical characteristics related to the ED visit and complementary test results; and treatments were recorded throughout the episode in the ED. We calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios for risk of in-hospital death and a composite outcome consisting of the following events: intensive care unit admission, orotracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. The logistic regression models were constructed with 3 groups of independent variables: the demographic and baseline health characteristics, clinical characteristics and complementary test results related to the ED episode, and treatments. RESULTS The mean (SD) age of patients was 62 (18) years. Most had high- or low-grade fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea. The most common concomitant conditions were cardiovascular diseases, followed by respiratory diseases and cancer. Baseline patient characteristics that showed a direct and independent association with worse outcome (death and the composite outcome) were age and obesity. Clinical variables directly associated with worse outcomes were impaired consciousness and pulmonary crackles; headache was inversely associated with worse outcomes. Complementary test findings that were directly associated with outcomes were bilateral lung infiltrates, lymphopenia, a high platelet count, a D-dimer concentration over 500 mg/dL, and a lactate-dehydrogenase concentration over 250 IU/L in blood.

The novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China initially and in a short time crossed the European borders. After mitigating the epidemic in China, Italy became one of the most COVID-19 affected countries worldwide. International travelers are important sources of infectious diseases and a possible source of epidemic. Due to its political, geographic, and cultural similarities, Italy is one of the main economic partners of Southeast European (SEE) countries.

METHODS: 227 pneumonia patients who visited the fever clinics in Shanghai General Hospital and 97 hospitalized COVID-19 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center were involved in a retrospective research study. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected. The trend of EOS level in COVID-19 patients and comparison among patients with different severity were summarized. RESULTS: The majority of COVID-19 patients (71.7%) had a decrease in circulating EOS counts, which was significantly more frequent than other types of pneumonia patients. EOS counts had good value for COVID-19 prediction, even higher when combined with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Patients with low EOS counts at admission were more likely to have fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath, with more lesions in chest CT and radiographic aggravation, and longer length of hospital stay and course of disease than those with normal EOS counts. Circulating EOS level gradually increased over the time, and was synchronous with the improvement in chest CT (12 days vs 13 days, P = .07), later than that of body temperature (12 days vs 10 days, P = .014), but earlier than that of the negative conversion of nucleic acid assays (12 days vs 17 days, P = .001).

We have analysed the kidney transplants carried out between March 9 and June 9, 2020, comparing these data with the numbers of procedures performed in the two previous years. Moreover, we have considered the possibility of performing living donor transplants during a worldwide pandemic. RESULTS: From March 9, 2020, when the Italian lockdown begun, till June 9, 2020, five kidney transplants have been performed at our transplant center in Naples, all from deceased donors. The donors and the recipients have been screened for COVID-19 infection, and the patients, all asymptomatic, followed strict preventive measures and were fully informed about the risks of surgery and immunosuppression during a pandemic. All the transplanted patients remained COVID negative during the follow-up. The number of transplants performed has been constant compared to the same months of 2018 and 2019. In agreement with the patients, we decided to postpone living donor transplants to a period of greater control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in Italy. CONCLUSION: Deceased donor kidney transplantation should continue, especially in a region with moderate risk, like Campania, with a more careful selection of donors and recipients, preferring standard donors and recipients without severe comorbidities.

Consequently, final test performance 2 days later was lower for difficult items versus easy items, and performance was lower in the self-regulated learning group than in an experimenter-controlled comparison group (in Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we tested hypotheses for why participants reached a similar number of correct recalls for both easy and difficult items. Three new groups included different scaffolds aimed at minimizing potential barriers to effective regulation.

Dexamethasone would limit the production of and damaging effect of the cytokines, but will also inhibit the protective function of T cells and block B cells from making antibodies, potentially leading to increased plasma viral load that will persist after a patient survives SARS. Moreover, dexamethasone would block macrophages from clearing secondary, nosocomial, infections. Hence, dexamethasone may be useful for the short-term in severe, intubated, COVID-19 patients, but could be outright dangerous during recovery since the virus will not only persist, but the body will be prevented from generating protective antibodies. Instead, a pulse of intravenous dexamethasone may be followed by administration of nebulized triamcinolone (6 times as active as cortisone) to concentrate in the lungs only. These corticosteroids could be given together with the natural flavonoid luteolin because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, especially its ability to inhibit mast cells, which are the main source of cytokines in the lungs. At the end, we should remember that \\"The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease\\" [Sir William Osler's (1849-1919)].","output":"Dexamethasone for COVID-19?

Globally, there have been 71,581,532 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,618,374 deaths, reported to World Health Organization (data retrieved on December 16, 2020). Currently, no treatment modalities for COVID-19 (e.g., vaccines or antiviral drugs) with confirmed efficacy and safety are available. Although the possibilities and relevant challenges of some alternatives (e.g., use of stem cells as immunomodulators) have been proposed, the personal protective equipment is still the only way to protect and lower infection rates of COVID-19 among healthcare workers and airway managers (intubators). In this article, we described the combined use of a plastic sheet as a barrier with the intubating stylet for tracheal intubation in patients needing mechanical ventilation. Although conventional or video-assisted laryngoscopy is more popular and familiar to other groups around the world, we believe that the video-assisted intubating stylet technique is much easier to learn and master. Advantages of the video stylet include the creation of greater working distance between intubator and patient, less airway stimulation, and less pharyngeal space needed for endotracheal tube advancement. All the above features make this technique reliable and superior to other devices, especially when a difficult airway is encountered in COVID scenario. Meanwhile, we proposed the use of a flexible and transparent plastic sheet to serve as a barrier against aerosol and droplet spread during airway management. We demonstrated that the use of a plastic sheet would not interfere or hinder the intubator's maneuvers during endotracheal intubation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the plastic sheet was effective in preventing the spread of mist and water spray in simulation models with a mannequin. In our experience, we found that this technique most effectively protected the intubator and other operating room personnel from infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Application of Plastic Sheet Barrier and Video Intubating Stylet to Protect Tracheal Intubators During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Taiwan Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trajectory studies of the COVID-19 pandemic have described patterns of symptoms over time.

Using a sample of racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse adults participating in a randomized clinical trial with pre-existing moderate to severe depression and/or anxiety symptoms, we compare symptom patterns before and during COVID-19; characterize symptom trajectories over a 20-week follow-up period; and evaluate whether social determinants are associated with within and between person differences in symptom trajectories. Data were collected before and during COVID-19 in Massachusetts and North Carolina. On average, depression and anxiety symptoms did not seem to worsen during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. During COVID-19, anxiety scores at follow-up were higher for participants with baseline food insecurity (vs no food insecurity). Depression scores at follow-up were higher for participants with food insecurity and for those with utilities insecurity (vs no insecurity). Participants with child or family care responsibilities at baseline had depression symptoms decreasing at a slower rate over time than those without these responsibilities.

Our two best performing absolute atherosclerotic risk prediction models provided higher performance than Framingham and QRisk3. Using a subset of 25 risk factors identified with feature selection, our reduced model achieves similar performance while being less complex. Further, it is interpretable, actionable and highly generalizable.

Almost 25 years later, Richard Pattle, John Clements and Chris Macklin, each working on the effects of nerve gases on the lungs, contributed to the understanding of the physiology of pulmonary surfactant. About 5 years later Mary Ellen Avery and Jere Mead published convincing evidence that preterm neonates dying of hyaline membrane disease (respiratory distress syndrome, RDS) had a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant. The first trials of nebulized synthetic (protein-free) surfactant to prevent RDS were published soon after Patrick Bouvier Kennedy (son of President John F Kennedy) died of this disorder after treatment in Boston. These trials were unsuccessful; however, Goran Enhorning and Bengt Robertson in the early 1970s demonstrated that natural surfactants (containing proteins) were effective in an immature rabbit model of RDS. Soon after this Forrest Adams showed that a natural surfactant was also effective in an immature lamb model. Working with him was Tetsuro Fujiwara who 2 years later, after returning to Japan, published the seminal article reporting the responses of 10 preterm infants with RDS to a bolus of modified bovine surfactant. During the 1980s there were numerous randomized controlled trials of many different natural and synthetic surfactants, demonstrating reductions in pulmonary air leaks and neonatal mortality. Subsequently natural surfactants were shown to be superior to the protein-free synthetic products. Recently there have been a number of randomized trials comparing different natural surfactant preparations. Commercially available bovine surfactants may have similar efficacy but there is some evidence that a porcine surfactant used to treat RDS with an initial dose of 200 mg per kg is more effective than a bovine surfactant used in an initial dose of 100 mg per kg. Bovine and porcine surfactants have not been compared in trials of prophylaxis. Very recently a new synthetic surfactant with a surfactant protein mimic has been compared with other commercially available natural and synthetic surfactants in two trials. The new surfactant may be superior to one of the older protein-free synthetic surfactants but there is no evidence of its superiority over established natural products and it is currently not approved for clinical use. A number of other new synthetic surfactants have been tested in animal models or in treatment of adults with ARDS, but so far there have been no reports of treatment of neonatal RDS. Natural surfactants work best if given by a rapid bolus into the lungs but less invasive methods such as a laryngeal mask, pharyngeal deposition or rapid extubation to CPAP have showed promise. Unfortunately, delivery of surfactant by nebulization has so far been ineffective. Surfactant treatment has been tried in a number of other neonatal respiratory disorders but only infants with meconium aspiration seem to benefit although larger and more frequent doses are probably needed to demonstrate improved lung function. A surfactant protocol based upon early treatment and CPAP is suggested for very preterm infants. Earlier treatment may improve survival rates for these infants; however, there is a risk of increasing the prevalence of milder forms of chronic lung disease. Nevertheless, surfactant therapy has been a major contribution to care of the preterm newborn during the past 25 years.","output":"Surfactants: past, present and future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article briefly describes the role of new technologies in the response strategy against the CoViD-19 emergency, focusing on the different instruments implemented to slow down the spread of the disease Taking the contact tracing app Immuni, developed by the Italian government as a case study, the paper reflects on how exceptions to general rules should be designed in order to best ensure the protection of fundamental rights","output":"The Rule, the Exception, and the Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Residents in facilities such as nursing homes (NHs) are particularly vulnerable to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

In this study, we found that pterostilbene inhibited proliferation, induced intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and caused S phase arrest, inhibited migration and excessive invasion in glioma cells. Pretreatment with the pan-caspase-inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK attenuated the PTE-induced apoptosis of glioma cells. Moreover, PTE significantly increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Inhibition of ROS with N-acetyl-L-cysteine not only rescued PTE-induced reduction of cellular viability but also prevented glioma cell apoptosis. We also discovered ERK 1/2 and JNK signaling pathways were activated by PTE and contributed to induce glioma cell apoptosis. In addition, specific inhibitors of ERK 1/2 and JNK attenuated PTE-induced apoptosis. Besides, PTE significantly reduced tumor volume and prolonged median survival of tumor-bearing rats in vivo.

PH-251 inhibited the biosynthesis of leukotriene C4 (LTC4), as well as degranulation of IgE/allergen-activated bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells (BMMC) in vitro. In contrast, zileuton (the prototype 5-LO inhibitor) inhibited leukotriene generation, but not degranulation. Consistent with its dual activity, compound PH-251 also significantly inhibited both the early and the late anaphylactic contractions of guinea pig lung parenchymal strip, whereas zileuton inhibited only the late (leukotriene-dependent) contractions. Comparative structure-activity analysis of PH-251 and its structural analogues showed that the anti-degranulation effect appeared to be dependent on the length of the straight-chain hydrocarbon substitution on the hydroxamic acid moiety. In the in vivo studies, PH-251 (3-30 mg/kg s.c.) strongly inhibited various components of zymosan-induced peritonitis - a typical non-allergic LT-dependent animal model of inflammation. In the mouse allergic asthma model, the compound significantly inhibited allergen-induced bronchial eosinophilic inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness to inhaled methacholine.

METHODS: We combined SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing data from England between 01-September-2020 and 28-February-2021. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate relationships between PCR-confirmed infection in contacts of community-diagnosed cases and index case viral load, S gene target failure (proxy for B.1.1.7 infection), demographics, SARS-CoV-2 incidence, social deprivation, and contact event type. We used LFD performance to simulate the proportion of cases with a PCR-positive contact expected to be detected using one of four LFDs. RESULTS: 231,498/2,474,066(9%) contacts of 1,064,004 index cases tested PCR-positive. PCR-positive results in contacts independently increased with higher case viral loads (lower Ct values) e.g., 11.7%(95%CI 11.5-12.0%) at Ct=15 and 4.5%(4.4-4.6%) at Ct=30. B.1.1.7 infection increased PCR-positive results by ~50%, (e.g. 1.55-fold, 95%CI 1.49-1.61, at Ct=20). PCR-positive results were most common in household contacts (at Ct=20.1, 8.7%[95%CI 8.6-8.9%]), followed by household visitors (7.1%[6.8-7.3%]), contacts at events/activities (5.2%[4.9-5.4%]), work/education (4.6%[4.4-4.8%]), and least common after outdoor contact (2.9%[2.3-3.8%]).

The accuracy of Tc estimates was evaluated based on bias, root mean square deviation (RMSD), RMSD based on mean values (RMSD-Mean), and standard deviation fall-in percentage (SDP). Under in-sample analysis, the optimized model achieved bias, RMSD, RMSD-Mean and SDP of 0.01C, 0.39C, 0.14C and 99%, respectively. When externally validated against two sets of unseen data, the model achieved comparable bias, RMSD, RMSD-Mean and SDP values of 0.06C, 0.32C, 0.13C, 92% and 0.08C, 0.39C, 0.19C, 92%, respectively. Overall, the results indicate the robustness of the optimized SCENARIO model for predicting the Tc responses during prolonged, high-intensity physical tasks under hot and humid environments. Future work to further validate the model against data beyond the range of the present study's experimental data and enhancing it for more accurate simulations of other heat strain markers including heart rate is recommended.","output":"Computer modelling of heat strain responses of exercising personnel in tropical climate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Entrainment of neural oscillations in occipital cortices by external rhythmic visual stimuli has been proposed as a novel therapy for patients with Alzheimers disease (AD). Despite this increased interest in visual neural oscillations in AD, little is known regarding their role in AD-related cognitive impairment and in particular during visuospatial processing. METHODS: We used source-imaged magnetoencephalography (MEG) and an established visuospatial processing task to elicit multi-spectral neuronal responses in 35 biomarker-confirmed patients on the AD spectrum and 20 biomarker-negative older adults. Neuronal oscillatory responses were imaged to the level of the cortex, and group classifications and neurocognitive relationships were modeled using logistic and linear regression, respectively. RESULTS: Visuospatial neuronal oscillations in the theta, alpha, and gamma ranges significantly predicted the classification of patients on the AD spectrum. Importantly, the direction of these effects differed by response frequency, such that patients on the AD spectrum exhibited weaker alpha-frequency responses in lateral occipital regions, and stronger gamma-frequency responses in the primary visual cortex, as compared to biomarker-negative older adults. In addition, alpha and gamma, but not theta, oscillations robustly predicted cognitive status (i.e., MoCA and MMSE scores), such that patients with neural responses that deviated more from those of healthy older adults exhibited poorer cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: We find that the multi-spectral neural dynamics supporting visuospatial processing differentiate patients on the AD spectrum from cognitively normal, biomarker-negative older adults. Oscillations in the alpha and gamma bands also relate to cognitive status in ways that are informative for emerging clinical interventions.","output":"Visuospatial alpha and gamma oscillations scale with the severity of cognitive dysfunction in patients on the Alzheimers disease spectrum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Moral distress has frequently been investigated in single healthcare settings and concerning a single type of professional. This study aimed to describe the experience of moral distress in all the types of professionals providing daily care to elderly patients and residents. Methods: The Grounded Theory approach, developed by Corbin and Strauss, was used. This study included participants from hospital and nursing homes of northern Italy. Purposive and theoretical sampling was used. Between December 2020 and April 2021, semi-structured interviews were conducted. Results: Thirteen participants were included in the study. Four categories were derived from the data: talking and listening, care provider wellbeing, decision making, protective factors, and potential solutions. The core category identified was sharing daily. Interviewees confirm how hard it may be to communicate to the elderly, but at the same time, how adequate communication with the leader is a protective factor of moral distress. They also confirm how communication is key to managing or downsizing misunderstandings at all levels. Findings highlight the scarcity of operators as a fundamental trigger of moral distress. Conclusions: Many determinants of this phenomenon lie behind the direct control of professionals, but education can help them learn how to prevent, manage, or downsize the consequences.","output":"Moral Distress in Community and Hospital Settings for the Care of Elderly People.

Data were collated by the hospital epidemiological service for patients admitted from 3/7/2020 to 9/1/2020. Time until final discharge or death was the outcome. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate time until death among admitted patients. In total, all cases had resolved leading to 207 deaths. Length of stay was significantly longer in those who died as compared to those who did not (p = 0.007). Of patients who had been discharged, 54 were readmitted and nine subsequently died. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that in addition to older age, male sex, and a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes, that a history of premorbid depression was a risk factors for COVID-19 mortality (aHR = 2.42 [1.38C4.23] P = 0.002), and that this association remained after adjusting for age and for neuropsychiatric conditions as well as medical comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and pulmonary conditions. Sex-stratified analyses revealed that associations between mortality and depression was strongest in males (aHR = 4.45 [2.04C9.72], P < 0.001), and that the association between heart failure and mortality was strongest in participants aged < 65 years old (aHR = 30.50 [9.17C101.48], P < 0.001). While an increasing number of studies have identified several comorbid medical conditions including chronic heart failure and age of patient as risk factors for mortality in COVID + patients, this study confirmed several prior reports and also noted that a history of depression is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 mortality.","output":"Clinical risk factors for mortality in an analysis of 1375 patients admitted for COVID treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People living with pre-existing illnesses were identified as one of the groups most at risk when COVID-19 erupted.

Building on the literature on assemblages of health and illness, therapeutic landscapes and the materialities of care, our analysis considers sociomaterialities of health, risk and care described in six featured case studies. Each person recounted a unique narrative that described the coming together of several different human and nonhuman agents in their experiences. Yet a number of overarching and intersecting themes can also be traced across the participants narratives: the vital contributions of lay care and self-care as part of the materialities of care, health and wellbeing; the role played by social networks, both online and in-person, for people in learning about and coping with COVID-19 and its potential risks; previous embodied and affective experiences of illness, vulnerability and care; and the role played by place and space in generating either therapeutic or distressing affective atmospheres.

COVID-19 has generated constant situations of change and uncertainty worldwide. During the pandemic, the acquisition of preventive behaviors has been relevant. Various studies carried out with adults associate risk perception and the implementation of preventive behaviors with knowledge about the COVID-19 and with age, but there are not many studies with adolescents. Therefore, the objective is to validate, in Spanish, the questionnaire of the knowledge, attitudes, risk perceptions, and practices of adolescents toward the pandemic, and analyze it according to sociodemographic characteristics. Method: This study was a descriptive cross-sectional study, which included adolescents between the ages of 12C18 (n = 354). First, a translation and a back-translation of the questionnaire were performed. The questionnaire was presented in several high schools chosen by convenience sampling and following a non-probabilistic snowball sampling. Reliability and validity analyses were then carried out and the relationships between the different sociodemographic variables (gender, place of residence, level of education, if the person was in a sentimental relationship, and financial aid) were analyzed. Results: The reliability of the questionnaire is acceptable (ordinal alpha = 77%). Knowledge was higher in women, and in those with a higher level of education; and were lower in those who lived in smaller towns, as well as in those who had a member of their family receiving financial aid. In terms of attitudes and risk perceptions, younger adolescents had higher scores, and those who had a member of their family receiving financial aid, lower. Conclusion: The questionnaire is a reliable tool in the Spanish adolescent population. Knowledge was influenced by gender, place of residence, level of education, and financial aid. Attitudes and risk perceptions were influenced by age and financial aid. For practices, no predictors were found. In general, adolescents scored lower on knowledge about COVID-19, but they scored higher on COVID-19 safety practices.","output":"Knowledge, Attitudes, Risk Perceptions, and Practices of Spanish Adolescents Toward the COVID-19 Pandemic: Validation and Results of the Spanish Version of the Questionnaire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biological properties of two mengovirus mutants, 205 and 280, were compared to those of wild-type virus.

METHODS: Children with a positive result of nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) underwent laboratory tests, anal and conjunctival swab, electrocardiography, lung, abdomen, and cardiac ultrasound. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed if abnormal basal blood pressure. Patients were followed-up for 6 months. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixteen children were evaluated; 15 were finally included. Confirmed family member SARS-CoV-2 infection was present in all. Twenty-seven percent were asymptomatic. Anal and conjunctival swabs tests resulted negative in all. Patients with lower body mass index (BMI) presented significantly higher viral loads. Main laboratory abnormalities were: lactate dehydrogenase increasing (73%), low vitamin D levels (87%), hematuria (33%), proteinuria (26%), renal hyperfiltration (33%), and hypofiltration (13%). Two of the patients with hyperfiltration exhibited high blood pressure levels at diagnosis, and persistence of prehypertension at 6-month follow-up. No abnormalities were seen at ultrasound, excepting for one patient who exhibited B-lines at lung sonography. Immunoglobulin G seroconversion was observed in all at 1-month. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirm that intra-family transmission is important. The significant higher viral loads recorded among patients with lower BMI, together with low vitamin D levels, support the impact of nutritional status on immune system. Renal involvement is frequent even among children with mild COVID-19, therefore prompt evaluation and identification of patients with reduced renal function reserve would allow a better stratification and management of patients.

We contacted 100 patients who attended a range of clinics ran by over 10 different General Surgical Consultants between 25th March 2020 and 30th April 2020. A team of junior doctors and clinical assistants were recruited to contact patients. Patients were contacted via telephone to ask if they would be happy to complete the survey which would be emailed to them, if they did not have an email address a shorter survey was completed over the phone.ResultsIn total we had 73 responses to the survey. Data collected suggests that virtual clinics are well received by patients. 48% (n=35) answered that they were overall very satisfied with the care received in the virtual clinic, and 79.6% (n=43) felt that their care did not suffer as a result of non-face to face contact. Most patients would recommend a virtual clinic to their friend or family 77% (n=56), however if given the option 60% (n=43) would prefer a face to face clinic appointment.ConclusionsAs the pandemic progresses it is important to identify ways in which good patient care can be delivered whilst not putting patients at risk of contracting the virus.

This has implicated the eye as a portal of transmission. The aim of this systemic review is to summarise and discuss the current literature regarding ocular involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: In this systematic review, the prevalence of ocular symptoms and signs was low (from 0 to 31.58%) and conjunctivitis was a relatively rare occurrence. The rate of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular swab samples was low as well and this ranged from 0 to 11.11%. The development of ocular symptoms and signs was not always accompanied by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular swab samples. The opposite was described as well. This may reflect issues related to the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and of the study design. Nonetheless, the nature of research in a pandemic is that conclusions can change as more information is obtained. SUMMARY: Whilst the eye is unlikely to be a main transmission route, we need to consider the possibilities of conjunctivitis as a presenting complaint and of the eye playing a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we need to take the appropriate precautions in our practice.

In addition, we imaged mitochondria of placental villi keeping in mind that the mitochondrion has been suggested as a potential residence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed a substantial overlapping of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and mitochondria in trophoblastic cells. This intriguing linkage correlated with an aberrant mitochondrial network. Overall, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides evidence of colocalization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and mitochondria in SARS-CoV-2 infected tissue.

This unique context allowed comparison of multiple virtual and face-to-face (F2F) Balint-type group experiences for participants and facilitators. METHOD: In March 2020, existing core trainee (CT) year 1 and 2, higher trainee (ST) and consultant Balint groups became virtual, with new CT3 and Speciality Doctor and Associate Specialist (SAS) virtual Balint groups established. All 57 participants and 5 facilitators were sent an anonymous electronic survey to retrospectively rate virtual Balint (March-August 2020) and their preceding F2F Balint group (suggesting September 2019-February 2020) experience. RESULT: The response rate was 89% for participants (51 respondents) and 100% for facilitators (5 respondents). For group participants, 90% (virtual) and 78% (F2F) agreed or strongly agreed that Balint group provided an opportunity to explore challenging aspects of clinical work. 76% (virtual) and 71% (F2F) agreed or strongly agreed that it made them feel more supported. Almost 50% agreed or strongly agreed that virtual and F2F Balint group helped work feel less stressful. Both ratings and free-text feedback emphasised virtual Balint attendance being easier. Facilitators rated virtual and F2F formats similarly highly with regards to exploring difficult doctor-patient interactions, richness of discussions and their enjoyment. Facilitators felt virtual attendance was easier but more draining, with more difficult adherence to Balint group etiquette and boundaries. 82% of participants and 75% of facilitators agreed or strongly agreed that virtual format made them more likely to attend future Balint groups. The rich pool of free-text comments received were predominantly positive, whilst noting challenges during virtual Balint in remaining present, with more distractions (for participants) and additional difficulty accessing group dynamics (for facilitators). CONCLUSION: Participant and facilitator responses indicate Balint-type groups being professionally and clinically beneficial across different psychiatrist grades, and promoting clinician wellbeing when both F2F and virtual during pandemic-related restrictions. Facilitator ratings (unlike participants) suggested specific virtual process challenges such as feeling more drained, perhaps in part due to technical application issues around this emerging format. Both participants and facilitators reported attendance being easier when virtual. Although some suggested returning to F2F post-COVID, more preferred to continue virtually or utilise a blended format. This was particularly for non-CT groups where geographical challenges (e.g. region-wide ST Balint) or competing clinical demands (e.g. consultant/SAS Balint) made regular commitment and attendance more difficult.","output":"Balint in the time of COVID-19: participant and facilitator experience of virtual Balint groups compared with in-person"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objective To provide an update on key safety metrics after transfusion of convalescent plasma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, having previously demonstrated safety in 5,000 hospitalized patients.

Most of the results obtained in the field employ average peak doses between 300 and 600 Gy. However, despite its proven efficacy, one of the biggest challenges in translating MRT to the clinic is that these high doses can be delivered only at synchrotron facilities, and there are only a few in the world. To solve this problem, we delivered three sessions of lower peak doses of 133 Gy, which approach clinical capabilities. The results showed complete tumour remission for 18 months. In fact, it ablated 50% of the primary melanomas with no metastasis. We believe that this study is of value because (i) it increased the therapeutic index of MRT, and (ii) it demonstrates that MRT can be less dependent on synchrotron sources, which opens the path for future clinical application. ABSTRACT: Background: Synchrotron Microbeam Radiotherapy (MRT) significantly improves local tumour control with minimal normal tissue toxicity. MRT delivers orthovoltage X-rays at an ultra-high FLASH dose rate in spatially fractionated beams, typically only few tens of micrometres wide. One of the biggest challenges in translating MRT to the clinic is its use of high peak doses, of around 300C600 Gy, which can currently only be delivered by synchrotron facilities. Therefore, in an effort to improve the translation of MRT to the clinic, this work studied whether the temporal fractionation of traditional MRT into several sessions with lower, more clinically feasible, peak doses could still maintain local tumour control. Methods: Two groups of twelve C57Bl/6J female mice harbouring B16-F10 melanomas in their ears were treated with microbeams of 50 m in width spaced by 200 m from their centres. The treatment modality was either (i) a single MRT session of 401.23 Gy peak dose (7.40 Gy valley dose, i.e., dose between beams), or (ii) three MRT sessions of 133.41 Gy peak dose (2.46 Gy valley dose) delivered over 3 days in different anatomical planes, which intersected at 45 degrees. The mean dose rate was 12,750 Gy/s, with exposure times between 34.2 and 11.4 ms, respectively. Results: Temporally fractionated MRT ablated 50% of B16-F10 mouse melanomas, preventing organ metastases and local tumour recurrence for 18 months. In the rest of the animals, the median survival increased by 2.5-fold in comparison to the single MRT session and by 4.1-fold with respect to untreated mice. Conclusions: Temporally fractionating MRT with lower peak doses not only maintained tumour control, but also increased the efficacy of this technique. These results demonstrate that the solution to making MRT more clinically feasible is to irradiate with several fractions of intersecting arrays with lower peak doses. This provides alternatives to synchrotron sources where future microbeam radiotherapy could be delivered with less intense radiation sources.","output":"Complete Remission of Mouse Melanoma after Temporally Fractionated Microbeam Radiotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, adaptive design trial with frequent interim analyses is to determine if Australian Indigenous children, who receive an additional (third) dose of human rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline) for children aged 6 to < 12 months, would improve protection against clinically significant all-cause gastroenteritis. PARTICIPANTS: Up to 1000 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter Indigenous) infants aged 6 to < 12 months will be recruited from all regions of the Northern Territory. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention is the addition of a third scheduled dose of human monovalent rotavirus vaccine.

When SARS-CoV-2 propagated in Vero cells, it acquired deletions surrounding the FCS. We studied the viral transcriptome in Vero cell-derived SARS-CoV-2-infected primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) with an emphasis on the viral genome stability of the FCS. While we found overall the viral transcriptome is similar to that generated from infected Vero cells, we identified a high percentage of mutated viral genome and transcripts in HAE-ALI. Two highly frequent deletions were found at the FCS region: a 12 amino acid deletion (678TNSPRRAR&#8595;SVAS689) that contains the underlined FCS and a 5 amino acid deletion (675QTQTN679) that is two amino acids upstream of the FCS. Further studies on the dynamics of the FCS deletions in apically released virions from 11 infected HAE-ALI cultures of both healthy and lung disease donors revealed that the selective pressure for the FCS maintains the FCS stably in 9 HAE-ALI cultures but with 2 exceptions, in which the FCS deletions are retained at a high rate of >40% after infection of &#8805;13 days. Our study presents evidence for the role of unique properties of human airway epithelia in the dynamics of the FCS region during infection of human airways, which is likely donor dependent.IMPORTANCE Polarized human airway epithelia at an air-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) are an in vitro model that supports efficient infection of SARS-CoV-2. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin cleavage site (FCS) at the boundary of the S1 and S2 domains which distinguishes it from SARS-CoV. However, FCS deletion mutants have been identified in patients and in vitro cell cultures, and how the airway epithelial cells maintain the unique FCS remains unknown. We found that HAE-ALI cultures were capable of suppressing two prevalent FCS deletion mutants (&#916;678TNSPRRAR&#8595;SVAS689 and &#916;675QTQTN679) that were selected during propagation in Vero cells. While such suppression was observed in 9 out of 11 of the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from independent donors, 2 exceptions that retained a high rate of FCS deletions were also found. Our results present evidence of the donor-dependent properties of human airway epithelia in the evolution of the FCS during infection.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 Transcriptome and the Dynamics of the S Gene Furin Cleavage Site in Primary Human Airway Epithelia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2020 and early 2021, with the eagerly anticipated regulatory approval of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the urgent global effort to inoculate populations against this devastating virus was underway. These case studies examine the early stages of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts across nine regions from around the world (Brazil, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Nigeria, Taiwan, United Kingdom and United States). By evaluating and comparing different approaches used to immunize against a novel pathogen, it is possible to learn a great deal about which methods were successful, and in which areas strategies can be improved. This information is applicable to the ongoing global vaccination against this virus, as well as in the event of future pandemics. Research was conducted by following and tracking the progress of vaccine rollouts in the nine regions, using published clinical trials, government documents and news reports as sources of data. Results relate to the proportion of populations that had received at least one COVID-19 dose by 28 February 2021.

The aim and purpose of this research is a clear and tentative way of pointing out the importance of competition in relation to coronavirus. In order to achieve this goal, the paper seeks to provide scientifically based answers to a number of current issues, starting from detention from the definitions of competition and coronavirus. In addition to the above, it is necessary to consider how this disease affected entrepreneurship, which had positive and negative consequences. In addition, it is important to note that it has left a significant impact on our mental health. The main results of the research point to the fact that the coronavirus as a global, economic and health crisis suddenly caught us all overnight and as such changed our lives. In addition to greatly affecting the economy, there is also a blow to the company. In case of suspicion of infection, the obligation to call a doctor, ie a territorially competent epidemiologist, and the obligation to go to an outpatient clinic are determined as a preventive measure. In this paper, qualitative research in correlation with quantitative research was used. Starting from the fact that quantitative research is based on the description of individual conditions, ie the establishment of cause-and-effect relationships, the paper in a representative way seeks to simplify the concept of competition as the drivingforce of a market economy that entails many benefits consumer choice, innovation. In addition, considering the coronavirus from a quantitative point of view, it is manifested in how the coronavirus as a new strain of virus, discovered in humans, 'stirred' the whole world as such forced people to care about their health and the health of our loved ones. Also, an obligation to adhere to epidemiological measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection has been introduced.

The disease at first was identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Being a human infectious disease, it causes high fever, cough, breathing problems. In some cases it can be fatal, especially in people with comorbidities like heart or kidney problems and diabetes. The current COVID-19 treatment is based on symptomatic therapy, so finding an appropriate drug against COVID-19 remains an immediate and crucial target for the global scientific community. Two main processes are thought to be responsible for the COVID-19 pathogenesis. In the early stages of infection, disease is determined mainly by virus replication. In the later stages of infection, by an excessive immune/inflammatory response, leading to tissue damage. Therefore, the main treatment options are antiviral and immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agents. Many clinical trials have been conducted concerning the use of various drugs in COVID-19 therapy, and many are still ongoing. The majority of trials examine drug reposition (repurposing), which seems to be a good and effective option. Many drugs have been repurposed in COVID-19 therapy including remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab and baricitinib.

Real world data specific to BC is needed to counsel patients (pts) with BC on their risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: In this retrospective study, we abstracted clinical data including demographics, tumor histology, cancer treatment, and COVID-19 testing results status from the electronic medical record of 3778 BC patients who received cancer care from 02/01/2020 - 05/01/2020 in New York City at our cancer center. The primary endpoint of the study was incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by treatment type (cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT) vs non-cytotoxic therapies (endocrine and/or HER2 directed therapy (E/H)) diagnosed by either serology, RT-PCR, or documented clinical diagnosis. Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) and Mann-Whitney Test were used to assess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by treatment and assess outcomes based on oncologic and non-oncologic risk factors respectively. Results: 3062 patients met inclusion criteria with 379 pts in CT, 2343 pts in E/H and 340 in NT groups. During study period 641 patients (20.9%) were tested by either PCR or serology with 64 patients (2.1%) diagnosed with COVID-19. All pts who tested positive by PCR and subsequently had serology testing were positive for IgG. The weighted risk of SARS-COV-2 infection was 3.5% in CT vs. 2.7% in E/H (p=0.523). 27 patients (0.9%) expired over follow up, with 10 deaths attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The weighted risk for death was 0.7% with CT vs. 0.1% with E/H, p=0.24 (Table A).

Here we demonstrate that Pin1 is a key cellular molecule necessary for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) propagation. In this study, siRNA-mediated silencing of Pin1 expression markedly suppressed the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. In addition, several recently generated Pin1 inhibitors showed strong inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 proliferation, measured by both viral mRNA and protein synthesis, and alleviated the cytopathic effect (CPE) on VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. One compound, termed H-77, was found to block SARS-CoV-2 proliferation at an EC(50) below 5 M regardless of whether it was added to the culture medium prior to or after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The inhibition of viral N protein mRNA synthesis by H-77 implies that the molecular mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 inhibition is likely to be associated with viral gene transcription or earlier steps. Another Pin1 inhibitor, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)a commercially available drug used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and which both activates the retinoic acid receptor and inhibits the activity of Pin1similarly reduced the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2.

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) remains committed to its responsibility to the public by assuring that the process and outcome of graduate medical education in the nation's residency programs produce competent, safe, and compassionate doctors. The Milestones Project is the ACGME's current strategy in the evolution to a competency-based system, which allows each specialty to develop its own set of subcompetencies and 5-level progression, or milestones, along a continuum of novice to expert. The education community has now had nearly 5 years of experience with these rubrics. While not perfect, Milestones 1.0 provided important foundational information and insights. The first iteration of the Anesthesiology Milestones highlighted some mismatch between subcompetencies and current and future clinical practices. They have also highlighted challenges with assessment and evaluation of learners, and the need for faculty development tools. Committed to an iterative process, the ACGME assembled representatives from stakeholder groups within the Anesthesiology community to develop the second generation of Milestones.

Many DNA viruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1), trigger STING signaling causing inhibition of virus replication. Here, we report that HSV1 evades this antiviral immune response by inducing a cellular microRNA, miR-24, which binds to the 3 untranslated region of STING mRNA and inhibits its translation. Expression of the gene encoding miR-24 is induced by the transcription factor AP1 and activated by MAP kinases in HSV1-infected cells. Introduction of exogenous miR-24 or prior activation of MAPKs, causes further enhancement of HSV1 replication in STING-expressing cells. Conversely, transfection of antimiR-24 inhibits virus replication in those cells. HSV1 infection of mice causes neuropathy and death; using two routes of infection, we demonstrated that intracranial injection of antimiR-24 alleviates both morbidity and mortality of the infected mice.

It puts a tremendous strain on society by damaging reputation, public trust, freedom of expression, journalism, justice, truth, and democracy. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to detect and contain unreliable information. Multiple techniques have been proposed to detect fake news propagation in tweets based on tweets content, propagation on the network of users, and the profile of the news generators. Generating human-like content allows deceiving content-based methods. Network-based methods rely on the complete graph to detect fake news, resulting in late detection. User profile-based techniques are effective for bots or fake accounts detection. However, they are not suited to detect fake news from original accounts. To deal with the shortcomings in existing methods, we introduce a source-based method focusing on the news propagatorscommunity, including posters and re-tweeters to detect such contents. Propagators are connected using follower-following relations. A feature set combining the connectivity patterns of news propagators with their profile features is used in a machine learning framework to perform binary classification of tweets. Complex network measures and user profile features are also examined separately. We perform an extensive comparative analysis of the proposed methodology on a real-world COVID-19 dataset, exploiting various machine learning and deep learning models at the community and node levels. Results show that hybrid features perform better than network features and user features alone.

Unfortunately, there are several limitations in the trial methods. The COVID A to Z trial was stopped early for futility. In the sample size calculation, the authors assumed a 1.0 day shorter symptoms by intervention. Duration of symptoms was reduced by 1.2 days in the vitamin C arm compared with the usual care arm. Given that the observed vitamin C effect was 20% greater than the expected effect (1.2 vs. 1.0), it is illogical to have stopped the trial early because of futility.

Furthermore, we calculated quantile treatment effect of vitamin C. At the 60th percentile level of symptom distribution, duration was 9 days in the usual care arm, and 6 days in the vitamin C arm, which corresponds to reduction in symptom duration by 3 days (95% CI 3 to 4.6 days;P < 0.001).

Eye health remains inaccessible for a large amount of the global population. Digital tools that automize the eye exam could be used to address this issue. IQA is a fundamental step in digital fundoscopy for clinical applications; it is one of the first steps in the preprocessing stages of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems using eye fundus images. Images from the EyePACS dataset were used, and quality labels from previous works in the literature were selected. Cubical complexes were used to represent the images; the grayscale version was, then, used to calculate a persistent homology on the simplex and represented with persistence diagrams. Then, 30 vectorized topological descriptors were calculated from each image and used as input to a classification algorithm. Six different algorithms were tested for this study (SVM, decision tree, k-NN, random forest, logistic regression (LoGit), MLP). LoGit was selected and used for the classification of all images, given the low computational cost it carries. Performance results on the validation subset showed a global accuracy of 0.932, precision of 0.912 for label quality and 0.952 for label no quality, recall of 0.932 for label quality and 0.912 for label no quality, AUC of 0.980, F1 score of 0.932, and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.864.

In contrast to western views of gorillas as \\"gentle giants,\\" staff viewed gorillas as dangerous animals before working for these projects. Overall, employment leads to viewing conservation and gorillas more positively, and in many cases, viewing the gorillas as kin. The most common value attributed to the gorillas was economic, yet intrinsic and non-use existence values were frequently mentioned. Loango staff, but not Bwindi staff, reported behavior change related to hunting and bushmeat consumption, which likely is related to bushmeat consumption being commonplace in Gabon but not in Uganda. The Bwindi staff seemed to have a more positive and broader outlook toward conservation than the Loango staff, possibly because they had more years of formal education, they worked with gorillas longer, there is more history of conservation activities in Bwindi, and/or they have been less directly affected by negative consequences of conservation (e.g., crop raiding).

Participants were first-time recruited on social networks and via telephone messages through a snowball sampling and tested during the third week of the lockdown period. Subsequently, a follow-up evaluation was carried out during the seventh week of lockdown. The survey assessed perceived stress, sleep quality, insomnia and depression symptoms, and anxiety, using the following questionnaires: the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Beck Depression Inventory-second edition, and the State-Anxiety Inventory. Women showed the worst condition for all the examined dimensions in both the assessments. Nevertheless, at the follow-up women reported a reduction in perceived stress, insomnia and depression severity symptoms, and anxiety. On the other hand, male participants showed a worsening of perceived stress, sleep quality, and insomnia symptoms. Consequently, the gender prevalence gap of clinical conditions such as insomnia and depression was largely reduced under lockdown. Our investigation pointed to a different time course of sleep and mental health between genders during the home confinement period. Women seemed to show greater long-term resilience during the lockdown. Meanwhile, the male gender emerges as the most vulnerable category to the extension of the restraining measures. Our results suggest that there is no \\"weaker gender\\" after a prolonged lockdown.

The main purpose of the study is to investigate the incidence and severity of the allergic reactions, and to evaluate the safety of revaccination. METHODS: All patients in the region of Southern Denmark with case histories of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines in a defined period are included in this study. Diagnostic work up consisted of a detailed case history, evaluation of Brighton level of diagnostic certainty and World Allergy Organization grade of anaphylaxis and skin prick testing- and basophil histamine release testing with COVID-19 vaccines and relevant drug excipients. Patients were revaccinated at the Allergy Center when possible. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients are included in this study. In 199,377 doses administered, nine patients fulfilled the criteria of anaphylaxis when using the Brighton Criteria (incidence being 45 per million). Of 55 patients with reactions to the first dose, 52 patients were revaccinated without adverse reactions. We found no proven cases of immediate anaphylaxis due to COVID-19 vaccines. By skin prick test, we diagnosed three patients with drug excipient allergy and further a patient with mastocytosis was found. CONCLUSIONS: Anaphylactic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are rare and the incidence is similar to what is seen with other virus-based vaccines.

Hence, the purpose of the study is to see the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 daily tests on the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar exchange rate using Vector Autoregressive approach. The data is gathered from February 26, 2020 to March, 2021. This period was selected, because the pandemic expanded, and the first case was observed in Pakistan on Feb 26th 2020. To verify this effect, a Vector Autoregressive Model was developed. A generalized version of the Autoregressive Model is a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pakistani rupee devalued against the US dollar throughout the abovementioned period. When analyzing the Pakistani rupee vs. the US dollar exchange rate using a Vector Autoregressive Model, the values of the lags (1, 4, 6, and 7) of the explanatory variable have a significant impact.

METHODS: Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054, Mage = 16.68, standard deviation = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3 weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. RESULTS: For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.","output":"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

MATERIALS AND METHODS All 6 patients involved in this study had a gastric band in place for more than 1 year; the median interval from gastric banding to BP-LGP was 31.7 months (range, 19.7-49.9 months). Five (83.3%) patients were female. Preoperative median body mass index (BMI) at gastric banding was 35.4 kg/m(2) (range, 31.9-43.9 kg/m(2)), median nadir BMI with the gastric band was 25.7 kg/m(2) (range, 20.9-31.0 kg/m(2)), and percentage excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) ranged from 24.3% to 123.6%. Indications for BP-LGP were as follows: chronic gastric prolapse in 2 patients (33.3%), pouch-esophageal dilatation in 3 (50.0%), and insufficient weight loss in 4 (66.6%), which included 2 patients with weight loss failure (%EBMIL of <30%). RESULTS The 6 patients consecutively underwent surgery from May 2014 to January 2015. No conversion to open surgery was necessary, and no perioperative complication or mortality occurred. Mean operative time was 190 minutes. All patients showed weight loss after revision and showed resolution of troublesome signs and symptoms. Median follow-up after revision was 7.3 months (range, 5.7-10.1 months), median BMI at last follow-up was 27.6 kg/m(2) (range, 22.7-34.0 kg/m(2)), and median %EBMIL was 75.7% (range, 21.0%-103.6%).

One of the challenges of antimicrobial treatment is antibiotics diffusion into the lungs. Although targeted delivery of antibiotics using nebulization may be interesting, their place in ARDS patients remains to be explored. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the most severe patients is associated with a high rate of infection and raises several challenges, diagnostic issues and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics changes being at the top. Prevention of pulmonary infection is a key issue in ARDS patients, but there is no specific measure for these high-risk patients. Reinforcing preventive measures using bundles seems to be the best option.","output":"Pulmonary infections complicating ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing socioeconomic crisis has impeded progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). This paper investigates the impact of COVID 19 on the progress of the SDGs and provides insight into how green recovery stimulus, driven by circular economy (CE)-based solid waste management (SWM) could assist in attaining the intended targets of UN-SDG. It was understood in this review that the guiding principles of the UN-SDGs such as, public health, environmental concerns, resource value and economic development are similar to those that have driven the growth of waste management activities; thus, in order to achieve the goals of UN-SDG, a circular economy approach in solid waste management system should be prioritized in the post-COVID economic agenda. However, policy, technology and public involvement issues may hinder the shift to the CE model; therefore, niche growth might come from developing distinctive waste management-driven green jobs, formalizing informal waste pickers and by focusing in education and training of informal worker. The review also emphasized in creating green jobs by investing in recycling infrastructure which would enable us to address the climate change related concerns which is one of the key target of UN- SDG. The CE-based product designs and business models would emphasize multifunctional goods, extending the lifespan of products and their parts, and intelligent manufacturing to help the public and private sectors maximise product utility (thus reducing waste generation) while providing long-term economic and environmental benefits. The study also recommended strong policies that prioritized investments in decentralization of solid waste systems, localization of supply chains, recycling and green recovery, information sharing, and international collaboration in order to achieve the UN-SDGs.","output":"Circular economy approach in solid waste management system to achieve UN-SDGs: Solutions for post-COVID recovery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has played a decisive role in understanding the transmission and evolution of the virus during its emergence and continued circulation. However, limited genomic sampling in many high-incidence countries has impeded detailed studies of SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology. Consequently, critical questions remain about the generation and global distribution of virus genetic diversity. To address this gap, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Gujarat, India, during its first epidemic wave and shed light on virus' spread in one of the pandemic's hardest-hit regions. By integrating regional case data and 434 whole virus genome sequences sampled across 20 districts from March to July 2020, we reconstructed the epidemic dynamics and spatial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Gujarat, India. Our findings revealed that global and regional connectivity, along with population density, were significant drivers of the Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The three most populous districts in Gujarat accounted ~84% of total cases during the first wave. Moreover, we detected over 100 virus lineage introductions, which were primarily associated with international travel. Within Gujarat, virus dissemination occurred predominantly from densely populated regions to geographically proximate locations with low-population density. Our findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 transmission follows a gravity model in India, with urban centres contributing disproportionately to onward virus spread.","output":"Genomic epidemiology of early SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Gujarat, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of epileptic seizures, particularly regarding status epilepticus (SE), may be challenging in an emergency room setting. The aim of the study was to study the diagnostic yield of perfusion computed tomography (pCT) in patients with single epileptic seizures and SE. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who followed an acute ischemic stroke pathway during a 9-month period and who were finally diagnosed with a single epileptic seizure or SE. Perfusion maps were visually analyzed for the presence of hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion. Clinical data, EEG patterns, and neuroimaging findings were compared. RESULTS: We included 47 patients: 20 (42.5%) with SE and 27 (57.5%) with single epileptic seizure. Of 18 patients who showed hyperperfusion on pCT, 12 were ultimately diagnosed with SE and eight had EEG findings compatible with an SE pattern. Focal hyperperfusion on pCT had a sensitivity of 60% (95% CI 36.4C80.2) and a specificity of 77.8% (95% CI 57.2C90.6) for predicting a final diagnosis of SE. The presence of cerebral cortical and thalamic hyperperfusion had a high specificity for predicting SE presence. Of note, 96% of patients without hyperperfusion on pCT did not show an SE pattern on early EEG. CONCLUSIONS: In acute settings, detection by visual analysis of focal cerebral cortical hyperperfusion on pCT in patients with epileptic seizures, especially if accompanied by the highly specific feature of thalamic hyperperfusion, is suggestive of a diagnosis of SE and requires clinical and EEG confirmation. The absence of focal hyperperfusion makes a diagnosis of SE unlikely.","output":"Epileptic seizures in the emergency room: clinical and electroencephalographic findings associated with brain perfusion patterns on computed tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to evolve, its influence on specific patient populations suffering from chronic disorders becomes increasingly important. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are commonly immunosuppressed with immunomodulators, biologics, and steroids. Therefore, IBD patients have been considered as a risk population for COVID-19. Yet, emerging epidemiologic data may indicate otherwise. It is still unclear, however, how COVID-19 infection affects IBD patients and how seroconversion against the virus might take place depending upon disease states and treatments. We describe a single center cohort of pediatric IBD patients with COVID-19, a subset of whom were tested for seroconversion subsequent to the laboratory test supported infection. Methods and Results: The electronic medical records of pediatric IBD patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab based PCR testing were included in the study. The clinical course of IBD, concurrent medications, COVID-19 related symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing date, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing date and result were examined. A total of 13 pediatric IBD patients at Texas Childrens Hospital tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patient demographics and specifics of IBD disease and management are detailed in table 1. Management was not altered in any of these patients in response to the positive COVID-19 test. Seven (53.8%) had symptoms including fever, sore throat, fatigue, loss of taste, dizziness, loss of smell, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea;six (46.2%) were asymptomatic. No patients required hospitalization attributed to COVID-19. Of the 13 patients, 6 (46.2%) have been already tested for seroconversion. Four (67.7%) had elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG of whom 3 patients (50%) had acute and resolved symptoms;one (16.7%) had an ambiguous serology (reactive total IgG and IgM but negative IgG and IgM individually), and one (16.7%) had nonreactive antibody titers. Seroconversion was tested between 0.4, or 4 to 13.7 weeks after initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. The close antibody testing at 0.4 weeks had the ambiguous results. Serologic testing for the additional cases is pending. Conclusions: We describe a cohort of pediatric IBD patients with COVID-19 ranging from 1 week to 4 months after infection whose disease course has not been significantly affected. A large proportion of patients tested for seroconversion were found to mount a detectable IgG based immune response in spite of their medical immunosuppression. More research needs to be performed to evaluate the importance of seroconversion with relation to disease course andCOVID-19 reinfection in pediatric IBD patients.

Italy, Spain, and the United States (US) were most severely affected by the first wave of the pandemic. The reasons why some countries were more strongly affected than others remain unknown. We identified the most-affected and less-affected countries and states and explored environmental, host, and infrastructure risk factors that may explain differences in the SARS-CoV-2 mortality burden. Methods: We identified the top 10 countries/US states with the highest deaths per population until May 2020. For each of these 10 case countries/states, we identified 6 control countries/states with a similar population size and at least 3 times fewer deaths per population. We extracted data for 30 risk factors from publicly available, trusted sources. We compared case and control countries/states using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and conducted a secondary cluster analysis to explore the relationship between the number of cases per population and the number of deaths per population using a scalable EM (expectation-maximization) clustering algorithm.

The influence of nutrients and bioactive molecules present in foodstuffs on immune system activity, the influence of COVID-19 on the nutritional status of the patients, and the dietary recommendations for hospitalized patients are addressed. Deficient nutritional status is probably due to anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, hypermetabolism, and excessive nitrogen loss. There is limited knowledge regarding the nutritional support during hospital stay of COVID-19 patients. However, nutritional therapy appears as first-line treatment and should be implemented into standard practice. Optimal intake of all nutrients, mainly those playing crucial roles in immune system, should be assured through a diverse and well-balanced diet. Nevertheless, in order to reduce the risk and consequences of infections, the intakes for some micronutrients may exceed the recommended dietary allowances since infections and other stressors can reduce micronutrient status. In the case of critically ill patients, recently published guidelines are available for their nutritional management.

In this study, we examine how maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma history relate to mothers' beliefs and intentions about the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children. METHODS: A total of 240 mothers with a mental health history participating in a parenting study answered online survey questions via Prolific. Questions assessed: (a) trauma indictors (past diagnosis, current symptoms, and lifetime exposure to events); (b) vaccine measures (intentions for self and child, COVID-19 vaccine confidence, general vaccine perceived safety, reasoning about vaccine intentions, sources of influence on intentions); and (c) possible explanatory variables (institutional distrust, negative worldviews). ANCOVAs and regression analyses were used. RESULTS: When compared with mothers with other mental health diagnoses, mothers with a PTSD history had significantly less confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and less intent to get the vaccine for themselves or their child. These effects were explained by greater institutional distrust (i.e., significant indirect effects). Mothers with a previous PTSD diagnosis also expressed different reasons for vaccine hesitancy (e.g., less belief in science) and ascribed less influence to healthcare and governmental sources in vaccine decision-making. CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the potential utility of a trauma-informed approach in efforts to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

Many pathogens, viral and non-viral, can elicit these pathologies, which justifies reconsidering whether the target of therapeutic approaches to fight pathogen infections should be (a) the pathogen itself, (b) the pathologies elicited by the pathogen interaction with the human host, or (c) a combination of both. While little is known about the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2, it is well-established that the above-mentioned pathologies are associated with hyper-inflammation, tissue damage, and the perturbation of target organ metabolism. Mounting evidence has shown that these processes are regulated by endoproteinases (particularly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)). Here, we review what is known about the roles played by MMPs in the development of COVID-19 and postulate a mechanism by which MMPs could influence energy metabolism in target organs, such as the lung.

We studied the changes in AGP glycosylation in the course of FIP. Specifically, we focussed our attention on the degree of sialylation, fucosylation and branching. This study presents a purification method for feline AGP (fAGP) from serum, using an ion exchange chromatography strategy. The glycosylation pattern was analyzed in detail by means of interaction of purified fAGP with specific lectins. In particular, Sambucus nigra agglutinin I and Maackia amurensis agglutinin lectins were used to detect sialic acid residues, Aleuria aurantia lectin was used to detect l-fucose residues and Concanavalin A was used to evaluate the branching degree. By this method we showed that fAGP did not present any l-fucose residues on its surface, and that its branching degree was very low, both in normal and in pathological conditions. In contrast, during FIP disease, fAGP underwent several modifications in the sialic acid content, including decreased expression of both (2C6)-linked and (2C3)-linked sialic acid (76 and 44%, respectively when compared to non-pathological feline AGP).","output":"Decreased sialylation of the acute phase protein 1-acid glycoprotein in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death from infectious diseases worldwide.

In any case, defects in alternative splicing have been related to several genetic diseases including muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease and cancer from almost every origin. One of the most effective approaches to redirect alternative splicing events has been to attach cell-penetrating peptides to oligonucleotides that can modulate a single splicing event and restore correct gene expression. Here, we summarize how natural existing and bioengineered peptides have been applied over the last few years to regulate alternative splicing and genetic expression.

CAM providers who had reorganized their practice to online consultations were more optimistic. Conclusion: The impact of COVID-19 on CAM providers was considerable. It adversely affected their clinical practice, financial situation, and view on their future practice. To ensure that the health needs of the Norwegian population regarding CAM use are met during pandemic times like COVID-19, it is recommended to support and train CAM providers in the development of online CAM services, as well as efficient implementation of infection prevention and control measures.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on complementary and alternative medicine providers: a cross-sectional survey in Norway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human anatomy is complex and best understood through hands-on dissection in the laboratory.

An intricate rotating peer-teaching component was incorporated to hand off the dissection between groups and to allow for study of anatomical variations. In-person lectures were converted to virtual platforms using both synchronous and asynchronous formats. Medical tank teams met virtually to review and report on their dissection. A strict protocol was designed for in-person self-study. Students have embraced these designs and safety protocols and continue to perform extremely well.

These symptoms are also associated with lower quality of life (QOL) and increased suicidality. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of IA symptoms in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and their association with QOL. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in three general and four psychiatric hospitals in Anhui Province, China, from January to July 2021. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. The Internet Addiction Test (IAT), Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression Symptom Scale (CES-D), and World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief version (WHOQOL-BREF) were utilized to examine IA, depressive symptoms, and QOL, respectively. RESULTS: In a multicenter sample of 278 adolescents with MDD, the prevalence of IA symptoms in adolescents with MDD was 46.8% (95% CI: 40.9C52.7%). Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with more severe depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.03C1.08), those living in a rural area (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.15C3.27), and those with poor academic performance (OR = 2.90, 95% CI: 1.42C5.95) were more likely to have IA symptoms. After controlling for confounding factors, patients with IA symptoms had significantly poorer QOL in the physical, psychological, and environmental domains than those without IA symptoms. CONCLUSION: IA symptoms are common in adolescents with MDD and appear to be associated with clinical symptoms. We could not infer a causal relationship between IA and depression because this was a cross-sectional study. Considering the positive association between IA symptoms and lower QOL, screening for IA symptoms should be conducted, and effective measures should be implemented for adolescents with MDD.","output":"Prevalence and Clinical Correlates of Internet Addiction Symptoms and Their Association With Quality of Life in Adolescents With Major Depressive Disorder: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is imposing a great threat to human lives and international panic that is not seen since WWII, resulting in financial crisis, daily life disturbance, transportation shutdown, industry disruption, and countries/cities lockdown in every corner of the globe.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical charts of patients arrived at the ED of Gaslini Children's Hospital from 10th March 2020 to 30th April 2019 and the same frame of 2020 were performed. We compared two groups by demographics, duration of fever before ED admission, triage code, number of patients hospitalized after ED evaluation. We calculated proportion and incidence rate for airborne infections, fever, and urinary tract infections (UTI), appendicitis, and gastroenteritis for control. RESULTS: 1362 children arrived at the ED during the lockdown compared to 5628 in the same period of 2019 (-75,8%). No difference was noticed (27.7% vs 28.4%) in the total amount of infectious episodes. A significant reduction in rate of incidence and proportion were observed for upper respiratory tract infections (21,4% vs 28%), otitis (2,6% vs 16,2%), streptococcal infections (0,5% vs 5,2%) and bronchiolitis (2,1% vs 5,7%). Conversely, FUO (27,8 vs 11,1%), infectious mononucleosis (2,6% vs 0,4%), UTI (7,4% vs 2,9%) and appendicitis (6,8% vs 1,1%) significantly increased. Median time from the onset of fever and arrival in ED was significantly lower in 2020 group.

The increase in rate of FUO and febrile conditions, together with the short time from fever onset and ED visit could be related to the fear for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on infectious diseases epidemiology: The experience of a tertiary Italian Pediatric Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fusion between the viral and target cell membranes is an obligatory step for the infectivity of all enveloped virus, and blocking this process is a clinically validated therapeutic strategy. Viral fusion is driven by specialized proteins which, although specific to each virus, act through a common mechanism, the formation of a complex between two heptad repeat (HR) regions. The HR regions are initially separated in an intermediate termed prehairpin, which bridges the viral and cell membranes, and then fold onto each other to form a 6-helical bundle (6HB), driving the two membranes to fuse. HR-derived peptides can inhibit viral infectivity by binding to the prehairpin intermediate and preventing its transition to the 6HB. The antiviral activity of HR-derived peptides differs considerably among enveloped viruses. For weak inhibitors, potency can be increased by peptide engineering strategies, but sequence-specific optimization is time-consuming. In seeking ways to increase potency without changing the native sequence, we previously reported that attachment to the HR peptide of a cholesterol group (cholesterol-tagging) dramatically increases its antiviral potency, and simultaneously increases its half-life in vivo. We show here that antiviral potency may be increased by combining cholesterol-tagging with dimerization of the HR-derived sequence, using as examples human parainfluenza virus, Nipah virus, and HIV-1. Together, cholesterol-tagging and dimerization may represent strategies to boost HR peptide potency to levels that in some cases may be compatible with in vivo use, possibly contributing to emergency responses to outbreaks of existing or novel viruses.","output":"A General Strategy to Endow Natural Fusion-protein-Derived Peptides with Potent Antiviral Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging mutations and genotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, have been reported globally.

To investigate the possible effects of this mutation on the function of the spike, i.e. the biology of the virus, different bioinformatic pipelines based on phylogeny, natural selection and co-evolutionary models, molecular docking and epitopes prediction were implemented. Results of the phylogeny of sequences carrying the S:T1117I worldwide showed a polyphyletic group, with the emergency of local lineages. In Costa Rica, the mutation is found in the lineage B.1.1.389 and it is suggested to be a product of positive/adaptive selection. Different changes in the function of the spike protein and more stable interaction with a ligand (nelfinavir drug) were found. Only one epitope out 742 in the spike was affected by the mutation, with some different properties, but suggesting scarce changes in the immune response and no influence on the vaccine effectiveness.

However, when supportive care referrals are offered in hospital settings, distressed patients and carers do not consistently act on those referrals, which can prolong patient suffering. The degree to which sub-optimal referral uptake also occurs in Australian telephone support services is unknown. AIMS To report, among a sample of distressed patients and caregivers who called a cancer information and support service: 1) the types of services used; 2) proportion who received and actioned a referral (uptake); 3) associations between referral to a service and callers' characteristics); and, 4) associations between uptake of a referred service and callers' characteristics. METHODS This study used cross-sectional data collected at 3-month post-baseline from control participants (usual care group) enrolled in the Structured Triage and Referral by Telephone (START) trial. The START trial recruited distressed adult cancer patients and caregivers from the Cancer Council Information and Support Service (CIS). A research assistant conducted a 30-45 min telephone interview with participants, which included recall of referrals provided by CIS staff and reported uptake of referral(s) to the offered service types. RESULTS Most patients (98%) and caregivers (97%) reported receiving a referral to a service. For patients and caregivers respectively, information materials (71%, 77%), CIS call-back (51%, 43%), practical services (52%, 45%), and group peer support (49%, 51%) were the services most frequently offered. For callers receiving a referral, uptake was highest for information materials (91%) and CIS call-backs (89%) and lowest for specialist psychological services (30%). Significant association was found between older age and reduced uptake of services (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION The high uptake rate of CIS call-backs suggests it is a potentially more acceptable form of support compared to specialist psychological services. Efforts to reduce the barriers to telephone-based psychological services are required. Specifically, older age peoples' and caregivers' preferences for support and priorities who may benefit from a referral coordinator.","output":"Referral and uptake of services by distressed callers to the Cancer Council Information and Support telephone service."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anaerobic cocci are common anaerobic isolates.

As the routine diagnostic methods may be insufficient to detect and identify the anaerobic cocci in patients with UTIs, enhanced quantitative urine culture (EQUC) can give better results. EQUC is performed by plating urine samples onto different media to be incubated in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions with a prolonged incubation time.

However, adult vaccination remains a challenge with overall low coverage rates, which has an impact on both the patients who have these diseases and the health care system in terms of resource use and costs derived. This study aimed to estimate the direct economic impact of herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, influenza and pertussis in Spanish adults 45 years and older. Methods Data from 2015 were extracted from two Spanish public databases: the Minimum Basic Data Set for Hospitalisations and the Clinical Database of Primary Care. Codes from the International Classification of Diseases and the International Classification of Primary Care were used to identify and classify the diseases analysed. The variables extracted and calculated were hospitalisation (cases, percentage, length of stay, costs, mortality), primary care (cases, percentage, costs) and referrals (cases, percentage, costs). Results were presented for the age groups 45C64 years, 65C74 years, > 74 years and all ages. Results In adults 45 years and older, total costs amounted to 134.1 million in 2015 (i.e. 63.9% of the total direct costs for all age groups): 44.4% due to pneumococcal disease, 39.5% due to influenza, 16.0% due to herpes zoster and 0.1% due to pertussis. Hospitalisations represented 58.1% (77.9 million) of the total costs, with 15,910 admissions, 144,752 days of hospitalisation and 1170 deaths.

WelTel? is an evidence-based digital health platform widely deployed in various geographical and health contexts. The objective is to identify the facilitators and barriers for implementing WelTel and to assess the application of the mCFIR tool in facilitating focus groups in different geographical and health settings. METHODS: Both qualitative and descriptive quantitative approaches were employed. Six mCFIR sessions were held in three countries with 51 key stakeholders. The mCFIR tool consists of 5 Domains and 25 constructs and was distributed through Qualtrics Experience Management (XM). Performance and Importance scores were valued on a scale of 0 to 10 (Mean  SD). Descriptive analysis was conducted using R computing software. NVivo 12 Pro software was used to analyze mCFIR responses and to generate themes from the participants input. RESULTS: We observed a parallel trend in the scores of Importance and Performance. Of the five Domains, Domain 4 (End-user Characteristics) and Domain 3 (Inner Settings) scored highest in Importance (8.9  0.5 and 8.6  0.6, respectively) and Performance (7.6  0.7 and 7.2  1.3, respectively) for all sites.

However, the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and nasopharyngeal microbiota, and the association with metabolome has not been well characterized. Here, metabolomic analysis of blood, urine, and nasopharyngeal swabs from a group of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, and metagenomic analysis of pharyngeal samples were used to identify the key features of COVID-19. Results showed lactic acid, l-proline, and chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CME) were significantly reduced in the sera of COVID-19 patients compared with non-COVID-19 ones. Nasopharyngeal commensal bacteria including Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans and Leptotrichia hofstadii were notably depleted in the pharynges of COVID-19 patients, while Prevotella histicola, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella dispar were relatively increased. The abundance of G. haemolysans and L. hofstadii were significantly positively associated with serum CME, which might be an anti-SARS-CoV-2 bacterial metabolite. This study provides important information to explore the linkage between nasopharyngeal microbiota and disease susceptibility.

This essay focuses on the employer?s perspective and considers how firms can use different employment models to improve sustainability during the crisis. We propose two alternative employment models which we label ?Oversustainability? and ?Mutual Sustainability? that depend on the choice of the firm?s competitive strategy (proactive/innovative vs analyzer/following).

Effective programs and policies are necessary to address this growing public health problem. The purpose of this study is to assess the perspectives of a national sample of youth on access to STI care and behaviors regarding STIs. METHODS: MyVoice, a national text message survey of youth, was used to pose four open-ended questions on STI screening and treatment to 1115 youth aged 14C24 in August 2018. A mixed-methods strategy was employed for the study. Qualitative data was analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. Summary statistics were calculated for demographic data and prevalence of themes. RESULTS: Of the 800 participants who responded to at least one question (72% response rate), mean age was 19 years (SD = 3.1), 55% identified as female, 61% identified as non-Hispanic white, and 33% qualified for free/reduced lunch. A majority felt it would be easy to get screened (69%) or treated (68%) for an STI. Nearly all respondents (95%) stated they would share an STI diagnosis with their sexual partners. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high rates of STIs among youth, most respondents reported that STI screening and treatment is accessible, and they would share an STI diagnosis with their partner.

With advances in treatment options, the identification of patients with obstructive ETD is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study was to validate a Danish translation of the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7). METHODS: All participants underwent tympanometry, otomicroscopy and completed the ETDQ-7. We included 34 ears from patients with obstructive ETD who had abnormal tympanometry curves but no history of cholesteatoma or adhesive otitis. As a control group, 48 otherwise healthy ears with a normal tympanometry curve were included from patients with known sensorineural hearing loss or normal hearing. RESULTS: A Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 indicated a good internal consistency reliability of the questionnaire. The mean ETDQ-7 score in the obstructive ETD group was 31 versus 13.5 in the control group (p = 0.00). A receiver operating characteristics analysis produced an area under the curve of 94%, showing excellent discriminatory abilities between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ETDQ-7 has previously been validated in English, German, Dutch and Portuguese, demonstrating good clinical relevance. The Danish translation of the ETDQ-7 has produced similar results and may be valuable in diagnosing obstructive ETD and in monitoring the effect of balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube.

Umbralisib, as the 4th iteration in this PI3K-inhibitor class for relapsed/refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma (iB-NHL), appears comparably active but may have improved tolerability. AREAS COVERED We review the use and limitations of PI3K-inhibitors for iB-NHL and discuss the development of and clinical results for umbralisib. Efficacy data are contextualized alongside other PI3K-inihibitors within the limitations of published single-arm studies. We compare and contrast available safety data, covering the off-target inhibition by umbralisib of casein kinase 1 that is thought to contribute to a more favorable immune-mediated toxicity profile. EXPERT OPINION Though a late-comer to the PI3K-inihibitor party in iB-NHL, umbralisib may carve out an important role in treatment algorithms.

Therefore, we treated human Alveolar Epithelial Lentivirus-immortalised cells (hAELVi cells) with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF- (25 ng/ml) and IFN- (30 ng/ml), in the presence or absence of hydrocortisone (HC). While TNF- and IFN- are known to reduce epithelial barrier properties, HC could be expected to protect the barrier function and result in an anti-inflammatory effect. We investigated the impact of anti-inflammatory/inflammatory treatment on transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of the low permeability marker sodium fluorescein (NaFlu). After incubating hAELVi cells for 48 hours with a combination of TNF- and IFN-, there was a significant decrease in TEER and a significant increase in the Papp. The presence of HC maintained the TEER values and barrier properties, so that no significant Papp change was observed.

Therefore, this study was to clarify the characteristics of elderly patients aged 75 or older with COVID-19 pneumonia in order to guide rational treatment for elderly patients. Methods: : we enrolled 331 elderly patients aged 75 or older with confirmed COVID-19 in Huoshenshan hospital of Wuhan from February 3rd to March 31st. The cases were divided into general, serious and critical groups according to severity after hospitalization, and the difference among groups were compared by R package statistics software. Results: : Compared with general group, serious and critical groups had more underlying comorbidities and higher incidence of cough, breath shortness and anorexia. Moreover, there existed obviously differences in many of laboratory indexes and CT images among them. serious and critical elderly patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, corticosteroid, abidor, cephaloprin, imipenem, human serum albumin (HSA), nutrition support, anti SARS-CoV-2 positive plasma and actemra. Multivariate analysis of factors showed that male sex, hypertension, diabetes, renal diseases, breath shortness, neutrophil, platelet, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase were the risk factor for serious and critical illness. While blood cell (WBC) was the protective factor. Conclusion: elderly patients have high incidence of severe pneumonia and poor treatment efficacy.

Therefore, it is urgent to find a new strategy to prevent and control PRV infection. Previous studies have proven that guanine (G)-rich DNA or RNA sequences in some other viruses genomes have the potential to form G-quadruplex (G4), which serve as promising antivirus targets. In this study, we identified two novel G4-forming sequences, OriL-A and OriL-S, which are located at the upstream origin of replication (OriL) in the PRV genome and conserved across 32 PRV strains. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and a gel electrophoresis assay showed that the two G-rich sequences can fold into parallel G4 structures in vitro. Moreover, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) melting and a Taq polymerase stop assay indicated that the G4 ligand PhenDC3 has the capacity to bind and stabilize the G4. Notably, the treatment of PRV-infected cells with G4-stabilizer PhenDC3 significantly inhibited PRV DNA replication in host cells but did not affect PRVs attachment and entry. These results not only expand our knowledge about the G4 characteristics in the PRV genome but also suggest that G4 may serve as an innovative therapeutic target against PRV.","output":"G-Quadruplexes Formation at the Upstream Region of Replication Origin (OriL) of the Pseudorabies Virus: Implications for Antiviral Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STATEMENT: Enrichment analysis of cell transcriptional responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection from biclustering solutions yields broader coverage and superior enrichment of GO terms and KEGG pathways against alternative state-of-the-art machine learning solutions, thus aiding knowledge extraction. MOTIVATION AND METHODS: The comprehensive understanding of the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 virus on infected cells is still incomplete. This work aims at comparing the role of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in the study of cell regulatory processes affected and induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus using transcriptomic data from both infectable cell lines available in public databases and in vivo samples. In particular, we assess the relevance of clustering, biclustering and predictive modeling methods for functional enrichment. Statistical principles to handle scarcity of observations, high data dimensionality, and complex gene interactions are further discussed. In particular, and without loos of generalization ability, the proposed methods are applied to study the differential regulatory response of lung cell lines to SARS-CoV-2 (-variant) against RSV, IAV (H1N1), and HPIV3 viruses. RESULTS: Gathered results show that, although clustering and predictive algorithms aid classic stances to functional enrichment analysis, more recent pattern-based biclustering algorithms significantly improve the number and quality of enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways with controlled false positive risks. Additionally, a comparative analysis of these results is performed to identify potential pathophysiological characteristics of COVID-19.

However, data on nosocomial influenza is usually collected during outbreaks only and clinical information of nosocomial influenza is sparsely available. Objectives To systematically analyse the distribution of nosocomial and community-acquired influenza and epidemiological characteristics in a tertiary care unit in two consecutive seasons. Study design A retrospective observational study was conducted to identify and characterise cases of nosocomial and community-acquired influenza at Freiburg University hospital from 1 January 2013 to 30 April 2014. A validated multiplex RT-PCR to detect influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens was used throughout. Clinical information was retrieved from the hospital-based information system. Results Overall, 218 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were included (179 in the first, 39 patients in the second season). A rate of 20% of nosocomial influenza was observed throughout. A fatal outcome was recorded for 9% of nosocomial cases, which were mainly associated with influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09. Nosocomial influenza occurred in all age groups, but fatalities were only observed in patients 18 years. Patients with nosocomial influenza were significantly older, underwent therapy for blood malignancies and immunosuppressive regimens more frequently, and received solid organ transplantation more often compared to community-acquired patients. Conclusions Despite the different distribution of virus subtypes and epidemiological properties between both influenza seasons, the rate of nosocomial cases remained similar.

However, the behavioural effects of the economic crisis on the decisions to have children and to migrate may be substantial. The literature on the relationship between the economic cycle and demographics uncovers the potential of the unemployment rate to predict fertility and migrations. Based on this evidence, we estimate the elasticity of the number of births per woman of child-bearing age and of the net migration rate to the unemployment rate in Italy, considering the 1980-2019 period. Accordingly, we forecast the impact of the pandemic on the birth rate and on migration flows in 2020-23, and we build alternative scenarios for the following years (2024-2065). Lastly, we examine the consequences of the same phenomena on the demographic structure and on GDP and on GDP per capita.

The objective of this study was to describe characteristics, self-reported symptoms, and predictors of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community-based sample. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a cross-sectional nationwide survey of adults in the US conducted between April 24 through May 13, 2020. The survey targeted a representative sample of approximately 5,000 respondents. The rate of COVID-19 cases and testing, most frequently reported symptoms, symptom severity, treatment received, impact of COVID-19 on mental and physical health, and factors predictive of testing positive were assessed. Most of the 5,203 participants (85.6%) reported no COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the 747 (14.5%) participants reporting COVID-19-like symptoms, 367 (49.1%) obtained a diagnostic test. Eighty-nine participants (24.3%) reported a positive COVID-19 test result, representing 1.7% of the total sample. For those testing positive, the most common symptoms were dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath/difficulty breathing. Those who tested positive were more likely to report greater symptom severity versus those who tested negative. Severe dry cough, new loss of taste or smell, trouble waking up, living with someone experiencing symptoms, recent international travel, respiratory issues, and reporting ethnicity of Black or African American were predictive of testing positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 using community-level self-reported data across the US during the peak of most stay at home' orders. Self-reported symptoms and risk factors identified in this study are consistent with the clinical profile emerging for COVID-19. In the absence of widespread testing, this study demonstrates the utility of a representative US community-based sample to provide direct-reported symptoms and outcomes to quickly identify high-risk individuals who are likely to test positive and should consider taking greater precautions.","output":"COVID-19 prevalence and predictors in United States adults during peak stay-at-home orders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A highly infectious and life-threatening virus originated from Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread all over the world. This novel virus belongs to coronavirus family and is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), causing respiratory disease known as COVID-19. In March 2020, WHO has declared COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Morbidity and mortality are swiftly rising day by day with the situation more severe and fatal for the co-morbid population. Many COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic, but they are silently spreading the infection. There is a need for proper screening of infected patients to prevent the epidemic transmission of disease and also for the early curative interventions to reduce the risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19 illness. To date, the diagnostic assays fall under two categories, molecular detection of viral genetic material by realtime RT-polymerase chain reaction and serological test, which rely on detecting antiviral antibodies. Unfortunately, there are no effective prophylactics and therapeutics available against COVID-19. However, few drugs are showing promising antiviral activity against it and presently are referred for the clinical trials, albeit FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency use of few drugs in the manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review gives an insight into current progress, challenges and future prospects of laboratory detection methods of COVID-19 and also highlights the clinical stage of the major proposed or evidence based drugs/vaccines recommended against the novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic virus.","output":"Combating the progression of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infectious Disease: Current state and future prospects in molecular diagnostic and drug discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between liquidity and stock returns in the Vietnam stock market during the COVID-19 outbreak.

It causes symptoms such as chest pain or dyspnea, but it is rare to see elderly patients who develop SPM. Here we report the case of an elderly patient diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who neither got mechanical ventilation nor had chest trauma but were found to develop SPM for unknown reason. CASE SUMMARY: A 62-year-old man complained of a 14-d history of fever accompanied by dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient was treated with supplementary oxygen by nasal cannula and gamma globulin. Other symptomatic treatments included antibacterial and antiviral treatments. On day 4 of hospitalization, he reported sudden onset of dyspnea. On day 6, he was somnolent. On day 12, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain which eventually progressed to bilateral chest pain. He was diagnosed with SPM, with no clear trigger found. Conservative treatment was administrated. During follow-up, the pneumomediastinum had resolved and the patient recovered without other complications. CONCLUSION: We presume that aging lung changes and bronchopulmonary infection play an important part in the onset of SPM in COVID-19, but severe acute respiratory syndrome may represent a separate pathophysiologic mechanism for pneumomediastinum. Although the incidence of SPM in elderly patients is low, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of SPM in those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for life-threatening complications such as cardiorespiratory arrest may occur.","output":"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum in an elderly COVID-19 patient: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on telemedical care have not been described on a national level. Thus, we investigated the medical stroke treatment situation before, during, and after the first lockdown in Germany. METHODS: In this nationwide, multicenter study, data from 14 telemedical networks including 31 network centers and 155 spoke hospitals covering large parts of Germany were analyzed regarding patients' characteristics, stroke type/severity, and acute stroke treatment. A survey focusing on potential shortcomings of in-hospital and (telemedical) stroke care during the pandemic was conducted. RESULTS: Between January 2018 and June 2020, 67,033 telemedical consultations and 38,895 telemedical stroke consultations were conducted. A significant decline of telemedical (p < 0.001) and telemedical stroke consultations (p < 0.001) during the lockdown in March/April 2020 and a reciprocal increase after relaxation of COVID-19 measures in May/June 2020 were observed. Compared to 2018-2019, neither stroke patients' age (p = 0.38), gender (p = 0.44), nor severity of ischemic stroke (p = 0.32) differed in March/April 2020. Whereas the proportion of ischemic stroke patients for whom endovascular treatment (14.3% vs. 14.6%; p = 0.85) was recommended remained stable, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower proportion of recommendation of intravenous thrombolysis during the lockdown (19.0% vs. 22.1%; p = 0.052). Despite the majority of participating network centers treating patients with COVID-19, there were no relevant shortcomings reported regarding in-hospital stroke treatment or telemedical stroke care. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedical stroke care in Germany was able to provide full service despite the COVID-19 pandemic, but telemedical consultations declined abruptly during the lockdown period and normalized after relaxation of COVID-19 measures in Germany.","output":"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on stroke teleconsultations in Germany in the first half of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nearly 220,000 children have been adopted from other countries by American parents since 1986.

The modality of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) combined with Western medicine (WM) approaches is being used to treat COVID-19 patients in China. Several systematic reviews (SRs) are available highlighting the efficacy and safety of TCM combined with WM approaches in COVID-19 patients. However, their evidence quality is not completely validated. Purpose: We aimed to assess the methodological quality and the risk of bias of the included SRs, assess the evidence quality of outcomes, and present their trends and gaps using the evidence mapping method. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, CBM, and Wanfang Data were searched from inception until March 2021 to identify SRs pertaining to the field of TCM combined with WM approaches for COVID-19. The methodological quality of the SRs was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), the risk of bias of the included SRs was assessed with the Risk of Bias in Systematic Review (ROBIS) tool, and the evidence quality of outcomes was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results: In total, 23 SRs were found eligible. Twenty-one were rated of moderate confidence by AMSTAR 2, while 12 were rated at low risk using the ROBIS tool. In addition, most outcomes were graded as having moderate quality using the GRADE system. We found that the combined use of TCM and WM approaches could improve the CT recovery rate, effective rate, viral nucleic acid negative conversion rate, and the disappearance rate of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Also, these approaches could decrease the conversion rate from mild to critical, white blood cell counts, and lymphocyte counts and shorten the time to viral assay conversion and the length of hospital stay. Conclusion: TCM combined with WM approaches had advantages in efficacy, laboratory, and clinical symptom outcomes of COVID-19, but the methodological deficiencies of SRs should be taken into consideration. Therefore, to better guide clinical practice in the future, the methodological quality of SRs should still be improved, and high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies should also be carried out.","output":"Evidence Mapping of 23 Systematic Reviews of Traditional Chinese Medicine Combined With Western Medicine Approaches for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper expands on \\"An Ethics Framework for Making Resource Allocation Decisions within Clinical Care: Responding to COVID-19,\\" which is also published in this special issue of the Journal of Bioethical Inquiry.

Thus, this study aims to evaluate the impact of temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 cases and deaths during the initial phase of the epidemic in Brazil. Methodology: This is an ecological study based on secondary data. Daily data on new COVID-19 cases and deaths and on climate indicators was collected from February 20th to April 18th, 2020 (n=59 days), for all state capital cities in Brazil and the Federal District (Brasilia). The studied climate indicators included mean temperature, temperature amplitude, mean relative humidity, relative humidity amplitude, and percentage of days with mean relative humidity less than or equal to 65%. Correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were performed for all cities and was also stratified by quintiles of the COVID-19 incidence rate. Results: Mean daily temperature was positively correlated with the number of days until the first COVID-19 case was reported. A lower mean relative humidity was correlated with lower number of cases and deaths in Brazil, especially when the relative humidity was less than or equal to 65%. Higher temperatures and humidity amplitudes were correlated with lower COVID-19 mortality. Additionally, after controlling for humidity, cumulative cases of COVID-19 were inversely associated with temperature in cities with mean temperatures less than 25.8 degrees Celsius.

We analyse data on livestock production from the index site (a commercial pig farm in Malaysia) prior to and during the outbreak, on Malaysian agricultural production, and from surveys of NiV's wildlife reservoir (flying foxes). Our analyses suggest that repeated introduction of NiV from wildlife changed infection dynamics in pigs. Initial viral introduction produced an explosive epizootic that drove itself to extinction but primed the population for enzootic persistence upon reintroduction of the virus. The resultant within-farm persistence permitted regional spread and increased the number of human infections. This study refutes an earlier hypothesis that anomalous El Ni?o Southern Oscillation-related climatic conditions drove emergence and suggests that priming for persistence drove the emergence of a novel zoonotic pathogen.

Relying on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for identifying infected individuals may result in missed cases. Screening for antibodies after an outbreak can help to find missed cases and better illuminate routes of transmission. METHODS: In this study, we present the results of a serological screening of the healthcare workers (HCWs) on a ward for infectious diseases in Sweden with a point-of-care antibody test 8 weeks after an outbreak of COVID-19. In all, 107/123 (87%) of HCWs who were tested with RT-PCR in the outbreak investigation participated in this study on seroprevalence. Participants were also asked to fill out a questionnaire entailing epidemiological data. The cohort was stratified by RT-PCR result and the resulting groups were compared to each other. RESULTS: Six (8%) HCWs who were tested RT-PCR negative during the outbreak investigation had developed specific IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These HCWs had all worked shifts with colleagues who later were tested RT-PCR positive during the outbreak.

The causes of delay are complex and include interrelated social, economic, cultural, environmental, and health system factors. Project Start was a qualitative study designed to assess and identify the multilevel factors contributing to the barriers and facilitators of initiating chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer who experienced 60 day delay in (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy initiation were included. Participants completed semi-structured interviews exploring barriers and facilitators to starting chemotherapy. Interviews were transcribed and coded to identify themes using the Sort and Sift, Think and Shift analytic approach. This analysis included thorough examination of the data by advancing through iterative analytic phases to identify core topics within and across transcripts. RESULTS: We enrolled (N=22) participants with median age at diagnosis 53.5 years (range 27C70) who identified as Latina (n=8), Black (n=5), and non-Latina White (n=9). Participants described a common chemotherapy initiation process reflecting their unique needs as they transitioned through four stages: 1) receiving diagnosis and treatment recommendations; 2) processing treatment options; 3) Flipping the Switch; and 4) activating treatment and engaging in care.

Previous research has shown that novel disease outbreaks are associated with high stress levels and sleep impairments that lead to neuropsychiatric consequences. Therefore, it is vital to study both stress and protective factors such as coping and resilience that may hinder or help sleep quality during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Further, as gender disparities exist in sleep quality, it is important to understand the relationship between pandemic\\\\related stress, coping strategies, resilience, and sleep in bothgenders during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: Our study examined how gender, stress, coping, and resilience were associated with sleep cross\\\\sectionally during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in a representative sample of US adults (N = 393). RESULTS: Consistent with many recent studies, we found that worsened sleep quality in women compared to men persisted during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

This aspect simplifies the estimation process, but does not consider the influence of relatively small changes in the design variables in terms of the objective function. In this work, the SIDR (Susceptible, Infected, Dead and Recovered) model is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and its parameters are estimated by formulating a robust inverse problem, that is, considering the sensitivity of design variables. For this purpose, a robust multi-objective optimization problem is formulated, considering the minimization of uncertainties associated to the estimation process and the maximization of the robustness parameter. To solve this problem, the Multi-objective Stochastic Fractal Search algorithm is associated with the Effective Mean concept for the evaluation of robustness. The results obtained considering real data of the epidemic in China demonstrate that the evaluation of the sensitivity of the design variables can provide more reliable results.","output":"Identification of an Epidemiological Model to Simulate the COVID-19 Epidemic using Robust Multi-objective Optimization and Stochastic Fractal Search"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Hospital palliative care is an essential part of the COVID-19 response, but relevant data are lacking. The recent literature underscores the need to implement protocols for symptom control and the training of non-specialists by palliative care teams. AIM The aim of the study was to describe a palliative care unit's consultation and assistance intervention at the request of an Infectious Diseases Unit during the COVID-19 pandemic, determining what changes needed to be made in delivering palliative care. DESIGN This is a single holistic case study design using data triangulation, for example, audio recordings of team meetings and field notes. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS This study was conducted in the Palliative Care Unit of the AUSL-IRCCS hospital of Reggio Emilia, which has no designated beds, consulting with the Infectious Diseases Unit of the same hospital. RESULTS A total of 9 physicians and 22 nurses of the Infectious Diseases Unit and two physicians of the Palliative Care Unit participated in the study.Our Palliative Care Unit developed a feasible 18-day multicomponent consultation intervention. Three macro themes were identified: (1) new answers to new needs, (2) symptom relief and decision-making process, and (3) educational and training issues. CONCLUSION From the perspective of palliative care, some changes in usual care needed to be made. These included breaking bad news, patients' use of communication devices, the limited time available for the delivery of care, managing death necessarily only inside the hospital, and relationships with families.","output":"Learning a palliative care approach during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case study in an Infectious Diseases Unit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although olfactory disorders (OD) are among the most significant symptoms of COVID-19, recovery time from COVID-19 related OD as well as their consequences on the quality of life remain poorly documented.

In the patients who subjectively recovered from COVID-19 related OD (N = 609), recovery occurred on average after 16 days and most of the time within one month (\\"normal\\" recovery range); 49 subjectively recovered in 1 to 2.5 months, and several cases took up to 6.5 months. Among the patients with ongoing OD (N = 2502), 974 were outside the \\"normal\\" recovery range (persistent OD) and reported OD for 1 to 10 months. Developing a persistent OD was more likely with increasing age and in women, and was more often associated with parosmia and phantosmia. The deleterious impact of COVID-19 related OD on the quality of life was significantly aggravated by OD duration, and was more pronounced in women. Because persistent OD is not infrequent after COVID-19, has deleterious consequences on the quality of life, and receives few solutions from the health practitioners, it would be beneficial to implement screening and treatment programs to minimize the long-term behavioral consequences of COVID-19 related OD.","output":"Recovery from COVID-19-related olfactory disorders and quality of life: insights from an observational online study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has brought about a lot of disruption, and education was one of the areas that was very significantly impacted.

We find that if Tokyo were locked down for a month, the indirect effect on other regions would be twice as large as the direct effect on Tokyo, leading to a total production loss of 27 trillion yen in Japan or 5.2% of the country's annual GDP. Although the production that would be shut down in Tokyo accounts for 21% of the total production in Japan, the lockdown would result in an 86% reduction of the daily production in Japan after one month.","output":"The propagation of economic impacts through supply chains: The case of a mega-city lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents two new concepts and definitions to the medical literature. One of those is endogenous retinoic acid theory and the other retinoic acid depletion syndrome. A new classification will be provided for the immune system: retinoic acid-dependent component and retinoic acid non-dependent component. If this theory is verified, all the diseases where the retinoic acid metabolism is defective and retinoic acid levels are low will be identified and new approaches will be developed fortreating such diseases. When the need for retinoic acids increases, such as acute infection, high fever, severe catabolic process, or chronic antigenic stimulation, cytochrome oxidase enzymes are inhibited by drugs or internal mechanisms. Metabolism and excretion of retinoic acids stored in the liver are prevented. In this way, retinoic acid levels in the blood are raised to therapeutic levels. This is called Endogenous Retinoic Acid Theory. Retinoic acids also manage their metabolism through feedback mechanisms. Despite compensatory mechanisms, causes such as high fever, serious catabolic process and excessively large viral genome (SARS-CoV-2), excessive use of RIG-I and Type I interferon synthesis pathway using retinoic acid causes emptying of retinoic acid stores. As a result, the RIG-I pathway becomes ineffective, Type I IFN synthesis stops, and the congenital immune system collapses. Then the immune mechanism passes to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, MDA5 and UPS pathways in the monocyte, macrophage, neutrophil and dendritic cells of the adaptive immune defense system that do not require retinoic acid. This leads to excessive TNF and cytokine discharge from the pathway. With the depletion of retinoic acid stores as a result of this overuse, the immune defense mechanism switches from the congenital immune system to the adaptive immune system, where retinoic acids cannot be used. As a result of this depletion of retinoic acids, the shift of the immune system to the NFB arm, which causes excessive cytokine release, is called retinoic acid depletion syndrome. COVID-19 and previously defined sepsis, SIRS and ARDS are each retinoic acid depletion syndrome. We claim that retinoic acid metabolism is defective in most inflammatory diseases, particularly COVID-19 (cytokine storm) sepsis, SIRS and ARDS. Finding a solution to this mechanism will bring a new perspective and treatment approach to such diseases.","output":"COVID-19: Endogenous Retinoic Acid Theory and Retinoic Acid Depletion Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, Human Reconstruction is an important part of 3D Reconstruction because it enables us to acquire human information. In reality, Human Reconstruction is applied more and more widely in various domains of people's life such as healthcare, education, sport, entertainment, fashion, anthropometry...especially in the Covid-19 pandemic situation. Technically, the digitalization of human shape and pose is being implemented by two main solutions. The first solution aims to re-create 3D shape and pose of people by using a set of 2D images from different view angles. The second method focuses on handling with the point cloud which is acquired from a set of depth cameras. Both of them have their own advantages and disadvantages. The current trend of 3D Human Reconstruction is to try recreating human shape and pose not only from various available sources (images, point cloud) but also from natural sources (surveillance camera). However, the accuracy of current solutions is significantly sensitive to the working environment. Therefore, this work gives an attempt to develop two human reconstruction methods and evaluate their performance in various conditions as synthetic, laboratory, and real-world environments. The results show a comparison of human reconstruction's accuracy due to the working environment and method of approach. In the synthetic environment, the accuracy is highest for both two methods because of the perfection of input. The accuracy of these methods is lower in the remaining environment. Besides, the result also proves that point cloud-based method is more sensitive than image-based method due to the limitation of hardware devices. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"3D Human Reconstruction: A Comparison between Images-Based and Point Cloud-Based Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined clinician insights into telehealth assessment services for autism spectrum disorder implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. 35 clinicians from multiple disciplines across 17 sites in the Autism Care Network were interviewed.

METHODS: This study was institutional review board approved. Reports for CT studies with findings of newly diagnosed diverticulitis within Henry Ford Health System during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 were reviewed and compared with the same time period in 2019. Total cases of diverticulitis on CT were compared, as well as the prevalence of an associated abscess. A chi-squared analysis was performed to determine the statistical significance of the percentage of patients presenting with an abscess in each year. RESULTS: During the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, 120 patients were identified with CT findings of newly diagnosed diverticulitis with 11.7% of those patients (14 patients) presenting with an associated abscess. During the same time period in 2019, many more CT studies with newly diagnosed diverticulitis were obtained (339), and, compared to 2020, less than half the percentage of those patients had an associated abscess (4.4% or 15 patients). CONCLUSION: Patients with urgent health concerns avoided appropriate and necessary care during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic. While non-COVID-19 emergency visits were diminished, patients who did present with diverticulitis were more likely to present with greater disease severity as manifested by an associated abscess. Patients must be encouraged to seek care when appropriate and need reassurance that hospitals and their emergency departments are safe to visit.

Aeromedical evacuation represents a unique challenge in which to manage ETT cuffs. We evaluated three methods of automatic ETT cuff pressure adjustment during changes in altitude in an altitude chamber. METHODS Size 7.5 and 8.0 mm ETTs that are currently included in the Critical Care Air Transport Team allowance standard were used for the evaluation. Three automatic cuff pressure controllers-Intellicuff, Hamilton Medical; Pyton, ARM Medical; and Cuff Sentry, Outcome Solutions-were used to manage cuff pressures. The fourth group had cuff pressure set at sea level without further adjustment. Each ETT was inserted into a tracheal model and taken to 8,000 feet and then to 16,000 feet at 2,500 ft/min. Baseline cuff pressure at sea level was approximately 25 cm H2O. RESULTS Mean cuff pressure at both altitudes with both size ETTs was as follows: Control arm, 141  64 cm H2O; Pyton, 25  0.8 cm H2O; Cuff Sentry, 22  0.3 cm H2O; and Intellicuff, 29  6.6 cm H2O. The mean time that cuff pressure was >30 cm H2O using Intellicuff at both altitudes was 2.8  0.8 minutes. Pressure differences from baseline in the control arm and with Intellicuff were statistically significant. Cuff pressure with the Cuff Sentry tended to be lower than indicated on the device. CONCLUSIONS Mean cuff pressures were within the recommended range with all three devices. Intellicuff had difficulty regulating the cuff pressure initially with increases in altitude but was able to reduce the pressure to a safe level during the stabilization period at each altitude.

This study aimed to pair network analysis and epidemiological data in order to evaluate the impact of animal movements on pathogen prevalence in farms and assess the risk of local areas being exposed to diseases due to incoming movements. Our methodology was applied to hepatitis E virus (HEV), an emerging foodborne zoonotic agent of concern that is highly prevalent in pig farms. Firstly, the pig movement network in France (data recorded in 2013) and the results of a nation-wide seroprevalence study (data collected in 178 farms in 2009) were modelled and analysed. The link between network centrality measures of farms and HEV seroprevalence levels was explored using a generalised linear model. The in-degree and ingoing closeness of farms were found to be statistically associated with high HEV within-farm seroprevalence (p < 0.05). Secondly, the risk of a French dpartement (i.e. French local administrative areas) being exposed to HEV was calculated by combining the distribution of farm-level HEV prevalence in source dpartements with the number of movements coming from those same dpartements. By doing so, the risk of exposure for dpartements was mapped, highlighting differences between geographical patterns of HEV prevalence and the risk of exposure to HEV. These results suggest that not only highly prevalent areas but also those having at-risk movements from infected areas should be monitored. Pathogen management and surveillance options in the pig production sector should therefore take animal movements into consideration, paving the way for the development of targeted and risk-based disease surveillance strategies.","output":"Combining network analysis with epidemiological data to inform risk-based surveillance: Application to hepatitis E virus (HEV) in pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Different screening procedures and diagnostic criteria are being followed in the same as well as in different countries with no single standard criteria established for diagnosis of GDM.

METHOD This prospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of a tertiary care institute in South India from March 2017 to October 2018. Six-hundred and eighty women with or without risk factors for GDM were recruited in the study and screened for GDM based on IADPSG and NICE criteria. Women with preexisting diabetes mellitus or with fasting plasma glucose  126 mg/dl were excluded. RESULTS The overall prevalence of GDM in our study was 27.2% by either IADPSG/NICE criteria. In this study, 25.1% women and 11.6% women were diagnosed as GDM using IADPSG and NICE criteria, respectively. The level of agreement between the two diagnostic criteria was found to be poor in our study and was statistically significant (kappa = 0.429, p < 0.001). Women testing IADPSG-positive NICE-negative had a higher risk of GHTN, abortions, PROM, preterm delivery, caesarean section and congenital anomalies, meconium-stained liquor, and low Apgar scores at 1 min when compared to non GDM group. In addition, except for preterm delivery, women diagnosed as GDM by both IADPSG and NICE criteria had adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia, urinary tract infection, and polyhydramnios. Women diagnosed as GDM in IADPSG-negative NICE-positive had no significant adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes.

METHODS: This paper attempts to overview current seasonal COVID-19 trends. RESULTS: Cases are spiking now in winter in Australia and also in summer weather, such as in Florida. Clearly warm weather does not significantly dampen viral spread unless public health mitigation measures are adhered to. Respiratory pathogens (including influenza), will co-circulate in winter. Co-infection with influenza and COVID-19 may worsen outcomes and mutations of either virus may change and further negatively affect such outcomes. The public in Australia has avidly taken the influenza vaccine and this, along with COVID-19 prevention measures, has drastically curbed influenza spread in this country. CONCLUSIONS: Countries in the northern hemisphere with high rates of COVID-19 should strive to reduce numbers prior to the onset of winter. Those that managed to maintain low COVID-19 rates due to public health measures should endeavor to maintain this status quo despite opening borders for economically badly needed tourists. Spikes of cases in countries wherein COVID-19 was formerly under control will deter tourists, further depressing beleaguered economies. Vigilance must be maintained until an effective vaccine becomes available.

Consequently, regulatory health agencies worldwide have altered their regulatory guidelines, on ethanol quality, to meet this high demand, raising concern about the products quality. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify ethanol content and to qualitatively assess common impurities in ethanol-based gel hand sanitizers by headspace gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (HS-GC/FID). METHODS: To quantify the ethanol content, 0.10 g of the sample was weighed in a 20 mL headspace vial and 5 mL of deionized water was added. Regarding the qualitative approach, 0.25 g of the sample was weighed and 4 mL of deionized water and was added. The samples were incubated, and then 400 L of the headspace was injected into the GC/FID. Forty-eight products purchased in Brazil were analyzed.

These scale response options create lowest point, current feelings, and difference scores to evaluate the healing outcome cross-sectionally. This manuscript aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the GBV-Heal to understand its usefulness for research and practice. METHOD: Instrument evaluation consisted of two phases analyzing online survey data from two GBV survivor samples recruited from online health research portals in the United States. In Phase One (N = 236), we conducted factor analyses and evaluated convergent/discriminant validity using depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and wellbeing measures.

Ideal anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates should be screened to prevent secondary injury to the lungs. Here, we propose that in vitro three-dimensional organoid and lung injury repair mouse models are powerful models for the screening antiviral drugs. Lung epithelial progenitor cells, including airway club cells and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, were co-cultured with supportive fibroblast cells in transwell inserts. The organoid model was used to evaluate the possible effects of hydroxychloroquine, which is administered as a symptomatic therapy to COVID-19 patients, on the function of mouse lung stem/progenitor cells. Hydroxychloroquine was observed to promote the self-renewal of club cells and differentiation of ciliated and goblet cells in vitro. Additionally, it inhibited the self-renewal ability of AT2 cells in vitro. Naphthalene- or bleomycin-induced lung injury repair mouse models were used to investigate the in vivo effects of hydroxychloroquine on the regeneration of club and AT2 cells, respectively. The naphthalene model indicated that the proliferative ability and differentiation potential of club cells were unaffected in the presence of hydroxychloroquine. The bleomycin model suggested that hydroxychloroquine had a limited effect on the proliferation and differentiation abilities of AT2 cells. These findings suggest that hydroxychloroquine has limited effects on the regenerative ability of epithelial stem/progenitor cells. Thus, stem/progenitor cell-derived organoid technology and lung epithelial injury repair mouse models provide a powerful platform for drug screening, which could possibly help end the

International Labour Organization, the first layoffs are occurring among those who live off precarious work, such as: outsourced workers, clerks, waiters, kitchen workers, day laborers, baggage handlers, and cleaners We show a brief synthesis of the consequences that the health crisis has brought to Brazilian workers and propose coping measures that are not limited to emergency aid The recovery and creation of occupations will depend, among other factors, on the resumption of spending on social and economic programs that were able to reduce social inequalities at the beginning of this century, such as PAC-favelas;Minha Casa, Minha Vida Program;Bolsa Famlia Program and the FAT Employment and Income Generation Program These programs can and must be expanded to bring the economy back to growth in the long run Alternate abstract: La pandemia de COVID-19 es un problema de salud pblica global que ha dado una nueva dinmica a la economa mundial La rpida propagacin de la enfermedad

pattern recognition. Many tasks are presented to resort to computational systems for ESR in real-life applications. However, current systems are usually designed for individual tasks, and are not robust and applicable to other tasks. Cross-task systems, which promote unified knowledge modeling across various tasks, have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we propose a cross-task system for three different tasks of ESR: acoustic scene classification, urban sound tagging, and anomalous sound detection. An architecture named SE-Trans is presented that uses attention mechanism-based Squeeze-and-Excitation and Transformer encoder modules to learn channel-wise relationship and temporal dependencies of the acoustic features. FMix is employed as the data augmentation method that improves the performance of ESR. Evaluations for the three tasks are conducted on the recent databases of DCASE challenges. The experimental results show that the proposed cross-task system achieves state-of-the-art performance on all tasks. Further analysis demonstrates that the proposed cross-task system can effectively utilize acoustic knowledge across different ESR tasks.","output":"A Squeeze-and-Excitation and Transformer based Cross-task System for Environmental Sound Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Women are underrepresented in professional spaces, particularly at leadership positions. In science, the participation in editorial boards of journals is evidence of a high reputation within a specialty or field. Therefore, female presence in editorial boards can be used as a proxy for female presence and leadership in academic spaces. Here, we assessed the gender composition in editorial boards of 31 biodiversity conservation (BC) journals included in the Web of Science and obtained information on current and past editorial boards of these journals. We found pervasive gender bias in the editorial boards of the main scientific BC journals. Current editorial boards were composed of 1251 editors, of which only 28.7% were women. Nevertheless, gender biases are becoming smaller over time. Our projections indicate that BC journals may achieve gender balance in their editorial boards by the year 2038. We argue that a diverse and inclusive editorial board has greater chances to propose innovative solutions to conservation problems. Thus, the academic community, editors and journals must take proactive measures to achieve gender balance. Given that most editors are men, hiring women still depends on them; and these men need urgently to take their share of responsibility and be actors of change. More broadly, journals and science decision-makers must commit to their importance in the movement and start, for example, to hire and support women's work.","output":"Pervasive gender bias in editorial boards of biodiversity conservation journals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The present study aimed to determine the correlation between pharyngeal airway volume and craniofacial morphology through cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Additionally, the study analyzed the influence of gender on pharyngeal airway volume. (2) Methods: 80 CBCT scans of 40 male and 40 female patients (mean age: 15.38 + 1.10 years) fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included. CBCT scans were evaluated for pharyngeal airway volume using the In Vivo Dental 5.1 software. Additionally, CBCT-derived lateral cephalograms were used to assess various craniofacial morphology parameters. To examine the influences of gender on airway volume, T-test was carried out. Correlation between airway volume and craniofacial parameters were measured using Pearson correlation followed by regression analysis. The value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean airway volume was significantly greater in males than in females. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between maxillary plane inclination and pharyngeal airway volume. In contrast, a positive correlation was observed between mandibular length and lower molar inclination with oropharyngeal and total pharyngeal airway volume. Females showed a statistically significant positive correlation between the pharyngeal airway volume and sagittal position of maxilla and mandible; they also showed a negative correlation between oropharyngeal airway volume and the mandibular plane angle. Conclusions: Overall, the pharyngeal airway space differs significantly between males and females.

Recent evidence suggests that solid organ transplant recipients who received mRNA vaccines reach low immunization rates. There are only few reports about the risk factors and severity of COVID-19 disease in these patients.

Material and methods Retrospective cohort study with kidney transplant patients who received a COVID-19 vaccine before testing positive for SARS-CoV-19 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Demographic characteristics and clinical information are described and compared with our previous series of patients who were infected before the initiation of the vaccination rollout. Results Sixteen kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 after being vaccinated were included and compared with our previous series of 76 unvaccinated positive patients. No differences were found among risk factors such as age, time after transplant, hypertension and obesity between groups (p-value > 0.05). After COVID-19 diagnosis among inoculated patients, ten patients were hospitalized, and 4 of whom met the criteria for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Three patients died due to COVID-19 complications. Despite this, the incidence of infections has decreased after vaccination rollout (p-value < 0.05). Conclusion Patients risk profiles remain constant among positive COVID-19 recipients between waves. We did not find significant differences in hospitalization and severity rates in this reduced group of patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a single center were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who underwent endovascular repair for acute TAAA between January 2010 and April 2020 were included. Perioperative and mid-term follow-up outcomes were analyzed. Survival, freedom from reintervention, and target vessel patency were calculated by KaplanCMeier analysis. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (18 men, 67.5  6.9 years) underwent endovascular repair for acute symptomatic (n = 15) or contained ruptured (n = 15) TAAA. An off-the-shelf four-branched stent-graft (T-Branch) was used in 19 (63.3%) patients, a custom-made device (CMD) with expedite order in 5 (16.7%) patients, a CMD with short anticipated delivery time in 3 (10.0%) patients, and a CMD available in the hospital in 3 (10.0%) patients. Technical success was 90.0% (n = 27). Thirty-day mortality was 10% (n = 3). There was no complete persistent paraplegia, but one (3.3%) patient suffered permanent limb weakness. Estimated survival at 1 and 2 years was 86.3%  6.4%, and 82.3%  7.2%, respectively. Estimated freedom from reintervention at 1 and 2 years was 81.4%  7.6% and 73%  8.8%. Estimated target vessel patency at 1 and 2 years was 96.6%  2% and 92.6%  2.9%. CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of acute TAAA in this selected group of patients was associated with low early mortality and excellent mid-term survival.

Our institution created a competency based virtual endocrinology elective to provide continued clinical experience with a focus on type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and health equity in diabetes care. Methods: A 4-week virtual endocrinology elective alternated between different mini-rotations to maximize exposure to inpatient and outpatient endocrine care, as well as self-directed and faculty/fellow directed educational experiences. Post-elective surveys assessed student satisfaction with elective components and change in comfort levels with T2DM management and social determinants of health (SDH) on diabetes care. Results: Overall, 87% (n=13) of students were extremely satisfied with the elective. Increased comfort was seen with management of type 2 DM and the impact of SDH on DM care (DM 88% neutral/uncomfortable to 94% comfortable, SDH 50% neutral/uncomfortable to 94% comfortable). Students were satisfied with the quality of patient care and requested opportunities for more direct involvement.

A disease is eliminated if it is controlled sufficiently to prevent an epidemic from occurring in a given geographical area. Control and elimination are achieved locally, but a disease can only be eradicated if it is eliminated everywhere. Eradication is plainly a more demanding goal, but it has two advantages over control. First, the economics of eradication can be very favourable when eradication not only reduces infections but also avoids the need for vaccinations in future. Indeed, when eradication is feasible, it will either pay to control it to a fairly low level or to eradicate it. This suggests that, from an economics perspective, diseases that are eliminated in high-income countries are prime candidates for future eradication efforts. Second, the incentives for countries to participate in an eradication initiative can be strong; indeed they can be even stronger than an international control programme. Moreover, high-income countries typically benefit so much that they will be willing to finance elimination in developing countries. Full financing of an eradication effort by nation-states is not always guaranteed, but it can be facilitated by a variety of means. Hence, from the perspective of economics and international relations, eradication has a number of advantages over control.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included hospitalized patients aged  18 years with confirmed COVID-19 in Alborz province, Iran, from 20 February 2020 to 25 March 2020. Data on demographic, clinical and outcome (in-hospital mortality) data were obtained from electronic medical records. Self-reported comorbidities were classified into the following groups: DM (having DM with or without other comorbidities), only DM (having DM without other comorbidities), CVD (having CVD with or without other comorbidities), only CVD (having CVD without other comorbidities), and having any comorbidity. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to quantify the risk and predictors of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 in patients with these comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 2957 patients with COVID-19, 2656 were discharged as cured, and 301 died. In multivariate model, DM (OR: 1.62 (95% CI 1.14C2.30)) and only DM (1.69 (1.05C2.74)) increased the risk of death from COVID-19; but, both CVD and only CVD showed non-significant associations (p > 0.05). Moreover, having any comorbidities increased the risk of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 (OR: 2.66 (95% CI 2.09C3.40)). Significant predictors of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with DM were lymphocyte count, creatinine and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (all P-values < 0.05).

Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon complication described in isolated case reports. However, a causal relationship has yet to be established. This case report adds to the growing body of evidence that GBS is a potential COVID-19 complication. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Caucasian woman with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection presented to the emergency department with 4 days of gradually worsening ascending lower extremity weakness. Exam revealed bilateral lower extremity weakness, mute reflexes, and sensory loss. Soon after starting intravenous administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG), the patient developed respiratory distress, eventually requiring intubation. She remained intubated for the duration of her IVIG treatment. After five rounds of treatment, the patient was successfully extubated and transferred to acute rehab. Following 4 weeks of intense physical therapy, she was able to walk with assistance on room air.

METHODS: This mixed-methods study included comprehensive literature review and in-depth interviews with key informants to assess the situation of management system of snakebite, antivenom market and access to antivenoms in seven ASEAN countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Lao PDR and Myanmar. Data were analysed by a framework method. RESULTS: ASEAN have developed various strategies to improve outcomes of snakebite victims. Five domestic antivenom manufacturers in the region produce up to 288 375 vials of antivenoms annually with the value of US$13 058 053 million which could treat 42 213 snakebite victims. However, there remain challenges to be addressed especially the lack of snakebite-related informatics system, inadequate antivenoms at the healthcare facilities and when the majority of snakebite victims seek traditional healers instead of conventional treatment.

Studying the Internet public opinion dissemination mechanism of public health emergencies is of great significance for creating a legalized network environment, and it is also helpful for managers to make scientific decisions when encountering Internet public opinion crisis. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the analysis of the process of spreading the Internet public opinion in major epidemics, a dynamic model of the Internet public opinion spread system was constructed to study the interactive relationship among the public opinion events, network media, netizens and government and the spread of epidemic public opinion. The Shuanghuanglian event in COVID-19 in China was taken as a typical example to make simulation analysis. Findings: Research results show three points: (1) the government credibility plays a decisive role in the spread of Internet public opinion;(2) it is the best time to intervene when Internet public opinion occurred at first time;(3) the management and control of social media are the key to public opinion governance. Besides, specific countermeasures are proposed to assist control of Internet public opinion dissemination. Originality/value: The epidemic Internet public opinion risk evolution system is a complex nonlinear social system. The system dynamics model is used to carry out research to facilitate the analysis of the Internet public opinion propagation mechanism and explore the interrelationship of various factors. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Internet public opinion dissemination mechanism of COVID-19: evidence from the Shuanghuanglian event"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) are still important for both children and pediatric urologists. Urotherapy is recommended in LUTD treatment management. In our country, all citizens under the age of 20 were banned from going out of their homes due to Covid-19 and the homeschooling system has been adopted The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of lockdown and homeschooling on the effectiveness of urotherapy used for LUTD treatment. METHODS 83 patients were included in the study group. Besides 306 patients were determined as the control group (pre-Covid). The patients in the study group and the control group were compared in terms of improvement in Dysfunctional voiding and incontinence scoring system (DVISS), quality of life scores, bladder diary, Bristol stool scale, and treatment responses at 3rd and 6th months. RESULTS The study group and control group were compared in terms of DVISS, voiding frequency and incontinence in the voiding diary, quality of life score, and Bristol stool scale at admission visit and the group characteristics were similar. During the 6th month visit, the mean DVISS of the study group was found to be significantly lower (7.12  3.48; 8.58  4.06 respectively (p 0.002)). Daily voiding frequency was similar in the study group and the control group during the 2nd and 3rd visit. The study group's mean number of daily incontinence was significantly lower at visit 3 (0.57  0.9; 0.94  0.27, respectively (p 0.02).After six months of treatment, 13.3% of the study group patients had a complete response, 44.6% had a partial response, whereas 42.2% non-responders. In the control group, the response rates were as 5.9%, 39.2% and 54.9% respectively (p 0.02). CONCLUSIONS LUTD is still very common in pediatric urology. Standard urotherapy is widely used in treatment management. According to our results, the success of standard urotherapy increases with lockdown and homeschooling. We have shown that the success of standard urotherapy can be improved by regulating environmental conditions.

METHODS Twenty eight swine were deeply anesthetized and received a 40% total body surface area full thickness burn injury and TBI. Swine were then randomized to receive restrictive or aggressive resuscitation for eight hours after which time animals were euthanized and necropsy was performed. Volume of brain injury was assessed after analyzing segmental slices of brain tissue. RESULTS There were no differences between the restrictive and aggressive resuscitation groups in blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, intra-cranial pressure (ICP), or serum lactate levels after 8 hours of resuscitation. Urine output was higher in the aggressive resuscitation group. The restrictive group had a significantly higher serum BUN compared to baseline and compared to the aggressive group. There was no significant difference in size of brain injury between groups. CONCLUSIONS Both restrictive and aggressive resuscitation demonstrated adequate resuscitation at eight hours post-injury. Increased serum BUN in the restrictive group may be an indicator of early acute kidney injury, despite adequate urine output.

Although it may seem unspecific, scientific evidence has allowed a better definition of this headache type, revealing relevant associations with other COVID-19 symptoms and prognoses. We therefore sought to highlight the most remarkable findings concerning headache secondary to COVID-19, specifically focusing on epidemiology, characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: The real prevalence of headache as a symptom of COVID-19 is still unclear ranging from 10 to 70%. Headache mainly has a tension-type-like phenotype, although 25% of individuals present with migraine-like features that also occur in patients without personal migraine history. This finding suggests that a likely pathophysiological mechanism is the activation of the trigeminovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism can occur by trans-synaptic invasion through the olfactory route from the nasal cavity, leading to anosmia which has been associated with headache. SARS-CoV-2 protein has been found not only in olfactory mucosa and bulbs but also in trigeminal branches and the trigeminal ganglion, supporting this hypothesis. However, other mechanisms such as brain vessels inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 damage to the endothelium or systemic inflammation in the context of cytokine storm cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, headache has been associated with lower COVID-19 mortality. No specific treatment for COVID-19 headache is available at present. SUMMARY: Studies show that investigating COVID-19 headache represents an opportunity not only to better understand COVID-19 in general but also to advance in the knowledge of both secondary and primary headaches.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether direct discharge () from the emergency department (ED) of SSIs is non-inferior to traditional care regarding treatment satisfaction and functional outcome, and to compare other patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), patient-reported experiences (PREMs), resource utilization, and adverse outcomes before and after . METHODS: This trial compared outcomes for 11 SSIs 6 months before and after the implementation of  protocols. Pre-, patients were treated according to local protocols. Post-, patients were discharged directly using removable orthoses, discharge leaflets, smartphone application, and telephone helpline. Participants received a 3-month postinjury PROM/PREM survey to assess treatment satisfaction (Visual Analog Scale, VAS), pain (VAS), functional outcome (four validated questionnaires), and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL; EuroQol-5D). Resource utilization included general practitioner (GP) visit (yes/no), physiotherapist visit (yes/no), return to work/school/sports (days), work/school absenteeism to visit hospital (yes/no), number of hospital visits, and follow-up X-rays. Other outcomes included missed injuries (additionally to SSI) and adverse outcomes (delayed union, non-union). Between-group differences were assessed using propensity score-adjusted regression analyses. Non-inferiority was assessed for satisfaction and functional outcome using predefined margins. RESULTS: 348 (pre-) and 371 (post-) patients participated; 144 (41.4%) and 153 (41.2%) patients completed the survey. Satisfaction and functional outcome post- were non-inferior to traditional care. Mean satisfaction was 8.13 pre- and 7.95 post- (mean difference: ?0.16, p=0.408). Pain, HR-QoL, GP/physiotherapist visits, and return to work/school/sports were comparable before and after .

However, studies on the association between methamphetamine use and adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) are limited and had inconsistent findings. This study aimed to determine the impact of methamphetamine use on adherence to ART among MSM living with HIV. From December 2018 to October 2019, MSM living with HIV were recruited (N = 351) and non-adherence to ART was defined as a Medication Adherence Report Scale score of <23. Overall, 16.0% of the participants reported methamphetamine use in the prior three months and 13.4% of the participants had non-adherence to ART. The proportion of non-adherence to ART among HIV-positive MSM were 28.6% and 10.5% with and without methamphetamine use, respectively. After controlling for demographics, illicit drug use, and co-morbidities, methamphetamine use during the prior three months was associated with a higher risk of non-adherence to ART (adjusted odds ratio = 3.08; 95% confidence intervals: 1.24-7.69). Compared with HIV-positive MSM with non-adherence to ART, HIV-positive MSM with good adherence to ART had a higher CD4 counts and were more likely to achieve an undetectable viral load. Since poor adherence to ART is associated with an increased HIV viral load and the risk of HIV transmission to others, our study suggests that it is imperative to screen HIV-positive patients for methamphetamine use and to provide effective therapy to reduce methamphetamine use and the associated non-adherence to ART.","output":"Methamphetamine Use Associated with Non-adherence to Antiretroviral Treatment in Men Who Have Sex with Men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Escape from recognition of SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant spike epitopes but overall preservation of T cell immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To explore whether the acute 30-day burden of COVID-19 on health care use has changed from the beginning to the end of the pandemic.

This is a relevant issue when millions of vapers (and smokers) must remain under indoor confinement and/or share public outdoor spaces with non-users. The fact that the respiratory flow associated with vaping is visible (as opposed to other respiratory activities) clearly delineates a safety distance of 1-2 m along the exhaled jet to prevent direct exposure. Vaping is a relatively infrequent and intermittent respiratory activity for which we infer a mean emission rate of 79.82 droplets per puff (6-200, standard deviation 74.66) comparable to mouth breathing, it adds into shared indoor spaces (home and restaurant scenarios) a 1% extra risk of indirect COVID-19 contagion with respect to a \\"control case\\" of existing unavoidable risk from continuous breathing. As a comparative reference, this added relative risk increases to 44-176% for speaking 6-24 min per hour and 260% for coughing every 2 min. Mechanical ventilation decreases absolute emission levels but keeps the same relative risks. As long as direct exposure to the visible exhaled jet is avoided, wearing of face masks effectively protects bystanders and keeps risk estimates very low. As a consequence, protection from possible COVID-19 contagion through vaping emissions does not require extra interventions besides the standard recommendations to the general population: keeping a social separation distance of 2 m and wearing of face masks.","output":"Aerial Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus through Environmental E-Cigarette Aerosols: Implications for Public Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We aimed to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of probiotics supplementation on symptoms and disease activity in patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondylarthritis (SpA), or psoriatic arthritis). METHODS A systematic literature review and meta-analysis from RA and SpA randomized controlled trials were conducted searching for articles in MEDLINE/PubMed and abstracts from recent international rheumatology meetings. The control group was a placebo or another dietary intervention. The risk of bias of the selected studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and the Jadad scale. RESULTS The initial search yielded 173 articles. Of these, 13 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, 8 concerning a total of 344 RA patients and 2 concerning a total of 197 SpA patients. Three meta-analyses were also analyzed. Probiotic strains and quantities used were different among trials (5 studies using Lactobacillus sp., 1 trial Bacillus coagulans and the others a mix of different probiotic strains). Time to assess response ranged from 8 weeks to one year. Two studies associated probiotic supplementation with a dietary intervention. Meta-analysis showed a statistically significant decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration (mean difference (MD)) -3.04 (95% CI -4.47, -1.62) mg/L, p < 0.001; I2 = 20%, n patients = 209) with probiotics in RA. However, after excluding high-risk-of-bias trials of meta-analysis, there was no difference between probiotics and placebo on DAS28 (standard MD -0.54; 95% CI -1.94 to 0.85, p = 0.45, I2 93%, n patients = 143). The two studies on SpA patients showed no efficacy of probiotics. CONCLUSIONS Probiotic supplementation might decrease RA activity with a moderate decrease effect on CRP, but lack of evidence and studies' heterogeneity do not allow us to propose them to patients with inflammatory arthritis to control their disease.

Therefore, many researchers have investigated the factors that could affect the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to assess the impact of aero-allergen sensitization and allergic diseases on the severity of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: We included 60 adult patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and allocated them into two groups equal in number as having severe and non-severe COVID-19. We evaluated the demographic features and allergic diseases in addition to clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of COVID-19. Skin prick tests (SPTs) with common aero-allergens, serum total IgE levels and blood eosinophil counts were evaluated 3 months after the patient's recovery from COVID-19. Results: The mean age of the patients was 52  11 years and 73.3% of the patients were male. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, gender, smoking habits, obesity and comorbidities. Although the frequency of sensitization to aeroallergens and the allergic diseases were similar, the history of allergic diseases in the family was higher in the severe group (p<0.001). The polysensitization in SPTs was associated with the presence of a cytokine storm during the infection (p=0.02). Total IgE levels and blood eosinophil counts were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: The presence of atopy or allergic diseases does not seem to be related to the severity of COVID-19.

Delayed or eliminated care may place patients at risk for adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVE.-: To identify opportunities for laboratory test stewardship to close potential gaps in care created by the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN.-: The study was a retrospective time series design examining laboratory services received before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large metropolitan health system serving women and children. RESULTS.-: Laboratory test volumes displayed 3 distinct patterns: (1) a decrease during state lockdown, followed by near-complete or complete recovery; (2) no change; and (3) a persistent decrease. Tests that diagnose or monitor chronic illness recovered only partially. For example, hemoglobin A1c initially declined 80% (from 2232 for April 2019 to 452 for April 2020), and there was a sustained 16% drop (28-day daily average 117 at August 30, 2019, to 98 at August 30, 2020) 4 months later.

There is limited data about patients with end-stage renal disease who also suffer from COVID-19. In this report, we discuss the case of a hemodialysis patient who developed COVID-19 pneumonia in the clinical course. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 79-year-old man who had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and was taking regular hemodialysis was admitted to hospital for a fever and dry cough. The patient, who also had cardiovascular disease, had no history of contact with COVID-2019 patients. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with COVID-2019 by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and his pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. INTERVENTION: The treatment was mainly supportive and the patient was intensively monitored. He was treated with oxygen, broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and methylprednisolone. The patient took continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) every 2 days. OUTCOMES: After 19 days, an RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, and computed tomography (CT) of the patient's thorax indicated that the pulmonary inflammatory exudation was absorbed and pulmonary infection improved significantly. He was discharged on day 29 after recovering from COVID-2019 pneumonia. LESSONS: The courses of disease and treatment options for this individual were significantly more complicated than those for ordinary patients. Therefore, it was necessary to monitor the condition of the patient closely and to protect the dialysis unit staff from being infected. Compared with other severe COVID-2019 cases, this patient recovered more quickly following treatment, which was likely due to the removal of inflammatory mediators by CRRT.

Although quality assurance procedures are followed to ensure safety and efficiency at all levels: appropriate handling of contaminated items, decontamination, proper cleansing, and instrument care, but the necessity of human presence to implement these procedure in-creases the threat of HAI. Thus, an intelligent autonomous multi-sensor wireless controlled NXT robot using MATLAB is proposed to handle contaminated items and sterilize equipments in the centralized sterilization sup-ply department. The proposed system is entirely automated and eliminates the need of human presence to implement quality assurance procedures, thus decreasing the threat of HAI. An archetype using Lego NXT robotic kit is developed to implement tasks performed in CSSD. MATLAB is used to control NXT robot instead of Lego Mindstorms software, due to its versatility, capability to perform computationally intensive tasks and wide usage by researchers. A powerful control system is designed that allows user to interrupt, control and monitor autonomous NXT robots.","output":"An Approach to design Human Assisting Prototype Robot for providing Fast and hygienically secure environment to Clinical professionals in order to fight against COVID-19 in Hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We formulate an optimal control problem to determine the lockdown policy to curb an epidemic where other control measures are not available yet.

It consists of documentation, linkage, and follow-up of cases, contacts, and events. To allow SORMAS users to visualise data, compute essential surveillance indicators, and estimate epidemiological parameters from such network data in real-time, we developed the SORMAS Statistics (SORMAS-Stats) application. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the essential visualisations, surveillance indicators, and epidemiological parameters implemented in the SORMAS-Stats application and illustrates the application of SORMAS-Stats in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Based on findings from a rapid review and SORMAS user requests, we included the following visualisation and estimation of parameters in SORMAS-Stats: transmission network diagram, serial interval (SI), time-varying reproduction number R(t), dispersion parameter (k) and additional surveillance indicators presented in graphs and tables. We estimated SI by fitting lognormal, gamma, and Weibull distributions to the observed distribution of the number of days between symptom onset dates of infector-infectee pairs. We estimated k by fitting a negative binomial distribution to the observed number of infectees per infector. Furthermore, we applied the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach and estimated R(t) using the incidence data and the observed SI computed from the transmission network data. RESULTS: Using COVID-19 contact-tracing data of confirmed cases reported between July 31 and October 29, 2021, in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt region of France, we constructed a network diagram containing 63570 nodes. The network comprises 1.75% (1115/63570) events, 19.59% (12452/63570) case persons, and 78.66% (50003/63570) exposed persons, 1238 infector-infectee pairs, 3860 transmission chains with 24.69% (953/3860) having events as the index infector. The distribution with the best fit to the observed SI data was lognormal distribution with a mean of 4.30 days (95% CI, 4.09-4.51 days). We estimated the dispersion parameter k of 21.11 (95% CI, 7.57-34.66) and an effective reproduction number R of 0.9 (95% CI, 0.58-0.60). The weekly estimated R(t) values ranged from 0.80 to 1.61. CONCLUSIONS: We provide an application for real-time estimation of epidemiological parameters, essential for informing outbreak response strategies. The estimates are commensurate with findings from previous studies. SORMAS-Stats application would greatly assist public health authorities in the regions using SORMAS or similar tools by providing extensive visualisations and computation of surveillance indicators.","output":"A Novel Tool for Real-Time Estimation of Epidemiological Parameters of Communicable Diseases Using Contact-Tracing Data: Development and Deployment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Portfolio assessment (PA) as an assessment for learning (AfL) alternative has been under-represented in second/foreign language acquisition (SLA) research literature.

This pivot to virtual instruction has been particularly difficult in courses where hands-on experiences are the norm, such as in anatomy and physiology laboratory courses. Now with the transition back to mostly in-person instruction, the anatomy and physiology lab environment has faced a new set of challenges where the want to return to a strictly hands-on experience is being met with the need to still maintain flexibility and accessibility for students placed in quarantine. The anatomy and physiology lab curriculum at the University of the Incarnate Word (UIW) has adapted to this varied set of needs by adopting the use of the web-based laboratory software platform, Lt.

The recent rise of opportunistic infections especially mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients is further complicating their outcomes. Mucormycosis is well known to infect patients with diabetes mellitus, malignancy, chemotherapy, and other immunocompromised conditions. The treatment of COVID-19 largely remains systemic steroids and other immunomodulators that add to the risk of invasive fungal infection. Methodology: Here, we present a retrospective case series of 13 patients with individual clinical characteristics along with the demography and treatment details. The data were collected retrospectively in a single center that caters to a large population of COVID-19 patients with varying severity. Results: Thirteen patients were presented with COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM). The median age was higher in non-survivors (49.5 years), with a higher odds of death (23.8) in those with severe COVID, having overall mortality of 64.3%. Moreover, diabetes mellitus was present in 61.5% of patients with a mortality of 75%. About 11 (84.6%) patients had received prior steroids for COVID-19. The incidence of hyperglycemia at admission was equal among both survivors and non-survivors. Conclusion: The prevalence of mucormycosis seems to be increasing among COVID-19 patients which may be associated with increased use of steroids, the possible immunocompromised state imposed by SARS-CoV-2, or co-existing conditions such as diabetes mellitus. The mortality of CAM is remarkably high and apart from preventive practices and rational use of immunomodulators, a high index of suspicion with early diagnosis would be key to survival.","output":"Coronavirus Disease-Associated Mucormycosis from a Tertiary Care Hospital in India: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION We present an approach to laparoscopic right colon resection utilizing a single port placed through the umbilicus.

Despite various modifications of reconstruction methods after LTG, an optimal procedure has yet to be established. The authors report the newly developed reconstruction technique after LTG: intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the transorally inserted anvil (OrVil; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). METHODS After full mobilization of the abdominal esophagus, the esophagus is transected with an endoscopic linear stapler. The anvil is then transorally inserted into the esophagus by using the OrVil system. After jejunojejunostomy is performed through a 4-cm midline minilaparotomy, preparing a 50-cm Roux-en-Y jejunal limb, a circular stapler is inserted into the jejunum and introduced into the abdominal cavity. Pneumoperitoneum is established by sealing off the laparotomy wound retractor with a surgical glove attached to the circular stapler. Double-stapling esophagojejunostomy with a circular stapler is performed intracorporeally, and the jejunal stump is closed with an endoscopic linear stapler. RESULTS Of the 16 patients who underwent this operation, there was no intraoperative complication or conversion to open surgery, and no patient required an extension of the initial incision for anastomosis. Mean operation time and blood loss were 194 min and 272 ml, respectively. One patient developed an intra-abdominal abscess postoperatively. Postoperative fluorography revealed no anastomosis leakage or stenosis in any of the patients. Patients resumed an oral liquid diet on postoperative day 3-5, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 11 days. CONCLUSIONS We have successfully performed LTG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction using our technique in 16 patients without any anastomosis complications. We believe that our procedure is a secure and reliable reconstruction method after LTG, which is especially useful in obese patients, in whom conventional extracorporeal anastomosis often is difficult.","output":"Intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the transorally inserted anvil (OrVil) after laparoscopic total gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"College students are aboriginals on the Internet, and the Internet has become an indispensable part of their lives.

RESULTS: In the home quarantine period, we documented a fall in the number of neurological admissions by 58.3%, but an increased need for intensive care in older patients. Patients in the home quarantine period were younger [73 (65?91) vs 76 (65?95), p = 0.005], had worse Glasgow Coma Scores (12.3  3.6 vs 13.7  2.5, p = 0.007), higher in-hospital mortality rate (21.3% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.001), had a lower prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, and chronic neurologic disease, albeit had a higher prevalence of the acute cerebrovascular disease (hemorrhagic/ ischemic stroke)(90.7% vs 78.9, p = 0.025).

Design: Clinical follow up study Setting: Academic and medical institutions in USA Participants: 269 healthy individuals ranging in age from 19 to 80 (Average age: 51; 165 females and 104 males) who received either BNT162b2 (Pfizer) or mRNA1273 (Moderna) vaccines. Main Outcome Measures NAb levels were measured: i) 2 to4 weeks after a second vaccine dose, ii) 2 to 4 months after the second dose, iii) within 1 to 2 weeks prior to a third dose and iv) 2 to 4 weeks after a third RNA vaccine dose. Results: In 269 study participants, percent neutralisation ranged from 0% to 99% 2 to 4 weeks after a second vaccine dose. The majority of vaccine recipients (154/269, 57%) demonstrated NAb levels at greater than 75% 2 to 4 weeks after their second dose. Our study also revealed that 25% of vaccine recipients did not neutralise above 50% (Median neutralisation: 21%, titers <1:80) within a month after their second dose. We called these individuals Vaccine Poor Responders (VPRs). Twenty-three VPRs ranging in age from 31 to 79 (10 males, 13 females, average age: 62.5) independently obtained a third dose of either BNT162b2 or mRNA1273 vaccine 1 to 8 months (average: 5 months) after their second dose. Within a month after their third dose, poor responders showed an average 20 fold increase in NAb levels (range 46% to 99%). Conclusions The results suggest that poor responders are not permanently poor responders; they can generate high NAb levels with an additional vaccine dose independent of mRNA vaccine manufacturer. Previous reports indicate that NAb levels decline much more rapidly than clinical protection from hospitalisation and disease, but that does not account for vaccine recipients who never generated high levels of NAbs after two doses. It is possible that poor responders are a source of breakthrough infections. Although it is not known what levels of NAbs protect from infection or disease, many vaccine recipients in high risk professions may wish to keep peripheral NAb levels high, limiting infection, asymptomatic viral replication, and potential transmission.","output":"Third COVID-19 Vaccine Dose Boosts Neutralising Antibodies in Poor Responders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cruise travel contributed to SARS-CoV-2 transmission when there were relatively few cases in the United States. By March 14, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a No Sail Order suspending U.S. cruise operations; the last U.S. passenger ship docked on April 16. METHODS: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises in U.S. waters or carrying U.S. citizens and used regression models to compare voyage characteristics. We used compartmental models to simulate the potential impact of four interventions (screening for COVID-19 symptoms; viral testing on two days and isolation of positive persons; reduction of passengers by 40%, crew by 20%, and port visits to one) for 7-day and 14-day voyages. RESULTS: During January 19CApril 16, 2020, 89 voyages on 70 ships had known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks; 16 ships had recurrent outbreaks. There were 1,669 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 29 confirmed deaths. Longer voyages were associated with more cases (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17, p < 0.0001). Mathematical models showed that 7-day voyages had about 70% fewer cases than 14-day voyages. On 7-day voyages, the most effective interventions were reducing the number of individuals onboard (43-49% reduction in total infections) and testing passengers and crew (42-43% reduction in total infections). All four interventions reduced transmission by 80%, but no single intervention or combination eliminated transmission. Results were similar for 14-day voyages.

In this study, we aimed to develop a noninvasive ARDS monitoring protocol based on traditional quantitative and radiomics approaches from chest CT. Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 31, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Quantitative and radiomics data were extracted from automatically segmented regions of interest (ROIs) of infection regions in the lungs. ARDS existence was measured by Pa02/Fi02 <300 in artery blood samples. Three different models were constructed by using the traditional quantitative imaging metrics, radiomics features and their combinations, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the effectiveness of the models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to test the clinical value of the proposed model. Results: The proposed models were constructed using 352 CT images from 86 patients. The median age was 49, and the male proportion was 61.9%. The training dataset and the validation dataset were generated by randomly sampling the patients with a 2:1 ratio. Chi-squared test showed that there was no significant difference in baseline of the enrolled patients between the training and validation datasets. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of the traditional quantitative model, radiomics model and combined model in the validation dataset was 0.91, 0.91 and 0.94, respectively. Accordingly, the sensitivities were 0.55, 0.82 and 0.58, while the specificities were 0.97, 0.86 and 0.98. The DCA curve showed that when threshold probability for a doctor or patients is within a range of 0 to 0.83, the combined model adds more net benefit than \\"treat all\\" or \\"treat none\\" strategies, while the traditional quantitative model and radiomics model could add benefit in all threshold probability. Conclusions: It is feasible to monitor ARDS from CT images using radiomics or traditional quantitative analysis in COVID-19. The radiomics model seems to be the most practical one for possible clinical use.

We detected key proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-damage response that are critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A drug-protein interaction-based secondary screen confirmed compounds, such as the ATR kinase inhibitor berzosertib and torin2 with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Berzosertib exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in multiple cell types and blocked replication at the post-entry step. Berzosertib inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as well. Our study highlights key promising kinase inhibitors to constrain coronavirus replication as a host-directed therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 and beyond as well as provides an important mechanism of host-pathogen interactions.","output":"Antiviral drug screen identifies DNA-damage response inhibitor as potent blocker of SARS-CoV-2 replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging zoonotic viral pathogens threaten global health and there is an urgent need to discover host and viral determinants influencing infection.

This system detects objects through frames of video data collected from a closed-circuit television using You Only Look Once (v. 4) and assigns and tracks object IDs using DeepSORT, a multiple object tracking algorithm. Next, the coordinates of the detected object are transformed by image warping the area designated by the top angle composition in the original frame. The converted coordinates are matched with the actual map to measure the distance between objects and detect the social distance. If an infected person is present, the object that violates the movement path and social distancing of the infected person is detected using the ID assigned to each object.

It is either idiopathic, drug-induced or malignancy associated (MASS). MASS is uncommon in cervical cancer, and usually signals diagnosis, progression or recurrence. CLINICAL COURSE: Two months following chemoradiation for stage IIIC2(r) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix, a 55-year-old female developed painful papules and plaques on her left toes. One week later she developed fever and the rash spread to her body. Labs revealed leukopenia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Punch biopsy showed neutrophilic dermal inflammation with papillary dermal edema and was negative for infectious immunohistochemistry. The clinical presentation and histopathological features were consistent with, and met diagnostic criteria for Sweet Syndrome. One month following Sweet Syndrome diagnosis and four months following chemoradiation, positron emission tomography scan revealed recurrence in the pelvic lymph nodes.

In this study, we developed a machine learning-driven predictive risk model for all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using multiparametric approach with data from different domains. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study used territory-wide data of patients with type 2 diabetes attending public hospitals or their associated ambulatory/outpatient facilities in Hong Kong between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality. The association of risk variables and all-cause mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Machine and deep learning approaches were used to improve overall survival prediction and were evaluated with fivefold cross validation method. RESULTS: A total of 273 678 patients (mean age: 65.412.7 years, male: 48.2%, median follow-up: 142 (IQR=106C142) months) were included, with 91 155 deaths occurring on follow-up (33.3%; annualized mortality rate: 3.4%/year; 2.7 million patient-years). Multivariate Cox regression found the following significant predictors of all-cause mortality: age, male gender, baseline comorbidities, anemia, mean values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (FBG), measures of variability of both HbA1c and FBG. The above parameters were incorporated into a score-based predictive risk model that had a c-statistic of 0.73 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.77), which was improved to 0.86 (0.81 to 0.90) and 0.87 (0.84 to 0.91) using random survival forests and deep survival learning models, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A multiparametric model incorporating variables from different domains predicted all-cause mortality accurately in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

However, their temporal offset may change in regions subject to nutrient enrichment, and by peaking earlier, such populations can maintain their position in the vernal plankton succession. We tested whether the marine keystone diatom Skeletonema marinoi can accomplish this through thermal evolutionary adaptation. Eight geographically separated subpopulations, representing hydromorphologically and climatologically similar inlets displaying a range of trophic states, were compared in a common-garden experiment. At early-spring temperatures, both doubling times and variation coefficients thereof, correlated negatively with the trophic state of the environment of origin, indicating selection for fast growth due to eutrophication. At mid-spring temperatures, the relationships were reversed, indicating selection in the opposite direction. At late-spring temperatures, no significant relationships were detected, suggesting relaxed selection. Subsequent field observations reflected these findings, where blooming temperatures decreased with trophic state. Natural selection thus moves along with eutrophication towards colder temperatures earlier in the spring, favouring genotypes with the capacity to grow fast.

Bags were punctured 3 times daily with a sterile needle to simulate clinical use. Injection ports were swabbed and 50 mL of fluid were collected in duplicates on days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 10. Aerobic bacterial cultures were performed on the fluid and injection port. Contamination was defined as bacterial growth of a similar phenotype across 2 consecutive times. Increase in the fluid contamination rate from day 0 was tested using an exact binomial test. Port contamination rate between locations was tested using Fisher's exact test. MAIN RESULTS Combined bacterial growth on injection ports reached a mean (95% confidence interval) of 8.1 (0.005-16.2) cfu/port on day 10. The combined port contamination was 3.3%, 11.1%, 17.8%, and 31.1% on days 0, 2, 4, and 7, respectively. Port contamination was similar between ER and ICU.

Our approach relies on automatically selecting the best (fitting or predicting) model from a range of user-defined time series models, excluding the most recent data points, to characterise the main trend in an incidence. We then derive prediction intervals and classify data points outside this interval as outliers, which provides an objective criterion for identifying departures from previous trends. We also provide a method for selecting the optimal breakpoints, used to define how many recent data points are to be excluded from the trend fitting procedure. The analysis of simulated COVID-19 outbreaks suggest ASMODEE compares favourably with a state-of-art outbreak-detection algorithm while being simpler and more flexible.

Promising disease-modifying treatments to reinstate UBE3A expression are under development and an early measure of treatment response is critical to their deployment in clinical trials. Increased delta power in EEG recordings, reflecting abnormal neuronal synchrony, occurs in AS across species and correlates with genotype. Whether delta power provides a reliable biomarker for clinical symptoms remains unknown. METHODS: We analyzed combined EEG recordings and developmental assessments in a large cohort of individuals with AS (N = 82 subjects, 133 combined EEG and cognitive assessments, 1.08-28.16 years; 32F) and evaluated delta power as a biomarker for cognitive function, as measured by the Bayley Cognitive Score. We examined the robustness of this biomarker to varying states of consciousness, recording techniques and analysis procedures. RESULTS: Delta power predicted the Bayley Scale cognitive score (P < 10-5 , R2 = 0.9374) after controlling for age (P < 10-24 ), genotype:age (P < 10-11 ), and repeat assessments (P < 10-8 ), with the excellent fit on cross validation (R2 = 0.95).

The aim of this study was to evaluate how measures adopted during the pandemic period affected retina clinic performance and patient satisfaction, and to model future clinic flow to predict operational performance under conditions of increasing patient and provider volumes. METHODS: Clinic event timestamps and demographics were extracted from the electronic medical records of in-person retina encounters from March 15 to May 15, 2020 and compared with the same period in 2019 to assess patient flow through the clinical encounter. Patient satisfaction was evaluated by Press Ganey patient experience surveys obtained from randomly selected outpatient encounters. A discrete-events simulation was designed to model the clinic with COVID-era restrictions to assess operational performance under conditions of increasing patient and provider volumes. RESULTS: Retina clinic volume declined by 62 % during the COVID-19 health emergency. Average check-in-to-technician time declined 79 %, total visit length declined by 46 %, and time in the provider phase of care declined 53 %. Patient satisfaction regarding access nearly doubled during the COVID-period compared with the prior year (p < 0.0001), while satisfaction with overall care and safety remained high during both periods.

The study found that cyberbullying and abuse were direct positive predictors (critical t-value for the path > 1.96; p < 0.05) of adolescent NSSI; however, screen time did not have any direct relationship. Furthermore, stress was a significant full mediating factor of screen time and a partial mediating factor of cyberbullying and abuse in the relationship with adolescent NSSI (critical t-value of the path = 5.27; p < 0.05). Cyberbullying, screen time, and abuse with the mediating effect of stress could explain 48% of the variance in adolescent NSSI (R(2) = 0.48). Adolescent mental health prevention and promotion programs need to be redesigned during the current COVID-19 pandemic to manage their stress and minimize the mental health consequences of cyberbullying, abuse, and inappropriately increased screen time.","output":"The Effect of Cyberbullying, Abuse, and Screen Time on Non-suicidal Self-Injury Among Adolescents During the Pandemic: A Perspective From the Mediating Role of Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has led to the implementation of strict restrictions in Australia, which have severely impacted sporting activities Tennis is played by 6 2% of the population within the Oceania region, and is a valuable sport for maintaining social, mental, and physical health Current literature indicates the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of Australian residents The aim of this study was to investigate changes in training and match play due to the outbreak, and its effects on emotional well-being of Australian senior tennis players Additionally, explore any differences between middle aged (41-60 years) and senior (61 years and over) Australian tennis players An online survey was used to assess training and match play habits, as well as ascertain the emotional well-being of tennis players The survey was active from 24th April 2020 until 6th June 2020 Participants were adult (41+ years) tennis players from Australia Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed to check for differences in training hours and tennis matches played Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess the difference in Brief Emotional Experience Scale (BEES) scores, employment status as well as the training hours and tennis matches played between the two age groups A Kendall's Tau B correlation test was performed to assess the associations of training, match play and demographic characteristics with BEES scores Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed differences in BEES scores between participants of differing match play formats, tennis experience and cessation of tennis training time periods There were 245 respondents who met our inclusion criteria Tennis training hours along with the tennis matches played significantly decreased during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19, 85 09 and 88 48%, respectively No significant (p &gt; 0 05) differences were observed between age groups for any of the training modality hours, nor was there any significant difference in number of tennis matches played The participants average BEES score was 0 99 +/- 1 27, indicating that respondents had a positive emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic The emotional well-being of the senior group was significantly (P = 0 002) higher than the middle aged group Together, our results show that training and tennis match play decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, however the emotional well-being of senior tennis players in Australia appeared to not be negatively affected","output":"Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mood and Training in Australian Community Tennis Players"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While there is wide consensus regarding the importance of early intervention, health is rarely considered within priorities.

Therefore, the delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs by oxidation-responsive smart systems would be an efficient anti-inflammatory strategy that benefits from the selective drug release in an inflammatory site, a lower treatment dose, and minimizes side effects. PURPOSE: In this study, we present the feasibility of an oxidation-sensitive PEGylated alternating polyester, methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(phthalic anhydride-alter-glycidyl propargyl ether) (mPEG-b-P(PA-alt-GPBAe)), as novel nanocarrier for curcumin (CUR), and explore the application in anti-inflammatory therapy. METHODS: The copolymers used were obtained by combining a click reaction and a ring-opening-polymerization method. CUR was loaded by self-assembly. The in vitro drug release, cytotoxicity toward RAW 264.7 cells and cellular uptake were investigated. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effects of CUR-loaded polymeric nanoparticles (NPs-CUR) were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages and tested in a murine model of ankle inflammation. RESULTS: Fast drug release from NPs-CUR was observed in trigger of 1 mM H(2)O(2) in PBS. Compared with NPs and free drugs, the significant anti-inflammatory potential of NPs-CUR was proven in activated RAW 264.7 cells by inhibiting the production of TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 and increasing the level of an anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Finally, a local injection of NPs-CUR at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg suppressed the acute ankle inflammatory response in mice by histological observation and further reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the affected ankle joints compared to that of free CUR.

We have previously used this method to detect HSV1, GBV-C, and measles virus sequence in brain tissue from deceased donors. Deep sequencing was performed on brain specimens from a cohort of patients who died with progressive forms of MS, revealing evidence of increased expression of some human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) domains. OBJECTIVES: Identify RNA sequences and new antigens involved in the pathogenesis of MS METHODS: Deep sequencing was performed on RNA extracted from 12 progressive MS, 2 neuromyelitis optica (MS/NMO = demyelination group), 14 normal control, and 7 other neurologic disease (OND) control frozen brain specimens. The resulting single-ended 50 bp sequences (reads) were compared to a non redundant viral database representing (NRVDB) all 1.2 M viral records in GenBank. A retroviral gene catalog (RVGC) was prepared by identifying human genetic loci (GRCh37.p13) homologous to domains contained in the Gypsy 2.0 retro element database. Reads were aligned to the RVGC and human transcriptome with Bowtie2. The resulting viral hit rates (VHRs) were normalized by the number of high quality reads. The expression of human genes, including HERVs, was determined using Cufflinks. Comparisons between the groups were performed using the false discovery rate. RESULTS: Fifty to 131 million high quality reads per specimen were obtained. Comparison of the reads to the NRVDB suggested that the demyelination and OND specimens had higher VHRs against some retroviral sequences compared with the controls. This was confirmed by retroviral domain averaging. Gene expression analysis showed differential expression among some HERV sequences. Single read mapping revealed one envelope and one reverse transcriptase sequence record that were significantly enriched among the demyelination samples compared to the normal controls. Less restrictive (comprehensive) read mapping showed that 2 integrase, 2 core, 2 envelope, and 3 KRAB sequences that were overexpressed in the demyelination group. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that some endogenous retroviral sequences are significantly overexpressed in these demyelination brain tissue specimens, but the magnitude of this overexpression is small. This is consistent with the concept of HERV activation as a part of the innate immune response.","output":"Enrichment of Retroviral Sequences in Brain Tissue from Patients with Severe Demyelinating Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives.

It is based on the observation that most patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a drastic reduction of food intake, and that a substantial percentage develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation or even continuous positive airway pressure. METHODS: High-calorie dense diets in a variety of different consistencies with highly digestible foods and snacks are available for all patients. Oral supplementation of whey proteins as well as intravenous infusion of multivitamin, multimineral trace elements solutions are implemented at admission. In the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficit, cholecalciferol is promptly supplied. If nutritional risk is detected, two to three bottles of protein-calorie oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are provided. If <2 bottles/d of ONS are consumed for 2 consecutive days and/or respiratory conditions are worsening, supplemental/total parenteral nutrition is prescribed. CONCLUSION: We are aware that our straight approach may be debatable.

By introducing a new laser configuration in place of conventional optical system of the flow cytometry, the interference fringe (periodic intensity modulation) is created inside the flow which provides a calibrated scale for the size measurement. The fringe pitch is precisely determined by the crossing angle of laser beams and the wavelength. The transverse size of the beam spot can be much larger than wavelength, for example, 30 micro-meters, where the flow cell design in conventional system can be used with moderated dimensional tolerance. The interaction length of sample with laser becomes longer: ~30 micro-meter and thus the scattering light and fluorescent light in case of labeled particle becomes much higher. Importantly, those signals are modulated in MHz frequency range associated with the periodic intensity modulation of the interference fringe. By measuring modulation depth, we can determine the particle size. We may utilize a bandpass filter or the digital signal processing of FFT, and thus we can drastically improve S/N ratio. This is because of the narrow spectrum of signal and thus effectively eliminates noise from various debris contained in the sample, and also low frequency shot noise in the photo detector signal. Thanks to the above-mentioned merits, it will be possible to measure the size of EVs and exosomes in particle-by-particle basis in reliable dimensional scale at nano-meter resolution.

Our goals are to (1) to observe the correlation between the strictness of social distancing policies and the spread of disease and (2) to determine the optimal adoption level of social distancing policies. The earliest instances of the virus were found in China, and the virus has reached the United States with devastating consequences. Other countries severely affected by the pandemic are Brazil, Russia, the United Kingdom, Spain, India, Italy, and France. Although it is impossible to stop it, it is possible to slow down its spread to reduce its impact on the society and economy. Governments around the world have deployed various policies to reduce the virus spread in response to the pandemic. To assess the effectiveness of these policies, the systems dynamics of the society needs to be analyzed, which is generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with continuous feedback loops. Because of the challenges with the other methods, we chose agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise in assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis by applying policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, emergency hospitalization, and travel prevention to reduce infection rates. Based on modeling studies conducted in Imperial College, increasing levels of interventions could slow the spread of disease and infection. We ran the model with six different percentages of social distancing while keeping the other parameters constant. The results show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, in turn decreasing the spread of disease and infection rates when implemented at higher levels. We also validated these results by using the behavior space tool with ten experiments with varying social distancing levels. We conclude that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels leads to a significant reduction in infection spread and the number of deaths. Both experiments show that infection rates are reduced drastically when social distancing intervention is implemented between 80% to 100%.","output":"Quantifying the Effects of Social Distancing on the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present article examines how job demands and resources are related to indices of strain among healthcare professionals during virus pandemics.

MethodsFifty-eight patients and thirty matched controls underwent symptom-questionnaires, cardiac and lung magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and spirometry at 3 months following COVID-19. Of them, forty-six patients returned for follow-up assessments at 6 months. FindingsAt 2-3 months, 83% of patients had at least one cardiopulmonary symptom versus 33% of controls. Patients and controls had comparable biventricular volumes and function. Native cardiac T1 (marker of inflammation) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE, marker of focal fibrosis) were increased in patients. Sixty percent of patients had lung parenchymal abnormalities on CMR and 55% had reduced peak oxygen consumption (pVO2) on CPET. By 6 months, 53% of patients remained symptomatic. On CMR, indexed right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (-4{middle dot}3 mls/m2, P=0{middle dot}005) decreased and RV ejection fraction (+3{middle dot}2%, P=0{middle dot}0003) increased.

METHODS: Published and grey literature was reviewed, and augmented by consultation with key informants, to collate past experience, existing guidelines and emerging strategies for pandemic vaccine deployment. Identified ethical issues and decision-making processes were also included. Concurrently, simulation modelling studies estimated the likely impacts of alternative vaccine allocation approaches. Assembled evidence was presented to a workshop of national experts in pandemic preparedness, vaccine strategy, implementation and ethics. All of this evidence was then used to generate a proposed ethical framework for vaccine priorities best suited to the Australian context. FINDINGS: Published and emerging guidance for priority pandemic vaccine distribution differed widely with respect to strategic objectives, specification of target groups, and explicit discussion of ethical considerations and decision-making processes. Flexibility in response was universally emphasised, informed by real-time assessment of the pandemic impact level, and identification of disproportionately affected groups. Model outputs aided identification of vaccine approaches most likely to achieve overarching goals in pandemics of varying transmissibility and severity.

Saudi Arabia's first case was reported in March 2020. Subsequently, some 220,000 cases and 2,000 deaths were recorded through July 2020. COVID-19 infection aggravates glycemic control and provokes acute hyperglycemic crises, according to some reports. We made the same observations in some of our patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, we are unaware of any reported cases of DKA among COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: Highlighting the significance of hyperglycemia on COVID-19 patient outcomes. METHODS: Five patients with DKA were admitted and diagnosed with COVID-19 based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Electronic medical records were reviewed and informed consent was obtained prior to reporting the index cases. RESULTS: Five patients presenting with DKA complicating a concurrent COVID-19 infection were reported. Three were known to have preexisting diabetes and two had newly diagnosed diabetes based on significantly elevated glycated hemoglobin levels at admission. Four recovered and were discharged to their homes and one had a complicated course and died. CONCLUSION: Our cases demonstrate that COVID-19 infection can trigger DKA. DKA can occur among patients who are known to have diabetes mellitus or appears as a first presentation. Clinicians should be extremely careful in checking for admission hyperglycemia and closely monitor respiratory status during fluid resuscitation of COVID-19-related DKA.","output":"Diabetic Ketoacidosis Precipitated by COVID-19 infection: Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of a maternal vaccine against newborn calf diarrhea associated with group A bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine parvovirus and K99 Escherichia coli (E. coli) were examined on a beef cow-calf herd.

Computed tomography images have revealed that the virus preferentially affects the base of the lung, which experiences larger tidal stretches than the apex. We hypothesize that the expression of both the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are sensitive to regional cell stretch in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we stretched precision cut lung slices (PCLS) for 12 h with one of the following protocols: 1) unstretched (US); 2) low-stretch (LS), 5% peak-to-peak area strain mimicking the lung base; or 3) high-stretch (HS), the same peak-to-peak area strain superimposed on 10% static area stretch mimicking the lung apex. PCLS were additionally stretched in cigarette smoke extract (CSE) to mimic an acute inflammatory exposure. The expression of ACE2 was higher whereas that of TMPRSS2 was lower in the control samples following LS than HS. CSE-induced inflammation substantially altered the expression of ACE2 with higher levels following HS than LS. These results suggest that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in lung cells is mechanosensitive, which could have implications for the spatial distribution of COVID-19-mediated lung injury and the increased risk for more severe disease in active smokers and patients with COPD.","output":"Mechano-inflammatory sensitivity of ACE2: Implications for the regional distribution of SARS-CoV-2 injury in the lung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent events, most notably the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, have made it increasingly apparent that liquidity is synonymous with corporate survival. In this paper, we explore how governments can fulfill an important need as suppliers of liquidity. Building on the financing advantage view of state ownership, we theorize how state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may provide capital by offering trade credit to customer firms. The data indicate a positive relation between the level of state ownership and the provision of trade credit. Using an institution-focused framework, we further determine that the nation's institutional environment systematically affects the opportunities and motivations for SOEs to grant trade credit. Specifically, we find that SOEs grant more trade credit in countries with less developed financial markets, weaker legal protection of creditors, less comprehensive information-sharing mechanisms, more collectivist societies, left-wing governments, and higher levels of unemployment. Firm-level factors also influence the credit-granting decisions of SOEs, with SOEs with lower levels of state ownership and higher extents of internationalization offering lower amounts of trade credit. Overall, our study offers novel insights regarding the important role of state-owned firms as providers of liquidity.","output":"International evidence on state ownership and trade credit: Opportunities and motivations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is a new, rare, post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We aimed to describe the 6-month outcomes of PIMS-TS. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised children (aged <18 years) who fulfilled the UK Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) diagnostic criteria for PIMS-TS and were admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK) between April 4 and Sept 1, 2020. Patients were followed up by a multidisciplinary team of specialists at 6 weeks and 6 months after admission. Biochemical and functional outcomes were analysed. FINDINGS: 46 children were included in this study. The median age at presentation was 102 years (IQR 88-133), 30 (65%) patients were male and 16 (35%) were female, 37 (80%) were from minority ethnic groups, and eight (17%) had pre-existing comorbidities. All patients had elevated markers of systemic inflammation at baseline. None of the patients died. By 6 months, systemic inflammation was resolved in all but one patient. 38 (90%) of 42 patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies within 6 weeks of admission remained seropositive at 6 months. Echocardiograms were normal in 44 (96%) of 46 patients by 6 months, and gastrointestinal symptoms that were reported in 45 (98%) of 46 patients at onset were present in six (13%) of 46 patients at 6 months. Renal, haematological, and otolaryngological findings largely resolved by 6 months. Although minor abnormalities were identified on neurological examination in 24 (52%) of 46 patients at 6 weeks and in 18 (39%) of 46 at 6 months, we found minimal functional impairment at 6 months (median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 0 [IQR 0-1]). Median manual muscle test-8 scores improved from 53 (IQR 43-64) during hospital admission to 80 (IQR 68-80) at 6 months, but 18 (45%) of 40 patients showed 6-min walk test results below the third centile for their age or sex at 6 months. PedsQL responses revealed severe emotional difficulties at 6 months (seven [18%] of 38 by parental report and eight [22%] of 38 by self report). 45 (98%) of 46 patients were back in full-time education (virtually or face to face) by 6 months. INTERPRETATION: Despite initial severe illness, few organ-specific sequelae were observed at 6 months. Ongoing concerns requiring physical re-conditioning and mental health support remained, and physiotherapy assessments revealed persisting poor exercise tolerance. Longer-term follow-up will help define the extended natural history of PIMS-TS.

Is one exercise training modality better than the others for improving these outcomes? DESIGN Systematic review with network meta-analysis of randomised trials. PARTICIPANTS Adults requiring haemodialysis for end-stage renal disease. INTERVENTION Aerobic training, resistance training, combined training and control (no exercise or placebo). OUTCOME MEASURES Aerobic capacity, arterial blood pressure at rest, and haemodialysis efficiency. RESULTS Thirty-three trials involving 1254 participants were included. Direct meta-analyses were conducted first. Aerobic capacity improved significantly more with aerobic training (3.35 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 1.79 to 4.91) and combined training (5.00 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 3.50 to 6.50) than with control. Only combined training significantly reduced systolic (-9 mmHg, 95% CI -13 to -4) and diastolic (-5 mmHg, 95% CI -6 to -3) blood pressure compared to control. Only aerobic training was superior to control for haemodialysis efficiency (Kt/V 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20). However, when network meta-analysis was conducted, there were some important different findings. Both aerobic training and combined training again elicited greater improvements in aerobic capacity than control. For systolic blood pressure, combined training was superior to control. For diastolic blood pressure, combined training was superior to aerobic training and control. No modality was superior to control for haemodialysis efficiency. Combined training was ranked as the most effective treatment for aerobic capacity and arterial blood pressure. CONCLUSION Combined training was the most effective modality to increase aerobic capacity and blood pressure control in people who require haemodialysis.

Meta-analysis of Nofimas Atlantic salmon microarray database was performed for the selection of genes that have shown strong and reproducible expression changes. Using data from 127 experiments including 6440 microarrays, four transcription modules (TM) were identified with a total of 902 annotated genes: 161 virus responsive genes C VRG (activated with five viruses and poly I:C), genes that responded to three pathogenic bacteria (523 up and 33 down-regulated genes), inflammation not caused by infections C wounds, melanized foci in skeletal muscle and exposure to PAMP (180 up and 72 down-regulated genes), and stress by exercise, crowding and cortisol implants (33 genes). To assist the selection of gene markers, genes in each TM were ranked according to the scale of expression changes. In terms of functional annotations, association with diseases and stress was unknown or not reflected in public databases for a large part of genes, including several genes with the highest ranks. A set of multifunctional genes was discovered. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase was present in all TM and 22 genes, including most differentially expressed matrix metalloproteinases 9 and 13 were assigned to three TMs. The meta-analysis has improved understanding of the defense strategies in Atlantic salmon. VRG have demonstrated equal or similar responses to RNA (SAV, IPNV, PRV, and ISAV), and DNA (gill pox) viruses, injection of bacterial DNA (plasmid) and exposure of cells to PAMP (CpG and gardiquimod) and relatively low sensitivity to inflammation and bacteria. Genes of the highest rank show preferential expression in erythrocytes. This group includes multigene families (gig and several trim families) and many paralogs. Of pathogen recognition receptors, only RNA helicases have shown strong expression changes. Most VRG (82%) are effectors with a preponderance of ubiquitin-related genes, GTPases, and genes of nucleotide metabolism. Many VRG have unknown roles. The identification of TMs makes possible quantification of responses and assessment of their interactions.

Study volunteers attempted to contact and enroll patients in the MyChart patient portal to allow the completion of a post-discharge video visit. If patients were unable to enroll, barriers were documented and coded for themes. Of the 324 patients discharged from MSBI during the study period, 277 (85%) were not yet enrolled in MyChart. Volunteers successfully contacted 136 patients (49% of those eligible), and 39 (14%) were successfully enrolled. Inability to contact patients was the most significant barrier.

A name-based rationing system was established to enable the population of Taiwan to purchase affordable medical face masks on-site and on the electronic platform (eMask). This study is to assess the extent and fairness of face mask supply to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan.Methods: This was a retrospective longitudinal study. The weekly face mask supply statistics were collected from name-based rationing system administration and included the National Health Insurance Card and eMask selling records. National registered population statistics by age, gender, and district were collected from the Ministry of the Interior Department of Statistics.Findings: Purchase records showed that the weekly average face mask supply was 05 mask per person at the beginning of the name-based rationing system and gradually increased to a maximum of 51 masks per person. Comparing monthly total face mask supply in aged 0-9,10-19, 20-59, and aged 60 years to the register population in Taiwan, exception first month implementation, the other period showed a similar distribution of mask supply to that to the total population.

The C-terminal helices of Nsp1 (Nsp1-C-ter) from SARS-CoV-2 bind in the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosomal subunit and blocks mRNA entry, thereby shutting down host protein synthesis. Nsp1 suppresses host immune function and is vital for viral replication. Hence, Nsp1 appears to be an attractive target for therapeutics. In this study, we have in silico screened Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs against Nsp1-C-ter. Among the top hits obtained, montelukast sodium hydrate binds to Nsp1 with a binding affinity (K(D)) of 10.8  0.2 M in vitro. It forms a stable complex with Nsp1-C-ter in simulation runs with C95.8  13.3 kJ/mol binding energy. Montelukast sodium hydrate also rescues the inhibitory effect of Nsp1 in host protein synthesis, as demonstrated by the expression of firefly luciferase reporter gene in cells. Importantly, it shows antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with reduced viral replication in HEK cells expressing ACE2 and Vero-E6 cells. We, therefore, propose montelukast sodium hydrate can be used as a lead molecule to design potent inhibitors to help combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Drug targeting Nsp1-ribosomal complex shows antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DETAILS OF THE CLINICAL CASE: A 51-yr-old man underwent a respiratory rehabilitation program (RRP), after being tracheostomized and ventilated due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. Respiratory care, early mobilization, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation were started in the ad hoc isolation ward of our rehabilitation center. At baseline, muscle function was consistent with intensive care unit-acquired weakness and the patient still needed mechanical ventilation (MV) and oxygen support. During the first week of RRP in isolation, the patient was successfully weaned from MV, the tracheal cannula was removed, and the walking capacity was recovered. At the end of the RRP, continued in a standard department, respiratory muscles strength increased by 7% and muscle function improved as indicated by the quadriceps size enlargement of 13% and the change of the Medical Research Council sum score from 48/60 to 58/60. DISCUSSION: Providing RRP in patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS involves risks for operators and organizational difficulties, especially in rehabilitation centers; nevertheless, its continuity is important to prevent the development of permanent disabilities in previously healthy subjects. Limited to the experience of only one patient, we were able to carry out a safe RRP during the COVID-19 pandemic, promoting the complete functional recovery of a COVID-19 young patient. SUMMARY: Most patients who develop serious consequences of COVID-19 infection risk a reduction in their quality of life. However, by organizing and directing specialized resources, subacute rehabilitation facilities could ensure the continuity of the RRPs even during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Feasibility and Efficacy of the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program in a Rehabilitation Center: CASE REPORT OF A YOUNG PATIENT DEVELOPING SEVERE COVID-19 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern pose a major threat to public health, due to possible enhanced virulence, transmissibility and immune escape.

Six-week-old mice were inoculated intranasally with a representative virus from the original B.1 lineage, or the emerging B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages. We also infected a group of mice with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10). Viral load and mRNA levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines were analyzed in the lung tissues on day 3 after infection. Our data show that unlike the B.1 virus, the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 viruses are capable of infecting C57BL/6 mice and replicating at high concentrations in the lungs. The B.1.351 virus replicated to higher titers in the lungs compared with the B.1.1.7 and MA10 viruses. The levels of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-, IL-1) and chemokine (CCL2) were upregulated in response to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infection in the lungs. In addition, robust expression of viral nucleocapsid protein and histopathological changes were detected in the lungs of B.1.351-infected mice.

We account for transmission during a pre-symptomatic incubation period and use a time-varying effective reproduction number (R(t)) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention. We estimate the intervention effect on reducing the transmission rate using a natural experiment design and quantify uncertainty by permutation. In China and South Korea, we predicted the entire disease epidemic using only early phase data (2C3 weeks after the outbreak). A fast rate of decline in R(t) was observed, and adopting mitigation strategies early in the epidemic was effective in reducing the transmission rate in these two countries. The nationwide lockdown in Italy did not accelerate the speed at which the transmission rate decreases. In the United States, R(t) significantly decreased during a 2-week period after the declaration of national emergency, but it declined at a much slower rate afterwards.

These cytokines were stratified for periodontitis, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (anti-CCP) status. Binary logistic regression analyses with periodontitis as outcome were performed adjusting for the above mentioned confounding factors including anti-rheumatic medication, disease duration and the cytokine in question.

Mutated malignant cells may in many cases be controlled by the immune system to be kept at an unnoticed low amount. However, a severe infection may compromise the immune system in controlling such malignant clones leading to escape and fatal cancer progression. A novel mechanism based computational model coupling cancer and infection to the adaptive immune system is presented and analyzed. The model pin-points important physiological mechanisms responsible for cancer progression and explains numerous medical observations. The progression of a cancers and the effects of treatments depend on cancer burden, the level of infection and on the efficiency of the adaptive immune system. The model exhibits bi-stability, i.e., gravitate towards one of two stable steady states: a harmless dormant state or a full-blown cancer-infection disease state. A borderline exists and if infection exceeds this for a sufficiently long period of time the cancer escapes. Early treatment is vital for remission and may control the cancer back into the stable dormant state. CAR T-cell immunotherapy is investigated by help of the model. The therapy significantly improves its efficacy in combination with antibiotics or immunomodulation. ABSTRACT: Background: The immune system attacks threats like an emerging cancer or infections like COVID-19 but it also plays a role in dealing with autoimmune disease, e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases, and aging. Malignant cells may tend to be eradicated, to appraoch a dormant state or escape the immune system resulting in uncontrolled growth leading to cancer progression. If the immune system is busy fighting a cancer, a severe infection on top of it may compromise the immunoediting and the comorbidity may be too taxing for the immune system to control. Method: A novel mechanism based computational model coupling a cancer-infection development to the adaptive immune system is presented and analyzed. The model maps the outcome to the underlying physiological mechanisms and agree with numerous evidence based medical observations. Results and Conclusions: Progression of a cancer and the effect of treatments depend on the cancer size, the level of infection, and on the efficiency of the adaptive immune system. The model exhibits bi-stability, i.e., virtual patient trajectories gravitate towards one of two stable steady states: a dormant state or a full-blown cancer-infection disease state. An infectious threshold curve exists and if infection exceed this separatrix for sufficiently long time the cancer escapes. Thus, early treatment is vital for remission and severe infections may instigate cancer progression. CAR T-cell Immunotherapy may sufficiently control cancer progression back into a dormant state but the therapy significantly gains efficiency in combination with antibiotics or immunomodulation.","output":"Potential of Immunotherapies in Treating Hematological Cancer-Infection ComorbiditiesA Mathematical Modelling Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about the potential consequences of pancreatic tissue sampling in dogs. The goal of the present study was to evaluate changes in serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity and canine-specific pancreatic lipase after pancreatic fine-needle aspiration and surgical biopsy in 27 clinically healthy dogs.

Subsequently, all the dogs underwent intraoperative pancreatic fine-needle aspiration and clamshell biopsy. After euthanasia, pancreata were sectioned for histopathologic evaluation. Serum pancreatic enzyme levels were measured at 3 time points: baseline, after ultrasound-guided aspiration, and after intraoperative aspiration and biopsy. No significant differences were detected among mean serum pancreatic lipase values at any point (P > 0.05). Serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity did not change from baseline (18.2 +/- 2.1 microg/dl; mean +/- standard error) after ultrasound-guided aspiration (13.6 +/- 2.2 microg/dl) but increased significantly after intraoperative sampling (44.8 +/- 1.9 microg/dl; P < 0.0005).

In two pre-registered experiments, we investigated the degree to which young adults' concerns about COVID-19 correlated with their ability to sustain attention.

Despite large and stable individual differences, performance on the scene CPT did not significantly correlate with the severity of COVID-related concerns obtained from the survey. Experiment 2 tested US participants during a later phase of the pandemic. Once again, CPT performance did not significantly correlate with COVID concerns expressed in a pre-task survey. However, participants who had more task-unrelated thoughts performed more poorly on the CPT.

Based on our knowledge of HIV pathophysiology, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated lymphopenia could also be related to T cell apoptosis. By comparing intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU COVID-19 patients with age-matched healthy donors, we found a strong positive correlation between plasma levels of soluble FasL (sFasL) and T cell surface expression of Fas/CD95 with the propensity of T cells to die and CD4 T cell counts. Plasma levels of sFasL and T cell death are correlated with CXCL10 which is part of the signature of 4 biomarkers of disease severity (ROC, 0.98). We also found that members of the Bcl-2 family had modulated in the T cells of COVID-19 patients. More importantly, we demonstrated that the pan-caspase inhibitor, Q-VD, prevents T cell death by apoptosis and enhances Th1 transcripts. Altogether, our results are compatible with a model in which T-cell apoptosis accounts for T lymphopenia in individuals with severe COVID-19.

After 12 h of MinION sequencing, strain-level characterization could be achieved, linking the food containing a pathogen to the related human isolate of the affected patient, by means of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogeny.

The purpose of this study is to examine how public institutions act during a pandemic to ensure the security of supply. Design/methodology/approach - The distinct focus is if, why and how public institutions have adopted additive manufacturing (AM) - a production technology colloquially known as three-dimensional printing in which a product is created by joining raw material layer by layer based on a digital model (computer-aided design [CAD] file) of the product - in reaction to supply disruptions caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. For this purpose, four cases within the context of the pandemic supply disruption are used as the units of analysis. Findings - The findings are twofold: public institutions reacted, on the one hand, with a behavioral solution approach, trying to solve the supply disruption with new or changed forms of cooperation and collaboration. On the other hand, public institutions used a technical solution approach (TSA) as a supply disruption response and intensified their use of AM. Research limitations/implications - This research derives an implications model that focuses on the TSA. Considering the ex ante and ex post phases of the disruption, several effects of AM on resilience are identified. The most relevant is the long-term learning effect (i.e. AM data created during this disruption might also help in a new disruption). Practical implications - Practitioners who act under extreme pressure and uncertainty are informed by cases that have managed to close bottleneck situations with either a behavioral or TSA. Specific strategies are given for how public buyers could use AM within a pandemic situation to mitigate supply bottlenecks, such as increasing their robustness by localizing sourcing and increasing agility by combining traditional and additive supply sources. Additionally, insights are provided into how public organizations can increase their level of preparedness by including disruption paragraphs, establishing CAD databases, in contract clauses and keeping reserve contracts with AM service providers. Originality/value - This research contrasts behavioral and technical solution concepts for a pandemic in the public sector. Thus, it provides insights into the relative benefits of AM and causes and effect with regard to how AM affects supply robustness and agility.","output":"Learning from supply disruptions caused by SARS-CoV-2: use of additive manufacturing as a resilient response for public procurement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in Hong Kong in a regional surveillance study for Coronaviruses in 2012 and was detected for the first time in United States (US) swine in February 2014.

Thus, this study investigates the relationship between sexual function and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iranian pregnant women. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional study was carried out among 437 pregnant women using the sociodemographic and obstetrics characteristics questionnaire, Female Sexual Function Inventory, Stress, Depression, and Anxiety Scales. Random sampling was employed to select pregnant women who had a medical record in Health Centers of Tabriz city, Iran. The questionnaires were sent to the participants' cell phones via WhatsApp or text messages, including links of questionnaires and the participants completed these questionnaires. Spearman correlation test was used to determine the relationship between sexual function and stress, anxiety, and depression. Generalized linear modeling was used to estimate each of the independent variables (sociodemographic characteristics, stress, anxiety, and depression) on the dependent variable (sexual function). RESULTS: The mean (Standard Deviation) sexual functioning (total) score was 20.0 (8.50) from the available range of 2 to 36. The mean (SD) of depression, stress, and anxiety scale was 4.81 (5.22), 5.13 (4.37), and 7.86 (4.50) (possible score ranging from 0 to 21), respectively. Based on Spearman's correlation test, there was a significant reverse correlation between the total sexual function score and stress, anxiety, and depression, indicating that all three variables negatively impacted sexual functioning. Variables such as mild stress, spouse type of job, sufficient household income, living with parents, higher marital satisfaction, and higher gestational age had a significant, positive impact on sexual function and could predict 35.8% of the variance model. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual functioning was significantly impacted by stress, anxiety, and depression - all of which are heightened during a pandemic.

Statins, prescribed primarily for lipid reduction, are known to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties and have been associated with a reduced mortality rate among COVID-19 patients taking statins as reported in two recent retrospective studies. However, a meta-analysis that included nine studies showed that statin use did not improve in-hospital outcomes of those with COVID-19. In addition, concerns regarding the use of statins and an increase in COVID-19 infections have been raised, as statins may increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our goal was to investigate the effect of statins in COVID-19 patients in a large, diverse patient population across the United States containing nearly 120,000 patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

Methods: Patients with exclusively ileal involvement CD who underwent IUS and an FC were prospectively included. Simple ultrasound index was used to determine inflammatory activity. The usual statistical tests for comparison of diagnostic techniques were used. Results: One hundred and five patients were included, IUS showed inflammatory activity in 59% of patients and complications in 18.1%. FC showed a significant correlation with IUS in the weak range (Spearman coefficient r=0.502; P<0.001); the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.88; P<0.001).

For allergic children in Ireland, already waiting up to 4 years for an elective oral food challenge (OFC), the restrictions signified indefinite delay. At the time of the initiative, there were approx 900 children on the Children's Health Ireland (CHI) waiting list. In July 2020, a project was facilitated by short\\\\term (6 weeks) access to an empty COVID stepdown facility built, in a hotel conference centre, commandeered by the Health Service Executive (HSE), Ireland. The aim of this study was to achieve the rapid roll\\\\out of an offsite OFC service, delivering high throughput of long waiting patients, while aligning with existing hospital policies and quality standards, international allergy guidelines and national social distancing standards. METHODS: The working group engaged key stakeholders to rapidly develop an offsite OFC facility. Consultant paediatric allergists, consultant paediatricians, trainees and allergy clinical nurse specialists were seconded from other duties. The facility was already equipped with hospital beds, bedside monitors (BP, pulse and oxygen saturation) and bedside oxygen. All medication and supplies had to be brought from the base hospital. Daily onsite consultant anaesthetic cover was resourced and a resuscitation room equipped. Standardized food challenge protocols were created. Access to the onsite hotel chef facilitated food preparation. A risk register was established. RESULTS: After 6 weeks of planning, the remote centre became operational on 7/9/2020, with the capacity of 27 OFC/day. 474 challenges were commenced: 465 (98%) were completed and 9 (2%) were inconclusive. 135 (29%) OFCs were positive, with 25 (5%) causing anaphylaxis. No child required advanced airway intervention. 8 children were transferred to the base hospital. The CHI allergy waiting list was reduced by almost 60% in only 24 days. CONCLUSIONS: Oral food challenges remain a vital tool in the care of allergic children, with their cost saving and quality\\\\of\\\\life benefits negatively affected by a delay in their delivery. This project has shown it is possible to have huge impacts on a waiting list efficiently, effectively and safely with good planning and staff buy\\\\ineven in a pandemic. Adoption of new, flexible and efficient models of service delivery will be important for healthcare delivery in the postCCOVID\\\\19 era.","output":"Mass food challenges in a vacant COVID\\\\19 stepdown facility: Exceptional opportunity provides a model for the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although social exclusion violates the basic needs of sense of control, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and belongingness, it is unknown if fear of missing out (FoMO) or attachment anxiety contributes to ones sense of ostracism and each of these basic needs. We aimed to identify if baseline scores in attachment anxiety and/or FoMO predict how excluded an individual feels after playing an online ball-tossing game designed to include or exclude them and if these constructs tap into basic needs that ostracism has shown to threaten. A sample of 193 young adults participated in this online study. After completing measures of demographics, FoMO, and attachment anxiety, each participant played Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game. Under the guise of playing with two other human participants, this paradigm consists of pre-programmed conditions of either inclusion, which entails receiving 10 of the total 30 ball tosses, or exclusion, which consists of receiving the ball only twice at the beginning of the game. Participants then completed post-measures of state ostracism, basic needs, and attention checks and were debriefed regarding the nature of the Cyberball game. We found that FoMO, but not attachment anxiety, predicted how ostracized one felt. Likewise, FoMO was inversely related to control, belongingness, and meaningful existence. Attachment anxiety did not predict any of the basic needs examined in the study. We conclude FoMO may be less about the experience one misses out on and more about the fear of being excluded. Future research is needed to evaluate if people experience increases in state FoMO while excluded and if baseline mood influences our findings.","output":"Afraid of Social Exclusion: Fear of Missing Out Predicts Cyberball-Induced Ostracism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"KENIA C Een verpleegkundige plaatst een kaars ter nagedachtenis aan collegas die stierven aan covid-19.

Bedside clinicians abstracted daily patient data on history, treatment, and short-term course. We describe management and a proposed severity scale for treatment used in this hospital. RESULTS: 44 patients were enrolled; with incomplete information on 11. Of the 33 studied patients, 91% were male, median age 64; 88% were overweight or obese. 45% were hypertensive, 12% had been taking an ACE-inhibitor. Noninvasive ventilation was performed on 39% of patients for part or all or their ICU stay with no provider infection. Most patients received antibiotics for pneumonia. Patients also received lopinivir/ritonavir (82%), hydroxychloroquine (79%), and tocilizumab (12%) according to this treatment algorithm. Nine of 10 patients survived their ICU course and were transferred to the floor, with one dying in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: ICU patients with COVID-19 frequently have hypertension.

Estimating the geographic location of mobile devices is an essential step for statistical inference. Most studies use the Voronoi tessellation for this, which is based on the assumption that mobile devices are always connected to the nearest radio cell. This paper uses a modular Bayesian approach, allowing for different modules of prior knowledge about where devices are expected to be, and different modules for the likelihood of connection given a geographic location. We discuss and compare the use of several prior modules, including one that is based on land use. We show that the Voronoi tessellation can be used as a likelihood module. Alternatively, we propose a signal strength model using radio cell properties such as antenna height, propagation direction, and power. Using Bayes' rule, we derive a posterior probability distribution that is an estimate for the geographic location, which can be used for further statistical inference. We describe the method and provide illustrations of a fictional example that resembles a real-world situation. The method has been implemented in the R packages mobloc and mobvis, which are briefly described.","output":"A Bayesian approach to location estimation of mobile devices from mobile network operator data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As antiviral drug resistance develops and new viruses emerge there is a pressing need to develop strategies to rapidly develop antiviral therapeutics.

We discovered two antiviral drug combinations act on distinct signaling pathways, either STAT1 or S6 phosphorylation, to block HSV-1 infection. We focused on upregulation of S6 phosphorylation by HSV-1 infection, and our subsequent finding that ribavirin antagonizes this upregulation of S6 phosphorylation.

Chemoprophylaxis with repurposed drugs enables deployment ahead of development of novel vaccines. It may have particular utility as a stopgap ahead of vaccine deployment or when vaccines become less effective on virus variants, in countries where there may be structural inaccessibility to vaccines or in specific risk-groups. Rapid implementation of robust trial designs is a persistent challenge in epidemics. We systematically reviewed SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 chemoprophylaxis trial registrations from the first 21 weeks of the pandemic to critically appraise significant design features and alignment of study populations to clinical and public health uses, and describe candidate chemoprophylactic agents. METHODS: We searched online international trial databases from 31 Dec 2019 to 26 May 2020 using keywords \\"proph*\\" or \\"prevention\\". Trial protocols assessing efficacy of chemoprophylactic agents for COVID-19 were included. Trial components were screened for eligibility and relevant studies extracted. Key trial design features were assessed. RESULTS: We found 76 chemoprophylaxis study registrations, proposing enrolment of 208,367 people with median size of 490 (IQR 262-1710). A randomised design was specified for 63 trials, 61 included a control group and total proposed enrolment size was 197,010, median 600 (IQR 236-1834). Four protocols provided information on effect size sought. We estimate that for a control group attack rate of 10%, 66% of trials would be underpowered to detect a 50% effect size, and 97% of trials would be underpowered to detect a 30% effect size (at the 80% level). We found evidence of adaptive design in one trial registration only. Laboratory-confirmed infection with or without symptoms was the most common primary outcome. Polymerase chain reaction testing alone was used in 46% of trials, serological testing in 6.6% and 14.5% used both testing methods. Healthcare workers were the target population in 52/79 (65.8%) trials: 49 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and 3 post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Sixteen trials (20.3%) planned PEP in close contacts. Five studies (6.3%) considered chemoprophylaxis in clinical-risk patients. Older adults were the focus of recruitment in only 3 (3.8%) studies (all long-term care facilities). Two (2.5%) studies of PrEP in the general population included older adults. Hydroxychloroquine was the most common candidate agent in 55/79 trials (69.6%), followed by chloroquine (4/79, 5.0%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (3/79, 3.8%). CONCLUSION: Many registered COVID-19 chemoprophylaxis efficacy trials were underpowered to detect clinically meaningful protection at epidemiologically informed attack rates. This, compounded with the time that has taken to organise these trials as compared to the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines, has rendered these trials of marginal importance. International coordination mechanisms and collaboration is required. Supporting the design of feasible chemoprophylaxis trials, large enough to generate strong evidence, early on in an epidemic using adaptive platform trial designs will allow structured entry and exit of candidate agents and rapid stand-up of trial infrastructure.

For more than five decades, the search for new antibiotics has relied heavily on the chemical modification of natural products (semisynthesis), a method ill-equipped to combat rapidly evolving resistance threats. Semisynthetic modifications are typically of limited scope within polyfunctional antibiotics, usually increase molecular weight, and seldom permit modifications of the underlying scaffold. When properly designed, fully synthetic routes can easily address these shortcomings2. Here we report the structure-guided design and component-based synthesis of a rigid oxepanoproline scaffold which, when linked to the aminooctose residue of clindamycin, produces an antibiotic of exceptional potency and spectrum of activity, which we name iboxamycin. Iboxamycin is effective against ESKAPE pathogens including strains expressing Erm and Cfr ribosomal RNA methyltransferase enzymes, products of genes that confer resistance to all clinically relevant antibiotics targeting the large ribosomal subunit, namely macrolides, lincosamides, phenicols, oxazolidinones, pleuromutilins and streptogramins. X-ray crystallographic studies of iboxamycin in complex with the native bacterial ribosome, as well as with the Erm-methylated ribosome, uncover the structural basis for this enhanced activity, including a displacement of the Structure-guided design and component-based synthesis are used to produce iboxamycin, a novel ribosome-binding antibiotic with potent activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.","output":"A synthetic antibiotic class overcoming bacterial multidrug resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Risk of COVID-19 exposure and more severe illness are serious concerns for older adults.

Therefore, the emerging BCT can present an invaluable opportunity for the organisations in need of preparing for and responding to uncertain and complex instances. The adoption of BCT in the operations and supply chain management (OSCM) literature remains scarcely investigated, especially in the context of managing risks in emergency situations such as crises, disasters, and pandemics, which are characterised by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA) in the business environment. This article will contribute to the OSCM literature by developing a conceptual model that will examine the causal relationships between VUCA business environment, constructs derived from technology acceptance model (TAM), resilience and behavioural intention of the operations managers to adopt BCT for risk management. The model was tested by gathering responses from 116 operations managers in the UK (during COVID-19 pandemic) through structural equation modelling. Findings from the analysis suggest that understanding the benefits of BCT, involvement in resilient organisational practices and user-friendly implementation of the technology will have a significant and positive influence on the intention to adopt BCT for risk management in the OSCM context.

However, the inverse problem of ECGI is ill-posed, and it requires accurate mathematical modeling of both atria and torso, mainly from CT or MR images.

All the hospital centres in Spain were contacted in order to collect data on patients with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis who had taken at least one dose of DPIA. Its efficacy was analysed in clinical, functional and microbiological terms by comparing the year before and the year after the prescription of DPIA. Adverse effects and variables associated with these effects, or any need to withdraw the drug, were also analysed. RESULTS: 164 patients from 33 Spanish centres were included; 86% and 14% of these were treated with dry powder colistin and tobramycin, respectively. Chronic bronchial infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present in 86% of these patients, and DPIA significantly reduced the number of exacerbations, the quantity and purulence of sputum and the isolation of pathogenic microorganisms. The most common adverse effect was cough (40%), particularly in cases of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and a previous cough and in those patients who had difficulties in handling the device.

We performed a retrospective study of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to October 30, 2020 in an integrated academic medical system in the Chicagoland area. We analyzed patients who had daily exertional oximetry measurements taken. We defined exertional hypoxia as SpO2 < 90% with ambulation. We excluded patients who had first exertional oximetry measurements or first exertional hypoxia after the use of oxygen therapies. We determined the association of exertional hypoxia without resting hypoxia with the eventual need for nasal cannula or advanced oxygen therapies (defined as high flow nasal cannula, Bi-PAP, ventilator, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). We also calculated the time between development of exertional hypoxia and the need for oxygen therapies. Of 531 patients included, 132 (24.9%) had exertional hypoxia. Presence of exertional hypoxia was strongly associated with eventual use of nasal cannula (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.8-8.4) and advanced oxygen therapy (IRR 7.7, 95% CI 3.4-17.5). Exertional hypoxia preceded nasal cannula use by a median 12.5 h [IQR 3.25, 29.25] and advanced oxygenation by 54 h [IQR 25, 82].

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of behavioral intention of free/self-paid COVID-19 vaccination and its associations with prosociality and social responsibility among university students in China. METHODS: An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 6922 university students in five provinces in China during November 1-28, 2020. With informed consent, participants filled out an online survey link distributed to them via WeChat study groups. The response rate was 72.3%. RESULTS: The prevalence of behavioral intentions of free COVID-19 vaccination was 78.1%, but it dropped to 57.7% if the COVID-19 vaccination involved self-payment (400 RMB; around 42 USD). After adjusting for background factors, prosociality (free vaccination: adjusted odds ratio [ORa] = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.09-1.12; self-paid vaccination: ORa = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.07-1.09) and social responsibility (free vaccination: ORa = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.14-1.19; self-paid vaccination: ORa = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.11-1.14) were positively associated with the two variables of COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated the positive effects of prosociality and social responsibility on the intention of COVID-19 vaccination. Accordingly, modification of prosociality and social responsibility can potentially improve COVID-19 vaccination.

The first-line treatment for AIS is mechanical thrombectomy (MT), with or without additional intravenous thrombolysis, while there are different pharmacological, surgical and endovascular treatment options for an acute occlusion of the UL arteries. Here, we describe the practicability, efficacy and safety of neurointerventional devices and techniques for MT of upper extremity arterial occlusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected patient databases from four neurovascular centers was performed. Clinical and imaging data, as well as procedural parameters, were assessed. RESULTS Seven out of 6138 patients (incidence: 0.11%) presenting with an AIS due to the occlusion of craniocervical arteries requiring MT and a concomitant occlusion of the brachial (4/7), axillary (2/7), or ulnar (1/7) artery causing acute ULI were identified. Craniocervical MT was technically successful in all cases. Subsequent MT of the upper limb was performed using neurointerventional thrombectomy techniques, most frequently stent retriever thrombectomy (in 4/7 cases) and direct aspiration (in 7/7 cases). MT achieved successful recanalization in 6/7 cases, and the UL completely recovered in all six cases. In one case, recanalization was not successful, and the patient still had a marginally threatened extremity after the procedure, which improved after pharmacological therapy. CONCLUSION In the rare case of AIS requiring MT and concomitant acute upper extremity arterial occlusion, MT of the UL arteries using neurointerventional devices and techniques is practical, effective, and safe.","output":"Concomitant Acute Ischemic Stroke and Upper Extremity Arterial Occlusion: Feasibility of Mechanical Thrombectomy of the Upper Limb Using Neurointerventional Devices and Techniques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Self-care interventions offer a solution to support the achievement of three goals of the World Health Organization (WHO): to improve universal health coverage, reach people in humanitarian situations, and improve health and well-being. In light of implementing WHO consolidated guidelines on self-care interventions to strengthen sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists from four different EMR countries discussed the current SRH situation, inequality gaps, barriers to SRH service access and the pharmacist's crucial role as a first-line responder to patients before, during and after COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: Self-care interventions for SRH allow health care providers to serve a greater number of patients, improve progress toward universal health coverage, and reach people in humanitarian crises. In fact, these interventions can be significantly enhanced by utilizing community pharmacists as first-line health care providers. This review highlights the important role of community pharmacists in promoting self-care interventions and empowering individuals, families and communities. As a result, well-informed individuals will be authoritative in their health decisions. Exploring self-care interventions in the EMR was done through reviewing selected SRH services delivery through community pharmacists before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Somalia. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, community pharmacists were found to be excluded from both governmental and nongovernmental SRH programmes. During the pandemic, community pharmacists managed to support patients with self-care interventions, whether voluntarily or through their pharmacy associations. This highlights the need for the health care decision-makers to involve and support community pharmacists in influencing policies and promoting self-care interventions. CONCLUSION: Self-care interventions can increase individuals' choice and autonomy over SRH. Supporting community pharmacists will definitely strengthen SRH in the EMR and may help make the health system more efficient and more targeted.","output":"The role of community pharmacists in increasing access and use of self-care interventions for sexual and reproductive health in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: examples from Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Somalia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel type of highly contiguous pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Pregnant ladies are vulnerable to the virus infection due to alteration in anatomic and immune system The chance of infection would apparently rise due to antenatal visits but inadequate medical care facilities during pregnancy can be harmful for both maternal and perinatal outcome The Government of India has divided the districts of various states into Red, Orange and Green zones Most of the hospitals from Red and Orange zones have made it mandatory COVID-19 testing for all antenatal patients near term making it easier to isolate and manage patients accordingly The green zone hospital presently not doing COVID testing for all peripartum patients Thus, proper maternal health care management at tertiary level is required with minimum exposure and risk in suspected cases especially in green zone hos-pitals Here, we present our experience as a team at our Obstetrics and Gynae-cology department of pregnant women with upper respiratory tract infec-tion/suspected case of COVID-19 infection during hospitalization in our rural setup and further we will discuss patient triage based on risk level, antenatal care planning and handling emergencies during COVID-19 lockdown ?

DESIGN: Quantitative surveys were conducted among participants before and after the distribution of produce prescription vouchers. Univariate statistics were used to describe the participant population, and paired t tests were used to examine change in fruit and vegetable intake. Qualitative, in-depth telephone interviews were conducted among participants, health educators, and food retailers and coded for themes. SETTING: Eight health promotion programs, 2 food pantries, and 11 food retailers. PARTICIPANTS: In each health promotion program or food pantry, between 6 and 97 participants were enrolled. INTERVENTION: Produce prescription vouchers were distributed to participants and redeemed at local food retailers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE S: An increase in local fruit and vegetable purchasing and consumption. RESULTS: Of the produce prescription participants who completed the baseline survey (n = 93), 86% were female, 64% were African American, and 68% were food insecure. The voucher redemption rate was 18%. The majority of participants indicated that they visit farmers' markets more now than before the produce prescription initiative, that shopping at the farmers' market made it easy to include more fresh produce in their family's diet, and that they tried a new farmers' market because of the produce prescription initiative. All health educators and food retailers who participated felt that the initiative benefited their program or operation and were willing to partner with the program again. CONCLUSIONS: While redemption rates were lower than anticipated, the produce prescription initiative had positive impacts on participants' local fruit and vegetable purchasing and consumption. Because of COVID-19, the initiative was not implemented until late in the North Carolina produce season. Moving forward, the program will start earlier and work with local food retailers to connect with their communities to increase redemption rates.","output":"A Mixed-Methods Examination of the Impact of the Partnerships to Improve Community Health Produce Prescription Initiative in Northeastern North Carolina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID pandemic of 2020 resulted in unprecedented restrictions of public life in most countries around the world, and many hospital systems experienced dramatic decreases in non-COVID related patient admissions.

Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, infrared thermography (IRT) has been considered a gold standard method for screening febrile individuals at the time of pandemics. The objective of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of IRT for screening infectious diseases with specific applications to COVID-19. Approach: A literature review was performed in Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect to search for studies evaluating IRT screening from 2002 to present using relevant keywords. Additional literature searches were done to evaluate IRT in comparison to traditional core body temperature measurements and assess the benefits of measuring additional vital signs for infectious disease screening. Results: Studies have reported on the unreliability of IRT due to poor sensitivity and specificity in detecting true core body temperature and its inability to identify asymptomatic carriers. Airport mass screening using IRT was conducted during occurrences of SARS, Dengue, Swine Flu, and Ebola with reported sensitivities as low as zero. Other studies reported that screening other vital signs such as heart and respiratory rates can lead to more robust methods for early infection detection. Conclusions: Studies evaluating IRT showed varied results in its efficacy for screening infectious diseases.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 267 adults with SCD from the national INSIGHTS Study. The binary outcome variable asked whether, in the past 12 months, participants had delayed going to an ED when they thought they needed care. Logistic regression was performed with clinical, demographic, and psychosocial measures. RESULTS: Approximately 67% of the participants reported delaying ED care. Individuals who delayed care were more likely to have reported higher stigma experiences (odds ratio [OR]=1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.16), more frequent pain episodes (OR=1.15; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32), lower health care satisfaction (OR= 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.94), and more frequent ED visits (OR=6.07; 95% CI 1.18 to 31.19).

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a scoring system based on the data obtained on admission, to predict the need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This study included COVID-19 patients admitted to Sina Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences from February 20 to May 29, 2020. Patients' data on admission were retrospectively recruited from Sina Hospital COVID-19 Registry (SHCo-19R). Multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to identify the predictive factors for mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 681 patients were included in the study; 74 patients (10.9%) needed mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, while 607 (89.1%) did not. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that age (OR,1.049; 95% CI:1.008-1.091), history of diabetes mellitus (OR,3.216; 95% CI:1.134-9.120), respiratory rate (OR,1.051; 95% CI:1.005-1.100), oxygen saturation (OR,0.928; 95% CI:0.872-0.989), CRP (OR,1.013; 95% CI:1.001-1.024) and bicarbonate level (OR,0.886; 95% CI:0.790-0.995) were risk factors for mechanical ventilation during hospitalization.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the neuropsychiatric effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in MS patients and to analyze the risk factors contributing to psychological stress. METHODS The study was designed as a prospective, cross-sectional survey study. Multiple assessment tools that are used in neurological practice, including Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) were administered prospectively both during the early and the peak stages of COVID-19 outbreak (ESO and PSO, respectively). The survey forms were designed using SurveyMonkey and the participants were participating in the survey via a web link and QR code. RESULTS Fifty patients were included in the study. BDI scores, PSQI and FSI measurements, cognitive and social subscale scores and total FIS score, MSQOL-54 measurements, physical and mental subscale scores, and total MSQOL-54 score at PSO were significantly different than those at ESO. The body mass index values of the patients increased significantly at PSO compared to those measured at ESO.

We used the sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 strains in California to investigate the time-varying patterns of the evolutionary genetic distance. The accumulative genetic distances were quantified across different time periods and in different viral proteins. The increasing trends of genetic distance were observed in spike protein (S protein), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region and nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) of open reading frame 1 (ORF1), and nucleocapsid protein (N protein). The genetic distances in ORF3a, ORF8, and nsp2 of ORF1 started to diverge from their original variants after September 2020. By contrast, mutations in other proteins appeared transiently, and no evident increasing trend was observed in the genetic distance to the original variants.

In this cross-sectional survey study of US adults, surveys were administered via internet and telephone. Adults were surveyed from April 30-May 4, 2020, a time of peaking COVID-19 incidence within the US. Participants were recruited from the probability-based AmeriSpeak? national panel. Brief surveys were completed by 994 adults, with 73.0% of respondents reported mask wearing, 82.7% reported physical distancing, 75.1% reported crowd avoidance, 89.8% reported increased hand-washing, and 7.7% reported having prior COVID-19 testing. Multivariate analysis (p critical value .05) indicates that women were more likely to report protective behaviors than men, as were those over age 60. Respondents who self-identified as having low incomes, histories of criminal justice involvement, and Republican Party affiliation, were less likely to report four protective behaviors, though Republicans and individuals with criminal justice histories were more likely to report having received COVID-19 testing. The majority of Americans engaged in COVID-19 protective behaviors, with low-income Americans, those with histories of criminal justice involvement, and self-identified Republicans less likely to engage in these preventive behaviors.

Methods and results According to individual patient preference or the organizational decision of the centre, patients were assigned to the home-delivery group or the standard in-clinic delivery group. In the former case, patients received telephone training on the activation process and use of the communicator. In June 2020, the centres were asked to reply to an ad hoc questionnaire to describe and evaluate their experience in the previous 3 months.

Design, Setting and Participants: In this cohort study of 903 healthcare workers who completed surveys about baseline characteristics and COVID-19 vaccine/infection history, 647 had antibody assays completed and were included herein. Exposure: COVID-19 vaccination with mRNA-1273 (n=387); BNT162b2 (n=212); or Ad26.COV2.S (n=10); unvaccinated (n=10); or boosted (n=28). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was IgG anti-spike titer. Secondary/tertiary outcomes included IgG spike receptor-binding domain competitive antibody blocking ELISA pseudoneutralization against the USA-WA1/2020 strain, and vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infection. Antibody levels were compared using ANOVA and multiple linear regression. Results: Mean age was 49.7, 75.3% were female, and mean comorbidities/patient was 0.7. Baseline variables were balanced (p>.05) except for immunosuppression (higher in boosted, p=.047), prior COVID-19 infections (higher with Ad26.COV2.S and unvaccinated, p<.001), and time since primary vaccination (higher with mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 than Ad26.COV2.S, p<.001).

Both viruses depend on a viral RNA polymerase to express their proteins, but only SARS-CoV-2 has a proofreading mechanism, which results in a low mutation rate compared to influenza. E1KC4 and camostat mesylate are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, achieving an effect similar to oseltamivir.

BACKGROUND Migraine is a common, incapacitating neurological condition. Although chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine are known to be safe, efficacious treatments for migraine, they have never been directly compared. DESIGN We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial at a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Adults aged 18-65 years, who presented with migraine, were eligible for recruitment. Sixty-six patients were randomized to either chlorpromazine 12.5 mg or prochlorperazine 12.5 mg, both infused in 500 ml of sodium chloride 0.9% over 30 min. Headache severity score, nausea severity score, and the presence of photophobia and phonophobia were assessed at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min. Adverse effects and the need for rescue therapy were recorded. The primary outcome was a reduction in headache severity score from baseline at 60 min post-commencement of the study medicine infusion. RESULTS Sixty-five patients were included in the analysis. There was a median reduction in headache severity score at 60 min of 3.0 (interquartile range 1.0-4.0) in the chlorpromazine arm versus 2.0 (1.0-4.0) in the prochlorperazine arm (median difference -0.5 (95% confidence interval, -1.9 to 0.9)). We saw no evidence of a difference in secondary outcomes at 30, 60, or 120 min. Side effects were reported in 16/32 (50%) patients in the chlorpromazine group versus 7/33 (21%) in the prochlorperazine group (p = 0.020). Rescue therapy was required in 12/33 (36%) patients in the chlorpromazine group versus 7/32 (22%) in the prochlorperazine group (p = 0.277).

However, whether prenatal exposure to leptin mediates the association between maternal metabolic conditions and autistic symptoms in children has not been investigated yet. METHODS: This study investigated the associations between mothers' metabolic conditions (pre-pregnancy overweight, diabetes mellitus during or before pregnancy, and HDP), leptin concentrations in umbilical cord serum, and autistic symptoms among 762 children from an ongoing cohort study, using generalized structural equation modeling. We used the Social Responsive Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2) at 8C9 years old to calculate total T-scores. Additionally, we used the T-scores for two subdomains: Social Communication and Interaction (SCI) and Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior (RRB). RESULTS: Umbilical cord leptin levels were associated with pre-pregnancy overweight [coefficient = 1.297, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.081C1.556, p = 0.005] and diabetes mellitus (coefficient = 1.574, 95% CI 1.206C2.055, p = 0.001). Furthermore, leptin levels were significantly associated with SRS-2 total T-scores (coefficient = 1.002, 95% CI 1.000C1.004, p = 0.023), SCI scores (coefficient = 1.002, 95% CI 1.000C1.004, p = 0.020), and RRB scores (coefficient = 1.001, 95% CI 1.000C1.003, p = 0.044) in children. Associations between maternal metabolic factors and autistic symptoms were not significant. DISCUSSION: The present study uncovered an association between cord leptin levels and autistic symptoms in children, while maternal metabolic conditions did not have an evident direct influence on the outcome. These results imply that prenatal pro-inflammatory environments affected by maternal metabolic conditions may contribute to the development of autistic symptoms in children. The findings warrant further investigation into the role of leptin in the development of autistic symptoms.","output":"Associations Among Maternal Metabolic Conditions, Cord Serum Leptin Levels, and Autistic Symptoms in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is the current public health threat all over the world. Unfortunately, there is no specific prevention and treatment strategy for this disease. We aim to explore the potential role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in this regard through this literature review. As a crucial enzyme of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ACE2 not only mediates the virus entry but also affects the pathophysiological process of virus-induced acute lung injury (ALI), as well as other organs damage. As interaction of COVID-19 virus spike and ACE2 is essential for virus infection, COVID-19-specific vaccine based on spike protein, small molecule compound interrupting their interaction, human monoclonal antibody based on receptor-binding domain, and recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhuACE2) have aroused the interests of researchers. Meanwhile, ACE2 could catalyze angiotensin II (Ang II) to form angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), thus alleviates the harmful effect of Ang II and amplifies the protection effect of Ang1-7. ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) have been shown to increase the level of expression of ACE2 and could be potential strategies in protecting lungs, heart, and kidneys. ACE2 plays a very important role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. Strategies targeting ACE2 and its ligand, COVID-19 virus spike protein, may provide novel method in the prevention and management of novel coronavirus pneumonia.","output":"Potential Role of ACE2 in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Prevention and Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delhi, a tropical Indian megacity, experiences one of the most severe air pollution in the world, linked with diverse anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions. First phase of COVID-19 lockdown in India, implemented during 25 March to 14 April 2020 resulted in a dramatic near-zeroing of various activities (e.g. traffic, industries, constructions), except the essential services. Here, we analysed variations in the fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) over the Delhi-National Capital Region. Measurements revealed large reductions (by 40C70%) in PM(2.5) during the first week of lockdown (25C31 March 2020) as compared to the pre-lockdown conditions. However, O(3) pollution remained high during the lockdown due to non-linear chemistry and dynamics under low aerosol loading. Notably, events of enhanced PM(2.5) levels (300C400 g m(?3)) were observed during night and early morning hours in the first week of April after air temperatures fell close to the dew-point (~ 15C17 C). A haze formation mechanism is suggested through uplifting of fine particles, which is reinforced by condensation of moisture following the sunrise.

However, there have been reports of ischemic strokes as the presenting symptom in young noncritically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients without significant risk factors. Further characterization of the coronavirus disease 2019 stroke population is needed. We present four cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ischemic strokes occurring in patients aged 37-68 yrs with varying coronavirus disease 2019 infection severities, premorbid risk factors, clinical presentations (eg, focal and nonfocal), and vascular distributions.

The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices security has become a serious concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks.

Here, we provide a detailed follow-up clinical investigation in a very young female patient (17-year-old) with a long-lasting anosmia after a mild infection, with partial recovery 15 months after the onset. METHODS: Neuroimaging and neurophysiologic assessments as well as olfactory mucosa swabbing for microbiological and immunocytochemical analyses were performed. Olfactory and gustatory evaluations were conducted through validated tests. RESULTS: Chemosensory evaluations were consistent with anosmia associated with parosmia phenomena and gustatory impairment, the latter less persistent. Brain MRI (3.0 T) showed no microvascular injury in olfactory bulbs and brain albeit we cannot rule out slight structural abnormalities during the acute phase, and a high-density EEG was negative. Immunocytochemistry of olfactory mucosa swabs showed high expression of ACE2 in sustentacular cells and lower dot-like cytoplasmic positivity in neuronal-shaped cells. DISCUSSION: The occurrence of long-term persistent olfactory deficit in spite of the absence of structural brain and olfactory bulb involvement supports the view of a possible persistent dysfunction of both sustentacular cells and olfactory neurons. The gustatory dysfunction even if less persisting for the described features could be related to a primary gustatory system involvement. Future longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the persistence of chemosensory impairment, which could have a relevant impact on the daily life.

Methods: The participants, recruited between April and December 2020, were randomized to receive a new treatment module either every third or every fifth day. The clinical outcomes were self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms and change in positive and negative emotions. Results: A total of 1256 individuals accessed the pre-screening survey, 407 were eligible and 92 provided contact information, where 82 were included in the study, n = 44 in the 3-day group and n = 38 in the 5-day group.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the concordance of MammaPrint results (70-gene signature) and BluePrint results (80-gene signature) between core needle biopsies (CNB) and surgical resection (SR) specimens using prospectively collected matched tissues from patients enrolled in the FLEX trial (NCT03053193). Methods: We analyzed 113 matched CNB and SR tumor specimens from women with early-stage breast cancer enrolled in the FLEX trial. Each patient enrolled in the trial receives a MammaPrint recurrence risk classification test with or without BluePrint molecular subtyping. Concordance of MammaPrint is reported using overall percentage agreement, positive predictive value (PPV, High Risk), negative predictive value (NPV, Low Risk), and Cohens kappa coefficient. Additionally, correlations between sample types are reported using Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: We found good concordance for MammaPrint results between CNB and SR tumor samples (90.3%, k = 0.803), with a 95.1% NPV and 84.6% PPV. There was also a strong correlation of MammaPrint indices between CNB and SR specimens (r = 0.94). In addition to our primary objective, we determined the concordance of BluePrint subtyping in the matched tumor samples, and found excellent concordance (98.2%) and strong correlation of BluePrint scores within each subtype. Conclusion: CNB samples demonstrated overall high concordance with paired SR samples for MammaPrint risk classification, ensuring that physicians are provided with accurate prognostic information for therapy decisions based on testing of core biopsy tissue. Further, BluePrint molecular subtyping also had good concordance between the sample types, outperforming concordance rates based on traditional IHC based classification. Overall, with an increase in neoadjuvant therapy, physicans and patients can be assured that MammaPrint and BluePrint provide reliable results that guide timely and appropriate therapies using preoperative CNB specimens.","output":"High concordance of 70-gene recurrence risk signature and 80-gene molecular subtyping signature between core needle biopsy and surgical resection specimen in early-stage breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the sequential implementation of the enhanced recovery program (ERP) and surgical site infection bundle (SSIB) on short-term outcomes in colorectal surgery (CRS) to determine if the presence of multiple standardized care programs provides additive benefit. STUDY DESIGN Institutional ACS-NSQIP data were used to identify patients who underwent elective CRS from September 2006 to March 2013. The cohort was stratified into 3 groups relative to implementation of the ERP (February 1, 2010) and SSIB (July 1, 2011). Unadjusted characteristics and 30-day outcomes were assessed, and inverse proportional weighting was then used to determine the adjusted effect of these programs. RESULTS There were 787 patients included: 337, 165, and 285 in the pre-ERP/SSIB, post-ERP/pre-SSIB, and post-ERP/SSIB periods, respectively. After inverse probability weighting (IPW) adjustment, groups were balanced with respect to patient and procedural characteristics considered. Compared with the pre-ERP/SSIB group, the post-ERP/pre-SSIB group had significantly reduced length of hospitalization (8.3 vs 6.6 days, p = 0.01) but did not differ with respect to postoperative wound complications and sepsis. Subsequent introduction of the SSIB then resulted in a significant decrease in superficial SSI (16.1% vs 6.3%, p < 0.01) and postoperative sepsis (11.2% vs 1.8%, p < 0.01). Finally, inflation-adjusted mean hospital cost for a CRS admission fell from $31,926 in 2008 to $22,044 in 2013 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Sequential implementation of the ERP and SSIB provided incremental improvements in CRS outcomes while controlling hospital costs, supporting their combined use as an effective strategy toward improving the quality of patient care.","output":"Improving Outcomes in Colorectal Surgery by Sequential Implementation of Multiple Standardized Care Programs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmacogenomics, nutrigenomics, vaccinomics, and the nascent field of plant omics are examples of variability science. They are embedded within an overarching framework of personalized medicine. Across these public health specialties, the significance and biology of the placebo response have been historically neglected. A placebo is any substance such as a sugar pill administered in the guise of medication, but one that does not have pharmacological activity. Placebos do have clinical effects, however, that can be substantive in magnitude and vary markedly from person-to-person depending, for example, on the type of disease, symptoms, or clinical trial design. Research over the past several decades attests to a genuine neurobiological basis for placebo effects. All drugs have placebo components that contribute to their overall treatment effect. Placebos are used in clinical trials as control groups to ascertain the net pharmacological effect of a drug candidate. Not only less well known but also relevant to rational therapeutics and personalized medicine is the nocebo. A nocebo effect occurs when an inert substance is administered in a context that induces negative expectations, worsening patients' symptoms. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there are high public expectations for new vaccines and medicines to end the contagion, while at the same time antiscience, post-truth, and antivaccine movements are worrisomely on the rise. These social movements, changes in public health cultures, and conditioned behavioral responses can trigger both placebo and nocebo effects. Hence, in clinical trials, forecasting and explaining placebo and nocebo variability are more important than ever for robust science and personalized health care. Against this overarching context, this article provides (1) a brief history of placebo and (2) a discussion on biology, mechanisms, and variability of placebo effects, and (3) discusses three emerging new concepts: placebogenomics, nocebogenomics, and augmented placebo, that is, the notion of a \\"placebo dose.\\" We conclude with a roadmap for placebogenomics, its synergies with the nascent field of social pharmacology, and the ways in which a new taxonomy of drug and placebo variability can be anticipated in the next decade.","output":"Rethinking Clinical Trials and Personalized Medicine with Placebogenomics and Placebo Dose."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The paper aims to present the development of conceptualization of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on associations with other articles on English edition of Wikipedia.

Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach taken in this study was based on the application of Moscovici's theory of social representations to Wikipedia's knowledge organization system (KOS). Internal links in the Wikipedia article about COVID-19 were considered anchors in its social representations. Each link in the introductory part of the article was considered an indicator of the semantic relationship between COVID-19 and other concepts from Wikipedia's knowledge base. The subject of this study was links extracted from all revisions of the COVID-19 article between February and September 2020. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed on these conceptual structures using both synchronic and diachronic approaches. Findings It was found that the evolution of anchors in the Wikipedia article on COVID-19 was in line with the mechanism of symbolic coping related to infectious disease. It went through stages of divergence, convergence and normalization. It shows that this mechanism governs the social organization of knowledge related to COVID-19 on Wikipedia.

Few studies have shown cerebrovascular pathologies that indicate CNS involvement in acute patients. However, replication studies are necessary to verify if these effects persist in COVID-19 survivors more conclusively. Furthermore, recent studies indicate fatigue is highly prevalent among long-COVID patients. How morphometry in each group relate to work-related fatigue need to be investigated. METHOD: COVID survivors were MRI scanned two weeks after hospital discharge. We hypothesized, these survivors will demonstrate altered gray matter volume (GMV) and experience higher fatigue levels when compared to healthy controls, leading to stronger correlation of GMV with fatigue. Voxel-based morphometry was performed on T1-weighted MRI images between 46 survivors and 30 controls. Unpaired two-sample t-test and multiple linear regression were performed to observe group differences and correlation of fatigue with GMV. RESULTS: The COVID group experienced significantly higher fatigue levels and GMV of this group was significantly higher within the Limbic System and Basal Ganglia when compared to healthy controls. Moreover, while a significant positive correlation was observed across the whole group between GMV and self-reported fatigue, COVID subjects showed stronger effects within the Posterior Cingulate, Precuneus and Superior Parietal Lobule. CONCLUSION: Brain regions with GMV alterations in our analysis align with both single case acute patient reports and current group level neuroimaging findings. We also newly report a stronger positive correlation of GMV with fatigue among COVID survivors within brain regions associated with fatigue, indicating a link between structural abnormality and brain function in this cohort.","output":"Higher limbic and basal ganglia volumes in surviving COVID-negative patients and the relations to fatigue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"West Nile virus (WNV) can cause neuro-invasive and febrile illness that may be fatal to humans. The production of inflammatory cytokines is key to mediating WNV-induced immunopathology in the central nervous system. Elucidating the host factors utilized by WNV for productive infection would provide valuable insights into the evasion strategies used by this virus. Although attempts have been made to determine these host factors, proteomic data depicting WNV-host protein interactions are limited. We applied liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for label-free, quantitative phosphoproteomics to systematically investigate the global phosphorylation events induced by WNV infection. Quantifiable changes to 1,657 phosphoproteins were found; of these, 626 were significantly upregulated and 227 were downregulated at 12 h postinfection. The phosphoproteomic data were subjected to gene ontology enrichment analysis, which returned the inflammation-related spliceosome, ErbB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor kappa B, and mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathways. We used short interfering RNAs to decrease the levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, bifunctional polynucleotide phosphatase/kinase, and retinoblastoma 1 and found that the activity of nuclear factor kappa B (p65) is significantly decreased in WNV-infected U251 cells, which in turn led to markedly reduced inflammatory cytokine production.

No standard immunosuppressive treatment approach is able to control disease progression in patients with SAVI. We studied the efficacy and safety of targeting type I IFN signaling with the Janus kinase inhibitor, ruxolitinib. METHODS: We used DNA sequencing to identify mutations in TMEM173 in patients with peripheral blood type I IFN signature. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was administered on an off-label basis. RESULTS: We identified three patients with SAVI presenting with skin involvement and progressive severe interstitial lung disease. Indirect echocardiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension were present in one case. Following treatment with ruxolitinib, we observed improvements of respiratory function including increased forced vital capacity in two patients, with discontinuation of oxygen therapy and resolution of echocardiographic abnormalities in one case. Efficacy was persistent in one patient and only transitory in the other two patients. Clinical control of skin complications was obtained, and one patient discontinued steroid treatment. One patient, who presented with kidney involvement, showed resolution of hematuria. One patient experienced increased recurrence of severe viral respiratory infections. Monitoring of peripheral blood type I interferon signature during ruxolitinib treatment did not show a stable decrease. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that targeting type I IFN receptor signaling may represent a promising therapeutic option for a subset of patients with SAVI syndrome and severe lung involvement. However, the occurrence of viral respiratory infection might represent an important cautionary note for the application of such form of treatment.

The development of an effective COVID-19 vaccine could limit the morbidity and mortality caused by infection and may enable the relaxation of social-distancing measures. Age is one of the most significant risk factors for poor health outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore, it is desirable that any new vaccine candidates elicit a robust immune response in older adults. Methods: Here, we use in-depth immunophenotyping to characterize the innate and adaptive immune response induced upon intramuscular administration of the adenoviral vectored ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD-1222) COVID-19 vaccine candidate in mice. Findings: A single vaccination generates spike-specific Th1 cells, Th1-like Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, polyfunctional spike-specific CD8+ T cells. and granzyme-B-producing CD8 effectors. Spike-specific IgG and IgM are generated from both the early extrafollicular antibody response and the T follicular helper cell-supported germinal center reaction, which is associated with the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies. A single dose of this vaccine generated a similar type of immune response in aged mice but of a reduced magnitude than in younger mice. We report that a second dose enhances the immune response to this vaccine in aged mice. Conclusions: This study shows that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induces both cellular and humoral immunity in adult and aged mice and suggests a prime-boost strategy is a rational approach to enhance immunogenicity in older persons.

It begins in the external auditory canal and progresses through the skull base, causing osteomyelitis and eventually cranial neuropathy, especially of the facial nerve. Design/Methods: NA Results: A 65-year old diabetic man, presented with an 8-month progressing left otitis externa and evolved with ipsilateral proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, blindness, facial palsy, hearing loss and contralateral evolvement of the temporal bone with hearing impairment. The cranial and brain images showed erosion of the anterior wall of the left external ear conduct, osteomyelitis through the skull base and tissue occupying the left superior orbital fissure intraconal fat, with invasion of the left orbit. Cavernous sinus thrombosis was excluded and the diagnosis of a rare presentation of multiple cranial nerve palsies associated with MEO was made. He was initially treated with oral ciprofloxacin, which was switched to meropenem and vancomycin and underwent left canal wall-up mastoidectomy with good recovery of right ear hearing capacity, but no improvements of neurological deficits nor left hearing function. Microbiological tests were negative as a possible consequence of the early use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the patient was infected by Sars-CoV-2 during hospitalization and passed away after ten days of COVID-19 intensive care unit internment. Conclusions: MEO is a rare and life-threatening condition. Facial palsy is a well stablished neurological complication, but multiple cranial nerves evolvement due to orbital fissure invasion is a rare phenotype.

Moreover, the demand for mHealth, which is in need of change due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is increasing worldwide. Accordingly, interest in health care in everyday life and the importance of mHealth are growing. OBJECTIVE: We developed the MibyeongBogam (MBBG) app that evaluates the users subhealth status via a smartphone and provides a health management method based on that users subhealth status for use in everyday life. Subhealth is defined as a state in which the capacity to recover to a healthy state is diminished, but without the presence of clinical disease. The objective of this study was to compare the awareness and status of subhealth after the use of the MBBG app between intervention and control groups, and to evaluate the apps practicality. METHODS: This study was a prospective, open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted at two hospitals in Korea with 150 healthy people in their 30s and 40s, at a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants visited the hospital three times as follows: preintervention, intermediate visit 6 weeks after the intervention, and final visit 12 weeks after the intervention. Key endpoints were measured at the first visit before the intervention and at 12 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcome was the awareness of subhealth, and the secondary outcomes were subhealth status, health-promoting behaviors, and motivation to engage in healthy behaviors. RESULTS: The primary outcome, subhealth awareness, tended to slightly increase for both groups after the uncompensated intervention, but there was no significant difference in the score between the two groups (intervention group: mean 23.69, SD 0.25 vs control group: mean 23.1, SD 0.25; P=.09). In the case of secondary outcomes, only some variables of the subhealth status showed significant differences between the two groups after the intervention, and the intervention group showed an improvement in the total scores of subhealth (P=.03), sleep disturbance (P=.02), depression (P=.003), anger (P=.01), and anxiety symptoms (P=.009) compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the MBBG app showed potential for improving the health, especially with regard to sleep disturbance and depression, of individuals without particular health problems. However, the effects of the app on subhealth awareness and health-promoting behaviors were not clearly evaluated. Therefore, further studies to assess improvements in health after the use of personalized health management programs provided by the MBBG app are needed.

Fortunately, in more recent years, scientists have developed vaccines. Vaccines are generally very safe, but cause side effects in a small percentage of cases. The United States Congress has passed two major pieces of legislation that provide sweeping tort immunity to vaccine manufacturers and others. In 1986 Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) and in 2005 it passed the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP ACT). Both Acts were passed to encourage manufacturers to develop vaccines, particularly in times of public emergencies, in exchange for expansive liability protection. Both Acts established no-fault type compensation schemes to compensate those suffering injury or death from vaccines without having to resort to typical litigation. The author discusses both Acts in detail, in the context of the current Covid-19 crisis.","output":"Vaccines Immunize People;legislation Immunizes Vaccine Manufacturers.

Healthcare workers, on the front lines of the epidemic, are facing major and potentially traumatic stressful events, overwhelming their ability to cope and their resources. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article will be to show how the use of the URG-EMDR protocol in a telemental health setting has proven to be feasible and effective in the treatment of a group of healthcare professionals working in nursing homes or hospital services that were highly mobilized during the acute phase of COVID-19. METHOD: 17 participants, registered nurses (N = 7) and licensed practical nurses (N = 10), were remotely treated using the URG-EMDR protocol in a single session. The assessment focused on anxiety and depressive symptoms (HAD scale) and the level of perceived disturbance (SUD). An additional evaluation of the satisfaction with the remote psychotherapy intervention was conducted. RESULTS: As the URG-EMDR protocol has already proven itself during emergency interventions, it is interesting to note that its remote use in the treatment of healthcare providers caring for COVID-19 patients allows for an improvement in the emotional state and a decrease in perceived disturbance, in a single session. This result is maintained 1 week after the intervention, despite the continued professional activities of the participants and the continuity of the event. Moreover, the remote therapy setting was judged satisfactory by the patients, even if it required adjustments and certain recommendations for practice. DISCUSSION: The remote use of the URG-EMDR protocol opens up innovative perspectives for early interventions and the prevention of the development of psychological disorders in the long term following a situation of acute stress.","output":"EMDR in Telemental Health Counseling for Healthcare Workers Caring for COVID-19 Patients: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The risk of toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN) depends on both drug and host factors, such as autoimmune disease. We present a case of TEN in a patient with recently diagnosed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Case Description: A 23-year-old previously healthy woman was admitted multiple times over 4 weeks for spiking fevers, cervical lymphadenopathy, and macular rash. Her symptoms began one week after her second SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and did not respond to outpatient treatment with azithromycin and steroids for presumed upper respiratory infection. Extensive infectious evaluation was unrevealing. She had elevated liver enzymes, cytopenias, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Lymph node and bone marrow biopsies were unrevealing. Further evaluation demonstrated elevated triglycerides, ferritin, and soluble IL-2 receptor. Natural killer cell function was normal. IL-18 was markedly elevated (181,803 pg/mL) supporting the diagnosis of adult-onset Stills disease with MAS. Dexamethasone and anakinra were initiated on day 29 of illness with prophylactic atovaquone and pantoprazole. Her symptoms and labs improved until day 57 of illness when she developed a diffuse, painful, blistering maculopapular rash consistent with TEN. Potential culprit drugs were held (pantoprazole, atovaquone, and cephalosporins) and she received a short course of IVIG and cyclosporine in addition to anakinra and steroids. She required prolonged hospitalization for wound care and rehabilitation. She has recovered well and remains on prednisone and canakinumab. Discussion: The widespread innate immune activation from MAS, possibly triggered by preceding vaccination, may have augmented her risk of developing TEN. Treatment was therefore directed towards ongoing MAS in addition to TEN.

Previous studies have shown that PEDV ORF3 encodes an ion channel protein. However, its influence on cell cycle and subcellular structure still require more research. In this study, we developed a Vero cell line that stably expresses PEDV ORF3 gene. Subcellular localization and influences of PEDV ORF3 on host cells were investigated. We further verified whether or not this gene enhances virus production. The results showed that PEDV ORF3 protein localizes in the cytoplasm and affects cell cycle progression by prolonging the S phase. In addition, the ORF3-expressing Vero cells had more vesicles than the host Vero cells. Furthermore, the attenuated PEDV rather than virulent PEDV could grow better in ORF3-expressing Vero cells. The expression level of the PEDV nucleocapsid protein also increased. These results provided information on the function of PEDV ORF3 and were helpful in understanding the mechanisms of PEDV replication.

RESULTS The public perceived different levels of risk regarding the likelihood and their concern about contracting the 2009 H1N1 flu. These measures of risk perception were primarily correlated with people of Hispanic ethnicity, having children in the household, and recent seasonal flu experience in the previous year. The perceived likelihood was not strongly associated with preventive behaviors, whereas the perceived concern was significantly associated with precautionary and preparatory behaviors. The association between perceived concern and precautionary behavior persisted after controlling for demographic characteristics.

It is a life-threatening condition exclusive to children with no effective treatment. METHODS: In this study, we used system-level and vaccinomics approaches to design a polyvalent vaccine for RSV, which could stimulate the immune components of the host to manage this infection. Our framework involves data accession, antigenicity and subcellular localization analysis, T cell epitope prediction, proteasomal and conservancy evaluation, host-pathogen-protein interactions, pathway studies, and in silico binding affinity analysis. RESULTS: We found glycoprotein (G), fusion protein (F), and small hydrophobic protein (SH) of RSV as potential vaccine candidates. Of these proteins (G, F, and SH), we found 9 epitopes for multiple alleles of MHC classes I and II bear significant binding affinity. These potential epitopes were linked to form a polyvalent construct using AAY, GPGPG linkers, and cholera toxin B adjuvant at N-terminal with a 23.9 kDa molecular weight of 224 amino acid residues. The final construct was a stable, immunogenic, and nonallergenic protein containing cleavage sites, TAP transport efficiency, posttranslation shifts, and CTL epitopes. The molecular docking indicated the optimum binding affinity of RSV polyvalent construct with MHC molecules (-12.49 and -10.48 kcal/mol for MHC classes I and II, respectively). This interaction showed that a polyvalent construct could manage and control this disease. CONCLUSION: Our vaccinomics and system-level investigation could be appropriate to trigger the host immune system to prevent RSV infection.","output":"Designing of Potential Polyvalent Vaccine Model for Respiratory Syncytial Virus by System Level Immunoinformatics Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The benefits of a neurosurgical skill laboratory (NSL) are unquestionable.

Outcomes included 6 measures: partner physical and mental health status (Short-Form-36 PCS and MCS), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), caregiver burden (Oberst Caregiver Burden Scale), and self-efficacy in ICD management (Sudden Cardiac Arrest Self-efficacy scale). Growth mixture and mixed effect modeling were used to identify and compare trajectories of 6 health outcomes within the P-only and P + P arms of the study. Partners (n = 301) were on average 62 years old, female (74.1%) and Caucasian (83.4%), with few co-morbidities (mean Charlson Co-morbidity index, 0.72  1.1). Two types of profiles were observed for P-only and P + P, one profile where patterns of health outcomes were generally better across 12 months and one with outcome patterns that were generally worse across time. For PCS, no significant partner differences were observed between P-only or P + P in either the better (p = 0.067) or the worse (p = 0.129) profile types. Compared to P-only, partners in the worse profile improved significantly over 12 months in MCS (p = 0.006), caregiver burden P + P (p = 0.004) and self-efficacy P + P (p = 0.041).

A higher mortality rate has been described in older infected individuals. Patients with hip fracture are a particularly vulnerable population during this pandemic because older age is associated with a higher mortality rate. Our aim was to describe the early mortality rate and demographic variables in a hip fracture sample population in Spain during the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS: This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. We collected data from 13 major hospitals in Spain from the beginning of the national state of alarm (declared on March 14, 2020, by the Spanish government) until the end of our study period on April 4, 2020. All patients who were 65 years of age, presented to the Emergency Department of the participating hospitals during this period with a diagnosis of proximal femoral fracture, and had a minimum follow-up of 10 days were included in the cohort. In addition to mortality, demographic and other potential prognostic variables were also collected. RESULTS: In this study, 136 patients with a hip fracture were included. Of these patients, 124 underwent a surgical procedure and 12 were managed nonoperatively. The total mortality rate was 9.6%. Sixty-two patients were tested for COVID-19, with 23 patients being positive. The mortality rate for these 23 patients was 30.4% (7 of 23 patients) at a mean follow-up of 14 days.

The research team used the snowball sampling technique to recruit participants following the completion of each participants semi-structured interview. A member check was completed to ensure rigour. Results: 16 social media educators and experts from several countries participated in the study. Study findings showed that within the Structural Frame, participants organizations were reported to have with diverse hierarchical structures, ranging hospital-based (strict), education institutional-based and online only groups (malleable). The Human Resources Frame revealed that most participants social media organizations operated on unpaid volunteer staff. The training of these staff was primarily via role-modeling and mentorship. Regarding the Political Frame, social media helped participants accumulate scholarly currency and influence within their field of practice. The Symbolic Frame showed a wide range of traditional to non-traditional organizational supports, which interacted with both intrinsic to extrinsic motivation. Conclusions: Bolman and Deals Four-Frame Model framework may serve as an effective guideline for academic leaders who wish to strategically implement or enhance social media use into their organizations.

Most febrile episodes are due to self-limited infections, but a small proportion of children will develop life-threatening infections. The early recognition of children who have or are progressing to a critical illness among all febrile cases is challenging, and there are currently no objective and quantitative tools to do so. This results in increased morbidity and mortality among children with impending life-threatening infections, whilst contributing to the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics, overwhelming health care facilities, and harm to patients receiving avoidable antimicrobial treatment. Specific fever origin is difficult to ascertain and co-infections in LMICs are common. However, many severe infections share common pathways of host injury irrespective of etiology, including immune and endothelial activation that contribute to the pathobiology of sepsis (i.e., pathogen agnostic mechanisms of disease). Importantly, mediators of these pathways are independent markers of disease severity and outcome. We propose that measuring circulating levels of these factors can provide quantitative and objective evidence to: enable early recognition of severe infection; guide patient triage and management; enhance post-discharge risk stratification and follow up; and mitigate potential gender bias in clinical decisions. Here, we review the clinical and biological evidence supporting the clinical utility of host immune and endothelial activation biomarkers as components of novel rapid triage tests, and discuss the challenges and needs for developing and implementing such tools.","output":"Host-Based Prognostic Biomarkers to Improve Risk Stratification and Outcome of Febrile Children in Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and importance In 2014, the hospital pharmacy started a project to implement a central intravenous additive service (CIVAS) unit A pre-feasibility study was performed, a new class C clean room equipped with the robotic system APOTECA unit was built and the fully automated aseptic production process was validated In 2016, the CIVAS started producing standard doses of chemotherapy supportive treatments (palonosetron, ondansetron, dexamethasone) in readyto- administer form for the oncology and haematology units The production was then shifted to antibiotics (cefazolin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone) and pantoprazole for infectious disease, cardiac surgery and emergency medicine departments Currently, the in-advance production of batch preparations at CIVAS is mainly based on daily consumption and performed by one pharmacy technician and one pharmacist (0 25 full time equivalent each) The working day is from 8am to 4pm (Monday-Friday) Aim and objectives The aim of this study was to analyse the performance of the CIVAS over the past year and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the increasing demands for sterile antibiotics by emergency departments Material and methods Overall CIVAS production, dosage accuracy and average production time (APT) of each ready-toadminister preparation were evaluated over a period of 12 months (from September 2019 to August 2020) Data were collected from the APOTECA statistical tool Results 12 215 preparations were compounded, of which 26% were in syringe (1 g cefazolin, APT 125 s) and 74% in 100 mL NaCl 0 9% infusion bags (55% for 4 5 g piperacillin-tazobactam, ATP 203 s;14% for 40 mg pantoprazole, ATP 196 s;5% for 2 g ceftriaxone, ATP 177 s) Average dosage accuracy for all preparations was 98 91% During the peak of Italy's COVID-19 outbreak (March 2020), weekly production increased by 28% The production of pantoprazole remained steady, while piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone for the emergency departments increased considerably (+19% and 9%, respectively) and cefazolin for the cardiac surgery department decreased by 26% Conclusion and relevance Implementation of a fully automated CIVAS allows measuring and controlling every step of the production process for ready-to-administer preparations The study showed that CIVAS met increasing demands for sterile antibiotics during the pandemic crisis, thereby supporting the emergency units and providing the highest level of quality and safety","output":"Fully automated central intravenous additive service (CIVAS): A 12 month analysis of performances and impact of COVID-19 on sterile antibiotic production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the focus in the area of health research may be shifting from infectious to non-communicable diseases, the infectious diseases of poverty remain a major burden of disease of global health concern.

A total of 1 081 contributing authors divided between 323 affiliations across 68 countries, territories and regions produced these 256 publications. The journal is indexed in major international biomedical databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Embase. In 2015, it was assigned its first impact factor (4.11), which is now 2.13. During the past five years, IDP has received manuscripts from 90 countries, territories and regions across six continents with an annual acceptance rate of all contributions maintained at less than 40%.

We have produced a total of $302$ pairs of two U.S. counties with good covariate balance on a total of $16$ important variables. Our primary outcome will be the average observed illness collected by Kinsa Inc. two weeks after the intervention period. Although the observed illness does not directly measure COVID-19, it reflects a real-time aspect of the pandemic, and unlike confirmed cases, it is much less confounded by counties' testing capabilities. We also consider observed illness three weeks after the intervention period as a secondary outcome.

AIM: To explore whether COVID-19 pandemic fears are associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and vice versa in adolescents with preexisting mental and behavioural disorders. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study among adolescents with pre-existing mental disorders. The extent of worrying related to the COVID-19 pandemic was measured using the COVID-19 inventory whereas obsessive-compulsive symptoms were assessed using the obsessive-compulsive inventory-revised (OCI-R). Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to explore the relationship between COVID-19 pandemic fears and the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients out of 63 participants (90.4%) had a COVID-19 inventory score of 12 or higher suggesting that a vast majority of young people with mental disorders had significant pandemic-related worries. Out of these 57 patients, over half (31) had an OCI-R modified score of 17 or higher indicating significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms. A positive correlation was found between the means of the two scores. This relationship was statistically significant - {r = 0.405, Sig. (two-tailed) = 0.001}.

Evaluating trends in the epidemiology of these events and possible mechanisms related to vaccination will enhance vaccine safety surveillance and inform best practices for future vaccine campaigns. AREAS COVERED: Epidemiology of the burden of vaccine-associated myocarditis are reviewed. Key summaries of available data from public health advisory bodies and vaccine safety surveillance databases are critically reviewed. The possible biological pathways for vaccine-associated heart inflammations are introduced. A critical synthesis of available information to inform vaccine recommendations and best practices is provided. The citations were selected by the authors based on PubMed searches of the literature, national vaccine safety surveillance databases and summaries from national public health bodies. EXPERT OPINION: Myocarditis may be associated with vaccination, through several biological mechanisms. Studies have shown that live viral vaccinations can act as a trigger for hypersensitivity inflammatory reactions, but further work is required to examine how the mRNA formulation may induce these autoimmune responses. Given that the risk of these adverse events is low, and the benefit of protection against disease is so great, the receipt of mRNA vaccines is recommended.","output":"Evaluating the relationship between myocarditis and mRNA vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Describe our experience of successfully using nasal high-frequency jet ventilation (NHFJV) in extremely low birth weight infants with respiratory failure.

However, detailed investigations that draw direct links between aerosol transport and virus infection are still lacking. To fill in the gap, we conducted a systematic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based investigation of indoor airflow and the associated aerosol transport in a restaurant setting, where likely cases of airflow-induced infection of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic individuals were widely reported by the media. We employed an advanced in-house large eddy simulation solver and other cutting-edge numerical methods to resolve complex indoor processes simultaneously, including turbulence, flowCaerosol interplay, thermal effect, and the filtration effect by air conditioners. Using the aerosol exposure index derived from the simulation, we are able to provide a spatial map of the airborne infection risk under different settings. Our results have shown a remarkable direct linkage between regions of high aerosol exposure index and the reported infection patterns in the restaurant, providing strong support to the airborne transmission occurring in this widely reported incident. Using flow structure analysis and reverse-time tracing of aerosol trajectories, we are able to further pinpoint the influence of environmental parameters on the infection risks and highlight the need for more effective preventive measures, e.g., placement of shielding according to the local flow patterns. Our research, thus, has demonstrated the capability and value of high-fidelity CFD tools for airborne infection risk assessment and the development of effective preventive measures.","output":"Simulation-based study of COVID-19 outbreak associated with air-conditioning in a restaurant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Studies investigating the association between the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and sports injury risk have reported mixed results across a range of athlete populations. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this systematic review was to identify whether athlete age, sex, sport type, injury definition and mechanism contribute to the variable findings. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in October 2018 using PubMed, EBSCOhost, Scopus, EmBase and Web of Science databases. Studies were included if they were peer reviewed and published in English language, included athletes from any competition level, performed the FMS at baseline to determine risk groups based on FMS composite score, asymmetry or pain, and prospectively observed injury incidence during training and competition. Study eligibility assessment and data extraction was performed by two reviewers. Random effects meta-analyses were used to determine odds ratio (OR), sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals. Sub-group analyses were based on athlete age, sex, sport type, injury definition, and injury mechanism. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies were included in the FMS composite score meta-analysis. There was a smaller effect for junior (OR = 1.03 [0.67-1.59]; p = 0.881) compared to senior athletes (OR = 1.80 [1.17-2.78]; p = 0.008) and for male (OR = 1.79 [1.08-2.96]; p = 0.024) compared to female (OR = 1.92 [0.43-8.56]; p = 0.392) athletes. FMS composite scores were most likely to be associated with increased injury risk in rugby (OR = 5.92 [1.67-20.92]; p = 0.006), and to a lesser extent American football (OR = 4.41 [0.94-20.61]; p = 0.059) and ice hockey (OR = 3.70 [0.89-15.42]; p = 0.072), compared to other sports. Specificity values were higher than sensitivity values for FMS composite score. Eleven studies were included in the FMS asymmetry meta-analysis with insufficient study numbers to generate sport type subgroups. There was a larger effect for senior (OR = 1.78 [1.16-2.73]; p = 0.008) compared to junior athletes (OR = 1.21 [0.75-1.96]; p = 0.432). Sensitivity values were higher than specificity values for FMS asymmetry. For all FMS outcomes, there were minimal differences across injury definitions and mechanisms. Only four studies provided information about FMS pain and injury risk. There was a smaller effect for senior athletes (OR = 1.28 [0.33-4.96]; p = 0.723) compared to junior athletes (OR = 1.71 [1.16-2.50]; p = 0.006). Specificity values were higher than sensitivity values for FMS pain. CONCLUSION Athlete age, sex and sport type explained some of the variable findings of FMS prospective injury-risk studies. FMS composite scores and asymmetry were more useful for estimating injury risk in senior compared to junior athletes. Effect sizes tended to be small except for FMS composite scores in rugby, ice hockey and American football athletes.

MethodsQuantified the benefits of vaccination using meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and transmission studies to estimate the relative risk reduction (RRR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), and number needed to vaccinate (NNV) for transmission, infection, and severe illness/hospitalization. Estimated the baseline infection risk and the baseline transmission risks for different settings. Quantified the benefits of exclusion using these data to estimate the number of unvaccinated people needed to exclude (NNE) to prevent one transmission in different settings. Modelled how the benefits of vaccination and exclusion change as a function of baseline infection risk. Studies were identified from recent systematic reviews and a search of MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, Embase, Global Health, and Google Scholar. ResultsData on infection and severe illness/hospitalization were obtained from 10 RCTs and 19 cohort studies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, totalling 5,575,049 vaccinated and 4,341,745 unvaccinated participants. Data from 7 transmission studies were obtained, totalling 557,020 index cases, 49,328 contacts of vaccinated index cases, and 1,294,372 contacts of unvaccinated index cases. The estimated baseline infection risk in the general population is 3.04%. The estimated breakthrough infection risk in the vaccinated population is 0.57%. Vaccines are very effective at reducing the risk of infection (RRR=88%, ARR=2.59%, NNV=39) and severe illness/hospitalization (RRR=89%, ARR=0.15%, NNV=676) in the general population. While the latter effect is small, vaccines nearly eliminate the baseline risk of severe illness/hospitalization (0.16%). Among an infected persons closest contacts (primarily household members), vaccines reduce transmission risk (RRR=41%, ARR=11.04%, NNV=9). In the general population, the effect of vaccines on transmission risk is likely very small for most settings and baseline infection risks (NNVs [] 1,000). Infected vaccinated people have a nontrivial transmission risk for their closest contacts (14.35%), but it is less than unvaccinated people (23.91%). The transmission risk reduction gained by excluding unvaccinated people is very small for most settings: healthcare (NNE=4,699), work/study places (NNE=2,193), meals/gatherings (NNE=531), public places (NNE=1,731), daily conversation (NNE=587), and transportation (NNE=4,699). Exclusion starts showing benefits on transmission risk for some settings when the baseline infection risk is between 10% to 20%. ConclusionsThe benefits of VMVP are clear: the coercive element to these policies will likely lead to increased vaccination levels. Our study shows that higher vaccination levels will drive infections lower and almost eliminate severe illness/hospitalization from the general population. This will substantially lower the burden on healthcare systems. The benefits of exclusion are less clear. The NNEs suggest that hundreds, and even thousands, of unvaccinated people may need to be excluded from various settings to prevent one SARS-CoV-2 transmission from unvaccinated people. Therefore, consideration of the costs of exclusion is warranted, including staffing shortages from losing unvaccinated healthcare workers, unemployment/unemployability, financial hardship for unvaccinated people, and the creation of a class of citizens who are not allowed to fully participate in many areas of society.

RESULTS: The results showed that a much higher frequency of specific IFN--secreting CTLs, high levels of granzyme B production, and a strong proliferation capacity of specific CTLs were observed in splenocytes of mice immunized with multi-epitope peptide than in those of a single CTL epitope. Moreover, pre-immunization of multi-epitope peptide could reduce the levels of HTNV RNA loads in the liver, spleen and kidneys of mice, indicating that specific CTL responses induced by multi-epitope peptide could reduce HTNV RNA loads in vivo.

Here we analyze the importance of the sialic acid binding activity for the infection of tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) by different IBV strains. Our results show that 2,3-linked sialic acid also serves as a receptor determinant on chicken TOCs. Infection of TOCs by IBV results in ciliostasis. Desialylation induced by neuraminidase treatment of tracheal organ cultures prior to infection by IBV delayed the ciliostatic effect or resulted in partial loss of ciliary activity. This effect was observed with both respiratory and nephropathogenic strains. Inhibition of ciliostasis was also observed when TOCs were pretreated with an 2,3-specific neuraminidase.

This study compares the gut microbial abundance and diversity between healthy volunteers and Malaysian IgAN cohort. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted involving biopsy-proven IgAN patients in clinical remission with matched controls in a Malaysian tertiary centre. Demographic data, routine blood and urine results were recorded. Stool samples were collected and their DNA was extracted by 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile their gut microbiota.

The core of this pandemic is the rapid transmissibility of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, its high morbidity and mortality, and the presence of infectious asymptomatic carriers. As a result, COVID-19 has dominated this year's headlines and commanded significant research attention. As we consider SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that scientists, governments, the media, and the general population also come to grips with the everyday cost of parasitic diseases.

One of these, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), is a well-matched surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 because it is also a Betacoronavirus, targets the human respiratory system, is transmitted via respiratory aerosols and droplets and is relatively resistant to disinfectants. Unfortunately, growth of HCoV-OC43 in the recommended human colon cancer (HRT-18) cells does not produce obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) and its titration in these cells requires expensive antibody-based detection. Consequently, multiple quantification approaches for HCoV-OC43 using alternative cell lines exist, which complicates comparison of research results. Hence, we investigated the basic growth parameters of HCoV-OC43 infection in three of these cell lines (HRT-18, human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) and African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells) including the differential development of cytopathic effect (CPE) and explored reducing the cost, time and complexity of antibody-based detection assay. Multi-step growth curves were conducted in each cell type in triplicate at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 with daily sampling for seven days. Samples were quantified by tissue culture infectious dose50(TCID50)/ml or plaque assay (cell line dependent) and additionally analyzed on the Sartorius Virus Counter 3100 (VC), which uses flow virometry to count the total number of intact virus particles in a sample. We improved the reproducibility of a previously described antibody-based detection based TCID50 assay by identifying commercial sources for antibodies, decreasing antibody concentrations and simplifying the detection process. The growth curves demonstrated that HCoV-O43 grown in MRC-5 cells reached a peak titer of 107 plaque forming units/ml at two days post infection (dpi). In contrast, HCoV-OC43 grown on HRT-18 cells required six days to reach a peak titer of 106.5 TCID50/ml. HCoV-OC43 produced CPE in Vero E6 cells but these growth curve samples failed to produce CPE in a plaque assay after four days. Analysis of the VC data in combination with plaque and TCID50 assays together revealed that the defective:infectious virion ratio of MRC-5 propagated HCoV-OC43 was less than 3:1 for 1-6 dpi while HCoV-OC43 propagated in HRT-18 cells varied from 41:1 at 1 dpi, to 329:4 at 4 dpi to 94:1 at 7 dpi. These results should enable better comparison of extant HCoV-OC43 study results and prompt further standardization efforts.","output":"Improving human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) research results comparability in studies using HCoV-OC43 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This paper synthesizes current, global evidence-informed guidance that supports nurses and midwives to recognize and respond to intimate partner violence (IPV), and how these practices can be translated from face-to-face encounters, to care that is delivered through telehealth BACKGROUND: COVID-19 related social and physical distancing measures increase the risk for individuals who are socially isolated with partners who perpetuate violence Providing support through telehealth is one strategy that can mitigate the pandemic of IPV, while helping patients and providers stay safe from COVID-19 DESIGN AND METHODS: In this discursive paper, we describe how practical guidance for safely recognizing and responding to IPV in telehealth encounters was developed The ADAPT-ITT (Assessment, Decisions, Administration, Production, Topical Experts, Integration, Testing, Training) framework was used to guide the novel identification and adaptation of evidence-informed We focused on the first six stages of the ADAPT-ITT framework CONCLUSIONS: This paper fills a gap in available guidance, specifically for IPV recognition and response via telehealth We present strategies for prioritizing safety and promoting privacy while initiating, managing, or terminating a telehealth encounter with patients who may be at risk for or experiencing IPV Strategies for assessment, planning, and intervention are also summarized System level responses, such as increasing equitable access to telecommunication technology are also discussed RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Integrating innovative IPV-focused practices into telehealth care is an important opportunity for nurses and midwives during the current global COVID-19 pandemic There are also implications for future secondary outbreaks, natural disasters, or other physically isolating events, for improving healthcare efficiency, and for addressing the needs of vulnerable populations with limited access to healthcare","output":"Recognizing and Responding to Intimate Partner Violence using Telehealth: Practical Guidance for Nurses and Midwives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current situation : Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) is a global framework for surveillance of Influenza and other respiratory viruses, data collection, laboratory capacity building, genomic data submission and archival, standardization and calibration of reagents and vaccine strains, production of seasonal influenza vaccines and creating a facilitatory regulatory environment for the same.

Particularly at risk are developing countries whose health systems may be less well equipped to detect quickly and respond effectively to the importation of new infectious diseases. This chapter examines what might have been the economic consequences if the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic had been imported to a small Asia-Pacific country. Hypothetical outbreaks in two countries were modelled. The post-importation estimations were carried out with two linked models: a stochastic disease transmission (SEIR) model and a quarterly version of the multi-country GTAP model, GTAP-Q. The SEIR model provided daily estimates of the number of persons in various disease states. For each intervention strategy the stochastic disease model was run 500 times to obtain the probability distribution of disease outcomes. Typical daily country outcomes for both controlled and uncontrolled outbreaks under five alternative intervention strategies were converted to quarterly disease-state results, which in turn were used in the estimation of GTAP-Q shocks to country-specific health costs and labour productivity during the outbreak, and permanent reductions in each countrys population and labour force due to mortality. Estimated behavioural consequences (severe reductions in international tourism and crowd avoidance) formed further shocks. The GTAP-Q simulations revealed very large economic costs for each country if they experienced an uncontrolled Ebola outbreak, and considerable economic costs for controlled outbreaks in Fiji due to the importance of the tourism sector to its economy. A major finding was that purely reactive strategies had virtually no effect on preventing uncontrolled outbreaks, but pre-emptive strategies substantially reduced the proportion of uncontrolled outbreaks, and in turn the economic and social costs.","output":"Modelling the Economic Impacts of Epidemics in Developing Countries Under Alternative Intervention Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the kinetics of the neutralizing antibody responses to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 delta variant over the course of 1 year in 16 patients infected at the beginning of the pandemic.

METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase with the keywords: inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2. We included studies reporting the frequency of COVID-19 infection and outcomes (hospitalisation, need for intensive care unit care and mortality) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We estimated the pooled incidence of COVID-19 in inflammatory bowel disease and comparative risk vis-a-vis the general population. We also estimated the pooled frequency of outcomes and compared them in patients who received and did not receive drugs for inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included. The pooled incidence rate of COVID-19 per 1000 patients of inflammatory bowel disease and the general population were 4.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-11.17) and 6.59 (3.25-13.35), respectively, with no increase in relative risk (0.47, 0.18-1.26) in inflammatory bowel disease. The relative risk of the acquisition of COVID-19 was not different between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (1.03, 0.62-1.71). The pooled proportion of COVID-19-positive inflammatory bowel disease patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit care was 27.29% and 5.33% while pooled mortality was 4.27%. The risk of adverse outcomes was higher in ulcerative colitis compared to Crohn's disease. The relative risks of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and mortality were lower for patients on biological agents (0.34, 0.19-0.61; 0.49, 0.33-0.72 and 0.22, 0.13-0.38, respectively) but higher with steroids (1.99, 1.64-2.40; 3.41, 2.28-5.11 and 2.70, 1.61-4.55) or 5-aminosalicylate (1.59, 1.39-1.82; 2.38, 1.26-4.48 and 2.62, 1.67-4.11) use.

The combination of drought and COVID-19 can lead to a compounding impact on farming sectors, including crop yield. This study investigated the potential impact of drought, COVID-19, and their compound effect on three major crop yields in 2020. The analysis was carried out using the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) concept to model the spatially varying relationship between Standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI), COVID-19 incidence rate, and three crop yields (corn, soybeans, and wheat) across the counties located in the USA. The GWR model was suitable for capturing local scale crop variability, and the potential hotspots are identified where the compound effect is dominant. Although the drought in 2020 was not extreme compared to the past events, the median crop yield during 2020 for the three crop yields was lower than their historical (1980-2020) median values, which highlights the potential role of COVID-19 on reduced crop yields. The compound effect of drought and COVID-19 seem to vary in terms of crop and region wise. For example, the compound effect on corn was prominent in Central California and several counties in Midwest USA.

Since T-box proteins share a similar DNA binding domain, we hypothesized that misexpressing T in the paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm would also interfere with the endogenous Tbx15 and Tbx18, causing embryonic phenotypes resembling those seen upon Tbx6 expression in the somites and limbs. Interestingly, ectopic T expression led to distinct embryonic phenotypes, specifically, reduced-sized somites in embryos expressing the highest levels of T, which ultimately affects axis length and neural tube morphogenesis.

Methods: A focus group with 10 professionals providing the Caregiver Skills Training Program was conducted. Results: Poor families of vulnerable children were found to be challenged, more than average, in finding daily necessities during the initial stage of the outbreak. Most vulnerable children displayed additional problematic behaviors and emotional problems during the quarantine. The social service professionals addressed the family needs by providing tangible resources and offering online training, workshops, and programs to meet their needs. Several important lessons were learned. First, technology know-how on conducting online training, workshop, and program could be a challenge to some social service professionals and the parents. Second, the professionals reported that they made huge efforts to produce guidelines in protecting services users' privacy, to equip themselves with necessary skills in executing privacy-protection measures, and to keep exploring for safer alternatives.

Automatic pain assessment tools are therefore more than desirable in cases where this specific ability is negatively affected by various psycho-physiological dispositions, as well as distinct physical traits such as in the case of professional athletes, who usually have a higher pain tolerance as regular individuals. Hence, several approaches have been proposed during the past decades for the implementation of an autonomous and effective pain assessment system. These approaches range from more conventional supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques applied on a set of carefully hand-designed feature representations, to deep neural networks applied on preprocessed signals. Some of the most prominent advantages of deep neural networks are the ability to automatically learn relevant features, as well as the inherent adaptability of trained deep neural networks to related inference tasks. Yet, some significant drawbacks such as requiring large amounts of data to train deep models and over-fitting remain. Both of these problems are especially relevant in pain intensity assessment, where labeled data is scarce and generalization is of utmost importance. In the following work we address these shortcomings by introducing several novel multi-modal deep learning approaches (characterized by specific supervised, as well as self-supervised learning techniques) for the assessment of pain intensity based on measurable bio-physiological data. While the proposed supervised deep learning approach is able to attain state-of-the-art inference performances, our self-supervised approach is able to significantly improve the data efficiency of the proposed architecture by automatically generating physiological data and simultaneously performing a fine-tuning of the architecture, which has been previously trained on a significantly smaller amount of data.","output":"Multi-Modal Pain Intensity Assessment Based on Physiological Signals: A Deep Learning Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Teaching students about electronic health records presents challenges for most nursing programs, primarily because of the limited training opportunities within clinical practice settings. A simulated electronic health record is an experiential, learner-centered strategy that enables students to acquire and apply the informatics knowledge needed for working with electronic records in a safe learning environment before the students have encounters with real patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the Lippincott DocuCare simulated electronic health record and determine the feasibility issues associated with its implementation. METHODS: We used one-group pretest-posttest, surveys, and focus group interviews with students and instructors to pilot the DocuCare simulated electronic health record within an undergraduate nursing program in Western Canada. Volunteering students worked through 4 case scenarios during a 1-month pilot. Self-reported informatics knowledge and attitudes toward the electronic health record, accuracy of computerized documentation, satisfaction, and students and educators experiences were examined. Demographic and general information regarding informatics learning was also collected. RESULTS: Although 23 students participated in this study, only 13 completed surveys were included in the analysis. Almost two-thirds of the students indicated their overall understanding of nursing informatics as being fair or inadequate. The two-tailed paired samples t test used to evaluate the impact of DocuCare on students self-reported informatics knowledge and attitudes toward the electronic health record revealed a statistically significant difference in the mean score of knowledge before and after using DocuCare (before: mean 2.95, SD 0.58; after: mean 3.83, SD 0.39; t(12)=5.80, two-tailed; P<.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean scores of attitudes toward the electronic health record before and after using DocuCare (before: mean 3.75, SD 0.40; after: mean 3.70, SD 0.34; t(12)=0.39, two-tailed; P=.70). Students documentation scores varied from somewhat accurate to completely accurate; however, performance improved for the majority of students as they progressed from case scenarios 1 to 4. Both the faculty and students were highly satisfied with DocuCare and highly recommended its integration. Focus groups with 7 students and 3 educators revealed multiple themes. The participants shared suggestions regarding the DocuCare product customization and strategies for potential integration in undergraduate nursing programs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the feasibility and suitability of the DocuCare program as a tool to enhance students learning about informatics and computerized documentation in electronic health records.

ACP is a dynamic communication process involving patients, families and healthcare providers, which serves to discuss and document wishes and goals for future care. Currently, ACP practice is often suboptimal. This implies that important decisions about care and treatment may need to be made acutely in crises. Many factors contribute to suboptimal ACP practice. One such factor is ambiguity regarding roles and responsibilities of different disciplines in the ACP-process. The perception that having ACP conversations is primarily a physician's task is a misconception. Specific skills that could contribute to a holistic and person-centered ACP-process are largely lacking in nursing curricula and therefore, may be insufficient and under-utilized. For instance, nursing staff could involve persons in conversations about meaning, quality of life, loss and grief as a part of ACP. Moreover, they may communicate a patient's wishes to other healthcare providers including physicians. Acknowledgement of this potential role, by physicians as well as by nursing staff themselves, is needed for ACP to become a truly interprofessional process.","output":"[The nurse's role in the process of advance care planning]./ De rol van de verzorgende en verpleegkundige in het advance care planning proces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses work with older people in almost all practice settings and to do so effectively they require knowledge, expertise and skills.","output":"Building the future."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Access to psychiatric care is critical for patients discharged from hospital psychiatric units to ensure continuity of care. When face-to-face follow-up is unavailable or undesirable, telepsychiatry becomes a promising alternative. This study aimed to investigate hospital- and county-level characteristics associated with telepsychiatry adoption. METHODS: Cross-sectional national data of 3475 acute care hospitals were derived from the 2017 American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Generalized linear regression models were used to identify characteristics associated with telepsychiatry adoption. RESULTS: About one-sixth (548 [15.8%]) of hospitals reported having telepsychiatry with a wide variation across states. Rural noncore hospitals were less likely to adopt telepsychiatry (8.3%) than hospitals in rural micropolitan (13.6%) and urban counties (19.4%). Hospitals with both outpatient and inpatient psychiatric care services (marginal difference [95% CI]: 16.0% [12.1% to 19.9%]) and hospitals only with outpatient psychiatric services (6.5% [3.7% to 9.4%]) were more likely to have telepsychiatry than hospitals with neither psychiatric services. Federal hospitals (48.9% [32.5 to 65.3%]), system-affiliated hospitals (3.9% [1.2% to 6.6%]), hospitals with larger bed size (Quartile IV vs. I: 6.2% [0.7% to 11.6%]), and hospitals with greater ratio of Medicaid inpatient days to total inpatient days (Quartile IV vs. I: 4.9% [0.3% to 9.4%]) were more likely to have telepsychiatry than their counterparts. Private non-profit hospitals (- 6.9% [- 11.7% to - 2.0%]) and hospitals in counties designated as whole mental health professional shortage areas (- 6.6% [- 12.7% to - 0.5%]) were less likely to have telepsychiatry. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, telepsychiatry adoption in US hospitals was low with substantial variations by urban and rural status and by state in 2017.

In order to address citizens psychological problems, government agencies in many countries have employed AI-based chatbots to provide mental health services. However, there is a limited understanding of the determinants affecting citizens user experience and user satisfaction when mental health services supported by chatbots are provided. Thus, based on the Theory of Consumption Values (TCV), this study proposes an analytical framework to investigate the factors that are important to citizens user experience and user satisfaction when they interact with mental health chatbots. Analysis of data collected from 295 chatbot users in Wuhan and Chongqing reveals that personalization, enjoyment, learning, and condition are positively related to user experience and user satisfaction. However, voice interaction fails to devote to citizens user experience and user satisfaction. Thus, government agencies and their AI service contractors should enhance the functions and systems of mental health chatbots to ensure citizens user experience and user satisfaction. Also, they should more positively promote the use of mental health chatbots during the public health emergency.

Interdisciplinary approaches for zoonosis management exist in literature, but collaboratively implementing them is a pervasive challenge. The Sri Lanka Wildlife Health Centre (SLWHC) was created in 2011 to coordinate wildlife disease surveillance and response among government agencies. We interviewed SLWHC-affiliated personnel about existing communication and collaboration channels to identify operational needs as well as potential enhancements for the SLWHC's operations. We used the Policy Sciences' analytical framework to identify opportunities and challenges for the SLWHC. Study participants held both human and animal health as the utmost priorities. However, their observations indicate that inter-organizational communication barriers and intra-organizational hierarchies still need to be overcome for the Centre's partnering organizations to collaborate to their fullest potential. Any interventions to enhance the SLWHC's collaborative capacity for detecting and managing zoonotic disease outbreaks could be strengthened by appealing to participants' shared value orientations towards enlightenment and respect. A common interest was the desire to collaborate and combine resources, knowledge and personnel to detect, reduce and prevent the incidence of zoonotic disease outbreaks in Sri Lanka.

CLINICAL FINDINGS Clinical signs included muscle atrophy, paresis, depressed spinal reflexes, hyperesthesia of the thoracic limbs, and reduced jaw muscle tone. Pelvic limb reflexes were normal. Results of a neurologic examination were suggestive of multifocal lesions involving both brachial plexuses and the trigeminal nerves. Abnormal nerve conduction across the brachial plexus and delayed late potentials were found on electrodiagnostic testing, and diffuse subclinical involvement of other regions of the peripheral nervous system was confirmed on the basis of abnormal electromyographic findings for the masticatory muscles and conduction block of the peroneal nerve. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME No specific treatments were given, and neurologic signs resolved within a month. A relapse occurred 2 months after the first episode, with clinical signs affecting both the pelvic and the thoracic limbs on this occasion. Again, the condition resolved without specific treatment, and 13 months after the initial episode, the cat reportedly was normal. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Findings suggested that brachial plexus neuropathy can be a multifocal disease in cats, even if clinically apparent neurologic deficits are initially subtle or absent, and that electrodiagnostic techniques can be used to identify subclinical involvement of the peripheral nerves.","output":"Electrophysiologic evidence of polyneuropathy in a cat with signs of bilateral brachial plexus neuropathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Improving care coordination is particularly important for individuals with rare conditions (who may experience multiple inputs into their care, across different providers and settings). To develop and evaluate strategies to potentially improve care coordination, it is necessary to develop a method for organising different ways of coordinating care for rare conditions. Developing a taxonomy would help to describe different ways of coordinating care and in turn facilitate development and evaluation of pre-existing and new models of care coordination for rare conditions. To the authors' knowledge, no studies have previously developed taxonomies of care coordination for rare conditions. This research aimed to develop and refine a care coordination taxonomy for people with rare conditions. Methods: This study had a qualitative design and was conducted in the United Kingdom. To develop a taxonomy, six stages of taxonomy development were followed. We conducted interviews (n=30 health care professionals/charity representatives/commissioners) and focus groups (n=4 focus groups, 22 patients/carers with rare/ultra-rare/undiagnosed conditions). Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded with consent, and professionally transcribed. Findings were analysed using thematic analysis. Themes were used to develop a taxonomy, and to identify which types of coordination may work best in which situations. To refine the taxonomy, we conducted two workshops (n=12 patients and carers group; n=15 professional stakeholder group). Results: Our taxonomy has six domains, each with different options. The six domains are: 1) Ways of organising care (local, hybrid, national), 2) Ways of organising professionals involved in care (collaboration between many or all professionals, collaboration between some professionals, a lack of collaborative approach), 3) Responsibility for coordination (administrative support, formal roles and responsibilities, supportive roles and no responsibility), 4) How often appointments and coordination take place (regular, on demand, hybrid), 5) Access to records (full or filtered access), and 6) Mode of care coordination (face-to-face, digital, telephone). Conclusions: Findings indicate that there are different ways of coordinating care across the six domains outlined in our taxonomy. This may help to facilitate the development and evaluation of existing and new models of care coordination for people living with rare conditions.","output":"Developing a taxonomy of care coordination for people living with rare conditions: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the question of ethics in times of pestilence as during Covid-19, via the ideas of Simon Blackburn, Jean Paul Sartre, and Henry Louis Gates Jr;it employs the representational notions of Gayatri Spivak and Stuart Hall as ways of seeing, so as to map and evaluate Biblical-Hebrew Exodus stories in relation to the current Covid-19 pandemic This exploration also attempts to respond principally to the questions: what then is the place of the greater common good as ethic in the current experience?

The effects of COVID-19Cinduced inflammation on cancer cells and their microenvironment are yet to be elucidated. Here, we formulate the hypothesis that COVID-19Cassociated inflammation may generate a microenvironment favorable to tumor cell proliferation and particularly to the reawakening of dormant cancer cells (DCCs). DCCs often survive treatment of primary tumors and populate premetastatic niches in the lungs and other organs, retaining the potential for metastatic outgrowth. DCCs reawakening may be promoted by several events associated to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, including activation of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, lymphopenia and an uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Among pro-inflammatory factors produced during COVID-19, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by activated neutrophils have been specifically shown to activate premetastatic cancer cells disseminated in the lungs, suggesting they may be involved in DCCs reawakening in COVID-19 patients. If confirmed by further studies, the links between COVID-19, DCCs reactivation and tumor relapse may support the use of specific anti-inflammatory and anti-metastatic therapies in patients with COVID-19 and an active or previous cancer.","output":"COVID-19CInduced Modifications in the Tumor Microenvironment: Do They Affect Cancer Reawakening and Metastatic Relapse?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is ongoing and rapid advancement in approaches to modelling the fate of exhaled particles in different environments relevant to disease transmission.

The mechanisms for this relationship may include having high levels of motivation to get food (reinforcing value of food; RRV) and low levels of inhibitory control (delay discounting; ) which, when combined, is referred to as reinforcement pathology (RP). We sought to examine the relationships among multiple measures of household SES, RP, and age-adjusted body mass index (zBMI) among adolescents. METHODS These data were collected as part of ongoing longitudinal study of risk factors for obesity in 244 adolescents. The adolescents and one parent/guardian had height and weight measured and completed surveys. The adolescents completed an adjusting amount  task and a computer-based RRV task. Analyses consisted of correlations among measures of SES and RRV, , and BMI z-scores. In the case of significant associations, multiple regression models were created with theoretically informed covariates. RESULTS Household income, parent/guardian education, parent/guardian occupation, and food insecurity status were all related to one another. Among the adolescents, a significant portion of the variance in RRV was accounted for by household income after controlling for covariates. For , it was parent/guardian education that was most associated after controlling for covariates. CONCLUSION When low income and low parent/guardian education occur together, there may be an increased risk of RP. Separately, food insecurity was predictive of higher parent/guardian BMI. Future research should continue to explore the effects of low income and parent/guardian education on RP among youth by examining them over time.","output":"Having less and wanting more: an investigation of socioeconomic status and reinforcement pathology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-induced murine neuroinflammation serves as a model to study acute meningoencephalomyelitis, hepatitis, and chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination; which mimics certain pathologies of the human neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation occurs due to direct glial cell dystrophy instigated by central nervous system (CNS)-resident microglia and astrocytes, in contrast to peripheral CD4+T cell-mediated myelin damage prevalent in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Viral envelope Spike glycoprotein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion is an essential mechanistic step for MHV-induced CNS pathogenicity. Although Azadirachta indica (Neem), a traditional phytomedicine, is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and spermicidal activities, not much is known about anti-neuroinflammatory properties of its bark (NBE) in MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation and chronic demyelination. Recombinant demyelinating MHV strain (RSA59) was preincubated with NBE to arrest the infection-initiation event, and its effect on viral replication, viral transcription, cytokine expression, and successive pathogenicity were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Virus-free Luciferase assay explained NBEs anti-virus-to-cell fusion activity in vitro. Intracranial inoculation of RSA59 preincubated with NBE into the mouse brain significantly reduces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalomyelitis, and chronic progressive demyelination. Additionally, NBE effectively restricts viral entry, dissemination in CNS, viral replication, viral transcription, and expression of the viral nucleocapsid and inflammatory cytokines. From mechanistic standpoints, RSA59 preincubated with NBE reduced viral entry, viral replication and cell-to-cell fusion, as a mode of viral dissemination. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection with NBE (25 mg/kg B.W.) into mice revealed a significant reduction in viral Nucleocapsid protein expression in vivo. Conclusively, A. indica bark extract may directly bind to the virus-host attachment Spike glycoprotein and suppresses MHV-induced neuroinflammation and neuropathogenesis by inhibiting cell-to-cell fusion and viral replication. Further studies will focus on combining bioanalytical assays to isolate potential NBE bioactive compound(s) that contribute towards the anti-viral activity of NBE.","output":"Azadirachta indica A.

The gold standard for diagnosis relies heavily on clinical suspicion along with PCR based assays of respiratory swabs. This nucleic acid study is highly sensitive and specific, however, there are faults, especially during the incubation period, during which the virus is hard to detect. Here we present a case of a patient, presenting with signs and symptoms of pneumonia, with serial negative viral swabs spaced out over time, who was ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 infection via more invasive means. Case: A 49-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with cough and shortness of breath for 2 days which developed when she returned to New York from Florida. Her personal history was significant for her occupation as an ER nurse and a history of vaping for 5-6 years.After arrival to the emergency department, the patient was febrile to 103.3 F, tachycardic, and hypoxic, saturating 89% on room air. Her laboratory work was significant for a mildly elevated D-dimer level, elevated CRP (11.23), normal procalcitonin level, and two negative COVID-19 swabs over 2 days. Her initial chest X ray showed multifocal pneumonia and a CT chest showed ground glass opacities amid dense consolidation. The patient was empirically treated for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics. The patient's respiratory and hemodynamic status started to decline, despite treatment. Ultimately, the patient required further investigation - a bronchoalveolar lavage was ultimately found to be positive for the COVID-19 virus, and the patient was immediately started on Remdesivir. Discussion: In this day and age, countries are increasingly utilizing the COVID-19 reverse-transcriptase PCR and are pushing for widespread testing for case detection, but how sensitive and specific is this test, really? Serial testing with swabs performed at intervals should be the answer as the viral load of the COVID RNA steadily rises and peaks over 0-9 days after onset of symptoms. However, this may not be the case in a majority of patients and more invasive testing using bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage may be the only way to truly diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. The delay in confirmation, however, could prove to be truly fatal, subjecting patients to painful measures like intubation. This case brings to light the realization that nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs may not be sufficient to detect the virus with full certainty.","output":"When COVID Goes Undetected"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Water scarcity has resulted in extensive wastewater recycling for agricultural irrigation in both Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

We aimed to investigate the role of peripheral blood eosinophil (EOS) as a marker in the course of the virus infection to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 227 pneumonia patients who visited the fever clinics in Shanghai General Hospital and 97 hospitalized COVID-19 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center were involved in a retrospective research study. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected. The trend of EOS level in COVID-19 patients and comparison among patients with different severity were summarized. RESULTS: The majority of COVID-19 patients (71.7%) had a decrease in circulating EOS counts, which was significantly more frequent than other types of pneumonia patients. EOS counts had good value for COVID-19 prediction, even higher when combined with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Patients with low EOS counts at admission were more likely to have fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath, with more lesions in chest CT and radiographic aggravation, and longer length of hospital stay and course of disease than those with normal EOS counts. Circulating EOS level gradually increased over the time, and was synchronous with the improvement in chest CT (12 days vs 13 days, P = .07), later than that of body temperature (12 days vs 10 days, P = .014), but earlier than that of the negative conversion of nucleic acid assays (12 days vs 17 days, P = .001).

These allow for differentiating whether lesions are located in either the thoraco-lumbar region or in the cervical myelum and/or brain. Transcranial trapezius MEPs further enable to distinguish between spinal and supraspinal located lesions. No normative data are available. It is unclear whether transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are interchangeable modalities. Objectives: To provide normative data for trapezius MEP parameters in horses for TES and TMS and to discern direct and indirect conduction routes by neurophysiological models that use anatomical geometric characteristics to relate latency times with peripheral (PCV) and central conduction velocities (CCV). Methods: Transcranial electrical stimulation-induced trapezius MEPs were obtained from twelve horses. TES and TMS-MEPs (subgroup 5 horses) were compared intra-individually. Trapezius MEPs were measured bilaterally twice at 5 intensity steps. Motoneurons were localized using nerve conduction models of the cervical and spinal accessory nerves (SAN). Predicted CCVs were verified by multifidus MEP data from two horses referred for neurophysiological assessment. Results: Mean MEP latencies revealed for TES: 13.5 (11.1-16.0)ms and TMS: 19.7 (12-29.5)ms, comprising a??100% direct routes and for TMS mixed direct/indirect routes of L:23/50; R:14/50.

Direct route TMS-TES latency differences were 1.88-4.30 ms. 95% MEP amplitudes ranges for TES were: L:0.26-22 mV; R:0.5-15 mV and TMS: L:0.9 - 9.1 mV; R:1.1-7.9 mV. Conclusion: This is the first study to report normative data characterizing TES and TMS induced- trapezius MEPs in horses. The complex trapezius innervation leaves TES as the only reliable stimulation modality. Differences in latency times along the SAN route permit for estimation of the location of active motoneurons, which is of importance for clinical diagnostic purpose. SAN route lengths and latency times are governed by anatomical locations of motoneurons across C2-C5 segments. TES intensity-dependent reductions of trapezius MEP latencies are similar to limb muscles while MEP amplitudes between sides and between TES and TMS are not different. CCVs may reach 180 m/s.","output":"Trapezius Motor Evoked Potentials From Transcranial Electrical Stimulation and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Reference Data, Characteristic Differences and Intradural Motor Velocities in Horses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Isolated aspergillus laryngitis is rare and often diagnosed after surgical excision or biopsy for a suspected premalignant or malignant pathology. Unlike other systemic or localized aspergillosis, there are no specific guidelines for isolated laryngeal aspergillosis. Our experience of dealing with a wide variety of isolated laryngeal aspergillosis showed that this entity is very responsive to medical therapy, making extensive debridement (as often carried out in surgically accessible aspergillosis) unnecessary as it would invariably lead to long-term dysphonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of all cases of isolated aspergillus laryngitis that presented to our hospital over the past 5 years was carried out. All patients with confirmed histopathological diagnosis of aspergillus infection were included. RESULTS Twelve patients (five males and seven females) aged 28-54 years, who were diagnosed with aspergillus laryngitis presented with dysphonia. The most common involved site was the true vocal cords. All patients underwent cautious biopsies either in the operating theatre or in-office using a channeled fiber-optic laryngoscope. On histopathological examination, eight had invasive aspergillus infection while others showed variety of noninvasive involvement including colonization of cysts and carcinoma in situ. The most common species isolated was Aspergillus fumigatus. Appropriate antifungal chemotherapy was prescribed after ruling out systemic involvement. None of the patients showed recurrence or residual lesions on follow-up and reported significantly improved voice. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the wide spectrum of presentation of isolated aspergillus laryngitis with Aspergillus fumigatus being the most common organism isolated. Even the invasive variant is a medically treatable condition with voriconazole being the drug of choice. The importance of cautious biopsies and resections for voice preservation is also emphasized.

Its high mortality (roughly 38%) has raised public fear worldwide, calling for the development of effective and safe therapeutics to combat MERS-CoV infection. On the basis of our previous work in development of peptide fusion inhibitors against HIV and SARS-CoV, and the crystal structure of the six-helix-bundle core of the MERS-CoV spike protein, we identified a peptide derived from the MERS-CoV S protein S2 subunit HR2 domain (HR2P) with a potent inhibitory activity against S-protein-mediated cellCcell fusion. Here, we tested an HR2P analogue with improved pharmaceutical properties, HR2P-M2, for its inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo (appendix). Methods We assessed the anti-MERS-CoV activities of HR2P-M2 in vitro with pseudotyped MERS-CoVs in cell culture and in vivo with live MERS-CoVs in hDPP4-transgenic mice. The activities of HR2P-M2 to form six-helix bundles with HR1 peptides and to block fusion core formation between HR1 and HR2 peptides were studied using methods such as circular dichroism, N-PAGE, and FN-PAGE. Findings HR2P-M2 was highly effective in blockade of cellCcell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S proteins and inhibition of infection by MERS pseudoviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein with or without mutation in the HR1 region, with IC50 (the concentration causing 50% inhibition) less than 07 M. HR2P-M2 bound to the HR1 peptide to form stable six-helix bundles and blocked fusion core formation between the HR1 and HR2 peptides. Intranasal administration of HR2P-M2 before viral challenge fully protected hDPP4-transgenic mice (n=5) from MERS-CoV infection, whereas all the untreated mice (n=5) died 8 days after viral challenge. Interpretation Our findings suggest that the HR2P-M2 peptide merits further development as an effective and safe anti-MERS-CoV drug, alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs, to treat MERS-CoV-infected patients and to prevent the disease in high-risk populations, including health-care workers and family members of patients.

This can distort the triangle such that reserving methods like chain ladder or the loss ratio method do not work properly. A very recent example of such an external factor is the Covid-19 pandemic. In many countries, the insurance industry is in the process of establishing market knowledge about the impact of the pandemic on premiums and losses. We extend the additive claims reserving model to allow for calendar year effects and develop a variant of the incremental loss ratio method (also known as the additive method) that can make use of such market knowledge.

However, most existing phenomenological growth models only support single-peak outbreak dynamics whereas real epidemics often display more complex transmission trajectories. METHODS: We develop and apply a novel sub-epidemic modeling framework that supports a diversity of epidemic trajectories including stable incidence patterns with sustained or damped oscillations to better understand and forecast epidemic outbreaks. We describe how to forecast an epidemic based on the premise that the observed coarse-scale incidence can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics at finer scales. We evaluate our modeling framework using three outbreak datasets: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, plague in Madagascar, and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and four performance metrics. RESULTS: The sub-epidemic wave model outperforms simpler growth models in short-term forecasts based on performance metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions namely the mean interval score (MIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval. For example, we demonstrate how the sub-epidemic wave model successfully captures the 2-peak pattern of the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Moreover, in short-term sequential forecasts, the sub-epidemic model was able to forecast the second surge in case incidence for this outbreak, which was not possible using the simple growth models. Furthermore, our findings support the view that the national incidence curve of the Ebola epidemic in DRC follows a stable incidence pattern with periodic behavior that can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight how overlapping sub-epidemics can capture complex epidemic dynamics, including oscillatory behavior in the trajectory of the epidemic wave. This observation has significant implications for interpreting apparent noise in incidence data where the oscillations could be dismissed as a result of overdispersion, rather than an intrinsic part of the epidemic dynamics. Unless the oscillations are appropriately modeled, they could also give a false positive, or negative, impression of the impact from public health interventions. These preliminary results using sub-epidemic models can help guide future efforts to better understand the heterogenous spatial and social factors shaping sub-epidemic patterns for other infectious diseases.

Methods: Monthly TH utilization at a single large NCI-designated institute from 3/1/2020-11/30/2020 was reviewed. Utilization was calculated as chargeable TH visits (new video, established video, phone) as a proportion of all consult/follow up visits. Patient satisfaction surveys for oncology TH visits for MD/PA/NP providers were reviewed from 4/1/2020- 11/30/2020. Surveys were sent after every TH visit, unless the patient had a prior visit in the past 3 months. Percent (%) top box score (TBS) was defined as proportion of responses in the highest possible response category (i.e. very good). % TBS was reported for 14 survey items in 4 domains: technology, access, care provider (CP), and overall assessment. Satisfaction was assessed over time and according to patient factors: generation, gender, insurance type, employment status, and clinic site. The Cochrane-Armitage trend test was used to compare proportions of TBS responses across monthly time points. Results: TH comprised 21% (22,055/103,461) of all encounters in the study period. TH use increased from 9% in 3/2020 to a peak of 47% in 4/2020. In 11/2020, TH use was 18%. 28.0% (2,286/8,173) of TH patient surveys were returned. Multiple patient satisfaction metrics were improved over time (Table). Patients had higher satisfaction with phone compared to video visits with regards to technology (86% vs 76%) and access (80% vs 72%). Millennials (born 1981-1995) had higher satisfaction with access to TH (87%) compared to Gen X (1965-1980) (77%), Baby Boomer (1946- 1964) (74%), and Silent Generation (1928-1945) (72%), however all generations had similar levels of satisfaction with technology (range 77- 80%).

They provide information related to poor outcomes when considered together, however their collective behavior across time has not been characterized. METHODS We have developed the Triple Variable Index (TVI), a composite variable representing the sum of z-scores from MAP, BIS, and MAC values that occur together during surgery. We generated a TVI expression profile, defined as the sequential TVI values expressed across time, for each surgery where concurrent MAP, BIS, and MAC monitoring occurred in an adult patient (18 years) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between January and July 2014 (n = 5296). Patterns of TVI expression were identified using k-means clustering and compared across numerous patient, procedure, and outcome characteristics. TVI and the triple low state were compared as prediction models for 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS The median frequency MAP, BIS, and MAC were recorded was one measurement every 3, 5, and 5 min. Three expression patterns were identified: elevated, mixed, and depressed. The elevated pattern displayed the highest average MAP, BIS, and MAC values (86.5 mmHg, 45.3, and 0.98, respectively), while the depressed pattern displayed the lowest values (76.6 mmHg, 38.0, 0.66).

This issue is even more critical in the challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via chatbots on mobile devices, offer the potential to achieve scalability of healthy-coping interventions by lowering cost and supporting prevention. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to conduct a proof-of-concept evaluation measuring the engagement and effectiveness of Atena, a psychoeducational chatbot supporting healthy coping with stress and anxiety, among a population of university students. METHODS: In a proof-of-concept study, 71 university students were recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic; 68% (48/71) were female, they were all in their first year of university, and their mean age was 20.6 years (SD 2.4). Enrolled students were asked to use the Atena psychoeducational chatbot for 4 weeks (eight sessions; two per week), which provided healthy-coping strategies based on cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and mindfulness techniques. The intervention program consisted of conversations combined with audiovisual clips delivered via the Atena chatbot. Participants were asked to complete web-based versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) at baseline and postintervention to assess effectiveness. They were also asked to complete the User Engagement Scale-Short Form at week 2 to assess engagement with the chatbot and to provide qualitative comments on their overall experience with Atena postintervention. RESULTS: Participants engaged with the Atena chatbot an average of 78 (SD 24.8) times over the study period. A total of 61 out of 71 (86%) participants completed the first 2 weeks of the intervention and provided data on engagement (10/71, 14% attrition). A total of 41 participants out of 71 (58%) completed the full intervention and the postintervention questionnaires (30/71, 42% attrition). Results from the completer analysis showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms for participants in more extreme GAD-7 score ranges (t39=0.94; P=.009) and a decrease in stress symptoms as measured by the PSS-10 (t39=2.00; P=.05) for all participants postintervention. Participants also improved significantly in the describing and nonjudging facets, based on their FFMQ subscale scores, and asked for some improvements in the user experience with the chatbot.

Initially, CT imaging was demonstrated to be one of the most sensitive tests for the detection of infection. Currently, with broader availability of polymerase chain reaction for disease diagnosis, CT is mainly used for the identification of complications and other defined clinical indications in hospitalized patients. Nonetheless, radiologists are interpreting lung imaging in unsuspected patients as well as in suspected patients with imaging obtained to rule out other relevant clinical indications. The knowledge of pathological findings is also crucial for imagers to better interpret various imaging findings. Identification of the imaging findings that are commonly seen with the disease is important to diagnose and suggest confirmatory testing in unsuspected cases. Proper precautionary measures will be important in such unsuspected patients to prevent further spread. In addition to understanding the imaging findings for the diagnosis of the disease, it is important to understand the growing set of tools provided by artificial intelligence.

While contact tracers are provided with rapid intensive training they work in a dynamic setting, and may experience difficulties in managing the public's distress. Real-time data is essential to inform strategy, and respond to needs. This study aimed to understand the psychological impact on contact tracers and inform the development of appropriate supports. METHODS: A mixed methods design was used to collect data over three time points during 2021 using an online survey and semi-structured interviews. Measures included the Oldenburg Burnout Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale-14, the General Health Questionnaire 12, and the Impact of Events Scale-6. Survey data was analysed with ANOVAs and multiple regressions. Contact tracing systems issues, and concerns among the public were identified. Interviews, analysed using thematic analysis, provided an in-depth understanding of contact tracers' experiences. At time point 1, 139 contact tracers completed the survey, and 22 were interviewed. RESULTS: Burnout related exhaustion was experienced by 57% of contact tracers, 52% experienced mental distress, and 26% reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Professional background was associated with PTSD [F = 6.43, p=.013], and perceived stress scores [F = 5.23, p=.024]. Age was associated with perceived stress [F = 7.38, p = <.001)].

Moreover, the assessment of healthcare service potential access and utilization should take into account the care provided by primary and secondary services. Previous studies on the relationship between healthcare spatial accessibility and utilization often used conventional statistical methods without addressing the scale effect and spatial processes. This study investigated the impact of spatial accessibility to primary and secondary healthcare services on length of hospital stay (LOS), and the efficiency of using a geospatial approach to model this relationship. METHODS: This study focused on the  75-year-old population of the Nord administrative region of France. Inpatient hospital spatial accessibility was computed with the E2SFCA method, and then the LOS was calculated from the French national hospital activity and patient discharge database. Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial autoregressive (SAR), and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to analyse the relationship between LOS and spatial accessibility to inpatient hospital care and to three primary care service types (general practitioners, physiotherapists, and home-visiting nurses). Each model performance was assessed with measures of goodness of fit. Spatial statistical methods to reduce or eliminate spatial autocorrelation in the residuals were also explored. RESULTS: GWR performed best (highest R(2) and lowest Akaike information criterion). Depending on global model (OLS and SAR), LOS was negatively associated with spatial accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. GWR highlighted local patterns of spatial variation in LOS estimates. The distribution of areas in which LOS was positively or negatively associated with spatial accessibility varied when considering accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that spatial regressions could be useful for analysing the relationship between healthcare spatial accessibility and utilization. In our case study, hospitalization of elderly people was shorter in areas with better accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. This may be related to the presence of effective community healthcare services. GWR performed better than LOS and SAR. The identification by GWR of how these relationships vary spatially could bring important information for public healthcare policies, hospital decision-making, and healthcare resource allocation.","output":"Efficiency of fine scale and spatial regression in modelling associations between healthcare service spatial accessibility and their utilization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of data science in society today is undeniable, and now is the time to prepare data science talent (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2018) Data science demands collaboration, but collaboration within political science departments has been weak in teaching data science Bridging substantive and methods courses can critically aid in teaching data science because it facilitates this collaboration Our innovation is to integrate data science into both substantive and methods courses through a dedicated data science course and modules on data science topics taught in substantive courses This approach allows not only for more opportunities for teaching and practice of data science methods but also helps students to understand how social, economic, and political biases and incentives can affect their data","output":"Teaching Data Science in Political Science: Integrating Methods with Substantive Curriculum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is currently of global concern.

In particular, livestock diseases may constitute severe threats to humans due to the particularly high physical contact and exposure and, also, be the cause of important economic losses, even in non-endemic countries, where they often arise in the form of rapid and devastating epidemics. Rapid diagnostic tests have been used for a long time in field situations, particularly during outbreaks. However, they mostly rely on serological approaches, which may confirm the exposure to a particular pathogen but may be inappropriate for point-of-decision (point-of-care) settings when emergency responses supported on early and accurate diagnosis are required. Moreover, they often exhibit modest sensitivity and hence significantly depend on later result confirmation in central or reference laboratories. The impressive advances observed in recent years in materials sciences and in nanotechnology, as well as in nucleic-acid synthesis and engineering, have led to an outburst of new in-the-bench and prototype tests for nucleic-acid testing towards point-of-care diagnosis of genetic and infectious diseases.

Documented cognitive impairment, gender, or increasing age did not affect 1- or 5-year PLE. PLE influenced priorities of care: one-fifth of patients who estimated themselves to have >95% 1-year survival preferred care focusing on relieving pain and discomfort, compared with nearly three-quarters of those reporting a 50% chance of 1-year survival.

Patients who thought they were transplant candidates were significantly more confident they would be alive at 1 and 5 years and to want resuscitation attempted. Cognitive impairment had no effect on perceived transplant candidacy. A high symptom burden was present and underrecognized by HCPs. High symptom burden was associated with significantly lower PLE at both 1 and 5 years, increased anxiety/depression scores, and treatment choices more likely to prioritize relief of suffering. CONCLUSION: There is a disparity between patient PLE and those of their HCPs. Severity of symptom burden and beliefs regarding PLE or transplant candidacy affect patient treatment preferences.","output":"Perceptions of Illness Severity, Treatment Goals, and Life Expectancy: The ePISTLE Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to explore the value of CT in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia, especially for patients who have negative initial results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from January 19, 2020, to February 20, 2020, were included. All patients underwent chest CT and swab RT-PCR tests within 3 days. Patients were divided into groups with negative (seven patients) and positive (14 patients) initial RT-PCR results. The imaging findings in both groups were recorded and compared. RESULTS. Twenty-one patients with symptoms (nine men, 12 women; age range, 26-90 years) were evaluated. Most of the COVID-19 lesions were located in multiple lobes (67%) in both lungs (72%) in our study. The main CT features were ground-glass opacity (95%) and consolidation (72%) with a subpleural distribution (100%). Otherwise, 33% of patients had other lesions around the bronchovascular bundle. The other CT features included air bronchogram (57%), vascular enlargement (67%), interlobular septal thickening (62%), and pleural effusions (19%). Compared with that in the group with positive initial RT-PCR results, CT of the group with negative initial RT-PCR results was less likely to show pulmonary consolidation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION. The less pulmonary consolidation found at CT, the greater is the possibility of negative initial RT-PCR results. Chest CT is important in the screening of patients in whom disease is clinically suspected, especially those who have negative initial RT-PCR results.","output":"Can Chest CT Features Distinguish Patients With Negative From Those With Positive Initial RT-PCR Results for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a post-translational modification that plays pivotal roles in a wide range of cellular processes.

Notably, RNA virus genomes are sensed by mammalian cytosolic RIG-IClike receptors, thereby activating interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to restrict viral replication. However, recent evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway also protects against RNA viruses. So far, the mechanisms responsible for DNA sensing of RNA viruses, which replicate without known DNA intermediates, remain unclear. By using cGAS gene knockout and reconstitution in human and mouse cell cultures, we discovered that DNA sensing and cGAMP synthase activities are required for cGAS-mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis virus. The level of cGAMP produced in response to RNA virus infection was below the threshold of detection, suggesting that only transient and/or low levels of cGAMP are produced during RNA virus infections. To clarify the DNA ligands that activate cGAS activity, we confirmed that cGAS binds mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells; however, the amount of cGAS-associated mitochondrial DNA did not change in response to virus infection. Rather, a variety of pre-existing cytosolic DNAs, including mitochondrial DNA and endogenous cDNAs, may serve as stimuli for basal cGAS activation. Importantly, cGAS knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cGAS drives low-level ISG expression at steady state. We propose that cGAS-STING restricts RNA viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells, likely primed by endogenous cellular DNA ligands. Many medically important RNA viruses are restricted by the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway of innate immune activation. Since these viruses replicate without DNA intermediates, it is unclear what DNA ligand(s) are responsible for triggering this pathway. We show here that cGASs DNA binding and signaling activities are required for RNA virus restriction, similar to the mechanisms by which it restricts DNA viruses. Furthermore, we confirmed that cGAS continuously binds host DNA, which was unaffected by RNA virus infection. Finally, cGAS expression correlated with the low-level expression of interferon-stimulated genes in uninfected cells, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that cGAS-mediated sensing of endogenous DNA ligands contributes to RNA virus restriction by establishing a baseline of innate immune activation.","output":"Innate Immune Priming by cGAS as a Preparatory Countermeasure Against RNA Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malignant external otitis (MEO) is a rare inflammatory and infectious condition, typically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that mainly affects diabetic or immunocompromised elderly patients and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality It begins in the external auditory canal and rapidly progresses through the skull base, leading to osteomyelitis and may result in cranial neuropathy, especially of the facial nerve Here we describe a rare neurological presentation of MEO in a 65-year old diabetic man, who presented with an 8-month progressing left otitis externa and evolved with ipsilateral proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, blindness, facial palsy, hearing loss and contralateral evolvement of the temporal bone with hearing impairment He was initially treated with oral ciprofloxacin and after one week was transferred to our tertiary hospital, where antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem and vancomycin due to the severity of the case and to the hospitals microbiological profile The patient underwent left canal wall-up mastoidectomy with insertion of ear ventilation tube bilaterally, with good recovery of right ear hearing capacity, but with no improvements of neurological deficits nor left hearing function All microbiological tests performed were negative, and this was interpreted as a possible consequence of the early use of antibiotics Unfortunately, the patient was infected by Sars-CoV-2 during hospitalization and passed away after ten days of COVID-19 intensive care unit internment","output":"Multiple cranial nerve palsies in Malignant External Otitis: a rare presentation of a rare condition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Governments around the globe have introduced quarantine, lockdown, and mandatory isolation to slow the transmission of COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to investigate if iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms can be used to improve the diagnostic value of standard-dose CTP in AIS. METHODS Twenty-three patients with AIS underwent CTP with standardized protocol and dose. Raw data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and IR with intensity levels 3, 4, 5. Image quality was objectively (quantitative perfusion values, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)) and subjectively (overall image quality) assessed. Ischemic core and perfusion mismatch were visually rated. Discriminative power for tissue outcome prediction was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) resulting from the overlap between follow-up infarct lesions and stepwise thresholded CTP maps. RESULTS With increasing levels of IR, objective image quality (SNR and CNR in white matter and gray matter, elimination of error voxels) and subjective image quality improved. Using IR, mean transit time (MTT) was higher in ischemic lesions, while there was no significant change of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Visual assessments of perfusion mismatch changed in 4 patients, while the ischemic core remained constant in all cases. Discriminative power for infarct prediction as represented by AUC was not significantly changed in CBV, but increased in CBF and MTT (mean (95% CI)): 0.72 (0.67-0.76) vs. 0.74 (0.70-0.78) and 0.65 (0.62-0.67) vs 0.67 (0.64-0.70).

It describes how collaborative multi-agency working supported development and delivery of the programme. The context was policy in Wales. This included the Welsh Government response to the public inquiry into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, the report into care homes by the Older People's Commissioner for Wales, and the Welsh Government Health and Care Standards for Wales which include a standard relating to oral health. The aim was to introduce a programme, Gwn am Byth, to support 'oral hygiene and mouth care for older people living in care homes through the development of a consistent all-Wales approach'; this aligns with contemporaneous NICE guidelines. Materials and methods Recurrent Welsh Government funding was identified to support a community dental service (CDS) led programme (Gwn am Byth). A multi-professional team led the development and testing of materials and resources to support the programme, underpin training for care home staff, and allow them to assess and provide safe mouth care for residents. A Welsh Health Circular was published to ensure a consistent all-Wales approach Results New staff have been employed in all health boards, and an assessment tool has been developed and is in the final stages of validation. All Wales resources have been published for induction, training and education, and to support care home staff. Evidence-based care plans have been produced which link to individual residents' risks and needs. There is close working with other health and social care professionals. By March 2019, half of all care homes were participating in the programme to a greater or lesser extent. Over 5,000 health and care staff had been trained, and over 5,600 residents had been assessed and supported with delivery of an individual mouth care plan. There has been positive feedback from care home staff, residents, carers and CDS staff, although barriers to delivery remain. Discussion This paper describes programme delivery in the four years since Gwn am Byth began. The drivers for change are described and the need to influence Welsh Government policy decisions when funding was available. The authors discuss issues which can impact on the pace of change, and ways in which health and care staff can effectively work together to implement improvements.

In addressing mental health needs, web-based interventions have shown increasing promise in overcoming geographic distances and high student-to-counselor ratios, leading to the potential for wider implementation. The Mindfulness Virtual Community (MVC) program, a web-based program, guided by mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy principles, is among efforts aimed at effectively and efficiently reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress in students. OBJECTIVE: This studys aim was to evaluate the efficacy of an 8-week MVC program in reducing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress (primary outcomes), and improving mindfulness (secondary outcome) in undergraduate students at a large Canadian university. Guided by two prior randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that each demonstrated efficacy when conducted during regular university operations, this study coincided with a university-wide labor strike. Nonetheless, the students response to an online mental health program on a disrupted campus can provide useful information for anticipating the impact of other disruptions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future disruptions. METHODS: In this parallel-arm RCT, 154 students were randomly allocated to an 8-week MVC intervention (n=76) or a wait-list control (WLC) condition (n=78). The MVC intervention included the following: (1) educational and mindfulness video modules, (2) anonymous peer-to-peer discussions, and (3) anonymous, group-based, professionally guided, 20-minute videoconferences. Study outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 8-week follow-up using the following: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). Generalized estimation equations with an AR (1) covariance structure were used to evaluate the impact of the intervention, with outcome evaluations performed on both an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) basis. RESULTS: Participants (n=154) included 35 males and 117 females with a mean age of 23.1 years. There were no statistically significant differences at baseline between the MVC and WLC groups on demographics and psychological characteristics, indicating similar demographic and psychological characteristics across the two groups. Results under both ITT and PP approaches indicated that there were no statistically significant between-group differences in PHQ-9 (ITT: =C0.44, P=.64; PP: =C0.62, P=.053), BAI (ITT: =C2.06, P=.31; PP: =C2.32, P=.27), and FFMQ-SF (ITT: =1.33, P=.43; PP: =1.44, P=.41) compared to WLC. There was a significant difference for the PSS (ITT: =C2.31, P=.03; PP: =C2.38, P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: During a university labor strike, the MVC program led to statistically significant reductions in PSS compared to the WLC group, but there were no other significant between-group differences. Comparisons with previous cycles of intervention testing, undertaken during nondisrupted university operations, when efficacy was demonstrated, are discussed.

Here, using epidemiological data on COVID-19 and anonymized data on human movement4,5, we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimate that there were a total of 114,325 cases of COVID-19 (interquartile range 76,776-164,576) in mainland China as of 29 February 2020.

In August 2021, we published a systematic review and meta-analysis about the accuracy of Ag-RDTs. We now update this work and analyze the factors influencing test sensitivity in further detail. Methods and findings We registered the review on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020225140). We systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, medRvix, bioRvix, and FIND) for publications evaluating the accuracy of Ag-RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 until August 31, 2021. Descriptive analyses of all studies were performed, and when more than 4 studies were available, a random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing as a reference. To evaluate factors influencing test sensitivity, we performed 3 different analyses using multivariate mixed-effects meta-regression models. We included 194 studies with 221,878 Ag-RDTs performed. Overall, the pooled estimates of Ag-RDT sensitivity and specificity were 72.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69.8 to 74.2) and 98.9% (95% CI 98.6 to 99.1), respectively. When manufacturer instructions were followed, sensitivity increased to 76.4% (95%CI 73.8 to 78.8). Sensitivity was markedly better on samples with lower RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values (sensitivity of 97.9% [95% CI 96.9 to 98.9] and 90.6% [95% CI 88.3 to 93.0] for Ct-values <20 and <25, compared to 54.4% [95% CI 47.3 to 61.5] and 18.7% [95% CI 13.9 to 23.4] for Ct-values []25 and []30) and was estimated to increase by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI 1.7 to 4.0) for every unit decrease in mean Ct-value when adjusting for testing procedure and patients symptom status. Concordantly, we found the mean Ct-value to be lower for true positive (22.2 [95% CI 21.5 to 22.8]) compared to false negative (30.4 [95% CI 29.7 to 31.1]) results. Testing in the first week from symptom onset resulted in substantially higher sensitivity (81.9% [95% CI 77.7 to 85.5]) compared to testing after 1 week (51.8%, 95% CI 41.5 to 61.9). Similarly, sensitivity was higher in symptomatic (76.2% [95% CI 73.3 to 78.9]) compared to asymptomatic (56.8% [95% CI 50.9 to 62.4]) persons. However, both effects were mainly driven by the Ct-value of the sample. With regards to sample type, highest sensitivity was found for nasopharyngeal (NP) and combined NP/oropharyngeal samples (70.8% [95% CI 68.3 to 73.2]), as well as in anterior nasal/mid-turbinate samples (77.3% [95% CI 73.0 to 81.0]). Conclusion Ag-RDTs detect most of the individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and almost all when high viral loads are present (>90%). With viral load, as estimated by Ct-value, being the most influential factor on their sensitivity, they are especially useful to detect persons with high viral load who are most likely to transmit the virus. To further quantify the effects of other factors influencing test sensitivity, standardization of clinical accuracy studies and access to patient level Ct-values and duration of symptoms are needed.","output":"Accuracy of rapid point-of-care antigen-based diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis with meta regression analyzing influencing factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In single-access surgery, instruments enter the abdominal cavity through only 1 incision, the position of the instruments relative to each other is different compared with that in conventional laparoscopy.

As a result, it is increasingly important to study host-pathogen interactions within the context of their ecology and evolution. The dilution effect is the concept that higher biodiversity decreases pathogen transmission. It has been observed especially in zoonotic vector-borne pathosystems, yet evidence against it has been found. In particular, it is still debated how the community (dis)assembly assumptions and the degree of generalism of vectors and pathogens affect the direction of the biodiversity-pathogen transmission relationship. The aim of this study was to use empirical data and mechanistic models to investigate dilution mechanisms in two rodent-tick-pathogen systems differing in their vector degree of generalism. A community was assembled to include ecological interactions that expand from purely additive to purely substitutive. Such systems are excellent candidates to analyze the link between vector ecology, community (dis)assembly dynamics, and pathogen transmission. To base our mechanistic models on empirical data, rodent live-trapping, including tick sampling, was conducted in Wales across two seasons for three consecutive years. We have developed a deterministic single-vector, multi-host compartmental model that includes ecological relationships with non-host species, uniquely integrating theoretical and observational approaches. To describe pathogen transmission across a gradient of community diversity, the model was populated with parameters describing five different scenarios differing in ecological complexity; each based around one of the pathosystems: Ixodes ricinus (generalist tick) - Borrelia burgdorferi and I. trianguliceps (small mammals specialist tick) - Babesia microti. The results suggested that community composition and inter-specific dynamics affected pathogen transmission with different dilution outcomes depending on the vector degree of generalism. The model provides evidence that dilution and amplification effects are not mutually exclusive in the same community, but depend on vector ecology and the epidemiological output considered (i.e. the \\"risk\\" of interest). In our scenarios, more functionally diverse communities resulted in fewer infectious rodents, supporting the dilution effect. In the pathosystem with generalist vector we identified a hump shaped relationship between diversity and infections in hosts, while for that characterized by specialist tick, this relationship was more complex and more dependent upon specific parameter values.","output":"An eco-epidemiological modeling approach to investigate dilution effect in two different tick-borne pathosystems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood cell detection in microscopic images is an essential branch of medical image processing research.

This object detector is called TE-YOLOF, Tiny and Efficient YOLOF, and it is a One-Stage detector using dilated encoder to extract information from single-level feature maps. For increasing efficiency and flexibility, the EfficientNet Convolutional Neural Network is utilized as the backbone for the proposed object detector. Furthermore, the Depthwise Separable Convolution is applied to enhance the performance and minimize the parameters of the network. In addition, the Mish activation function is employed to increase the precision. Extensive experiments on the BCCD dataset prove the effectiveness of the proposed model, which is more efficient than other existing studies for blood cell detection.","output":"TE-YOLOF: Tiny and efficient YOLOF for blood cell detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At-risk users are people who experience elevated digital security, privacy, and safety threats because of what they do, who they are, where they are, or who they are with. In this systematization work, we present a framework for reasoning about at-risk users based on a wide-ranging meta-analysis of 85 papers. Across the varied populations that we examined (e.g., children, activists, women in developing regions), we identified 10 unifying contextual risk factors--such as oppression or stigmatization and access to a sensitive resource--which augment or amplify digital-safety threats and their resulting harms. We also identified technical and non-technical practices that at-risk users adopt to attempt to protect themselves from digital-safety threats. We use this framework to discuss barriers that limit at-risk users' ability or willingness to take protective actions. We believe that the security, privacy, and human-computer interaction research and practitioner communities can use our framework to identify and shape research investments to benefit at-risk users, and to guide technology design to better support at-risk users.","output":"SoK: A Framework for Unifying At-Risk User Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Mortality is high in Coronavirus disease 2019 patients with pre-existing comorbidities and advanced age. Associated complications have added to the negative prognosis. Nevertheless, many have fully recovered, even among the most fragile. Factors associated with their survival was investigated. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients aged 90 years admitted for COVID-19 to the Internal Medicine wards of two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. RESULTS: Among 34 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 33 (97.1%) had respiratory failure. Eighteen patients (52.9%) survived and 16 (47.1%) died during hospital stay. Survivors compared to deceased had a significantly longer hospitalization (19 vs. 10 days respectively; p = 0.02), a better PaO2:FiO2 ratio (241 vs. 171 respectively; p = 0.003), higher lymphocyte counts (p = 0.01) and lower serum LDH levels (p < 0.001) at admission. At multivariate analysis only higher PaO2:FiO2 was associated with survival (OR 1.06 [95%CI 1.0C1.03]; p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant difference in event-free survival between patients treated or not with LMWH (p < 0.0001) and between those treated or not with beta-blockers (p = 0.008). Cox regression, performed in the subgroup of patients who received LMWH, did not show significant difference for sex (HR 2.7 [95% CI 0.53C14.3], p = 0.23), CCI (HR 0.7 [95% CI 0.37C1.45], p = 0.38), PaO2:FiO2 ratio (HR 0.98 [95% CI 0.97C1.0], p = 0.07), corticosteroid therapy (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.22C4.5], p = 0.99) and beta-blocker therapy (HR 2.8 [95% CI 0.56C14,7], p = 0.21).

The cost of top-dressing agents is accounted for 20% of the production cost and therefore, the development of top-dressing automation technology is important to maintain and improve the financial and environmental viability of shrimp sustainable farming. This perspective described several sensor-based aquaculture technologies for on-farm management systems but sustainability in the aquaculture industry is not yet achieved in practice. The present technology is a new invention to reduce labor and production costs required for reducing bacterial and organic loads in Biofloc shrimp cultures. Aquaculture automation system disperses the top-dressing agents to the shrimp ponds based on the signals received from microbial and environmental sensors.

Given the large number of patients affected, healthcare personnel and facility resources are stretched to the limit; however, the need for urgent and emergent neurosurgical care continues. This article describes best practices when performing neurosurgical procedures on patients with COVID-19 based on multi-institutional experiences. METHODS: We assembled neurosurgical practitioners from 13 different health systems from across the USA, including those in hot spots, to describe their practices in managing neurosurgical emergencies within the COVID-19 environment. RESULTS: Patients presenting with neurosurgical emergencies should be considered as persons under investigation (PUI) and thus maximal personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned during interaction and transfer. Intubations and extubations should be done with only anesthesia staff donning maximal PPE in a negative pressure environment. Operating room (OR) staff should enter the room once the air has been cleared of particulate matter. Certain OR suites should be designated as covid ORs, thus allowing for all neurosurgical cases on covid/PUI patients to be performed in these rooms, which will require a terminal clean post procedure. Each COVID OR suite should be attached to an anteroom which is a negative pressure room with a HEPA filter, thus allowing for donning and doffing of PPE without risking contamination of clean areas. CONCLUSION: Based on a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we describe best practices when providing neurosurgical treatment for patients with COVID-19 in order to optimize clinical care and minimize the exposure of patients and staff.","output":"Minimizing SARS-CoV-2 exposure when performing surgical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using nine Demographic and Health Surveys for the three West African countries affected by the 2013?16 Ebola epidemic, this study applies a district-level interrupted time series (ITS) design to explore the longer-term impacts of the epidemic on school attendance.

Hence, the species composition of seafood can be complicated. While a DNA-based approach has been routinely utilized for species identification, a large scale of seafood identification in fish markets and restaurants could be challenging (e.g., elevated cost and time-consuming only for a limited number of species identification). In the present study, we aimed to identify the majority of fish species potentially consumed in fish markets and nearby seafood restaurants using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. Four eDNA samplings from a local fish market and nearby seafood restaurants were conducted using Sterivex cartridges. Nineteen universal primers previously validated for fish species identification were utilized to amplify the fragments of mitochondrial DNA (12S, COI, ND5) of species in eDNA samples and sequenced with NovaSeq 6000 sequencing.

Coronaviruses have developed a variety of mechanisms to repress host mRNA translation to allow the translation of viral mRNA, and concomitantly block the cellular innate immune response2,3. Although several different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have previously been implicated in shutting off host expression4-7, a comprehensive picture of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cellular gene expression is lacking. Here we combine RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and metabolic labelling of newly synthesized RNA to comprehensively define the mechanisms that are used by SARS-CoV-2 to shut off cellular protein synthesis. We show that infection leads to a global reduction in translation, but that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated. Instead, we find that infection leads to the accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs, which facilitates viral takeover of the mRNA pool in infected cells. We reveal that the translation of transcripts that are induced in response to infection (including innate immune genes) is impaired. We demonstrate this impairment is probably mediated by inhibition of nuclear mRNA export, which prevents newly transcribed cellular mRNA from accessing ribosomes. Overall, our results uncover a multipronged strategy that is used by SARS-CoV-2 to take over the translation machinery and to suppress host defences.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 uses a multipronged strategy to impede host protein synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emerging problem of the antibiotic resistance development and the consequences that the health, food and other sectors face stimulate researchers to find safe and effective alternative methods to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and biofilm formation. One of the most promising and efficient groups of materials known for robust antimicrobial performance is noble metal nanoparticles. Notably, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been already widely investigated and applied as antimicrobial agents. However, it has been proposed to create synergistic composites, because pathogens can find their way to develop resistance against metal nanophases; therefore, it could be important to strengthen and secure their antipathogen potency. These complex materials are comprised of individual components with intrinsic antimicrobial action against a wide range of pathogens. One part consists of inorganic AgNPs, and the other, of active organic molecules with pronounced germicidal effects: both phases complement each other, and the effect might just be the sum of the individual effects, or it can be reinforced by the simultaneous application. Many organic molecules have been proposed as potential candidates and successfully united with inorganic counterparts: polysaccharides, with chitosan being the most used component; phenols and organic acids; and peptides and other agents of animal and synthetic origin. In this review, we overview the available literature and critically discuss the findings, including the mechanisms of action, efficacy and application of the silver-based synergistic antimicrobial composites.

At risk groups including diabetic and obese patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19-related complications and poor outcomes. Substantial evidence points to hypovitaminosis D as a risk factor for severe disease, the need for ICU, and mortality. 1,25(OH)D, a key regulator of calcium homeostasis, is believed to have various immune-regulatory roles including; promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines, down regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, dampening entry and replication of SARS-COV-2, and the production of antimicrobial peptides. In addition, there are strong connections which suggest that dysregulated 1,25(OH)D levels play a mechanistic and pathophysiologic role in several disease processes that are shared with COVID-19 including: diabetes, obesity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, and even hypercoagulable states. With evidence continuing to grow for the case that low vitamin D status is a risk factor for COVID-19 disease and poor outcomes, there is a need now to address the public health efforts set in place to minimize infection, such as lock down orders, which may have inadvertently increased hypovitaminosis D in the general population and those already at risk (elderly, obese, and disabled). Moreover, there is a need to address the implications of this evidence and how we may apply the use of cheaply available supplementation, which has yet to overcome the near global concern of hypovitaminosis D.

However, the mechanism and function of the mammalian RNA interference (RNAi) response are poorly understood. Here, we characterized antiviral RNAi in a mouse model of infection with Nodamura virus (NoV), a mosquito-transmissible positive-strand RNA virus encoding a known double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR), the B2 protein. We show that inhibition of NoV RNA replication by antiviral RNAi in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) requires Dicer-dependent vsiRNA biogenesis and Argonaute-2 slicer activity. We found that VSR-B2 of NoV enhances viral RNA replication in wild-type but not RNAi-defective MEFs such as Argonaute-2 catalytic-dead MEFs and Dicer or Argonaute-2 knockout MEFs, indicating that VSR-B2 acts mainly by suppressing antiviral RNAi in the differentiated murine cells. Consistently, VSR-B2 expression in MEFs has no detectable effect on the induction of interferon-stimulated genes or the activation of global RNA cleavages by RNase L. Moreover, we demonstrate that NoV infection of adult mice induces production of abundant vsiRNA active to guide RNA slicing by Argonaute-2. Notably, VSR-B2 suppresses the biogenesis of both vsiRNA and the slicing-competent vsiRNA-Argonaute-2 complex without detectable inhibition of Argonaute-2 slicing guided by endogenous microRNA, which dramatically enhances viral load and promotes lethal NoV infection in adult mice either intact or defective in the signaling by type I, II, and III interferons. Together, our findings suggest that the mouse RNAi response confers essential protective antiviral immunity in both the presence and absence of the interferon response.IMPORTANCE Innate immune sensing of viral nucleic acids in mammals triggers potent antiviral responses regulated by interferons known to antagonize the induction of RNA interference (RNAi) by synthetic long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Here, we show that Nodamura virus (NoV) infection in adult mice activates processing of the viral dsRNA replicative intermediates into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) active to guide RNA slicing by Argonaute-2. Genetic studies demonstrate that NoV RNA replication in mouse embryonic fibroblasts is inhibited by the RNAi pathway and enhanced by the B2 viral RNAi suppressor only in RNAi-competent cells. When B2 is rendered nonexpressing or nonfunctional, the resulting mutant viruses become nonpathogenic and are cleared in adult mice either intact or defective in the signaling by type I, II, and III interferons.

The culprit is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, which invades cells by binding to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). While the majority of patients mount an appropriate antiviral response and recover at home, others progress to respiratory distress requiring hospital admission for supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, deterioration to acute respiratory distress syndrome necessitating mechanical ventilation, development of severe thrombotic events, or cardiac injury and dysfunction occurs. In this review, we highlight what is known to date about COVID-19 and cardiovascular risk, focusing in on the putative role of the endothelium in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. Approach and Results: Cytokine-driven vascular leak in the lung alveolar-endothelial interface facilitates acute lung injury in the setting of viral infection. Given that the virus affects multiple organs, including the heart, it likely gains access into systemic circulation by infecting or passing from the respiratory epithelium to the endothelium for viral dissemination. Indeed, cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 are highly prevalent and include acute cardiac injury, myocarditis, and a hypercoagulable state, all of which may be influenced by altered endothelial function. Notably, the disease course is worse in individuals with preexisting comorbidities that involve endothelial dysfunction and may be linked to elevated ACE2 expression, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly emerging data on COVID-19, together with results from studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1, are providing insight into how endothelial dysfunction may contribute to the pandemic that is paralyzing the globe. This may, in turn, inform the design of biomarkers predictive of disease course, as well as therapeutics targeting pathogenic endothelial responses.","output":"Overcoming Barriers: The Endothelium As a Linchpin of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pathogenesis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an unprecedented implementation of lockdown measures across world's nations.

Most of the existing methods learn network embedding based on distributional similarity hypothesis while ignoring adjacency similarity property, which may cause distance bias problem in the network embedding space. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework to encode distributional similarity and measure adjacency similarity simultaneously, named DDNE. The proposed DDNE trains a siamese neural network which learns a set of non-linear transforms to project the node pairs into the same low-dimensional space based on their first-order proximity. Meanwhile, a distance constraint is used to make the distance between a pair of adjacent nodes smaller than a threshold and that of each non-adjacent nodes larger than the same threshold, which highlight the adjacency similarity. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets in three social network analysis tasks, including network reconstruction, attribute prediction and recommendation.

We carried out all surveys in ~5 km-transects in a sample of eight urban and eight rural parishes (16 transects total). In 2018, we used the capture-recapture method to estimate absolute population size and 95% CI. We began transect surveys at 04 h 00 (local time) and identified individuals with photographs. The main limitations of this method were errors in identifying individuals, since photographs were not always clear, partly due to low light conditions during the surveys.

This allowed an in-depth validation and assay performance analysis of these platforms. More importantly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were stable or even increased within the observation period, which contradicts earlier studies reporting a rapid waning of Ab titers after three to four months.

Women who were identified at elevated risk (FHS-7 scores 1) were asked by the mammography technician prior to performing the screening mammogram for their permission to be contacted by a high-risk counselor for a formal high-risk assessment and potential genetic counseling/testing. In March 2020, nearly all cancer screening services shut down with the COVID-19 pandemic. Services re-opened in June 2020. We report on our experience in three-time frames: September 2019-February 2020;March 2020-May 2020, and June 2020-present. Results: From September 2019-February 2020: 3, 169 mammograms and FHS-7 screenings were performed. 44 had scores 1 (1.4%). 4 (9%) agreed to be contacted for an appointment with a high-risk counselor. Of these, 2 had previously met with genetics. No additional appointments were scheduled. From March 2020-May 2020, 576 mammograms and FHS-7 screenings were performed. 9 had scores 1 (1.6%). None agreed to be contacted for an appointment with a high-risk counselor. Two appointments had previously been completed. From June 2020-June 2021, 9, 131 mammogramsand FHS-7 screenings were performed. 240 had scores 1 (2.6%). 22 (9%) agreed to be contacted for an appointment with genetics. 11 appointments had previously been completed. 8 (73%) were completed as a consequence of this direct outreach. Conclusion: Although our work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, screening for hereditary risk at the time of mammography may be an effective way of facilitating referrals for genetic counseling/testing for high-risk patients. Consent to be contacted for a formal high-risk assessment was consistent at 9% pre-mammography closure and post-mammography re-opening. Consent to be contacted for genetics is likely to be associated with breast cancer risk perception. Future Directions: We are planning an educational intervention regarding the FSH-7 risk assessment tool and a positive score's association with the risk of hereditary breast cancer syndromes, as well as the benefits of optimized screening techniques depending on a patient's life-time risk of developing breast cancer. We anticipate that this will likely result in greater acceptance of a formal high-risk assessment for this at-risk population.","output":"Screening for genetic risk at the time of mammography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The GENCODE project annotates human and mouse genes and transcripts supported by experimental data with high accuracy, providing a foundational resource that supports genome biology and clinical genomics GENCODE annotation processes make use of primary data and bioinformatic tools and analysis generated both within the consortium and externally to support the creation of transcript structures and the determination of their function Here, we present improvements to our annotation infrastructure, bioinformatics tools, and analysis, and the advances they support in the annotation of the human and mouse genomes including: the completion of first pass manual annotation for the mouse reference genome;targeted improvements to the annotation of genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection;collaborative projects to achieve convergence across reference annotation databases for the annotation of human and mouse protein-coding genes;and the first GENCODE manually supervised automated annotation of lncRNAs Our annotation is accessible via Ensembl, the UCSC Genome Browser and https://www gencodegenes org","output":"Gencode 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Electronic measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) may facilitate timely and regular assessments in routine clinical practice. This study evaluated the validity and psychometric properties of an electronic version of the EQ-5D-5L (e-EQ-5D-5L) in Chinese patients with chronic knee and/or back problems. METHODS: 151 Chinese subjects completed an electronic version of the Chinese (Hong Kong) EQ-5D-5L when they attended a primary care or orthopedics specialist out-patient clinic in Hong Kong. They also completed the Chinese Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a Pain Rating Scale, and a structured questionnaire on socio-demographics, co-morbidities and health service utilization. 32 subjects repeated the e-EQ-5D-5L two weeks after the baseline. 102 subjects completed e-EQ-5D-5L and 99 completed the Global Rating on Change Scale at three-month clinic follow up. Construct validity was assessed by the association of EQ-5D-5L scores with external criterion of WOMAC scores. We tested mean differences of WOMAC scores between adjacent response levels of the EQ-5D-5L dimensions by one-way ANOVA, testCretest reliability by intra-class correlation, sensitivity by known group comparisons and responsiveness by changes in EQ-5D-5L scores over 3 months. RESULTS: There was an association between EQ-5D-5L and WOMAC scores. Mean WOMAC scores increased with the increase in adjacent response levels of EQ-5D-5L dimensions. TestCretest intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of EQ-5D-5L utility and EQ-VAS scores were 0.76 and 0.83, respectively, indicating good reliability. There were significant differences in the proportions reporting limitations in the EQ-5D-5L dimensions, the utility and VAS scores between the mild and severe pain groups (utility = 0.28, p = 0.001; VAS = 11.46, p < 0.001), and between primary care and specialist out-patient clinic patients (utility = 0.15, p = 0.001; VAS = 10.21, p < 0.001), supporting sensitivity.

The present study aimed to validate the Spanish version of the CERQ in students of the University of Granada (Spain) during the Covid-19 homebound. An online scale was developed and applied based on the Spanish version of the CERQ-S36, consisting of 36 items structured around nine cognitive strategies. Using a mixed sampling, the scale was applied to 450 students from different degree programmes. Regarding the psychometric results of the scale, firstly, in relation to reliability as internal consistency, we found that the scale applied to University students in a Covid-19 setting is highly stable. Secondly, in reference to concurrent criterion validity, we can conclude that the items individually measure the same as the total scale (taken as internal criterion), and thirdly and finally, in relation to construct validation, the two factor analyses implemented, one exploratory and the other confirmatory in nature, conform a factor structure of latent dimensions identical to the original one. In conclusion, the results obtained as a whole suggest that the CERQ-S36 scale could be useful for assessing cognitive coping in University populations in times of crisis. In situations such as the current global emergency due to the presence of Covid-19, the scale is useful for understanding emotional regulation strategies.

Other than contact tracing, genome sequencing provides information to help infer who infected whom. However, the effectiveness of the genomic approach in this context depends on both (high enough) mutation and (low enough) transmission rates. Today, the level of resolution that we can obtain when describing SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks using just genomic information alone remains unclear. In order to answer this question, we sequenced 49 SARS-CoV-2 patient samples from ten local clusters for which partial epidemiological information was available, and inferred transmission history using genomic variants. Importantly, we obtained high-quality genomic data, sequencing each sample twice and using unique barcodes to exclude cross-sample contamination. Phylogenetic and cluster analyses showed that consensus genomes were generally sufficient to discriminate among independent transmission clusters. However, levels of intrahost variation were low, which prevented in most cases the unambiguous identification of direct transmission events. After filtering out recurrent variants across clusters, the genomic data were generally compatible with the epidemiological information but did not support specific transmission events over possible alternatives. We estimated the effective transmission bottleneck size to be 1-2 viral particles for sample pairs whose donor-recipient relationship was likely. Our analyses suggest that intrahost genomic variation in SARS-CoV-2 might be generally limited and that homoplasy and recurrent errors complicate identifying shared intrahost variants. Reliable reconstruction of direct SARS-CoV-2 transmission based solely on genomic data seems hindered by a slow mutation rate, potential convergent events, and technical artifacts. Detailed contact tracing seems essential in most cases to study SARS-CoV-2 transmission at high resolution.","output":"Limited genomic reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission history within local epidemiological clusters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM/OBJECTIVE/INTRODUCTION: Cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is inevitable in severe and critically ill patients with novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). This review aimed to discuss current therapeutic options for the management of CRS in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Cytokine storm is caused by the colossal release of proinflammatory cytokines [e.g., IL (interleukin)-2, IL-6, IL-8 TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-, etc.] causing dysregulated, hyperimmune response. This immunopathogenesis leads to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Targeting cytokine storm with the therapies that are already available in India with the support of published guidelines and consensus can assist in achieving a better outcome in COVID-19. REVIEW RESULTS: We predominantly included published guidelines or consensus recommendations about the management of cytokine storm in COVID-19. From the existing literature evidence, it is observed that among the currently available agents, low-dose corticosteroids and heparin can be beneficial in managing cytokine storm. The use of serine protease inhibitors such as ulinastatin has been advised by some experts. Though therapies such as high-dose vitamin C and interleukin-6 inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab) have been advised, the evidence regarding their use for cytokine storm in COVID-19 is limited. Therapies such as Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK) inhibitors and Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1) antagonists are still in research. Besides, pharmaceutical treatments, use of blood purification strategies, and convalescent plasma may be life-saving options in some of the critically ill COVID-19 patients. For these therapies, there is a need to generate further evidence to substantiate their use in CRS management. CONCLUSION: Current management of COVID-19 is preventive and supportive. Different therapies can be used to prevent and treat the cytokine storm. More research is needed for further supporting the use of these treatments in COVID-19.

This study aims to examine the rearrangement of service provision at community pharmacies through the prism of social practice theory. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews. METHODS: In total, 21 community pharmacists, 3 hospital pharmacists and 10 experts in Estonia were interviewed. For data analysis, two-dimensional thematic textual analysis was performed according to four types of practices proposed in social practice theory and based on temporal distinction. RESULTS: The findings of this study reveal that, in order to maintain and improve community pharmacy service provision during the pandemic, there have been changes to all aspects of practice elements, including practical understandings, rules and teleological structures. The majority of challenges were experienced because of necessary changes to the habitual ways of providing pharmacy services, indicating resistance to these changes and reinforcing the need to continue existing practice-bundles. Limited access to healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in community pharmacists becoming the primary (and only) accessible healthcare contact; thus, leading to a shift in awareness about the role of pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: Although large-scale changes may result in the dissolvement of practice-bundles and require readiness to adjust current methods of service provision, dissolution is a gradual process. There is an urgent need to support pharmacists in managing the challenges of rearranging service provision, such as immediate organisational changes, lack of information and changing resources.","output":"A qualitative study of the challenges in rearranging community pharmacy service provision during the COVID-19 public health emergency: the prism of social practice theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To improve the detection and molecular identification of infectious bronchitis virus (avian coronavirus), two reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were developed. As diagnostic PCR, a set of consensus nested primers was selected from highly conserved stretches of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. As phylogeny PCR, a fragment of the spike protein gene (S1) was amplified and the PCR products were directly sequenced. To study the phylogenetic relationships of the viruses from various outbreaks, studies of molecular epizootiology were performed in Sweden, a Nordic region, where the occurrence of natural cases of the disease is relatively low and the occasional use of live vaccine(s) is well recorded and monitored. The disease appeared in the region in 1994, associated with production problems among layers of various ages. During outbreaks in 1995 and 1997, both layers and broilers were affected. To reduce losses, a live attenuated vaccine has been applied since 1997. By examining 12 cases between 1994 and 1998, molecular epizootiology revealed that, before 1997, the viruses had gene sequences very similar to strains of the Massachusetts serotype. However, comparative sequence analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the identity was not 100% to any of the strains of this serotype that we analysed. A virus related to the Dutch-type strain, D274, was also identified on one farm. Surprisingly, from 1997, the year that vaccination commenced with a live Massachusetts serotype vaccine, the majority of viruses detected had S1 sequences identical to the live Massachusetts vaccine strain. This genetic relation to the vaccine virus was also confirmed by N gene sequence analysis. The studies of molecular epizootiology reveal a strong probability that the vaccination had lead to the spread of the vaccine virus, causing various disease manifestations and a confusing epizootiological situation in the poultry population.","output":"Molecular epizootiology of infectious bronchitis virus in Sweden indicating the involvement of a vaccine strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to rigorously review the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in defined hematology oncology settings including (1) the setting of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) settings (2) at 5 mg and 10 mg doses, and (3) for response rates for use in the acute, delayed, and overall settings post-MEC and HEC. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through April 23, 2020. The primary efficacy endpoints were the rate of complete response, in the acute (0C24 h post-chemotherapy), delayed (24C120 h post-chemotherapy), and overall (0C120 h post-chemotherapy) phases. The secondary efficacy endpoints were the rates of no nausea and no emesis, for each phase. Safety endpoints were the rate of no serious adverse events (i.e., no grade 3 or 4 toxicities), as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. The Mantel-Haenszel, random-effects analysis model was used to compute risk ratios and accompanying 95% confidence intervals for each endpoint. For endpoints that statistically favored one arm, absolute risk differences were computed to assess whether there is a 10% or greater difference, used as the threshold for clinical significance by MASCC/ESMO. Fragility indices were also calculated for each statistically significant endpoint, to quantitatively assess the robustness of the summary estimate. A cumulative meta-analysis was conducted for each efficacy meta-analysis with more than 5 studies, also using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects analysis model. RESULTS: Three studies reported on olanzapine for the rescue of breakthrough chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV); 22 studies reported on olanzapine in the prophylactic setting. For studies reporting on HEC patients, olanzapine-containing regimens were statistically and clinically superior in seven of nine efficacy endpoints in the prophylaxis setting. When olanzapine is administered at a 10-mg dose, it is statistically and clinically superior to control patients in eight of nine endpoints among adults. Olanzapine may be effective in the MEC setting and when administered at 5-mg doses, but the paucity of data leads to notable uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Further RCTs are needed in the setting of MEC patients and administration of olanzapine at a lower 5-mg dose, which may be given to reduce the sedative effect of olanzapine at 10 mg.

This dynamic calcium sensitivity for fusion is found to be higher in Alpha and Beta variants and highest in Delta spike variant. We find that efficient fusion is dependent on Ca(2+) concentration at low pH, and the fusion activity of spike dropped as the Ca(2+) level rose beyond physiological levels.

METHODS: Serological and T-cell ELISpot assays were used to assess the response to first-dose and second-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (with either BNT162b2 mRNA or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines) in 140 participants receiving immunosuppression for autoimmune rheumatic and glomerular diseases. RESULTS: Following first-dose vaccine, 28.6% (34/119) of infection-na?ve participants seroconverted and 26.0% (13/50) had detectable T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. Immune responses were augmented by second-dose vaccine, increasing seroconversion and T-cell response rates to 59.3% (54/91) and 82.6% (38/46), respectively. B-cell depletion at the time of vaccination was associated with failure to seroconvert, and tacrolimus therapy was associated with diminished T-cell responses. Reassuringly, only 8.7% of infection-na?ve patients had neither antibody nor T-cell responses detected following second-dose vaccine. In patients with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (19/140), all mounted high-titre antibody responses after first-dose vaccine, regardless of immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are immunogenic in patients receiving immunosuppression, when assessed by a combination of serology and cell-based assays, although the response is impaired compared with healthy individuals. B-cell depletion following rituximab impairs serological responses, but T-cell responses are preserved in this group.

At BTHFT we benefited with all GP practices in the region using TPP SystmOne (S1) for medical records. We describe how we used S1 to help identify high risk patients under our care. Methods We did not appreciate the full extent we could use S1 to identify patients in our initial shielding identification process. As such, we reviewed notes of patients on biologic prescriptions and SC MTX from Homecare prescription lists. To capture patients on high dose prednisolone, we identified patients with a recent diagnosis of GCA and patients with recent prescriptions of > 20mg prednisolone through pharmacy records. On recognising the ability of S1 to identify patients that had glucocorticoid exposure through primary care and/or on cDMARDS we used S1 reporting mechanisms to identify these patients. Clinical record sharing enabled BTHFTs rheumatology department to access S1 for all patients under their care. S1s clinical reporting function was used to search for patients within at least one of the following cohorts before being combined in a single cohort of at risk patients (heart, lung or kidney disease, 70 years, diabetes or hypertension [including pulmonary artery hypertension]). Reports were created for patients on any DMARD issued within primary care within the previous 12 weeks. High dose steroid use was more challenging to demonstrate, but a report was devised to include all patients with an issued prescription for prednisolone 5mg tablets within the preceding 8 weeks (for any reason). An additional report was created for patients with a rheumatological diagnosis co-existing with an interstitial lung disease. Using S1's report joining function, the different drugs and at risk cohorts were combined to provide an accurate list of patients with features increasing their vulnerability to COVID-19. This list was easily modifiable and searches were re-run to update lists once inclusion on the shielding list was updated. Results Patients meeting the criteria for shielding were then advised in writing including signposting to BTHFTs rheumatology website and helpline for further information if required. By searching for all prednisolone prescriptions, this would have included patients given prednisolone for other reasons. 5mg tablet strength ensured patients on low dose were excluded, but we recognise some patients were likely over-recruited into this cohort. Conclusion We can update our searching methods to easily include patients on biologics and SC MTX by some additional bulk coding in preparation for future shielding specifications thereby bypassing the need to review individual notes for patients.

Accordingly, the current study evaluated community belongingness as a predictor of treatment change for anxiety and depression in a university counseling center. Method: Participants included 516 young adults with clinical levels of anxiety or depression who attended at least two individual therapy sessions at a university counseling center during fall 2020. Participants completed broad measures of psychosocial functioning at each session. Results: Paired-samples t-tests indicated that students demonstrated significant decreases in anxiety and depression after just one session.

However, it also implied that many patients were not screened and therefore had no accurate diagnosis. In this study, we carried out a population-based SARS-CoV-2 screening in Mexico to evaluate the COVID-19-related symptoms and their weighting in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss this data in the context of the operational definition of suspected cases of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus. Materials and Methods: One thousand two hundred seventy-nine subjects were included. They were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. The weighting of COVID-19 symptoms in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated statistically. Results: Three hundred and twenty-five patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 954 were negative. Fever, asthenia, dysgeusia, and oxygen saturation predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratios ranged from 1.74 to 4.98; p < 0.05). The percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 36% and only 38.15% met the Mexican operational definition. Cq-values for the gene N of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly higher in asymptomatic subjects than in the groups of COVID-19 patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Dysgeusia, fever, and asthenia increased the odds of a positive result for COVID-19 1.74-4.98-fold among the study population. Patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations had higher viral loads at COVID-19 diagnosis than those observed in asymptomatic patients. A high percentage of the participants in the study (61.85%) did not meet the operational definition for a suspected case of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus, representing a high percentage of the population that could have remained without a COVID-19 diagnosis, so becoming a potential source of virus spread.","output":"Population-Based COVID-19 Screening in Mexico: Assessment of Symptoms and Their Weighting in Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainable development is an effort to balance social progress with environmental equilibrium and economic growth. Young people affected by forced displacement are particularly vulnerable to the economic, environmental and social challenges of their surroundings. Using a framework that centres sustainable development on these three interconnected pillars, this article explores how the economic and environmental contexts in Lebanon impact adolescents and youth social development, drawing on qualitative data from adolescents in refugee and host community settings. The article highlights that adolescents face economic challenges because of the national economic crisis, exacerbated by COVID-19 lockdowns and service closures, poor labour market opportunities for youthand for refugees in particularand rising living costs. The environmental challenges facing adolescents include inadequate shelter (especially in collective shelters and informal tented shelters) and inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities. These economic and environmental conditions in turn influence adolescents social capabilities such as their physical and mental health, and voice and agency. The article concludes by highlighting the need for a more integrated approach to sustainable development that will allow both present and future generations in Lebanon to meet their own needs and live empowered lives. It outlines measures that could help achieve this approach, including: creating policies and programmes that promote investment in technical and soft skills-building to equip young people with the skills they need to take up jobs within the green economy;investing in adolescent-friendly social protection with linkages to environmental projects;and improved shelter, health and WASH facilities, particularly in response to the ongoing and future impacts of climate change. ? 2022 by the authors.

The aim of this study was to compare general anesthesia (GA) and monitored anesthetic care (MAC) with dexmedetomidine based on intraoperative vital signs, comfort of patients, surgeons and nurses and the adverse effects after closed reduction of nasal bone fractures. METHODS Sixty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II were divided into a GA group (n = 30) or MAC group (n = 30). Standard monitorings were applied. In the GA group, general anesthesia was carried out with propofol-sevoflurane-N2O. In the MAC group, dexmedetomidine and local anesthetics were administered for sedation and analgesia. Intraoperative vital signs, postoperative pain scores by visual analog scale and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were compared between the groups. RESULTS Intraoperatively, systolic blood pressures were significantly higher, and heart rates were lower in the MAC group compared to the GA group. There were no differences between the groups in the patient, nurse and surgeon's satisfaction, postoperative pain scores and incidence of PONV. CONCLUSIONS MAC with dexmedetomidine resulted in comparable satisfaction in the patients, nurses and surgeons compared to general anesthesia. The incidence of postoperative adverse effects and severity of postoperative pain were also similar between the two groups. Therefore, both anesthetic techniques can be used during the reduction of nasal bone fractures based on a patient%s preference and medical condition.","output":"General anesthesia versus monitored anesthetic care with dexmedetomidine for closed reduction of nasal bone fracture."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunomodulation of mast cell (MC) activity is warranted in allergic and inflammatory diseases where MCs have a central role in pathogenesis.

Here, we evaluate the intracellular signaling pathways of Siglec-8-mediated inhibition in primary MCs using an anti-Siglec-8 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Phospho-proteomic profiling of FcRI-activated MCs revealed Siglec-8 mAb-treatment globally inhibited proximal and downstream kinases, leading to attenuated MC activation and degranulation. In fact, Siglec-8 was found to directly interact with FcRI signaling molecules. Siglec-8 inhibition was dependent on both cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that interact with the SH2 containing protein phosphatase Shp-2 upon Siglec-8 phosphorylation. Taken together, these data support a model in which Siglec-8 regulates proximal FcRI-induced phosphorylation events through phosphatase recruitment and interaction with FcRI, resulting in global inhibition of MCs upon Siglec-8 mAb engagement.","output":"The Inhibitory Receptor Siglec-8 Interacts With FcRI and Globally Inhibits Intracellular Signaling in Primary Mast Cells Upon Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Precision health, by means of the support of precision medicine and precision nursing, is able to support clinical decision making in order to tailor optimal health-care decisions, around the individual characteristics of patients.

According to the clinical classification criteria, they were divided into severe group (46 cases) and non-severe (137cases). T lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte subpopulation, IL-6 levels, and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. Compared with the non-severe group, the lymphocyte count, T lymphocyte count, T lymphocyte percentage, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte percentage, CD8+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte percentage were lower in the severe group (p &lt; 0.05). Compared with the non-severe group, IL-6 were higher in the severe group (p &lt; 0.05). Compared with admission, the T lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count were significantly increased upon discharge in severe patients, non-severe patients and all patients. Multivariate Logsitic regression analysis showed CD4+ T lymphocyte count (OR ?0.011;95% CI ?0.041 to ?0.001;p = 0.011), CD8+ T lymphocyte count (OR ?0.14;95% CI ?0.048 to ?0.003;p = 0.013) were closely correlated with the clinical severity in patients of COVID-19. Multivariate Logsitic regression analysis also showed CD4+ T lymphocyte count (OR ?0.012;95% CI ?3.177 to 0.261;p = 0.021), CD8+ T lymphocyte count (OR ?0.019;95% CI ?5.852 to 0.115;p = 0.004) were independent predictors of disease progressing to the composite endpoint. Subgroup analysis for critically ill patients: The T lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count remained low in the death patients. The T lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count recovered soon in the discharged patients. In the event of COVID-19 infection, the T-lymphoid system is the primary activated immune system. The T lymphocytes, CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes continued to be low may be significantly related to the deterioration of the disease, and may indicate a poor prognosis.

The frequency of pneumothorax in SARS-CoV2 was reported in 0.95% of hospitalized patients in 6% of mechanically ventilated patients, and in 1% of a post-mortem case series. OBJECTIVES: Aim of our retrospective study was to investigate the incidence of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum (PNX/PNM) in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia patients treated with Helmet CPAP. Moreover, we examined the correlation between PNX/PNM and Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values. METHODS: We collected data from patients admitted to Luigi Sacco University Hospital of Milan from 2 February to 5 May 2020 with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia requiring CPAP. Patients, who need NIV with bi-level pressure or endotracheal intubation (ETI) for any reason except those who needed ETI after PNX/PNM, were excluded. Population was divided in two groups according to PEEP level used (10 cmH2O and >10 cmH20). RESULTS: 154 patients were enrolled. In the overall population, 42 patients (27%) were treated with High-PEEP (>10 cmH2O), and 112 with Low-PEEP (10 cmH2O). During hospitalization 3 PNX and 2 PNM occurred (3.2%). Out of these five patients, 2 needed invasive ventilation after PNX and died. All the PNX/PNM occurred in the High-PEEP group (5/37 vs 0/112, p<0,001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of PNX appears to be lower in SARS-CoV2 than SARS and MERS. Considering the association of PNX/PNM with high PEEP we suggest using the lower PEEP as possible to prevent these complications.","output":"Correlation between continuous Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values and occurrence of Pneumothorax and Pneumomediastinum in SARS-CoV2 patients during non-invasive ventilation with Helmet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Der Ausbruch der Corona-Epidemie Ende 2019 in Wuhan und die weltweiten Folgen der Pandemie haben die chinesische Fhrung politisch massiv unter Druck gesetzt.

In this paper, a novel Wasserstein metric-based data-driven distributionally robust mean-absolute deviation (DR-MAD) model is proposed. However, the proposed model is non-convex with an infinite-dimensional inner problem. To solve this model, we prove that it can be transformed into two simple finite-dimensional linear programs. Consequently, the problem can be solved as easily as solving the classic MAD model. Furthermore, the proposed DR-MAD model is compared with the 1/N, classic MAD and mean-variance model on S &P 500 constituent stocks in six different settings. The experimental results show that the portfolios constructed by DR-MAD model are superior to the benchmarks in terms of profitability and stability in most fluctuating markets.

Design: We evaluated 2,731 non-T2D participants recruited between 2008-2013 in the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study, China. T2D cases were identified with clinical and biochemical information collected at follow-up visits. Using stool samples collected during the follow-up in the subset (n=1,591), 16S rRNA profiling was conducted. Using multivariable-adjusted Poisson or linear regression, we examined associations of erythrocyte n-6 PUFA biomarkers with incident T2D, and diversity and composition of gut microbiota. Results: Over 6.2 years of follow-up, 276 T2D cases were identified (risk=0.10). Higher levels of erythrocyte {gamma}-linolenic acid (GLA), but not linoleic or arachidonic acid, were associated with higher T2D incidence. Comparing the top to the bottom quartile groups of GLA levels, relative risk was 1.72 (95% confidence intervals: 1.21, 2.44) adjusted for potential confounders. Baseline GLA was inversely associated with gut microbial richness and diversity (-diversity, both p<0.05) during follow-up, and significantly associated with microbiota {beta}-diversity (p=0.002). Seven genera ( Butyrivibrio, Blautia, Oscillospira, Odoribacter, S24-7 other, Rikenellaceae other, and Clostridiales other) were enriched in quartile 1 of GLA, and in participants without T2D.

In Indonesia, one of the most rapidly urbanizing regions in the world, the national government issues overall policy on the pandemic. However, implementation is often contingent on local governments. Many policies aim to stem the spread of infection by controlling people's mobility or regulating their daily activities. Urban agglomerations are a strategic site of investigation in this light, because they consist of interconnected communities governed by various levels and jurisdictions. This paper analyzes the effects of policy interventions relative to confirmed cases in the seven major urban agglomerations in Indonesia (totaling 30 municipal/district governments). Data were collected from confirmed and fatality trends from March to mid-October 2020, which were contrasted with corresponding policies for each jurisdiction. By sorting the indicators of the spread of the pandemic and its corresponding control measures, we reach conclusions about which dimensions served to curb or trigger the surge of COVID-19 clusters. The analysis unsurprisingly shows that within each agglomeration, the main cities continue to represent the highest number of confirmed cases despite variations between them. This study also highlights two key findings. First, the effectiveness of distancing measures depends considerably on the capacity of governments to implement restrictions. For example, budget limitations resulted in uneven implementation of national mandates by decentralized authority. Facilities and services at different locations also influence our understanding of disease transmission. Second, people's ability and willingness to engage with a policy regime is contingent upon personal values or economic constraints. The study shows that viewing the spatial distribution of COVID-19 at the scale of urban agglomerations helps to explain key aspects of transmission and policy, pointing to recommendations about pursuing certain protocols. Nevertheless, key challenges remain to meet the full potential of this analytical approach, due to relatively low levels of testing and inadequate data collection measures in Indonesia.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 restriction measures in Indonesia: A comparative spatial and policy analysis of selected urban agglomerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Affective biases can influence how past events are recalled from memory. However, the mechanisms underlying how discrete affective events shape memory formation and subsequent recall are not well understood. Further understanding this is important given the central role of negative biases in affective memory recall in depression and antidepressant drug action. In order to capture cognitive processes associated with affective memory formation and recall, we studied value-based decision-making between affective memories in two within-subject experiments (n=45 and n=74). Our findings suggest that discrete affective events, created by large magnitude Wheel of Fortune (WoF) outcomes, influence affective memory formation processes during reinforcement-learning (RL). After 24 hours, we show that healthy volunteers display stable preferences during value-based recall of affective memories in a binary decision-making task. Computational modelling of these preferences demonstrated a positive bias during value-based recall, induced by previously winning in the WoF. We further showed that value-based decision-making between affective memories engages the pupil-linked central arousal systems, leading to pupil constriction prior to, and differential pupil dilation after the decision onset depending on the valence of the chosen options. Taken together, we demonstrate that mechanisms underlying human affective memory systems can be described by RL and probability weighting models.

Our laboratory has developed the lead EPICC molecule, PA-dPEG24 (also known as RLS-0071), which is composed of a 15 amino acid peptide with a C-terminal monodisperse 24-mer PEGylated moiety. RLS-0071 has been demonstrated to possess other mechanisms of action in addition to complement blockade that include the inhibition of neutrophil-driven myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, inhibition of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation as well as intrinsic antioxidant activity mediated by vicinal cysteine residues contained within the peptide sequence. RLS-0071 has been tested in various ex vivo and in vivo systems and has shown promise for the treatment of both immune-mediated hematological diseases where alterations in the classical complement pathway plays an important pathogenic role as well as in models of tissue-based diseases such as acute lung injury and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy driven by both complement and neutrophil-mediated pathways (i.e., MPO activity and NET formation). Next generation EPICC peptides containing a sarcosine residue substitution in various positions within the peptide sequence possess aqueous solubility in the absence of PEGylation and demonstrate enhanced complement and neutrophil inhibitory activity compared to RLS-0071.

A strong association is well documented between antipsychotic use and the risk of stroke in schizophrenia although the magnitude of this association has yet to be studied in PwID.PwID have an increased risk of premature death. Cardio-metabolic monitoring and appropriate intervention to this vulnerable cohort will improve the preventable cardio-metabolic multi-morbidity. The NICE guideline (CG11) recommends antipsychotic medication should only be initially prescribed and monitored by the secondary care professionals for at least 12 months. They also should work together with primary care to ensure appropriate interventions are arranged where necessary.MethodA retrospective audit was performed for 40 service users, taking antipsychotic medication.

The analysis was restricted to cases with specimens collected through sentinel surveillance. Using a Cox proportional hazards model with mixed effects, we estimated hazard ratios (HR) for hospitalization risk following infection with a variant, adjusting for age, sex, calendar week, and vaccination. FINDINGS: 58,848 cases were sequenced through sentinel surveillance, of which 1705 (2.9%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Higher hospitalization risk was found for infections with Gamma (HR 3.20, 95%CI 2.40-4.26), Beta (HR 2.85, 95%CI 1.56-5.23), Delta (HR 2.28 95%CI 1.56-3.34) or Alpha (HR 1.64, 95%CI 1.29-2.07) compared to infections with ancestral lineages; Omicron (HR 0.92, 95%CI 0.56-1.52) showed no significant difference in risk.

Parents see the results of genetic talent testing as offering an advantage for their children when combined with the intensive parenting strategy of precision education. Drawing on the sociology of testing, I argue how genetic talent testing in China is a product of broader concerns about population quality and can potentially reshape how parents imagine quality children through the theory of multiple intelligences.

Considering the demand of remote health care changes, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to investigate the feasibility of e-Health care within one of the most performed surgery procedures: inguinal hernia repair. METHODS: A total of 60 patients used the e-Health application in this study compliant. Primary objectives were to investigate the accuracy of the deviating post-operative course alerting by the e-Health application. Secondary objectives included patient perspective and e-Health costs analysis. RESULTS: Forty-four patients reported no deviation in the post-operative course using the e-Health application of which 93.2% (n = 41) was in concordance with the findings during standard follow-up. Within 16 patients reporting a deviating post-operative course, a true complication was found in 25% (n = 4). Based on in-hospital costs, a hypothetical e-Health follow-up scenario was more expensive (59.5 per patient) than current standard follow-up care (28.2 per patient). Usage of the e-Health application showed a high perceived overall patient satisfaction: 4.2 (on a Likert-scale of 1C5). CONCLUSION: An e-Health application is a promising tool for identifying patients who require in-person or phone follow-up assessment. Patients perspectives surveys revealed high potential and willingness of using this application. A hypothetical e-Health follow-up scenario showed to be more expensive compared to current standard follow-up. If the identified (dis)advantages can be improved, e-Health follow-up care appears to be promising in terms of safety and feasibility. Future studies can leverage on this study and further investigate the use of e-Health within the field of general surgery.","output":"Using an E-Health Application for Post-operative Monitoring After Inguinal Hernia Repair: A Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many viruses, including coronaviruses, induce host translational shutoff, while maintaining synthesis of their own gene products.

These recommendations are coherent to avoid the spread of SARSCoV-2 infection, but are in contradiction with comprehensive diabetes care, which requires regular patient-provider interactions for patient education, prescriptions and possible management of complications or mental health. Moreover, confinement drives risk for unhealthy diets, decreased physical activity, mental health related concerns, in parallel to delayed care-seeking due to fear of contracting COVID-19. Another weakness in the current COVID-19 response is the focus on hospital care which overlooks the importance of Primary Care in guaranteeing continuity of care.

People usually use social media, especially Twitter, to transfer knowledge and beliefs on global concerns like COVID-19-vaccination, hence, Twitter is a good source for investigating public opinions. The present study aimed to assess Persian tweets to (1) analyze Iranian people's view toward COVID-19 vaccination. (2) Compare Iranian views toward a homegrown and imported COVID-19-vaccines. METHODS: First, a total of 803278 Persian tweets were retrieved from Twitter, mentioning COVIran Barekat (the homegrown vaccine), Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Moderna, and Sinopharm (imported vaccines) between April 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021. Then, we identified sentiments of retrieved tweets using a deep learning sentiment analysis model based on CNN-LSTM architecture. Finally, we investigated Iranian views toward COVID-19-vaccination. RESULTS: (1) We found a subtle difference in the number of positive sentiments toward the homegrown and foreign vaccines, and the latter had the dominant positive polarity. (2) The negative sentiment regarding homegrown and imported vaccines seems to be increasing in some months. (3) We also observed no significant differences between the percentage of overall positive and negative opinions toward vaccination amongst Iranian people. CONCLUSIONS: It is worrisome that the negative sentiment toward homegrown and imported vaccines increases in Iran in some months.

The World Health Organisation formulated the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control with the aim of controlling tobacco production and consumption. Most of the countries on the continent of Africa were also the target of the framework given the high importation and use of tobacco products. The main aim of this study was to find out the current status of tobacco control policies and their effectiveness in Africa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was a systematic literature review that was conducted between the months of August and November 2020 by extracting data from the databases of PubMed, Elsevier Scopus and Web of Science. Only English articles were culled from the retrieved papers. Out of the 910 papers retrieved, only 17 papers from African countries were selected on the quality synthesis after meeting the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that three governance resources were identified of regulatory (64.70%, N=11) which had smoke-free environment, advertisement bans, and cessation programs, economics (29.41%, N=5) which were taxation measures and informative (5.886%, N=1) which were mass media campaigns. Furthermore, Western African countries especially South Africa reported many pronouncements on smoke-free environment and taxation measures. Mass media campaigns proved to be more effective policies as compared to others. CONCLUSION: This study recommends that the future research should be done on the effectiveness of mixed policy instruments as compared to single application.

METHODS: Forty-five women with term pregnancies with confirmed non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (case group), and 96 SARS-CoV-2 negative women in identical conditions (control group) were approached, using consecutive sample. Weekly (1st to 5th week postpartum) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal swabs (cases) and breastmilk (cases and controls) were obtained. Concentration of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in breastmilk (cases and controls) were determined at 1st and 5th week post-partum.

We also observed a significant change in the transcript levels of immune-related genes, namely complement component 3a, galectin 2b, ubiquitin specific peptidase 21, and aquaporins. Nevertheless, we did not observe any significant response at the cellular level, since there were no differences between neutrophil migration or proliferation between control and yeast-exposed GF larvae.

Infection with PRRSV leads to reproductive complications, respiratory illness, and weak immunity to secondary infections. To better control PRRSV infection, novel approaches for generating control measures are critically needed. Here, in vitro Gibson assembly (GA) of viral genomic cDNA fragments was tested for its use as a quick and simple method to recover infectious PRRSV in cell culture. GA involves the activities of T5-exonuclease, Phusion polymerase, and Taq ligase to join overlapping cDNA fragments in an isothermal condition. Four overlapping cDNA fragments covering the entire PRRSV genome and one vector fragment were used to create a plasmid capable of expressing the PRRSV genome. The assembled product was used to transfect a co-culture of 293T and MARC-145 cells. Supernatants from the transfected cells were then passaged onto MARC-145 cells to rescue infectious virus particles. Verification and characterization of the recovered virus confirmed that the GA protocol generated infectious PRRSV that had similar characteristics to the parental virus. This approach was then tested for the generation of a chimeric virus. By replacing one of the four genomic fragments with that of another virus strain, a chimeric virus was successfully recovered via GA. In conclusion, this study describes for the first time the use of GA as a simple, yet powerful tool for generating infectious PRRSV needed for studying PRRSV biology and developing novel vaccines.","output":"Generation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by in vitro assembly of viral genomic cDNA fragments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Besides the principal respiratory symptoms, the COVID-19 has been associated with an important array of dermatological manifestations.

PATIENT CONCERNS: In all of Yichang city from January 20, 2020, to April 9, 2020, only 2 pregnant women, who were in the late stage of pregnancy, were diagnosed with COVID-19; one patient was admitted for fever with limb asthenia, and the other patient was admitted for abnormal chest computed tomography results. DIAGNOSES: Both pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: After the medical staff prepared for isolation and protection, the 2 pregnant women quickly underwent cesarean sections. A series of tests, such as laboratory, imaging, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid examinations, were performed on the 2 women with COVID-19 and their newborns. OUTCOMES: One of the 2 infected pregnant women had severe COVID-19, and the other had mild disease. Both babies were delivered by cesarean section. Both of the women with COVID-19 worsened 3 to 6 days after delivery. Chest computed tomography suggested that the lesions due to SARS-CoV-2 infection increased. These women began to exhibit fever or reduced blood oxygen saturation again. One of the 2 newborns was born prematurely, and the other was born at full term. Neither infant was infected with COVID-19, but both had increased prothrombin time and fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphocreatine kinase, and creatine kinase isoenzyme contents.

In this sense, this study performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of face-to-face and remote university classes in a Higher Education institution in the context of COVID-19. Inputs of energy and materials (food, office materials), outputs (air and water emissions, and solid waste) were gathered in situ for the functional unit of 2 hours of face-to-face or virtual class per week for 60 engineering students.

In the literature, most papers about the environmental management of educational activities focus on the energy efficiency of buildings and electronic equipment during their use. But this study revealed other environmental hotspots primarily associated with meal consumption followed by ethanol fuel use. Meal consumption patterns can be explained by the fact that people usually eat more often during home-office activities. Otherwise, the transportation impacts due to ethanol use are related mainly to face-to-face classes, as much transport is required such as for food supply and student transportation. Finally, an uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis were designed for the LCA conclusions.

AIM: The study aims to validate the content of an algorithm for the assessment, management and monitoring of drug-induced QTc prolongation in the psychiatric population. METHODOLOGY: Qualitative semi-structured interviews of cardiologists, to gather information regarding their approach in assessing the risk of drug-induced QTc prolongation at the time of prescribing. After the interview, an orientation to the algorithm was provided with a link to a cross-sectional, anonymous survey. The online survey included quantitative and qualitative components to gather feedback on the relevance and appropriateness of each step in the algorithm. RESULTS: Interview responses were incorporated into 4 themes. Responses indicated a lack of a unified protocol when assessing QTcI prolongation, which supports the need of an algorithm that includes a verified risk scoring tool. Quantitative survey results showed a mean score ranging from 3.08 to 3.67 out of 4 for the appropriateness of the algorithms steps, 3.08 to 3.58 for the safety and 3.17 to 3.75 for the reliability of references used.

Because adequate cerebral blood flow was apparently maintained through collateral flow, we ligated the innominate, right carotid, and subclavian arteries. We confirmed adequate blood flow to the brain and the right subclavian artery through collateral circulation after ligation using computed tomographic angiography. A damage control management, which involves ligating the injured innominate artery to arrest hemorrhage and monitoring regional forehead saturation for brain ischemia, can be a considerable procedure for the treatment of severe hemorrhagic shock due to innominate artery injury.","output":"Damage control management of innominate artery injury with tracheostomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surveillance testing for infectious disease is an important tool to combat disease transmission at the population level. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, RT-PCR tests have been considered the gold standard due to their high sensitivity and specificity. However, RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to return positive results when performed to individuals who are past the infectious stage of the disease. Meanwhile, antigen-based tests are often treated as a less accurate substitute for RT-PCR, however, new evidence suggests they may better reflect infectiousness. Consequently, the two test types may each be most optimally deployed in different settings. Here, we present an epidemiological model with surveillance testing and coordinated isolation in two congregate living settings (a nursing home and a university dormitory system) that considers test metrics with respect to viral culture, a proxy for infectiousness. Simulations show that antigen-based surveillance testing coupled with isolation greatly reduces disease burden and carries a lower economic cost than RT-PCR-based strategies. Antigen and RT-PCR tests perform different functions toward the goal of reducing infectious disease burden and should be used accordingly.","output":"Comparison of antigen- and RT-PCR-based testing strategies for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in two high-exposure settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The data of COVID-19 disease in China and then in South Korea were collected daily from several different official websites. The collected data included 33 death cases in Wuhan city of Hubei province during early outbreak as well as confirmed cases and death toll in some specific regions, which were chosen as representatives from the perspective of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Data were copied and pasted onto Excel spreadsheets to perform data analysis. A new methodology, Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA) [1], has been adapted to process the data and used to estimate the death rate of COVID-19 in real-time. Assumption is that the number of days from inpatients to death fall into a pattern of normal distribution and the scores in normal distribution can be obtained by observing 33 death cases and analysing the data [2]. We selected 5 scores in normal distribution of these durations as lagging days, which will be used in the following estimation of death rate. We calculated each death rate on accumulative confirmed cases with each lagging day from the current data and then weighted every death rate with its corresponding possibility to obtain the total death rate on each day. While the trendline of these death rate curves meet the curve of current ratio between accumulative death cases and confirmed cases at some points in the near future, we considered that these intersections are within the range of real death rates. Six tables were presented to illustrate the PIBA method using data from China and South Korea.

Critical to the rapid evaluation of vaccines and antivirals is the development of tractable animal models of infection. The use of common laboratory strains of mice to this end is hindered by significant divergence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, we designed and utilized an mRNA-based transfection system to induce expression of the hACE2 receptor in order to confer entry of SARS-CoV-2 in otherwise non-permissive cells. By employing this expression system in an in vivo setting, we were able to interrogate the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in type 1 interferon receptor deficient mice. In doing so, we showed that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced when hACE2 is expressed during infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that these responses are preserved in memory and are boosted upon secondary infection. Interestingly, we did not observe an enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses with hACE2 induction. Importantly, using this system, we functionally identified the CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes targeted during SARS-CoV-2 infection in H2b restricted mice. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice of this MHC haplotype primarily target peptides of the spike and membrane proteins, while the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells target peptides of the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins. The functional identification of these T cell epitopes will be critical for evaluation of vaccine efficacy in murine models of SARS-CoV-2. The use of this tractable expression system has the potential to be used in other instances of emerging infections in which the rapid development of an animal model is hindered by a lack of host susceptibility factors.","output":"mRNA induced expression of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in mice for the study of the adaptive immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims This systematic review aims to discuss the extent to which the measures undertaken to control the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries have affected those with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). The coronavirus pandemic is still raging on in many countries and its effects will still be felt years from now and previous studies have shown that it has impacted other mental illnesses. AN cases are on the rise and the nature of the illness has deadly consequences, therefore it is paramount to discuss the relationship between the COVID-19 measures and symptomatology of AN to ensure appropriate services are in place to deal with potential outcomes. Method Systematic search of the PubMed database gave thirty-three total results with seven of these used in this review. These studies met the inclusion criteria;examples include primary studies and use of the English Language. The exclusion criteria involved literature reviews, studies with less than ten participants and studies not separating AN from other eating disorders. Result Many studies were cross sectional in nature except two longitudinal studies. Anorexic symptomology increased in the majority of papers in this review. Specifically restricting intake has increased compared to before lockdown measures. Physical activity has varied on an individual level in most studies potentially due to compensatory behaviours. Co-morbid psychopathologies were also noted during these studies. There are many factors behind these changes such as food insecurity, the effect of media and social media, uncertainty and the lack of social interaction. A number of participants across the studies were dissatisfied with treatment services during lockdowns. Variability in study results may be due to the differences in measures between countries and the use of self-reported cases compared to those contacted through care services. Limitations of this review are largely due to the how current the topic is and recommendations for the future include reviewing new studies that are published and to review the situation once the full impact of COVID-19 is known. Conclusion Patients with AN have struggled more due to the COVID-19 measures and the true effect of the pandemic is yet to be felt. Further studies and reviews should be conducted. The appropriate services should be put into place to ensure patients are supported effectively.","output":"To what extent does the COVID-19 pandemic impact patients with anorexia nervosa?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen La coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) ha generado la mayor crisis de salud pblica de la era moderna Se considera que el estado protrombtico inducido por la infeccin tiene una relacin directa y de importancia sustancial con el da?o agudo en el pulmn y con las complicaciones de la infeccin, incluida la muerte Esta revisin de alcance (scoping review) resume y evala crticamente la evidencia sobre la relacin entre la trombosis y el COVID-19, y se basa en una bsqueda bibliogrfica sistemtica de todos los artculos publicados hasta el 5 de mayo de 2020 e incluidos en las bases de datos PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane y Clinicaltrials gov Hemos incluido 26 artculos en la revisin, y hemos evaluado su calidad empleando la gua STROBE Los principales sntomas que presentan los pacientes diagnosticados de COVID-19 son disnea, fiebre, tos, diarrea y vmitos A nivel analtico destaca, en esta enfermedad, un aumento de Dmero-D, fibringeno, tiempo de protrombina y linfopenia En cuanto a las pruebas radiolgicas, las tcnicas ms usadas para el diagnstico de tromboembolismo pulmonar, trombosis venosa profunda y otros fenmenos trombticos;fueron la ecografa y la tomografa computarizada Como conclusin, en la actualidad existe escasa evidencia cientfica con respecto a la COVID-19 y sus complicaciones trombticas Esta revisin resume este cuerpo de evidencia, evala su calidad, y ofrece conclusiones que orientan los siguientes pasos a dar en este rea de investigacin de enorme relevancia y crecimiento exponencial Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has triggered the worst public health crisis of modern times The prothrombotic state induced by the infection is considered directly and substantially related to acute lung damage and other medical complications, including death This scoping review summarises and critically assesses the existing evidence on the association between thrombosis and COVID-19, and is based on a systematic literature search of all articles published up to 5 May 2020 included in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials gov A total of 25 articles were included, and their quality evaluated using STROBE guidelines The main symptoms presented by patients that had been diagnosed with COVID-19 are dyspnoea, fever, cough, diarrhoea, and vomiting In the laboratory findings, it is characteristic to observe an increase in D-Dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, and lymphopenia Ultrasound and computed axial tomography were the radiological techniques most used for diagnosing pulmonary thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, and other thrombotic phenomena In conclusion, there is still limited scientific evidence on COVID-19 and its thrombotic complications This review summarises the body of evidence, assesses its quality, and offers conclusions that should help in the next steps in this highly relevant and expanding research area","output":"Trombosis y COVID-19: revisin de alcance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What is the social, emotional, and academic impact of attending school remotely rather than in person?

The total computed tomography (CT) score, a quantitative score based on assessment of the number, quadrant, and area of the lesions in CT, tended to perform better than assessment based only on the number or area of the lesions (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0887, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the total CT score, chest tightness, lymphocyte, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent factors for severe COVID-19. For patients admitted in 2 weeks from onset to hospitalization, the frequency of severe COVID-19 was gradually increased with the delayed hospitalization. The symptoms of fatigue, dry cough, sputum production, chest tightness, and polypnea were gradually more frequent. The levels of C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ?3-glutamyl transpeptidase, LDH, and d-dimer were also gradually increased, as well as the scores based on CT.

We aimed to identify the predictive value of NP RVP\\\\PCR samples compared with samples obtained from BAL in immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates. METHODS: We conducted an observational retrospective study of immunosuppressed adults who underwent bronchoscopy in the Pulmonary Department at the University of Rochester Medical Center between January 2011 and June 2016. We compared the positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity and false negative rate of NP RVP\\\\PCR and BAL RVP\\\\PCR, as well as identified clinical predictors of positive viral BAL RVP\\\\PCR. RESULTS: Eighty\\\\nine immunosuppressed patients had both NP and bronchoalveolar RVP\\\\PCR testing. Twenty\\\\one patients had NP(+)BAL(+) RVP\\\\PCR testing.

Moreover, this study aimed to discuss the possible pathobiological mechanisms of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19. Methods: Available articles from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and preprint databases (MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and Researchsquare) were searched on November 10th, 2020. Data on the characteristics of the study (anosmia, dysgeusia, and COVID-19) were extracted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. NewcastleCOttawa scale was used to assess research quality. Moreover, the pooled prevalence of anosmia and dysgeusia were calculated, and the association between anosmia and dysgeusia in presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was assessed using the Z test. Results: Out of 32,142 COVID-19 patients from 107 studies, anosmia was reported in 12,038 patients with a prevalence of 38.2% (95% CI: 36.5%, 47.2%); whereas, dysgeusia was reported in 11,337 patients out of 30,901 COVID-19 patients from 101 studies, with prevalence of 36.6% (95% CI: 35.2%, 45.2%), worldwide. Furthermore, the prevalence of anosmia was 10.2-fold higher (OR: 10.21; 95% CI: 6.53, 15.96, p < 0.001) and that of dysgeusia was 8.6-fold higher (OR: 8.61; 95% CI: 5.26, 14.11, p < 0.001) in COVID-19 patients compared to those with other respiratory infections or COVID-19 like illness.

However, the effect of hypertension on outcomes of COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Research Question: The aim of this study was to explore the effect of hypertension on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by using propensity scoreCmatching (PSM) analysis. Study Design and Methods: Participants enrolled in this study were patients with COVID-19 who had been hospitalized at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Chronic comorbidities and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed;patient outcomes and lengths of stay were obtained from discharge records. We used the Cox proportional-hazard model (CPHM) to analyze the effect of hypertension on these patients outcomes and PSM analysis to further validate the abovementioned effect. Results: : A total of 226 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, of whom 176 survived and 50 died. The proportion of patients with hypertension among non-survivors was higher than that among survivors (26.70% vs. 74.00%;P < 0.001). Results obtained via CPHM showed that hypertension could increase risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients (hazard ratio 3.317;95% CI [1.709C6.440];P < 0.001). Increased D-dimer levels and higher ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (N/L) were also found to increase these patients mortality risk. After matching on propensity score, we still came to similar conclusions.

In this report, the newly developed antibody detection assays ACCEL ELISA COVID-19 (ACCEL) and Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys) were evaluated. METHODS Serum samples submitted for routine laboratory testing were analyzed (66 and 161 PCR-positive and PCR-negative samples). After the samples were aliquoted, antibody detection tests were performed using ACCEL and Elecsys assays. RESULTS When detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR was set as the reference method for diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity was 83.3% and 75.8, and the specificity was 96.9 and 99.4% in ACCEL and Elecsys, respectively.

This project has evaluated if the schedule of LC screening or procedures has been interrupted /delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An international survey evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice and clinical trials from March 2020 to June 2020, as the first phase of a multicentre, international and observational project. The focus was on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, cared for around the world during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. RESULTS: Ninety-one centres expressed interest to participate and 76 were included in the analysis, from Europe, South America, North America, Asia and Africa (73.7%, 17.1%, 5.3%, 2.6% and 1.3% per continent, respectively). Eighty-seven per cent of the centres modified their clinical practice: 40.8% the diagnostic procedures, 80.9% the screening program, 50% cancelled curative and/or palliative treatments for LC, and 44.0% cancelled the liver transplantation program. Forty-five out 69 (65.2%) centres in which clinical trials were running modified their treatments in that setting, but 58.1% were able to recruit new patients. The phone call service was modified in 51.4% of centres which had this service prior to COVID-19 pandemic (n=19/37). CONCLUSION: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a tremendous impact on the routine care of patients with LC. Modifications in screening, diagnostic and treatment algorithms may have significantly impaired the outcome of patients. Ongoing data collection and future analyses will report the benefits and disadvantages of the strategies implemented, aiding future decision making.","output":"Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on liver cancer management (CERO-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Male sterility represents an important trait for hybrid breeding and seed production in crops. Although the genes required for male fertility have been widely studied and characterized in many plant species, most of them are single genic male-sterility (GMS) genes. To investigate the role of multiple homologous genes in anther and pollen developments of maize, we established the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing method to simultaneously mutate the homologs in several putative GMS gene families. By using the integrated strategies of multi-gene editing vectors, maize genetic transformation, mutation-site analysis of T0 and F1 plants, and genotyping and phenotyping of F2 progenies, we further confirmed gene functions of every member in ZmTGA9-1/-2/-3 family, and identified the functions of ZmDFR1, ZmDFR2, ZmACOS5-1, and ZmACOS5-2 in controlling maize male fertility. Single and double homozygous gene mutants of ZmTGA9-1/-2/-3 did not affect anther and pollen development, while triple homozygous gene mutant resulted in complete male sterility. Two single-gene mutants of ZmDFR1/2 displayed partial male sterility, but the double-gene mutant showed complete male sterility. Additionally, only the ZmACOS5-2 single gene was required for anther and pollen development, while ZmACOS5-1 had no effect on male fertility. Our results show that the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system is a highly efficient and convenient tool for identifying multiple homologous GMS genes. These findings enrich GMS genes and mutant resources for breeding of maize GMS lines and promote deep understanding of the gene family underlying pollen development and male fertility in maize.","output":"Use of CRISPR/Cas9-Based Gene Editing to Simultaneously Mutate Multiple Homologous Genes Required for Pollen Development and Male Fertility in Maize"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: News media has recently been replete with stories of anti-Asian rhetoric and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Empirical literature, however, has yet to systematically analyze and document these experiences and their impact. Our study aimed to examine this phenomenon by analyzing news media coverage published between December 31, 2019-June 30, 2020 on COVID-related anti-Asian incidents. METHOD: We utilized a phenomenological approach to conduct qualitative content analysis of 84 media articles reporting on coronavirus related anti-Asian incidents. We also present the emerging psychological framework of race-based stress and trauma to conceptualize the psychological impact of these race-based incidents reported in the media. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed five primary themes: (a) pathologizing cultural practices; (b) alien in one's own land; (c) invalidation of interethnic differences; (d) ascription of diseased status; and (e) duality of frontline hero and virus carrier. We provide examples for each of these themes. CONCLUSION: These themes document stigmatizing narratives and demonstrate the phenomenology of race-based stress and trauma experienced by Asian individuals during the COVID era. We present potential implications for mental health of Asian individuals during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as recommendations for future research.

It became clear that there was significantly above expected deterioration in function and ability in our children with Cerebral Palsy. Whilst there is a desire amongst some within the service to maintain this virtual approach, there is a question as to whether virtual assessment is in fact good enough for the long term care of these young people.We have used the Cerebral Palsy Integrated Pathway (CPIP) UK for 3 years. This is an evidence based tool for hip surveillance and monitoring of contracture/deformity in the lower limbs of children with cerebral palsy. Children and young people are seen at regular intervals dependent on their age and severity of cerebral palsy (based on gross motor functional classification system GMFCS). Joint measurement is colour-coded in a traffic light system where green is no concern, amber suggests an area of concern which may require intervention and red needs action or intervention.ObjectivesTo examine the impact of Covid related operational changes (reduction in face-to-face services) on pre- and post-Covid measurements extracted from CPIP data.MethodsA retrospective study of 97 patients aged 3C20 years (mean=10.33) registered under our Trust CPIP UK Registry. Paired-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were performed using SPSS Software. Statistical significance was indicated at 0.05.ResultsOf the 97 patients, 54 were male. 43 children had hemiplegic cerebral palsy (20 left sided and 23 right sided), 32 were diplegic distribution, and 22 were quadriplegic. The GMFCS score of severity was also recorded: 42 Level I, 25 Level II, 8 Level III, 13 Level IV and 9 Level V.The CPIP database pre- and post-lockdown measurements were compared. A significant difference was found between pre- and post-scores for Knee Popliteal Angle on the Right (t=-2.42, p=0.02). Where the mean score for 90 Children was pre 36.14 and post 39.24 degrees. A significant difference was also found between pre- and post-scores for Knee Popliteal on the Left (t=-2.78, p=0.01). The mean score for 88 children was 36.23 degrees pre and 40.09 post.Also significantly deteriorated was Ankle Dorsiflexion on the Right, (t=2.79, p=0.01), where 85 children showed a mean dorsiflexion to 9.6 degrees above neutral pre and 6.91 post. Ankle Dorsiflexion on the Left also significantly deteriorated (asymptotic sig=0.01). 88 children had a mean pre-value of 7.95 degrees above neutral and 5.47 post.Therefore, hamstrings and gastrocnemius muscle groups showed significant deterioration during lockdown.Of note, 4 children received interventions: 2 had intramuscular Botulinum Toxin injections, 2 had orthopaedic surgery. Children receiving interventions did not deteriorate.ConclusionsThe CPIP database is an excellent resource for comparison studies in cerebral palsy. The children who received interventions seemed to be protected from deterioration. This study demonstrates the importance of face-to-face consultations and interventions in preventing deterioration in children with spastic cerebral palsy.

Specifically, the current research focuses on the effect of experiential purchases on loneliness alleviation to replenish this research stream. Three experiments were conducted to explore the effect of experiential purchases (vs. material purchases) on alleviating loneliness. The results showed that experiential purchases have a stronger effect on loneliness alleviation than material purchases, which is mediated by relationship enhancement. In addition, purchases of social nature moderate the effect of experiential purchases on loneliness. Social experiential purchases lead to a higher degree of relief of loneliness. On the contrary, for the solitary experiential purchases, the effect of experiential purchases on loneliness is less tight.

However, established early warning scores designed to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration were never validated in the obstetric population. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective cohort study sought to evaluate the initial clinical characteristics of pregnant patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and to develop a pregnancy-specific early warning score to identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration and requiring advanced respiratory support. STUDY DESIGN: This was a single center, retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between April 2020 and December 2020. A total of 50 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between April 2020 and November 2020 were used to create the prediction model. Initial clinical characteristics identified at the time of diagnosis were compared between patients who required advanced respiratory support and those who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms for those diagnosed during the period of April 2020 to November 2020. Risk factors associated with a requirement for advanced respiratory support were used to create the Obstetric Warning Score system. The Obstetric Warning Score system was then validated using 30 patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in December 2020. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to evaluate the test characteristics of the Obstetric Warning Score system compared with other scoring systems including the Early Warning Score, the National Early Warning Score 2, and the Maternal Early Warning Criteria. RESULTS: Women who required advanced respiratory support were more likely to present with dyspnea (100% vs 33.3%; P<.001), have a higher heart rate (113.4 beats per minute vs 93 beats per minute; P<.001), respiratory rate (23.5 breaths per minute vs 17.7 breaths per minute; P<.001), temperature (99.1F vs 98.3F; P=.004), and C-reactive protein level (7.4 mg/dL vs 2.4 mg/dL; P<.001). Furthermore, 88.2% of patients requiring advanced respiratory support showed chest x-ray findings consistent with pneumonia, compared with 20.0% of the patients not requiring advanced respiratory support (P<.001). All patients requiring advanced respiratory support presented with at least 1 coronavirus disease 2019 symptom, whereas only 51.5% of patients not requiring advanced respiratory support were symptomatic (P<.001). The Obstetrical Warning Score model allocated 1 point each for a hazard ratio of >100 beats per minute, temperature of >99.0F, C-reactive protein level of >2.0 mg/dL, respiratory rate between 20 and 24 breaths per minute, complaints of dyspnea, and a positive chest x-ray. A respiratory rate of >24 breaths per minute was assigned 2 points. The area under the curve for the Obstetric Warning Score system was 0.97 compared with 0.72 for the Early Warning Score system, 0.92 for the National Early Warning Score 2 system, and 0.85 for the Maternal Early Warning Criteria system. An Obstetric Warning Score of &#8805;3 was predictive of a requirement for advanced respiratory support with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity 64%, and a positive predictive value of 36%.

Thus, there is a need to alleviate the Pb toxicity in plants for good quality food production especially from marginal soils. In this study, the effects of silicon nanoparticles (Si NPs) were investigated on coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) biomass, vitamin C, flavonoid, antioxidant enzyme activities (i.e., catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and super oxide dismutase (SOD)), malondialdehyde (MDA), and Pb concentration in plants subjected to different Pb concentrations. Treatments included four levels of Pb (0, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg of soil), and two levels of Si NPs (0 and 1.5 mM) in all combinations. The Pb treatments alone decreased the plant biomass and vitamin C while increased the flavonoid, MDA, antioxidant enzyme activities, and Pb concentration in tissues depending upon the Pb treatments. The foliar-applied 1.5 mM Si NPs alleviated the adverse impacts of Pb on coriander plants which were due to the minimization of Pb concentration in plants and improvements in the plant defense system. Si NPs minimized accumulation of MDA in plant tissues and adjusted the activities of POD, CAT, and SOD in plants under Pb stress. Overall, Si NP foliar application might be a suitable approach in reducing the Pb concentrations in plants. However, field studies with various plant species and environmental conditions are required to highlight the role of Si NPs on the plant under toxic trace element stress.","output":"Foliar application of silicon nanoparticles affected the growth, vitamin C, flavonoid, and antioxidant enzyme activities of coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) plants grown in lead (Pb)-spiked soil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the role of the world wars in 20th century energy transitions, focusing on the growth of oil as a major energy source which accelerated after the Second World War in North America and Europe.

In order to decrease this morbidity and improve esthetics, other techniques are being developed, such as natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS). It is aimed to review the current status of laparoendoscopic single site surgery in urology. ACQUISITION OF EVIDENCE A nonsystematic review has been carried out by means of the bibliographic search using the terms LESS and Urology from 2007 to 2012. The current LESS experience in urology is described, and its principal indications and the different single site devices and instruments available on the market are described. SYNTHESIS OF EVIDENCE LESS surgery arose as one more step in the constant evolution of minimally invasive surgery in an attempt to improve esthetics, reduce surgical trauma and decrease pain and the post-operative complications associated to the conventional laparoscopy with multiple trocars. Since it was first described in 2007, the experience has been increasing exponentially and the LESS technique, whether assisted or not by robot, is becoming consolidated for a large spectrum of urological indications (both in oncological and reconstructive surgery) on a much greater scale than the NOTES technique. Even though most of the existing data are not randomized and very rarely comparative, with the selection bias that this represents, it seems clear that the esthetic benefit and analgesic control associated to the LESS surgery is real and reproducible. The complications associated to it are greater in cases of major oncology surgery and are due more to the technique itself then to the approach. CONCLUSIONS Although the real benefit of the LESS surgery in urology cannot be appropriately quantified, the cosmetic improvement, less pain and greater patient satisfaction with their wound are clear. Appropriate training in this type of procedures in centers having large volumes and the continuous technical improvements in the instrumental development by the biomedical industry has resulted in the fact that the transumbilical LESS technique in urology has been born to stay.","output":"[Current state of single-port transumbilical surgery in urology: challenges and applications]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous cutaneous side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccines have been described since their clinical approval.

Falsification cohort: parallel cohort receiving elective knee or hip replacement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main cohort: hospital admission, intensive care unit, acute respiratory distress (ARD), ARD syndrome and all-cause mortality. Falsification cohort: complications after surgery and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The main cohort included 236 843 episodes of AVRI contributed by 202 629 unique individuals. Most episodes were in women (58.9%), 81.4% in people with Medicare Advantage and 40.3% in people aged 75+ years. Odds of mortality were lower in the ACEi (0.78 (0.74 to 0.83)) and ARB (0.64 (0.61 to 0.68)) cohorts compared with other HTN medications. On all other outcomes, people taking ARBs (but not ACEis) had a >10% reduction in odds of inpatient stays compared with other HTN medications.In the falsification analysis (N=103 353), both ACEis (0.89 (0.80 to 0.98)) and ARBs (0.82 (0.74 to 0.91)) were associated with decreased odds of complications compared with other HTN medications; ARBs (0.64 (0.47 to 0.87)) but not ACEis (0.79 (0.60 to 1.05)) were associated with lower odds of death compared with other HTN medications.

Since early 2020, the world's nations have faced conundrums over severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections resulting in COVID-19 resulting in national closures, and thus, a clear understandable plan that nations can implement is required to reopen. The healthcare benefits of reopening a nation more likely than not exceed the benefits of continued pandemic-related closure. Pandemic-related closures have resulted in countless delayed or avoided urgent care evaluations. Furthermore, routine care of acute and chronic illnesses, including evaluations, diagnoses, and treatments, has also been delayed. Isolation, loss of income, and fear have resulted in mental health conditions or exacerbated existing conditions. The magnitude of untoward ramifications is unknown and may ultimately represent an inestimable degree of danger and morbidity, and even death. The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has created an atmosphere of fear of COVID-19 that has directly and indirectly injured the world's population. Since this has resulted in increasing morbidity and mortality, creating economic chaos, and near systemic collapse of educational systems with no well described plan forward, it is the purpose of this study to provide guidelines that provide a path forward to safely open a nation. Physicians often equipped by their education, training, and experiences across disciplines are uniquely positioned to comprehend, coordinate, and teach other physicians, business owners, and municipal and government leaders from guidelines. As such, physicians may take the lead in a path forward to reopening a nation, including opening businesses, educational facilities, and religious establishments, while minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: Reviews of the literature among the disciplines of environmental air, sanitation, social interaction, medical testing, vaccination, protection, and disease prevention and safety allowed for the conceptualization and eventual genesis of identifiable interventions which either reduce the viral load in the environment or inactivate the virus from replication. Each of the guidelines was selected based on the principle that it involved the elimination or inactivation of the viral particle. With a reduction in viral load or inactivation of replication, the implementation of these guidelines is expected to allow for reopening a nation with an increased level of safety. Results: The guidelines identified, including air exchange (ventilation), air filtration, personal protective filtering devices (masks), hand hygiene, social distancing, screening and testing, vaccines, high-risk patient protection, medical management, and adjunctive therapies, are described and referenced. Conclusions: In that the pandemic is primarily a public health issue, the path forward is best coordinated by local, regional, and national physicians. Many physicians with a breadth of experiences are uniquely positioned to coordinate the implementation of these interdisciplinary guidelines. Using these guidelines as a planned, coordinated action, not fear, is a path forward.

Here, we analyze 621 bulk RNA sequencing samples and 7,540 consensus sequences from COVID-19 patients, and identify multiple strains of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, in four major clades that are prevalent within and across hosts. In particular, we find evidence for (i) within-host diversity across phylogenetic clades, (ii) putative cases of recombination, multi-strain and/or superinfections as well as (iii) distinct strain profiles across geographical locations and time.

STUDY DESIGN This was a single center, randomized control pilot study of 60 infants <29 weeks' gestation with a high PDAsc (5.0) at 36-48 hours of age receiving either Ibuprofen or Placebo intravenously. The study protocol did not allow for additional PDA therapy within the first two weeks. We reported the rate of consent, open label treatment and PDA closure rates. The primary outcome was chronic lung disease/Death. RESULTS 83 families were approached for enrollment with 73 (88%) providing consent; 13 infants had a PDAsc < 5; of the remaining infants, 30 were assigned Ibuprofen and 30 received placebo. Eight infants received open label treatment in the first two weeks (12%). The overall PDA closure rate after treatment was 57% in the Intervention Group and 17% in the Control Group (p<0.01). There was no difference in the primary clinical outcome (odds ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.3-2.1). CONCLUSION Using a PDA severity score for infant recruitment to a PDA treatment RCT is feasible. There is a high rate of consent and relatively low rate of open label PDA treatment.

We sought to compare the efficacy of different recruitment strategies in an NIH-funded study assessing treatment burden in patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs). METHODS: Targeted mailing, in-person table-based recruitment (tabling) in the waiting room, and telephone calling were used to enroll subjects into one of two studies of treatment burden: a survey study to validate a brief measure of treatment burden for quality assessment (study 1) or a qualitative study to develop a treatment burden clinical communication tool (study 2). RESULTS: Over 50% of subjects in each study were African American or African immigrants. In study 1, the enrollment goal of 200 was reached within 4 months. Tabling enrolled 78.5% of patients, while the remainder (21.5%) were enrolled from phone calls to eligible patients identified through the electronic medical record (EMR). In study 2, 340 eligible patients were identified through the EMR, and 7 (2.1%) were successfully enrolled via mailed invitations and responses. Retention rates (66% in study 1 and 71% in study 2) were reasonable in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Study recruiting goals in our safety net population were rapidly reached using the tabling method, which had substantively higher enrollment rates than mailings or telephone calls based on EMR reports.

METHODS: For this study PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase electronic databases were used to search for eligible studies on the interface between novel coronavirus and vaccine design until December 31, 2020. RESULTS: We have included fourteen non-randomized and randomized controlled phase I-III trials. Implementation of a universal vaccination program with proven safety and efficacy through robust clinical evaluation is the long-term goal for preventing COVID-19. The immunization program must be cost-effective for mass production and accessibility. Despite pioneering techniques for the fast-track development of the vaccine in the current global emergency, mass production and availability of an effective COVID-19 vaccine could take some more time. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a revisiting of the reported solicited and unsolicited systemic adverse events for COVID-19 candidate vaccines.

Formation of a stable binding interface between the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host is pivotal for viral entry. RBD has been shown to mutate frequently during pandemic. Although, a few mutations in RBD exhibit enhanced transmission rates leading to rise of new variants of concern, most RBD mutations show sustained ACE2 binding and virus infectivity. Yet, how all these mutations make the binding interface constantly favourable for virus remain enigmatic. This study aims to delineate molecular rearrangements in the binding interface of SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants. RESULTS: Here, we have generated a mutational and structural landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in first six months of the pandemic. We analyzed 31,403 SARS-CoV-2 genomes randomly across the globe, and identified 444 non-synonymous mutations in RBD that cause 49 distinct amino acid substitutions in contact and non-contact amino acid residues. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested independent emergence of RBD mutants. Structural mapping of these mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan reference strain RBD and structural comparison with RBDs from bat-CoV, SARS-CoV, and pangolin-CoV, all bound to human or mouse ACE2, revealed several changes in the interfacial interactions in all three binding clusters. Interestingly, interactions mediated via N487 residue in cluster-I and Y449, G496, T500, G502 residues in cluster-III remained largely unchanged in all RBD mutants. Further analysis showed that these interactions are evolutionarily conserved in sarbecoviruses which use ACE2 for entry. Importantly, despite extensive changes in the interface, RBD-ACE2 stability and binding affinities were maintained in all the analyzed mutants. Taken together, these findings reveal how SARS-CoV-2 uses its RBD residues to constantly remodel the binding interface. CONCLUSION: Our study broadly signifies understanding virus-host binding interfaces and their alterations during pandemic. Our findings propose a possible interface remodelling mechanism used by SARS-CoV-2 to escape deleterious mutations. Future investigations will focus on functional validation of in-silico findings and on investigating interface remodelling mechanisms across sarbecoviruses. Thus, in long run, this study may provide novel clues to therapeutically target RBD-ACE2 interface for pan-sarbecovirus infections.

In this study, a robot-assisted US-navigation platform has been developed for 3D US guidance and planning of conformal HIFU ablations. The platform was used to evaluate a conformal therapeutic strategy associated with an interstitial dual-mode USgHIFU catheter prototype (64 elements linear-array, measured central frequency f = 6.5 MHz), developed for the treatment of HepatoCellular Carcinoma (HCC). The platform included a 3D navigation environment communicating in real-time with an open research dual-mode US scanner/HIFU generator and a robotic arm, on which the USgHIFU catheter was mounted. 3D US-navigation was evaluated in vitro for guiding and planning conformal HIFU ablations using a tumor-mimic model in porcine liver. Tumor-mimic volumes were then used as targets for evaluating conformal HIFU treatment planning in simulation. Height tumor-mimics (ovoid- or disc-shaped, sizes: 3-29 cm3) were created and visualized in liver using interstitial 2D US imaging. Robot-assisted spatial manipulation of these images and real-time 3D navigation allowed reconstructions of 3D B-mode US images for accurate tumor-mimic volume estimation (relative error: 4  5%). Sectorial and full-revolution HIFU scanning (angular sectors: 88-360) could both result in conformal ablations of the tumor volumes, as soon as their radii remained  24 mm.

SETTING: Private verticalized health care network specialized in the older population. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals hospitalized because of COVID-19. We included 1696 consecutive patients, aged 71.813.0 years old and 56.1% female. Comorbidities were present in 82.3% of the cases (N=1696). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dependence for basic activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) using the Barthel Index and Lawton's Scale. We compared the outcomes between participants admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) vs those admitted to the ward. RESULTS: Participant were followed up for 21.811.7 days after discharge. During postdischarge assessment, independence for ADL was found to be lower in the group admitted to the ICU than the ward group (61.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 55.8%-66.2%] vs 72.7% [95% CI, 70.3%-75.1%], P<.001).

Seven years after the full implementation of the animal testing ban for cosmetic ingredients in the EU, there are still no alternative methods available capable of fully replacing oral repeated dose toxicity testing. Until this issue is resolved, the development of new cosmetic ingredients remains seriously hampered.

Oxygen availability may be compromised in obesity and several other metabolism-related pathological conditions, including sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, the metabolic syndrome (which is a set of conditions), type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Recent Advances: Strategies designed to reduce adiposity and its accompanying disorders have been mainly centered on nutritional interventions and physical activity programs. However, novel therapies are needed since these approaches have not been sufficient to counteract the worldwide increasing rates of metabolic disorders. In this regard, intermittent hypoxia training and hyperoxia could be potential treatments through oxygen-related adaptations. Moreover, living at a high altitude may have a protective effect against the development of abnormal metabolic conditions. In addition, oxygen delivery systems may be of therapeutic value for supplying the tissue-specific oxygen requirements. Critical Issues: Precise in vivo methods to measure oxygenation are vital to disentangle some of the controversies related to this research area. Further, it is evident that there is a growing need for novel in vitro models to study the potential pathways involved in metabolic dysfunction to find appropriate therapeutic targets. Future Directions: Based on the existing evidence, it is suggested that oxygen availability has a key role in obesity and its related comorbidities.

The resilient retail supply chain design is proposed under budget allocation and merchandise capacity constraints. Design/methodology/approach: This paper utilises the theory of constraint (ToC) and goal programming (GP) to address the COVID-19 impact on FRSC. The budgetary and capacity constraints are formulated with a constraint optimisation model and tested with six different priorities to deal with the physical and online stores. Next, all priorities are developed under different FRSC business scenarios. The ToC-GP-based optimisation model is validated with one of the Indian fashion retail supply chains. Findings: The proposed optimisation model presents the optimal retailing strategies for selling fashion goods over physical and online platforms. The multiple scenarios are presented for developing trade-offs among different strategies to maximise the retailer's merchandise performance. This paper also highlighted the strategic movement from high merchandise density stores to low merchandise density stores. This implies a reduction of sales targets and aspiration levels of both online and physical fashion stores. Research limitations/implications: The proposed model is validated with one of the fashion retailers in India. Other nations or multiple fashion retailers might be considered for more generalisation of findings in the future. Practical implications: This research helps fashion retail supply chain managers deal with consumer demand uncertainty over physical and online stores in pandemic times. Limitation: Other nations or multiple fashion retailers might be considered for more generalisation of findings in the future. Originality/value: This is the first study that considered the impact of COVID-19 on the retail fashion supply chain.

However, there are still some controversial problems as to which treatment should be primarily chosen. Methods The relevant studies comparing arthroplasty with internal fixation were searched in the databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Finally, 31 relevant randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. The quality of studies was evaluated and meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 software. We also assessed the heterogeneity among studies and publication bias via the I-squared index and forest plots. Results There was no significant difference between arthroplasty and internal fixation groups in patient mortality at both short-term and long-term points. However, patients treated with arthroplasty showed significantly lowered risks of reoperation both at short-term (5.6% vs 31.5%; relative risks (RR) = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.13-0.28; P < .00001) and long-term follow-up (9.5% vs 45.9%; RR = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.17-0.33; P < .00001). Similarly, arthroplasty-treated patients demonstrated a significant decrease in the risk of postoperation complications at short-term (10.3% vs 34.4%; RR = 0.37, 95% CI, 0.24-0.57; P < .00001) and long-term follow-up (11.7% vs 42.5%; RR = 0.30, 95% CI, 0.16-0.57; P < .0002). Besides, patients in the arthroplasty group were associated with better alleviation of pain postoperation (18.3% vs 31.1%; RR = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.33-0.78; P = .002).In trial sequence analyses, all cumulative Z curves except that of mortality crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundaries and conventional boundaries, and required information size has been reached. Conclusions Arthroplasty leads to a lower rate of reoperation, a reduced risk of complications, and a better alleviation of postoperation pain both at short-term and long-term follow-up. Most importantly, and according to trial sequence analyses, more than enough evidence has been achieved that arthroplasty does show better outcomes than internal fixation in terms of reoperation rate, complications, and postoperation pain.

The purpose of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of wound complications in patients who underwent wound closure with stainless steel staples or subcuticular sutures in surgery for gynecologic malignancies and to retrospectively determine the risk factors for wound complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS From April 2007 through March 2012, a cohort of 317 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for gynecologic malignancies was evaluated in the retrospective study. The skin was closed with stainless steel staples before March 2010 (staples group). From April 2010, the skin was closed by subcuticular suturing (subcuticular group). We compared the incidence of wound complications between 2 groups and evaluated independent multivariate associations with the effect of clinical parameters on occurrence of wound complications. RESULTS The incidence of wound disruption was 7.3% (23/317): 12.1% (17/140) in the staples group and 3.4% (6/177) in the subcuticular group (P = 0.0029). The incidence of wound infection was 2.5% (8/317): 5.0% (7/140) in the staples group and 0.6% (1/177) in the subcuticular group (P = 0.0124). Multivariate analyses performed with wound disruption as the end point revealed long-term steroid treatment, subcutaneous thickness, and skin staples as independent predictors. Subcutaneous thickness and skin staples were independent factors significantly associated with the possibility of wound infection.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of video consultations (VCs) in comparison with on-site visits (OSVs) was performed during a 6-week period in an LTx center in Germany. VC included a structured work-up questionnaire and vital sign documentation. Results: During the 6-week study period, 75 VCs were performed for 53 patients and 75 OSVs by 51 patients occurred. By the end of our study period, 77% of physician-patient contacts occurred through VC. Physician-patient consultations were reduced by 47% compared with the equivalent time frame in 2019. In 62% of cases, VC resulted in a concrete clinical decision. One COVID-19 patient in home quarantine was admitted due to respiratory failure detected by VC. Patient satisfaction with VC was high. Discussion: Implementation of VC helped to reduce the need for OSV and thus the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in our patient cohort.

With isolated transitional endoplasmic reticulum fractions, when incubated in the presence of nucleoside triphosphate and a cytosol fraction, temperature dependent formation of vesicles occurred with a Q(10) of ?2 but was apparent only at temperatures greater than 12C. A similar response was seen in situ at 12C and 16C where fusion of transition vesicles with cis Golgi apparatus, but not their formation, was blocked and transition vesicles accumulated in large numbers. At 18C and below and especially at 8C and 12C, the cells responded by accumulating smooth tubular transitional membranes near the cis Golgi apparatus face.

This patient arrived at the ER with respiratory discomfort that had been evolving over a month with symptoms of flu and deterioration of her general condition. A chest CT scan revealed an aspect of lung miliary tuberculosis with isolation of Koch's bacilli in the sputum.

The course was marked by a spectacular clinical improvement and two negative COVID-19 PCR controls at the end of treatment (at days 9 and 10). Anti-tubercular drugs (especially, rifampin) are powerful enzyme inducers that can reduce the effectiveness of chloroquine in our patient. This therapeutic success may be linked to the effect of anti-tubercular drugs against SARS ncov-2, especially rifampin, inhibiting the formation of messenger RNAs of SARS ncov-2 or to the synergistic effect of chloroquine and rifampin.

Many studies have shown that perinatal cells can inhibit the activation and modulate the functions of various inflammatory cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems, including macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and T and B lymphocytes. These immunological properties, along with their easy availability and lack of ethical concerns, make perinatal cells very useful/promising in regenerative medicine. In recent years, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained great interest as a new therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine being a cell-free product potentially capable, thanks to the growth factors, miRNA and other bioactive molecules they convey, of modulating the inflammatory microenvironment thus favoring tissue regeneration. The immunomodulatory actions of perinatal cells have been suggested to be mediated by still not fully identified factors (secretoma) secreted either as soluble proteins/cytokines or entrapped in EVs.

Whilst death rituals in India are contingent on the deceased's caste, community, class, gender and age, the impediment to the major death rituals creates a central conundrum for all mourners. It results from the substitution of 'sacred' ritual guidelines with new 'profane' ones for the 'disposal' of deceased COVID-19 patients. Departure from many significant pre-liminal rites, specific transition rites, and post-liminal rites has eschatological, ritual and cultural ramifications.

It is estimated that pre- and asymptomatic individuals are responsible for more than half of all transmissions. By detecting infected individuals before they have overt symptoms, wearable devices could potentially and significantly reduce the proportion of transmissions by pre-symptomatic individuals. the algorithm using Ava bracelet data when coupled with self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo; experimental condition); the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone (Symptom Only Algo; control condition). In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. TRIAL DESIGN: The trial is a randomized, single-blinded, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial. All subjects will participate in an initial Learning Phase (varying from 2 weeks to 3 months depending on enrolment date), followed by two contiguous 3-month test phases, Period 1 and Period 2. Each subject will undergo the experimental condition (the Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) in one of these periods and the control condition (Symptom Only Algo) in the other period. The order will be randomly assigned, resulting in subjects being allocated 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition first) or Sequence 2 (control condition first). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. PARTICIPANTS: The trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. A target of 20,000 subjects will be enrolled. Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. This results in approximately 6,500 normal-risk individuals and 3,500 high-risk individuals per sequence. Subjects will be recruited from previously studied cohorts as well as via public campaigns and social media. All data for this study will be collected remotely through the Ava COVID-RED app, the Ava bracelet, surveys in the COVID-RED web portal, and self-sampling serology and PCR kits. During recruitment, subjects will be invited to visit the COVID-RED web portal (www.covid-red.eu). After successfully completing the enrolment questionnaire, meeting eligibility criteria and indicating interest in joining the study, subjects will receive the subject information sheet and informed consent form. Subjects can enrol in COVID-RED if they comply with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Resident of the Netherlands. At least 18 years old. Informed consent provided (electronic). Willing to adhere to the study procedures described in the protocol. Must have a smartphone that runs at least Android 8.0 or iOS 13.0 operating systems and is active for the duration of the study (in the case of a change of mobile number, study team should be notified). Be able to read, understand and write Dutch. Previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (confirmed either through PCR/antigen or antibody tests; self-reported). Previously received a vaccine developed specifically for COVID-19 or in possession of an appointment for vaccination in the near future (self-reported). Current suspected (e.g., waiting for test result) COVID-19 infection or symptoms of a COVID-19 infection (self-reported). Participating in any other COVID-19 clinical drug, vaccine, or medical device trial (self-reported). Electronic implanted device (such as a pacemaker; self-reported). Pregnant at time of informed consent (self-reported). Suffering from cholinergic urticaria (per the Ava bracelets User Manual; self-reported). Staff involved in the management or conduct of this study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: All subjects will be instructed to complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app daily, wear their Ava bracelet each night and synchronise it with the app each day for the entire period of study participation. Provided with wearable sensor and/or self-reported symptom data within the last 24 hours, the Ava COVID-RED apps underlying algorithms will provide subjects with a real-time indicator of their overall health and well-being. Subjects will see one of three messages, notifying them that: no seeming deviations in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected; some changes in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected and they should self-isolate; or alerting them that deviations in their symptoms and/or physiological parameters could be suggestive of a potential COVID-19 infection and to seek additional testing. We will assess intraperson performance of the algorithms in the experimental condition (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) and control conditions (Symptom Only Algo). MAIN OUTCOMES: The trial will evaluate the use and performance of the Ava COVID-RED app and Ava bracelet, which uses sensors to measure breathing rate, pulse rate, skin temperature, and heart rate variability for the purpose of early and asymptomatic detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in general and high-risk populations. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests, PCR tests and/or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for each of the following two algorithms to detect first-time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: the algorithm using Ava Bracelet data when coupled with the self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data, and the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone. In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. The protocol contains an additional seventeen secondary outcomes which address infection incidence rates, health resource utilization, symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected participants, and the rate of breakthrough and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals vaccinated against COVID-19. PCR or antigen testing will occur when the subject receives a notification from the algorithm to seek additional testing. Subjects will be advised to get tested via the national testing programme, and report the testing result in the Ava COVID-RED app and a survey. If they cannot obtain a test via the national testing programme, they will receive a nasal swab self-sampling kit at home, and the sample will be tested by PCR in a trial-affiliated laboratory. In addition, all subjects will be asked to take a capillary blood sample at home at baseline (Month 0), and at the end of the Learning Phase (Month 3), Period 1 (Month 6) and Period 2 (Month 9). These samples will be used for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody testing in a trial-affiliated laboratory, differentiating between antibodies resulting from a natural infection and antibodies resulting from COVID-19 vaccination (as vaccination will gradually be rolled out during the trial period). Baseline samples will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of the Learning Phase is positive, and samples collected at the end of Period 1 will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of Period 2 is positive. When subjects obtain a positive PCR/antigen or serology test result during the study, they will continue to be in the study but will be moved into a so-called COVID-positive mode in the Ava COVID-RED app. This means that they will no longer receive recommendations from the algorithms but can still contribute and track symptom and bracelet data. The primary analysis of the main objective will be executed using data collected in Period 2 (Month 6 through 9). Within this period, serology tests (before and after Period 2) and PCR/antigen tests (taken based on recommendations by the algorithms) will be used to determine if a subject was infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not. Within this same time period, it will be determined if the algorithms gave any recommendations for testing. The agreement between these quantities will be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and how these compare between the study conditions. RANDOMISATION: All eligible subjects will be randomized using a stratified block randomization approach with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to one of two sequences (experimental condition followed by control condition or control condition followed by experimental condition). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence, resulting in equal numbers of high-risk and normal-risk individuals between the sequences. BLINDING (MASKING): In this study, subjects will be blinded as to study condition and randomization sequence. Relevant study staff and the device manufacturer will be aware of the assigned sequence. The subject will wear the Ava bracelet and complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app for the full duration of the study, and they will not know if the feedback they receive about their potential infection status will only be based on data they entered in the Daily Symptom Diary within the Ava COVID-RED app or based on both the data from the Daily Symptom Diary and the Ava bracelet. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): 20,000 subjects will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition followed by control condition) or Sequence 2 (control condition followed by experimental condition), taking into account their risk level. This results in approximately 6,500 normal-risk and 3,500 high-risk individuals per sequence.

Few studies have examined the role of laparoscopy in performing a Hartmann reversal. The aim of this study was to review our laparoscopic Hartmann reversal (LHR) experience with an emphasis on intra- and postoperative adverse events. METHODS A prospectively collected laparoscopic colorectal database involving 3 surgeons in 4 academic centres between 1991 and 2008 was reviewed. Factors evaluated were patient demographics, diagnosis, duration of surgery, intra- and postoperative complications, recovery of bowel function and length of stay in hospital. RESULTS Twenty-eight consecutive patients (13 men, 15 women) with a mean age of 61.1 (standard deviation [SD] 15.3) years and a mean weight of 72.3 (SD 20.1) kg underwent LHR. The diagnosis at initial surgery was complicated diverticulitis in 19 patients (67.9%), cancer in 6 patients (21.4%) and \\"other\\" in 3 patients (10.7%). The median duration of surgery was 166.2 (SD 74.4) minutes. There were no conversions. There was 1 major intraoperative complication (bleeding; 3.6%). There were 3 postoperative complications (10.7%): 1 abscess, 1 prolonged ileus and 1 wound hematoma. Only 1 patient with an abscess required readmission. There were no observed clinical anastomotic leaks. All patients underwent successful reanastomosis. The median time to return of bowel function was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] 3-4) days. The median length of stay in hospital was 5 (IQR 3-6) days. There was no mortality. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic colostomy reversal after a Hartmann procedure is safe and feasible in experienced hands. It is associated with low morbidity, quick return of bowel function and short stay in hospital.","output":"Laparoscopic colostomy reversal after a Hartmann procedure: a prospective series, literature review and an argument against laparotomy as the primary approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For large prostate volume, open simple prostatectomy (OSP) or holmium laser enucleation are the gold standard surgical treatment medical therapy failure.

Data were collected prospectively for all consecutive patients who underwent RASP in our high-volume tertiary hospital over a 6-year period. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) and uroflow findings were compared before and after surgery. Intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were also assessed. Forty-seven patients were included in the study. There was no intraoperative incident and no blood transfusion was needed after surgery. Median time to bladder catheter removal was 4 days and patients were discharged the day after. Within 90 postoperative days, 6 patients (12%) experienced at least one complication, all low-grade except one (2.1%) which was Clavien IIIa grade.

The exploratory work focusses on a subset of the indicators proposed under ICAO's Global Air Navigation Plan used to assess the operational performance in the arrival phase. A novel approach to characterize and assess the arrival flow management and level of traffic synchronization is presented. This will allow to evaluate ongoing air traffic recovery and identify operational bottlenecks.

A cross-sectional paper survey was conducted during the first German lockdown among patients with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder ( 60 years) or a diagnosed neurodegenerative disease (regardless of their age) from the department for neurodegenerative diseases and geriatric psychiatry at the University of Bonn. The WHO-5-, GAD-7- and WHOQOL-old score were used to determine levels of depression, anxiety and quality of life. The second part obtained information about the subjective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistical analysis included among others principal component analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. COVID-19-related, immediate distress was a strong predictor of elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety and a reduced quality of life. COVID-19-related concerns regarding health and financial security, however, were not significantly associated with negative mental health outcomes. The overall prevalence of symptoms of depression (50.8% [95% CI 43.8C57.6%]) and anxiety (32.7% [95% CI 26.4C39.2%]) among psychogeriatric patients was high.

Linear regression was used to predict maternal mental health and coping, using activities, support, and consequences of the lockdown as predictors, while adjusting for age, gestational age, ethnicity, income, marital status and number of children. Results: More than half of the participants reported feeling down (56%), lonely (59%), irritable (62%) and worried (71%), to some or high extent since lockdown began. Despite this, 70% felt able to cope with the situation. Support with her own health (95% CI .004, .235), contacting infant support groups (95% CI -.003, .252), and higher infant gestational age (95% CI .000, .063) predicted better mental health. Travelling for work (95% CI -.680, -.121), lockdown having a major impact on the ability to afford food (95% CI -1.202, -.177), and having an income lower than 30k (95% CI -.475, -.042) predicted poorer mental health. Support with her own health and more equal division of household chores were associated with better coping. Conclusion: During lockdown, a large proportion of new mothers experienced symptoms of poor mental health; mothers of infants with lower gestational age, with low income, and who are travelling to work were particularly at risk. However, greater support for maternal health and with household chores showed positive associations with maternal mental health and coping. These findings highlight the urgent need to assess maternal mental health, and to identify prevention strategies for mothers during different stages of lockdown.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on maternal mental health and coping in the UK: Data from the COVID-19 New Mum Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the disease was spread across the universe. This virus has level of blistering transmission because it can be transmitted through the air. To contain the outbreak, the people need to be self-isolated to minimize interaction with other people. In this case, the health workers are on the front line to combat this COVID-19 pandemic. It is because they must be dealing with the affected patients directly by taking care of them during their self-isolation period. The health workers must wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to avoid the virus transmission. In this turmoil, the availability of personal protective equipment or PPE is quite worrying. Therefore, the Indonesian government and every government around the world are arm in arm organize a worldwide aid in the form of PPE distribution through referral hospitals, with the objective of making the health workers safer. This research is aimed at conducting a simulation of distribution to obtain PPE route distribution in a more effective and efficient ways to get an optimal route. In this case, this research had been conducted by comparing two methods: saving matrix and tabu search for Hazmat suit distribution. Apart from getting an optimal route, the cost and time could be pushed more effectively to clock the fastest time in distribution with the fewest cost of distribution. The simulation of distribution point used was Distribution Center of West Java as an origin point, specifically at the COVID-19 referral hospitals in West Java, which was listed on the PIKOBAR site as the beneficiary of the PPE and the data of health workers in West Java mentioned in Central Agency on Statistics or locally known as BPS as the determinant of the requested PPE numbers. The result of this research showed that Tabu Search method was more optimal compared to Saving Matrix method based on similar approach, Nearest Neighbor, in determining the route that resulted in four distribution routes. This study showed that Saving Matrix research method concluded a mileage of 2.404 km in 80 hours at the cost of Rp. 10.505.968, while Tabu Search concluded a mileage of 2.351 km in 78 hours at the cost of Rp. 10.437.492.","output":"Comparison Of Optimal Distribution Route For Personal Protection Equipment By Saving Matrix And Tabu Search Methods Using Nearest Neighbor Approach At Covid-19 Referral Hospitals In West Java"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DEFINITION OF THE PROBLEM: Staff and patients in institutions of organized health care experience and express a variety of adverse conditions of these organizations. Within a theoretical framework of institutional pathology we can explain some of these miserable conditions as effects of the activities of organizations belonging to the political system (health policy) and to the economic system (health economy). Clinical ethics committees (CECs) cannot effectively handle such adversities or even address them properly. Standard organizational ethics can address them but cannot handle them effectively. ARGUMENTS: I propose to strengthen organizational ethics by a theory of institutional pathology. Basic nosological distinctions such as disease, illness and sickness, whose primary reference is to biological organisms and persons, can be analogically extended to socially constituted entities (e.g. hospitals) in terms of functional deficiency, miserable conditions, and need for reform of such entities. A very promising focus for analysis are organizational disorders of responsibility allocation. This group of institutional pathological disorders engenders, amongst other kinds of miserable conditions, specifically morally relevant miserable conditions. CONCLUSION: The institutional pathology paradigm, oriented to concrete institutions and organizations, can help clinical organizational ethics to considerably expand, in theoretical ethics as well as in ethically guided practice e.g. for members of CECs and organizational ethics advisors, the capacities for observing, evaluating and, if necessary, amending disturbed relations of responsibility.","output":"Miseren des Krankenhauses, institutionelle Pathologien und klinische Organisationsethik"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Assessment of whether SARS-CoV-2 has been propagated during intestinal passage and infectivity is conserved when shed rectally by hospitalised patients.

A high-quality and easy-to-use prognostic model to predict in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients could support physicians to make better clinical decisions. METHODS: Fine-Gray models were used to derive a prognostic model to predict in-hospital mortality (treating discharged alive from hospital as the competing event) in COVID-19 patients using two retrospective cohorts (n = 1008) in Wuhan, China from January 1 to February 10, 2020. The proposed model was internally evaluated by bootstrap approach and externally evaluated in an external cohort (n = 1031). RESULTS: The derivation cohort was a case-mix of mild-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients (43.6% females, median age 55). The final model (PLANS), including five predictor variables of platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex, had an excellent predictive performance (optimism-adjusted C-index: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.87; averaged calibration slope: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.08).

In France, teachers and radiography students in initial training, not specially prepared for this, had to adapt. An evaluation of the system was proposed to the students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire with 4 main sections (pedagogy, communication, learning and concerns) was sent to 91 students at the end of the semester. RESULTS: 91 responses were received. The slideshows with sound or presented during a virtual class are appreciated by the students. Online quizzes are ideal for learning/reviewing. For assessments, individual assignments and online questionnaires are appreciated. Teacher/student interaction via e-mail or video conferencing was considered satisfactory by the large majority of students. Student-student interactions via social networks, for course explanations or document exchange, are very suitable. The majority of students felt they were working a lot and much more compared to face-to-face teaching. Less than half of the students worked more than 20 h per week. Their motivation varied widely. Organizational habits were disrupted, but the autonomy granted was appreciated. The students were mainly concerned about the health of their loved ones and not about their own health. DISCUSSION: The use of distance education tools requires teacher commitment and technical skills. The frequency of communication by e-mail and/or videoconference between members of the teaching team and students must be adapted to the situation. Exchanges by e-mail allow for traceability, while videoconferencing allows direct interaction and a way out of isolation. Autonomy, appreciated by the students, was nevertheless combined with a strong variation in motivation; the anxiety-provoking period in which pedagogical continuity was built up may explain this contradictory observation.

Thyroid hormone affects glomerular filtration, which in turn affects excretion of PFOA and PFOS. We evaluated this by linking a model of thyroid disease status over the lifetime to a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of PFOA and PFOS. Using Monte Carlo methods, we simulated the target study population and analyzed the data using multivariable logistic regression. The target and simulated populations were similar with respect to age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum concentrations of PFOA and PFOS, and prevalence of clinical thyroid disease.

Coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and lymphopenia in infected individuals. Viral components like spike and nucleocapsid proteins trigger an immune response in the host to eliminate the virus. These viral antigens can be either recognized by the B cells or presented by MHC complexes to the T cells, resulting in antibody production, increased cytokine secretion, and cytolytic activity in the acute phase of infection. Genetic polymorphism in MHC enables it to present some of the T cell epitopes very well over the other MHC alleles. The association of MHC alleles and its downregulated expression has been correlated with disease severity against influenza and coronaviruses. Studies have reported that infected individuals can, after recovery, induce strong protective responses by generating a memory T-cell pool against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These memory T cells were not persistent in the long term and, upon reactivation, caused local damage due to cross-reactivity. So far, the reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2, which is highly contagious, shows related symptoms in three different stages and develops an exhaustive T-cell pool at higher loads of viral infection. As there are no specific treatments available for this novel coronavirus, numerous small molecular drugs that are being used for the treatment of diseases like SARS, MERS, HIV, ebola, malaria, and tuberculosis are being given to COVID-19 patients, and clinical trials for many such drugs have already begun. A classical immunotherapy of convalescent plasma transfusion from recovered patients has also been initiated for the neutralization of viremia in terminally ill COVID-19 patients. Due to the limitations of plasma transfusion, researchers are now focusing on developing neutralizing antibodies against virus particles along with immuno-modulation of cytokines like IL-6, Type I interferons (IFNs), and TNF- that could help in combating the infection. This review highlights the similarities of the coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS to the novel SARS-CoV-2 in relation to their pathogenicity and immunogenicity and also focuses on various treatment strategies that could be employed for curing COVID-19.","output":"Overview of Immune Response During SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Lessons From the Past"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 23, 2020, the United Nations (UN) made an \\"Appeal for a Global Ceasefire following the Outbreak of Coronavirus.\\" Despite this appeal, the Nagorno-Karabagh war was instigated on September 27, 2020.

In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to evaluate the feasibilityof the IFD. BACKGROUND Although distal atheromatous and thrombotic embolizations remain unresolved critical issues during catheter interventions, distal protection devices are infrequently used partly because of reduced lower maneuverability. METHODS In the in vitro experiment, we created an experimental circulation model composed of silicone latex tubes, a reservoir, and a roller pump. After the filter device was deployed in the tube, polystyrene fluorescent microspheres were injected and the capture rate was calculated. Ten trials were performed using the IFD and Spider FX. In the in vivo study, five independent operators deployed, and they retrieved the IFD in swine common iliac and internal carotid arteries. The procedural success rate as well as the delivery and retrieval time was evaluated. RESULTS In the in vitro study, the mean capture rate was 94% and 35% in the IFD and Spider groups, respectively. In the in vivo study, all procedures were successful, with no complications. The mean delivery time was 281  87 s and 194  67 s and the mean retrieval time was 24  9 and 13 1 s in the left internal carotid and the left common iliac arteries, respectively.

Many viruses down-regulate the innate immune responses in order to enhance their virulence. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae is the causative agent of severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with high mortality. Knowledge regarding the innate immune response against CCHFV is most limited. Interestingly, in this study it is shown that replicating CCHFV delays substantially the IFN response, possibly by interfering with the activation pathway of IRF-3. In addition, it is demonstrated that CCHFV replication is almost insensitive to subsequent treatment with interferon-alpha. Once the virus is replicating, virus replication is more or less insensitive to the antiviral effects induced by the interferon. By using an interferon bioassay, it is shown that infected cells secrete interferon relatively late after infection, that is, 48 hr post-infection. In summary, the results suggest the presence of a virulence factor encoded by CCHFV that delays the host defence in order to allow rapid viral spread in the host.","output":"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus delays activation of the innate immune response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"World Health Organization (WHO) declares the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic.

They are responsible for the correct protein folding, protection of the cell against stressors, presenting immune and inflammatory cytokines; furthermore, they are important factors in regulating cell differentiation, survival and death. Although the biological function of HSPs is to maintain cell homeostasis, some of them can be used by viruses both to fold their proteins and increase the chances of survival in unfavorable host conditions. Folding viral proteins as well as replicating many different viruses are carried out by, among others, proteins from the HSP70 and HSP90 families. In some cases, the HSP70 family proteins directly interact with viral polymerase to enhance viral replication or they can facilitate the formation of a viral replication complex and/or maintain the stability of complex proteins. It is known that HSP90 is important for the expression of viral genes at both the transcriptional and the translational levels. Both of these HSPs can form a complex with HSP90 and, consequently, facilitate the entry of the virus into the cell. Current studies have shown the biological significance of HSPs in the course of infection SARS-CoV-2.

STUDY DESIGN: Participants were male professional football players and team officials. Nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood samples were collected for the PCR and serological tests, respectively. Also, previous records of COVID-19 testing and symptoms were gathered. Those with previous positive PCR tests who tested negative for the second time were considered to be recovered patients. RESULTS: Of the 1243 subjects, 222 (17.9%) were seropositive, while 29 (2.3%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Sixty percent of symptomatic cases with a negative PCR were found to be seropositive. The mean level of IgM was significantly higher in PCR-positive and symptomatic subjects, whereas the recovered cases showed significantly higher levels of IgG.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The risk of developing clinically significant covid-19 infection within 28 days of attending a radiological examination. Covid19 infection rates for the 2020 cohort were compared against a control group who attended in 2019. RESULTS 84 positive SARSCoV2 tests were temporally associated with 47,340 radiological examinations across two hospitals in 2020.

To reveal the hepatic injury related to this disease and its clinical significance, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included 5,771 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Hubei Province. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We reported the distributional and temporal patterns of liver injury indicators in these patients and determined their associated factors and death risk. Longitudinal liver function tests were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with the risk factors and death. Liver injury dynamic patterns differed in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL). AST elevated first, followed by ALT, in severe patients. ALP modestly increased during hospitalization and largely remained in the normal range. The fluctuation in TBIL levels was mild in the non-severe and the severe groups. AST abnormality was associated with the highest mortality risk compared with the other indicators of liver injury during hospitalization. Common factors associated with elevated liver injury indicators were lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count increase, and male gender. CONCLUSION: The dynamic patterns of liver injury indicators and their potential risk factors may provide an important explanation for the COVID-19-associated liver injury. Because elevated liver injury indicators, particularly AST, are strongly associated with the mortality risk, our study indicates that these parameters should be monitored during hospitalization.","output":"Longitudinal Association Between Markers of Liver Injury and Mortality in COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has pointed to the need to increase our knowledge in fields related to human breathing.

Natural ventilation efficiency was checked in two different ventilation scenarios: only windows open and windows and doors open. The results show how ventilation affects the temperature, CO2 concentration, and median particle diameter size parameters. By contrast, the relative humidity depends more on the outdoor meteorological conditions. Both ventilation scenarios tend to create the same room conditions in terms of temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and particle size. Additionally, the evolution of CO2 concentration as well as the particle size distribution along the time was studied.

The evaluation was narrowed to two mRNA vaccines and two modified adenovirus vectored vaccines. METHODS: A frequentist random effects meta-analysis was carried out after data extraction. Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using New-Castle-Ottawa Scale. The overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was estimated in partially and fully vaccinated individuals. The effect size was expressed as Relative Risk (RR) and RRR (RR reduction) of SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated through between-study heterogeneity analysis and subgroup meta-analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review identified 27 studies eligible for the quantitative synthesis. Partially vaccinated individuals presented a RRR=73% (95%CI=59%-83%) for any positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RR=0.27) and a RRR=79% (95%CI=30%-93%) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RR=0.21). Fully vaccinated individuals showed a RRR=94% (95%CI=88%-98%) for any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR (RR=0.06) compared to unvaccinated. According to the subgroup meta-analysis, full BNT162b2 vaccination protocol achieved a RRR=84%-94% against any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR and a RRR=68%-84% against symptomatic positive PCR. The RR for any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR remained higher within elderly groups aged []69 years (RR=0.12-0.15) compared to younger individuals (RR=0.05-0.12). The RR against B.1.351 infection approached 0.40 for any positive PCR and 0.36 for symptomatic SARS-COV-2 while the RR of any B.1.1.7 infection was 0.14. CONCLUSION: The current licensed vaccines may be transmission blocking, especially after full vaccination protocol. Given the substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Subgroups meta-analyses suggested that the risk of any SARS-CoV-2 infection may be higher for non-B.1.1.7 variants and individuals aged []69 years.

Ultrasound (US) imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 patients;however, it requires a close-physical contact by the sonographer. In this context, this paper presents a Telerobotic Ultrasound (TR-US) system for complete remote control of the US probe, thereby preventing direct physical contact between patients and sonographers. The system consists of a 6-DOF robot arm at the remote site and a haptic device at the doctor's site. The control architecture precisely transmits the intended position and orientation of the US probe to the remote location for transversal and sagittal plane scanning. This architecture, when integrated with an admittance controller-based force modulation and feedback transmission, enables the radiologists to obtain high-quality images for diagnosis. The advantages and effectiveness of the system are demonstrated by conducting in-vivo feasibility study at AIIMS, Delhi, for imaging abdomen organs (liver, spleen, kidneys, bladders).

This research investigates gendered earnings disadvantage and (dis)parity across US counties by employing GIS-based maps, descriptive statistics, correlations and regression analyses wherein female earnings and female-versus-male earnings ratios are regressed against select explanatory variables representing educational attainments, gender-based work-status, and their occupational over/under-representation in the labor market. Five-years estimates data (2015C2019) from the NHGIS are used for computing location quotients for major occupation-types by gender and additional statistical analyses. Females with professional, Masters and doctoral degrees have improved earnings, even though gender parity is better for both genders among the less educated. Sadly, gender disparity in earnings is higher when male-versus-female ratio increases for those majoring in science/engineering, science and engineering-related and business degrees. Greater gender parity, however, is noted when more men major in Educationa sub-field largely deemed as feminine.

Whole white blood cells (WBC) and subpopulation dynamics as well the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were evaluated. RESULTS: Three-hundred seventy consecutive patients (mean age 81.75  6.8 years, 199 women's) were enrolled. In the entire population, significant kinetic changes in the WBC response (p <0.0001) between admission and first 24 hours post procedure, with a significant increase in total WBC (7.46  2.26 to 10.08  3.55) and absolute neutrophil count (4.97  2.06 to 8.19  3.43), NL ratio (3.72  2.8 to 9.76  7.29), and a meaningful decrease in absolute lymphocytes count (1.67  1.1 to 1.1  0.76).

The purpose of the study includes analyzing the effects of the Coronavirus pandemic on the taxpaying ability of individual taxpayers of Bangladesh and its subsequent impact on the government revenue collection;analyzing th factors related to the taxpaying ability like the situation of their employer, regularity of payment and so on;suggestions to the policy makers. Methodology. In this study purposive random sampling technique was followed to choose the respondents. The sample of the research includes the individuals who are within the tax net and have to pay income tax to the government. 128 respondents participated in the survey spontaneously. Mean value, standard deviation and related statistical tools were used for analyzing the data in the research. SPSS software was used for analyzing and interpreting the research result. Statistical tables were used to display the outcome. Findings. The major findings of the study suggest that 65.6 % of the respondents said that their official activities have been affected much while other 25 % claimed that their activities have become moderately affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Income of 40.6 % of the respondents has already been much affected and income of 32.8 % of the respondents has been moderately affected. The study warns that due to the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the income level, the government's tax collection may fall. Originality. The study concludes that the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect the government revenue collection and to tackle this situation a less regressive tax system is suggested which will allow shifting tax liability to the rich taxpayers. The study emphases the implementation of the existing tax laws so that tax evasion is minimized. Practical value. The study has recommended some specific recommendations that may help the respective authority in tackling the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The study suggested making some necessary adjustments in the public expenditure to reduce the pressure on tax collection.

Given the vast time that Earth has been teeming with life, do astrobiologists truly understand what geological features untouched by biological processes would look like? In the search for extraterrestrial life in the Universe, it is critical to determine what constitutes a biosignature across multiple scales, and how this compares with abiosignatures formed by nonliving processes. Developing standards for abiotic and biotic characteristics would provide quantitative metrics for comparison across different data types and observational time frames. The evidence for life detection falls into three categories of biosignatures: (1) substances, such as elemental abundances, isotopes, molecules, allotropes, enantiomers, minerals, and their associated properties; (2) objects that are physical features such as mats, fossils including trace-fossils and microbialites (stromatolites), and concretions; and (3) patterns, such as physical three-dimensional or conceptual n-dimensional relationships of physical or chemical phenomena, including patterns of intermolecular abundances of organic homologues, and patterns of stable isotopic abundances between and within compounds. Five key challenges that warrant future exploration by the astrobiology community include the following: (1) examining phenomena at the right spatial scales because biosignatures may elude us if not examined with the appropriate instrumentation or modeling approach at that specific scale; (2) identifying the precise context across multiple spatial and temporal scales to understand how tangible biosignatures may or may not be preserved; (3) increasing capability to mine big data sets to reveal relationships, for example, how Earth's mineral diversity may have evolved in conjunction with life; (4) leveraging cyberinfrastructure for data management of biosignature types, characteristics, and classifications; and (5) using three-dimensional to n-D representations of biotic and abiotic models overlain on multiple overlapping spatial and temporal relationships to provide new insights.","output":"Deciphering Biosignatures in Planetary Contexts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding virus transfer between liquid and skin is necessary to estimate transmission during water-related activities.

Our objective is to provide a framework of methodology for quantifying the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine on managing the importation risk of COVID-19 and other pandemics by leveraging different sets of parameters. METHODS: Three major categories of control measures on controlling importation risk were parameterized and modelled by the framework: 1) entry restrictions, 2) travel quarantine, and 3) domestic containment measures. Integrating the parameterized intensity of control measures, a modified SEIR model was developed to simulate the case importation and local epidemic under different scenarios of global epidemic dynamics. A web-based tool was also provided to enable interactive visualization of epidemic simulation. RESULTS: The simulated number of case importation and local spread modelled by the proposed framework of methods fitted well to the historical epidemic curve of China and Singapore. Based on the simulation results, the total numbers of infected cases when reducing 30% of visitor arrivals would be 884 (IQR 875-896) and 588 (IQR 583-595) times more than those when reducing 99% of visitor arrivals in mainland China and Singapore respectively, assuming actual time-varying Rt and travel quarantine policy. If the number of global daily new infections reached 100,000, 85%-91% of inbound travels should be reduced to keep the daily new infected number below 100 for a country with a similar travel volume as Singapore (daily 52,000 tourist arrivals in 2019). Whereas if the number was lower than 10,000, the daily new infected case would be less than 100 even with no entry restrictions. DISCUSSIONS: We proposed a framework that first estimated the intensity of travel restrictions and local containment measures for countries since the first overseas imported case. Our approach then quantified the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine using a modified SEIR model to simulate the potential epidemic spread under hypothetical intensities of these control measures. We also developed a web-based system that enables interactive simulation, which could serve as a valuable tool for health system administrators to assess policy effects on managing the importation risk. By leveraging different sets of parameters, it could adapt to any specific country and specific type of epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: This framework has provided a valuable tool to parameterize the intensity of control measures, simulate both the case importation and local epidemic, and quantify the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine on managing the importation risk.","output":"An integrated framework for modelling quantitative effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine on importation risk of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected over 3 million people worldwide with an estimated mortality rate of 5%.

The battle to overcome COVID-19 is not yet over; thus, it is essential that the public practices preventive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of reading and obtaining information via emergency alert SMS text messages and their effects on the individual's practice of preventive behaviors during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey comprising 990 participants was conducted over 3 days (March 25-27, 2020). A multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the sociodemographic factors that might influence the behavior of reading emergency alert text messages. A hierarchical linear regression model estimated the associations between reading emergency alert text messages for each precautionary behavior practiced against COVID-19. Additionally, the indirect effects of reading the text messages on each precautionary behavior via psychological factors (ie, perceived risk and response efficacy) were calculated. All data were weighted according to the 2019 Korea census data. RESULTS: Overall, 49.2% (487/990) of the participants reported that they always read emergency alert text messages and visited the linked website to obtain more information. Factors such as female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% CI 1.28-2.21) and older age (30-39 years: OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.25-3.28; 40-49 years: OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.80-4.47; 50-59 years: OR 3.19, 95% CI 2.01-5.06; 60 years and above: OR 3.12, 95% CI 2.00-4.86 versus 18-29 years) were identified to be associated with a higher frequency of reading the text messages. Participants who always read the text messages practiced wearing facial masks (=.074, P=.01) more frequently than those who did not. In terms of social distancing, participants who reported they always read the text messages avoided crowded places (=.078, P=.01) and canceled or postponed social gatherings (=.103, P<.001) more frequently than those who did not read the text messages. Furthermore, reading text messages directly and indirectly affected practicing precautionary behaviors, as the mediation effect of response efficacy between reading text messages and practicing preventive behaviors was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that emergency alert text messages sent to individuals' mobile phones are timely and effective strategies for encouraging preventive behavior in public. Sending emergency alert text messages to provide the public with accurate and reliable information could be positively considered by the health authorities, which might reduce the negative impact of infodemics.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 Emergency Alert Text Messages on Practicing Preventive Behaviors: Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the delivery of medical care across the world.

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop sustainable housing policies to accommodate the growing number of seniors in accessible home environments. This study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of how municipalities currently address housing accessibility issues and to explore what types of policy solutions they consider for the future. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five Swedish municipalities were selected to represent a diversity of the population, housing provision approaches, and geographical areas. To understand current housing policies, two key actors (e.g. public officials, housing adaptation grant managers, city architects, etc.) from each municipality participated in semi-structured interviews (N = 10). Subsequently, those key actors, two senior citizens, and three researchers participated in a research circle to explore future policy solutions. Data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The interviews revealed common approaches to deal with housing accessibility issues such as regular renovations and maintenance, individual adaptations based on specific needs, and seeking collaboration with private housing actors on housing provision matters. Possible measures suggested for the future included increasing the national coordination of housing accessibility policies, amending legislation to only allow the construction of housing according to strengthened accessibility standards, and introducing economic incentives for seniors to move from housing with poor accessibility to more accessible accommodations. CONCLUSIONS: Municipalities struggle with the lack of accessible and affordable housing for their ageing population, despite a large variety of policies from economic incentives to research and development policies. The results suggest that collaboration needs to be improved between all actors involved in housing policies. Preventive measures within the current laws may be needed to strengthen the construction of more accessible and affordable housing for populations ageing in place.","output":"Exploring housing policies in five Swedish municipalities: alternatives and priorities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is important to predict the environment around the breathing human because inhalation of virus (avian influenza, SARS) is recently severe worldwide problem, and air pollution caused by diesel emission particle (DEP) and asbestos attract a great deal of attention.

The aim of this study was to investigate the echocardiographic features in COVID-19 patients between severe and non-severe groups. For this single-center study, data from patients who were treated for COVID-19 between March 25, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were collected. Two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) images were obtained for all patients. Patients were divided into two groups based on the severity of their COVID-19 infections. 2DE parameters indicating right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) functions were compared between the two groups. A total of 90 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were included in this study. The mean age of the severe group (n = 44) was 63.3  15.7 years, and 54% were male. The mean age of non-severe group (n = 46) was 49.7  21.4 years, and 47% were male. In the severe group, RV and LV diameters were larger (RV, 36.6  5.9 mm vs. 33.1  4.8 mm, p = 0.003; LV 47.3  5.8 mm vs. 44.9  3.8 mm, p = 0.023), the LE ejection fraction (LVEF) and the RV fractional area change (RV-FAC) were lower (LVEF, 54.0  9.8% vs. 61.9  4.8%, p < 0.001; RV-FAC, 41.4  4.1% vs. 45.5  4.5%, p < 0.001), and pericardial effusions were more frequent (23% vs. 0%) compared to patients in the non-severe group. A multiple linear regression analysis determined that LVEF, right atrial diameter, high-sensitivity troponin I, d-dimer, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure, were independent predictors of RV dilatation.

It is important to demonstrate how these technologies were implemented during the early stages of this pandemic to identify their application and barriers to adoption, particularly among vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this knowledge synthesis was to present the range of RMTs used in delivering care to patients with COVID-19 and to identify perceived benefits of and barriers to their use. The review placed a special emphasis on health equity considerations. METHODS: A rapid review of published research was conducted using Embase, MEDLINE, and QxMD for records published from the inception of COVID-19 (December 2019) to July 6, 2020. Synthesis involved content analysis of reported benefits of and barriers to the use of RMTs when delivering health care to patients with COVID-19, in addition to health equity considerations. RESULTS: Of 491 records identified, 48 publications that described 35 distinct RMTs were included in this review. RMTs included use of existing technologies (eg, videoconferencing) and development of new ones that have COVID-19-specific applications. Content analysis of perceived benefits generated 34 distinct codes describing advantages of RMTs, mapped to 10 themes overall. Further, 52 distinct codes describing barriers to use of RMTs were mapped to 18 themes. Prominent themes associated with perceived benefits included a lower burden of care (eg, for hospitals, health care practitioners; 28 records), reduced infection risk (n=33), and support for vulnerable populations (n=14). Prominent themes reflecting barriers to use of RMTs included equity-related barriers (eg, affordability of technology for users, poor internet connectivity, poor health literacy; n=16), the need for quality \\"best practice\\" guidelines for use of RMTs in clinical care (n=12), and the need for additional resources to develop and support new technologies (n=11). Overall, 23 of 48 records commented on equity characteristics that stratify health opportunities and outcomes, including general characteristics that vary over time (eg, age, comorbidities; n=17), place of residence (n=11), and socioeconomic status (n=7). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this rapid review highlight the breadth of RMTs being used to monitor and inform treatment of COVID-19, the potential benefits of using these technologies, and existing barriers to their use. Results can be used to prioritize further efforts in the implementation of RMTs (eg, developing \\"best practice\\" guidelines for use of RMTs and generating strategies to improve equitable access for marginalized populations).","output":"Barriers to Use of Remote Monitoring Technologies Used to Support Patients With COVID-19: Rapid Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19), with the fatality rate in elder (60 years old or more) being much higher than young (60 years old or less) patients, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. A mathematical model considering young and elder subpopulations under different fatality rates was formulated based on the natural history of CoViD-19 to study the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The model considered susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, mild CoViD-19, severe CoViD-19, and recovered compartments, besides compartments of isolated individuals and those who were caught by test. This model was applied to study the epidemiological scenario resulting from the adoption of quarantine (isolation or lockdown) in many countries to control the rapid propagation of CoViD-19. We chose as examples the isolation adopted in S?o Paulo State (Brazil) in the early phase but not at the beginning of the epidemic, and the lockdown implemented in Spain when the number of severe CoViD-19 cases was increasing rapidly. Based on the data collected from S?o Paulo State and Spain, the model parameters were evaluated, and we obtained a higher estimation for the basic reproduction number R(0) (9.24 for S?o Paulo State, and 8 for Spain) compared to the currently accepted estimation of R(0) around 2 using the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered compartments) model. In comparison with the lockdown in Spain, the relatively early adoption of the isolation in S?o Paulo State resulted in enlarging the period of the first wave of the epidemic and delaying its peak. The model allowed to explain the flattening of the epidemic curves by quarantine when associated with the protective measures (face mask, washing hands with alcohol and gel, and social distancing) adopted by the population. The description of the epidemic under quarantine and protections can be a background to foreseen the epidemiological scenarios from the release strategies, which can help guide public health policies by decision-makers.","output":"Mathematical modeling of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2Evaluating the impact of isolation in S?o Paulo State (Brazil) and lockdown in Spain associated with protective measures on the epidemic of CoViD-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concentrations of free amino acids in plasma change coordinately and their profiles show distinctive features in various physiological conditions; however, their behavior can not always be explained by the conventional flow-based metabolic pathway network.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in other sample types, but there is limited understanding of the clinical or laboratory significance of its detection in blood. Methods: We undertook a systematic literature review to assimilate the evidence for the frequency of vRNA in blood, and to identify associated clinical characteristics. We performed RT-PCR in serum samples from a UK clinical cohort of acute and convalescent COVID-19 cases (n=212), together with convalescent plasma samples collected by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) (n=462 additional samples). To determine whether PCR-positive blood samples could pose an infection risk, we attempted virus isolation from a subset of RNA-positive samples. Results: We identified 28 relevant studies, reporting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 0-76% of blood samples; pooled estimate 10% (95%CI 5-18%). Among serum samples from our clinical cohort, 27/212 (12.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. RNA detection occurred in samples up to day 20 post symptom onset, and was associated with more severe disease (multivariable odds ratio 7.5). Across all samples collected 28 days post symptom onset, 0/494 (0%, 95%CI 0-0.7%) had vRNA detected. Among our PCR-positive samples, cycle threshold (ct) values were high (range 33.5-44.8), suggesting low vRNA copy numbers. PCR-positive sera inoculated into cell culture did not produce any cytopathic effect or yield an increase in detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. There was a relationship between RT-PCR negativity and the presence of total SARS-CoV-2 antibody (p=0.02). Conclusions: vRNA was detectable at low viral loads in a minority of serum samples collected in acute infection, but was not associated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 (within the limitations of the assays used).

Social distancing is critical for patients with cancer; however, it can also reduce their access to psychosocial coping resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore patient experiences to generate a model of how virtual mind-body programs can support the psychosocial well-being of patients with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among patients (aged &#8805;18 years) who participated in a virtual mind-body program offered by a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program consisted of mind-body group therapy sessions of fitness, yoga, tai chi, dance therapy, music therapy, and meditation. Live integrative medicine clinicians held each session via Zoom videoconferencing for 30-45 minutes. In semistructured phone interviews (n=30), patients were asked about their overall impressions and perceptions of the benefits of the sessions, including impacts on stress and anxiety. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. RESULTS: Among the 30 participants (average age 64.5 years, SD 9.36, range 40-80, 29 female), three major themes were identified relating to experiences in the virtual mind-body program: (1) the sessions helped the patients maintain structured routines and motivated them to adhere to healthy behaviors; (2) the sessions enhanced coping with COVID-19-related-stressors, allowing patients to \\"refocus\\" and \\"re-energize\\"; and (3) the sessions allowed patients to connect, fostering social relationships during a time of isolation. These themes informed the constructs of a novel behavioral-psychological-social coping model for patients with cancer.

Objective: To review immune changes brought along by each of these entities and how they might interrelate. Methods: We start presenting a brief review of the structure of the new coronavirus and how it alters the functioning of the human immune system. Subsequently, we describe the immune changes induced by AIT and how these changes could be favorable or unfavorable in the allergic patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a particular point of time during the evolving infection. Results: We describe how a healthy immune response against SARS-CoV-2 develops, versus an immune response that is initially suppressed by the virus, but ultimately overactivated, leading to an excessive production of cytokines (cytokine-storm-like). These changes are then linked to the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the patient. Reviewing the immune changes secondary to AIT, it becomes clear how AIT is capable of restoring a healthy innate immunity. Investigators have previously shown that the frequency of respiratory infections is reduced in allergic patients treated with AIT. On the other hand it also increases immunoregulation. Conclusion: As there are many variables involved, it is hard to predict how AIT could influence the allergic patient's reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In any case, AIT is likely to be beneficial for the patient with allergic rhinitis and/or allergic asthma in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as controlling allergic diseases leads to a reduced need for contact with healthcare professionals.

Based upon the theory of psychological reactance and psychoevolutionary theory of emotion, we hypothesize how such lifestyle changes affect consumers perceiving and responding to companies' communications messages. The theories also suggest that consumers in different cultures may respond to COVID-19 differently. To test our hypotheses, we implemented a Python scraper to collect companies Instagram posts pre- and during the COVID-19 lockdown. A machine learning algorithm was applied on the collected post photos to automatically identify certain photo characteristics, such as indoor versus outdoor, and with a single person versus many people; a text mining and sentiment analysis was implemented on the collected post captions to identify the salient emotion each caption exhibited, such as joy and anticipation. After that, we conducted a regression discontinuity analysis of photo characteristics or caption emotion on number of likes or comments to identify consumers response change due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

An integrated cell culture and real-time RT-PCR (ICC real-time RT-PCR) assay was developed to detect the infectivity of rotaviruses in water, which uses real-time RT-PCR to detect RNA produced by infectious rotaviruses during replication in host cells. Detection of rotaviral RNA in host cells provides direct evidence of the presence of infectious rotavirus rather than just the presence of rotavirus RNA. Using this newly developed method, the inactivation and resistance of rotavirus to UV treatments at various doses was evaluated. With an initial concentration of 2 x 10(4)PFU/ml simian rotavirus (SA11), a first-order linear relationship was obtained at UV dose range of 0-120 mJ cm(-2), and the inactivation rate constant was estimated to be 0.0343 cm(2) mJ(-1) (R(2)=0.966). The dose-inactivation curve tailed off and reached plateau as the UV dose increased from 120 to 360 mJ cm(-2), indicating resistance phenomena of sub-populations of SA11 at very high UV doses.

We apply the method to assess excess mortality from March to June 2020 in Denmark and Sweden as a result of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic; associated policy interventions; and behavioral, healthcare, social, and economic changes. We chose to compare Denmark and Sweden because reliable data were available and because the two countries are similar but chose different responses to COVID-19: Denmark imposed a rather severe lockdown; Sweden did not. We make forecasts by age and sex to predict expected deaths if COVID-19 had not struck. Subtracting these forecasts from observed deaths gives the excess death count. Excess deaths were lower in Denmark than Sweden during the first wave of the pandemic. The later/earlier ratio we propose for shortcasting is easy to understand, requires less data than more elaborate approaches, and may be useful in many countries in making both predictions about the future and the past to study the impact on mortality of coronavirus and other epidemics. In the application to Denmark and Sweden, prediction intervals are narrower and bias is less than when forecasts are based on averages of the last 5 y, as is often done. More generally, later/earlier ratios may prove useful in short-term forecasting of illnesses and births as well as economic and other activity that varies seasonally or periodically.","output":"Short-term forecasts of expected deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently the entire human population is in the midst of a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2).

M3CLpro (coronavirus main cysteine protease) is a promising drug target as it has a significant role in viral replication. Here we use the X-ray crystal structure of M3CLpro in complex with boceprevir to study the dynamic changes of the protease upon ligand binding. The binding free energy was calculated for water molecules at different locations of the binding site, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out for the M3CLpro/boceprevir complex, to thoroughly understand the chemical environment of the binding site. Several HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors were tested in vitro against M3CLpro. Specifically, asunaprevir, narlaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, and telaprevir all showed inhibitory effects on M3CLpro. Molecular docking and MD simulations were then performed to investigate the effects of these ligands on M3CLpro and to provide insights into the chemical environment of the ligand binding site.

These studies, however, were strongly biased towards hospitalized patients, and poorly represented patients who experienced a milder course of COVID-19, not requiring hospitalization. Jerusalem and its metropolitan area, comprising of over 1.3 million inhabitants, was the epicenter of Israel's COVID-19 crisis, with over 200,000 cases. Hadassah Medical Center, one of only two tertiary centers serving this multi-ethnic population, houses a Hematology Department that includes inpatient services, a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) center, day care services and in-campus outpatient clinics. From February 20 th, 2020, we tracked patients with confirmed COVID-19 reporting to their treating hematologists while being hospitalized due to COVID-19, at routine visits to the hematology services, or remotely via phone or email communication. This assured the representation of COVID-19 cases of various clinical severities. Data were collected retrospectively and included demographics, comorbidities, hematological diagnoses and treatments, course of COVID-19 and, importantly, source of infection. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess association between prognostic factors and outcomes including hospitalization, severe COVID-19 (per updated WHO criteria) and critical COVID-19, defined as a composite of ICU admission and mortality. Almost all the patients in this series were diagnosed prior to their vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest single center series of HM patients with COVID-19 reported to date. Our series included 183 patients. Median age was 62.5 years, 57% were men, and 72% had at least one comorbidity. The most frequent hematological diagnoses were indolent lymphoma and CLL (40%), aggressive lymphoma (20%) and multiple myeloma (19%). At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, 41% of the patients were receiving systemic anti-neoplastic treatment (excluding TKIs for CML and hydroxyurea for MPN), and 16% had undergone a previous allogeneic or autologous HSCT. Overall mortality, severe COVID-19, and hospitalization rates in the entire group were 9.8%, 14.2% and 32%, respectively, remarkably lower than in previous reports. Of the patients not receiving anti-neoplastic treatment, mortality and severe COVID-19 rates were comparable to those of the age-matched general population according to the Israeli Ministry of Health database [Table 1]. Consistent with previous studies, ischemic heart disease (IHD), dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, smoking and hypertension, as well as age and active anti-neoplastic treatment, each emerged as a risk factor significantly associated with hospitalization due to COVID-19 [Fig. 1, Table 2]. IHD, smoking, age and active treatment remained significant in multivariate analysis. Age and active treatment as well as 4 comorbidities were significantly associated with critical COVID-19. Interestingly, we observed a strong association between the number of prior anti-neoplastic treatment lines and critical COVID-19. Neither history of HSCT nor treatment with monoclonal antibodies were associated with COVID-19 outcomes. Notably, we did not detect any patient that contracted COVID-19 within the Hematology Department services, both inpatient and outpatient. Taken together, we present a different COVID-19 severity landscape in patients with HM as compared to previous observations. While active treatment was significantly associated with COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality, these rates were remarkably lower than previously reported. Despite harboring various degrees of immune suppression, patients with stable or indolent diseases not receiving active treatment appeared to be at a risk comparable to that of the age-matched general population, which depended largely on age and comorbidities. Routine preventive measures including symptom questioning, masks, and social distancing in both our inpatient and outpatient services provided a COVID-19-safe environment, obviating the need for changes in treatment schedules or assignment. These findings may have important consequences for future management of patients with HM in COVID-19 affected regions.

Surgical procedure backlogs have been calculated but not those for other healthcare services. This study aims to estimate the backlog of key primary preventive care services caused by COVID-19. Methods: This observational study assessed preventive care screening rates at three primary care clinics in Ottawa, Ontario from March to November 2020 using data from 22,685 electronic medical records. The change in cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and type 2 diabetes screening rates were extrapolated using 2016 census data, estimating the volume of key services delayed by COVID-19 across Ontario and Canada. Results: The mean percentage of patients appropriately screened for cervical cancer decreased by 7.5% (-0.3% to -14.7%;95% CI), colorectal cancer decreased by 8.1% (-0.3% to -15.8%;95% CI), and type 2 diabetes decreased by 4.5% (-0.2% to -8.7%;95% CI). Extrapolation estimated that Ontarians delayed 288,000 cervical cancer (11,000 to 565,000;95% CI), 326,000 colorectal cancer (13,000 to 638,000;95% CI), and 274,000 type 2 diabetes screenings (13,000 to 535,000;95% CI). Extrapolation to the Canadian population nearly triples these numbers. Re-opening measures have not reversed these trends.Interpretation: COVID-19 decreased the delivery of preventive care services, which may cause delayed diagnoses, increased mortality, and increased health care costs. Virtual care and reopening measures have not restored the provision of preventive care services. Electronic medical record data could be leveraged to improve screening via panel management.

The zoonotic nature of HEV in addition to its tendency from human to human transmission has led scientists across the globe to work on its different aspects. HEV also accounts for about 30% mortality rates in case of pregnant women. The genome of HEV is organized into three open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 ORF2 and ORF3. A reading frame encoded protein ORF4 has recently been discovered which is exclusive to GT 1 isolates of HEV. The ORF4 is suggested to play crucial role in pregnancy-associated pathology and enhanced replication. Though studies have documented the ORF4s importance, the genetic features of ORF4 protein genes in terms of compositional patterns have not been elucidated. As codon usage performs critical role in establishment of the hostCpathogen relationship, therefore, the present study reports the codon usage analysis (based on nucleotide sequences of HEV ORF4 available in the public database) in three hosts along with the factors influencing the codon usage patterns of the protein genes of ORF4 of HEV. RESULTS: The nucleotide composition analysis indicated that ORF4 protein genes showed overrepresentation of C nucleotide and while A nucleotide was the least-represented, with random distribution of G and T(U) nucleotides. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis revealed biasness toward C/G-ended codons (over U/A) in all three natural HEV-hosts (human, rat and ferret). It was observed that all the ORF4 genes were richly endowed with GC content. Further, our results showed the occurrence of both coincidence and antagonistic codon usage patterns among HEV-hosts. The findings further emphasized that both mutational and selection forces influenced the codon usage patterns of ORF4 protein genes. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is first bioinformatics study evaluating codon usage patterns in HEV ORF4 protein genes. The findings from this study are expected to increase our understanding toward significant factors involved in evolutionary changes of ORF4.

Although such predictions and the positive effects of SARS-CoV-2 on environment was already forecasted after the first wave of COVID-19, the learnt lesson as spotlight was not considered as one of the measures for which 2nd wave has quickly hit the world.","output":"Spike in pollution to ignite the bursting of COVID-19 second wave is more dangerous than spike of SAR-CoV-2 under environmental ignorance in long term: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients, refractory to conventional treatments. Aberrant activation of innate immune system may affect organ damage with poor prognosis for septic patients. Here, we investigated the efficacy of polymethyl methacrylate membrane (PMMA)-based continuous hemofiltration (CVVH) in modulating systemic and tissue immune activation in a swine model of LPS-induced AKI. After 3 h from LPS infusion, animals underwent to PMMA-CVVH or polysulfone (PS)-CVVH. Renal deposition of terminal complement mediator C5b-9 and of Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) deposits were evaluated on biopsies whereas systemic Complement activation was assessed by ELISA assay. Gene expression profile was performed from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by microarrays and the results validated by Real-time PCR. Endotoxemic pigs presented oliguric AKI with increased tubulo-interstitial infiltrate, extensive collagen deposition, and glomerular thrombi; local PTX-3 and C5b-9 renal deposits and increased serum activation of classical and alternative Complement pathways were found in endotoxemic animals. PMMA-CVVH treatment significantly reduced tissue and systemic Complement activation limiting renal damage and fibrosis. By microarray analysis, we identified 711 and 913 differentially expressed genes with a fold change >2 and a false discovery rate <0.05 in endotoxemic pigs and PMMA-CVVH treated-animals, respectively. The most modulated genes were Granzyme B, Complement Factor B, Complement Component 4 Binding Protein Alpha, IL-12, and SERPINB-1 that were closely related to sepsis-induced immunological process. Our data suggest that PMMA-based CVVH can efficiently modulate immunological dysfunction in LPS-induced AKI.","output":"PMMA-Based Continuous Hemofiltration Modulated Complement Activation and Renal Dysfunction in LPS-Induced Acute Kidney Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humoral and cellular responses after a third dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in patients treated for lymphoid malignancies. BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients such as patients with hematological malignancies have impaired immune response to two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer / BioNtech) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of a repeated immune stimulation with a third vaccine dose is needed. METHODS: a vaccine monitoring observatory was conducted in outpatients who were treated for lymphoid malignancies (LM) to monitor both immune and cellular response measured the day of administration of the dose 3 of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 and again three to four weeks. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was used to asses to the level of SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike (S) antibodies (Abs) titer and SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were assessed by a whole blood Interferon-Gamma Release Immuno Assay (IGRA) (QuantiFERON Human IFN-gamma SARS-CoV-2, Qiagen). RESULTS: Among the 43 assessable patients (suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n=15), indolent and aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (n=14), and multiple myeloma (MM) (n=16)), 18 (41,8%) had no anti-S Abs before the dose 3 of BNT162b2 vaccine (n=9 CLL, n=8 NHL, n=1 MM), and they all 18 remained negative after the dose 3. Amongst the 25 patients with positive anti-S titers before dose 3, all patients remained positive and 23 patients increased their anti-S titer after dose 3. Patients with CLL and/or with previous anti-CD20 therapy treated within 12 months of administration of dose 3 had no significant increase of the humoral response. Among 22 available patients, dose 3 of BNT162b2 vaccine significantly increased the median IFN-gamma secretion. On eight (36.4%) patients who were double-negative for both immune and cellular response, five (22.7%) patients remained double-negative after dose 3. CONCLUSIONS Dose 3 of BNT162b2 vaccine stimulated humoral immune response among patients with LM, in particular patients with MM (who had higher anti-S baseline titer after dose 2) and those with no anti-CD20 treatment history within a year. T-cell response was increased among patients in particular with no active chemotherapy regimen. Our data support the use of an early third vaccine dose among immunocompromised patients followed for LM though some of them will still have vaccine failure.","output":"Humoral and cellular responses after a third dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in patients treated for lymphoid malignancies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are few real-world data on the use of remdesivir (RDV) looking at timing of initiation in relation to symptom onset and severity of presenting disease. METHODS: We conducted multi-country retrospective study of clinical practice and use of RDV in COVID-19 patients. De-identified medical records data were entered into an e-CRF. Primary endpoints were all-cause mortality at day 28 and hospitalization duration. We assessed time from symptom onset to RDV start and re-admission. We included adults with PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 who were hospitalized after Aug 31, 2020 and received at least 1 dose of RDV. Descriptive analyses were conducted. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to calculate the mortality rate, LogRank test to compare groups defined by severity of disease. Competing risk regression with discharge and death as competing events was used to estimate duration of hospitalization, and Grays test to compare the groups. RESULTS: 448 patients in 5 countries (12 sites) were included. Demographics are summarized (table) by 3 disease severity groups at baseline: no supplemental oxygen (NSO), low flow oxygen 6 L/min (LFO), and high-flow oxygen > 6L/min (HFO). No demographic differences were found between groups except for the higher percentage of cancer/chemotherapy patients in NSO group. Corticosteroids use was HFO 73.6%, LFO 62.7%, NSO 58.0%. Mortality rate was significantly lower in NSO, and LFO groups compared with HFO (6.2%, 10.2%, 23.6%, respectively; Fig1). Median duration of hospitalization was 9 (95%CI 8-10), 9 (8-9), 13 (10-15) days, respectively (Fig2). Median time from first symptom to RDV start was 7 days in all 3 groups. Patients started RDV on day 1 of hospitalization in HFO and LFO and day 2 on NSO groups. And received a 5 day course (median). Readmission within 28-days of discharge was < 5% and similar across all 3 groups. Table 1. Patients baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes [Image: see text] Figure 1.

METHODS: Twenty commonly available fabrics and materials were evaluated for their ability to reduce air concentrations of ultrafine particles at coughing face velocities. Further assessment was made on the filtration ability of selected fabrics while damp and of fabric combinations which might be used to construct home-made masks. RESULTS: Single fabric layers blocked a range of ultrafine particles. When fabrics were layered, a higher percentage of ultrafine particles were filtered. The average filtration efficiency of single layer fabrics and of layered combination was found to be 35% and 45%, respectively. Non-woven fusible interfacing, when combined with other fabrics, could add up to 11% additional filtration efficiency. However, fabric and fabric combinations were more difficult to breathe through than N95 masks. CONCLUSIONS: The current coronavirus pandemic has left many communities without access to N95 face masks.

Studies of this disease have mainly focused on resistance evaluation, but the primary methods used-in vivo inoculation of pods or plants under greenhouse or field conditions-have limitations with respect to accuracy, stability, scale, and environmental safety. In this study, we developed a method for inoculating pods in vitro by soaking in a mycelial suspension. We optimized the crucial components, including the mycelial suspension concentration (40 to 60 mg mL-1), the maturity of the sampled pods (15 days after flowering), and the post-inoculation incubation period (5 days). Application of the mycelial suspension by soaking rather than spraying improved the efficiency of inoculation and made large-scale evaluation possible. Using this method, we evaluated 589 soybean germplasm resources (275 cultivars, 233 landraces, and 81 wild accessions). We identified 25 highly resistant cultivars, 11 highly resistant landraces, but only one highly resistant wild accession.

METHODS: We established two high-throughput employee testing centers in Seattle, Washington with drive-through and walk-through options for symptomatic employees in the University of Washington Medicine system and its affiliated organizations. Using data from these testing centers, we report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among symptomatic employees and describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes among employees with COVID-19. RESULTS: Between March 12 and April 23, a total of 3,477 symptomatic employees were tested for COVID-19 at two employee testing centers; 185 (5.3%) employees tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was similar when comparing frontline HCWs (5.2%) to non-frontline staff (5.5%). Among 174 positive employees reached for follow-up at least 14 days after diagnosis, 6 reported COVID-related hospitalization; all recovered. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, we observed that the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests among symptomatic HCWs was comparable to that of symptomatic non-frontline staff.

The semi-structured interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and then analyzed using Mayring's principles for content analysis. Results: We interviewed 12 medical students (8 female, mean age 23.2 years, mean medical training 3.7 years) working in Heidelberg COVID-19 crises management services, i.e., the Heidelberg Medical Hospital COVID-19 inpatient and outpatient units. The analysis revealed two key themes: Expectations and structural barriers and Experiences and mental burden. The participants reported uncertainty and apprehension before starting their voluntary work. Although they initially found volunteering to be somewhat disorganized, their roles became clearer with time. In addition, they reported good team cohesion, which helped reduce initial concerns and uncertainties. The participants also felt that working in the field had helped them maintain their professional identification while standard medical classes and bedside learning were suspended due to the COVID-19 crises.

Previous studies are heterogeneous and showed small effects. This study aims to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms and perceived mastery just after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous years in community-dwelling older adults and to identify potential risk groups according to the comprehensive geriatric assessment framework. METHODS: Data were used from 1068 Dutch older adults (aged 55C93 at baseline in 2011C2013) participating in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, including 4 follow-ups spanning 9 years. Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and feelings of mastery were assessed with the short Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale - Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and the Pearlin Mastery Scale. Linear mixed regression was used to compare outcomes in June-August 2020 to previous years and to examine predictors to identify risk groups. RESULTS: Slight increases in CES-D-10 (1.37, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 1.12;1.62), HADS-A (0.74, 95% CI 0.56;0.94) and mastery (1.10, 95% CI 0.88;1.31) occurred during the COVID year compared to previous years. Older adults with functional limitations or with frailty showed a smaller increase in feelings of mastery in the COVID-year. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest limited mental health effects on older adults from the first COVID-19 wave.

Greasy coating was a significant characteristic of patients with COVID-19. The proportions of greasy coating were 53.33%, 73.30%, 83.67 and 87.5% in disease category of mild, moderate, severe and critical. In addition, the thick coating proportion increased from mild (24.89%) to critical (50.00%). Conclusions: Tongue features have certain relationship with the category of COVID-19. Tongue features can serve as potential indicators for the evaluation of patient's condition and prognosis. Further studies are needed to enhance the quantification of tongue features and develop standards.","output":"Tongue features of patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES No agent has yet been proven to be effective for the treatment of severe patients with COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a pilot prospective open, single-arm multicentre study on off-label use of tocilizumab (TCZ) involving 63 hospitalised adult patients (56 males, age 62.612.5) with severe COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory parameters were prospectively collected at baseline, day 1, 2, 7 and 14. No moderate-to severe adverse events attributable to TCZ were recorded. RESULTS We observed a significant improvement in the levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer. The ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pa02) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi02) improved (meanSD Pa02/Fi02 at admission: 15253; at day 7: 283.73  115.9, at day 14: 302.2  126, p<0.05). The overall mortality was 11%; D-dimer level at baseline, but not IL-6 levels were predictors of mortality. TCZ administration within 6 days from admission in the hospital was associated with an increased likelihood of survival (HR 2.2 95%CI 1.3-6.7, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS In hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19, TCZ could be a safe option. An improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters was observed.

Herein, we employed several drug libraries intending to screen non-toxic inhibitory molecules against the active pocket of the enzyme that achieved stable binding mode in dynamics. Two anti-cancer compounds ([O-]C1=C(CC2=CC=CC=C2)SC(=[N+]1CC(=O)NC3=NC=C(CC4=CC=CC=C4)S3)S and CCCN(CCC)[S]-(=O)(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)NNC2=NC3=CC=C(Br)C=C3C(=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4) from Selleckchem.com were identified to occupy the active pocket of OGG1 and bind with greater affinity than Control TH5487. The binding affinity of Top-1 is ?11.6 kcal/mol while that of Top-2 is ?10.7 kcal/mol in contrast to TH5487 Control (?9 kcal/mol). During molecular dynamic simulations versus time, the said compounds are tightly held by the enzyme with no minor structural deviations reported except flexible loops in particular those present at the N and C-terminal. Both the compounds produced extensive hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme along with stable hydrogen bonding. The docking and molecular dynamics simulations predictions were further validated by molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) and Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA), and WaterSwap binding energies that validated strong binding of the compounds to the enzyme.

Older people and those with comorbidities are particularly vulnerable to this virus, with nursing homes and long term care facilities (LTCF) experiencing significant morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 outbreaks. The aim of this rapid systematic review was to investigate measures implemented in LTCF to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and their effect on morbidity and mortality of residents, staff and visitors. SETTING: Long-term care facilities. PARTICIPANTS: Residents, staff and visitors of facilities. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Databases and repositories and MedRXiv prepublished database) were systematically searched from inception to 27 July 2020 to identify studies reporting assessment of interventions to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in nursing homes among residents, staff or visitors. Outcome measures include facility characteristics, morbidity data, case fatalities and transmission rates. Due to study quality and heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The search yielded 1414 articles, with 38 studies included. Reported interventions include mass testing, use of personal protective equipment, symptom screening, visitor restrictions, hand hygiene and droplet/contact precautions, and resident cohorting. Prevalence rates ranged from 1.2% to 85.4% in residents and 0.6% to 62.6% in staff. Mortality rates ranged from 5.3% to 55.3% in residents. CONCLUSIONS: Novel evidence in this review details the impact of facility size, availability of staff and practices of operating between multiple facilities, and for-profit status of facilities as factors contributing to the size and number of COVID-19 outbreaks. No causative relationships can be determined; however, this review provides evidence of interventions that reduce transmission of COVID-19 in LTCF.

Visitors of healthcare facilities are the high-risk groups due to the presence of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting. Increasing the knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 prevention among hospital visitors are very important to prevent transmissions of the pandemic despite the lack of evidence remains a challenge in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the status of knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice towards COVID-19 and associated factors among hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed during August 1 to 30, 2020 from randomly selected 404 adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. The data was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. The outcome of this study was good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor preventive practice towards COVID-19. Three different binary logistic regression models with 95% CI (Confidence interval) was used for data analysis. For each mode, bivariable analysis (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) was used during data analysis. From the bivariable analysis, variables with a p-value <0.25 were retained into the multivariable logistic regression analysis. From the multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables with a significance level of p-value <0.05 were taken as factors independently associated with knowledge, attitude and preventive practices towards COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: About 69.3% of the respondents had good knowledge, 62.6% had a positive attitude, and 49.3% had good preventive practice towards the prevention of COVID-19. We found that factors significantly associated with good knowledge about COVID-19 were educational status who can read and write (AOR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.18C6.56) and college and above (AOR = 6.15; 95%CI: 2.18C17.40), and use of social media (AOR = 2.96; 95%CI: 1.46C6.01). Furthermore, factors significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 includes the presence of chronic illnesses (AOR = 5.00; 95%CI; 1.71C14.67), training on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.91; 95%CI: 1.96C7.70), and peer/family as a source of information (AOR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.06C5.63). Being a student (AOR = 7.70; 95%CI: 1.15C15.86) and participants who had a good knowledge on COVID-19 (AOR = 4.49; 95%CI: 2.41C8.39) were factors significantly associated with good practice towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We found that knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards prevention of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors were low. Therefore, we recommended that different intervention strategies for knowledge, attitude and preventive practices are urgently needed to control the transmission of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors. Health education of those who could not read and write about COVID-19 knowledge issues and advocating use of social media that transmit messages about COVID-19 are highly encouraged to increase the good knowledge status of adult hospital visitors. Furthermore, providing training about COVID-19 prevention methods and using various sources of information about COVID-19 will help for improving positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention, whereas for increasing the status of good preventive practices towards COVID-19, improving the good knowledge about COVID-19 of adult hospital visitors are essential.","output":"Knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards COVID-19 and associated factors among adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Introduction: \\"Due to the COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] pandemic and corresponding economic decline, the number of Americans experiencing food insecurity has skyrocketed in the United States According to surveys administered by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution in Spring 2020, approximately one in five parents living with children have experienced food insecurity due to the pandemic, and rates of food insecurity are even higher among Black and Hispanic households As with many social services, schools are critical sites in our nation's child nutrition infrastructure by offering breakfasts and lunches to children and distributing millions of subsidized meals to low-income students every day With the closure of schools in Spring 2020, however, many children and families lost access to these meals, with one recent piece of research suggesting that only 61 percent of families whose children usually receive free or reduced-price school meals continued to receive meals during the closures In the face of this national challenge, it is critical for education leaders at the state and local levels to consider how school meals can be effectively distributed to children and families when schools reopen in the fall, regardless of whether the mode of instruction is in-person or online To support governors and state education leaders, this memo offers a synthesis of key school nutrition guidance and considerations across states' school reopening plans and includes links to relevant national resources on this topic \\"","output":"School Nutrition and Meals Programs During K-12 School Reopening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A review Objective To discussandexpound the classification, origin, pathogenicity, protein target structure, vaccines and therapeutic drugs for coronavirus (CoVs) Methods After reading 159 literatures about coronavirus, we summarized and analyzed the classification, origin, pathogenicity, target structure of drug action, corresponding vaccines and therapeutic drugs development for CoVs Results CoVs is a type of pathogenic microorganism that seriously endangers human and animal health, which belongs to a RNA virus with a large amount of natural hosts The virus is prone to gene recombination and mutation, and has genetic diversity So far, new subtypes or coronaviruses are emerging continuously CoVsS protein, PLpro and 3CLpro are good targets for drug development We summarized the drugs found based on the above targets Conclusion In the past few decades, diseases caused by coronavirus have posed a great threat to global public health, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) and the recently emerging new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) However, there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoV infections so far Therefore, comprehensive and in-depth research on coronavirus is still a need","output":"Research progress of coronavirus and related drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rapid implementation of changes to practice in mental health services, in particular transitions of care.

METHOD: Thirty-four participants were interviewed about quality and safety in mental health transitions during May and June 2020 (the end of the first UK national lockdown). Semi-structured remote interviews were conducted to generate in-depth information pertaining to various stakeholders (patients, carers, healthcare professionals and key informants). Results were analysed thematically. RESULTS: The qualitative data highlighted six overarching themes in relation to practice changes: (a) technology-enabled communication; (b) discharge planning and readiness; (c) community support and follow-up; (d) admissions; (e) adapting to new policy and guidelines; (f) health worker safety and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated some quality and safety concerns such as tensions between teams, reduced support in the community and increased threshold for admissions. Also, several improvement interventions previously recommended in the literature, were implemented locally. DISCUSSION: The practice of mental health transitions has transformed during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting quality and safety. National policies concerning mental health transitions should concentrate on converting the mostly local and temporary positive changes into sustainable service quality improvements and applying systematic corrective policies to prevent exacerbations of previous quality and safety concerns.","output":"Effects of the first COVID-19 lockdown on quality and safety in mental healthcare transitions in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Since the outbreak of Covid-19, many randomized controlled trials have been launched to test the efficacy of promising treatments These trials will offer great promise for future treatment However, a public health emergency calls for a balance between gathering sound evidence and granting therapeutic access to promising trial drugs as widely as possible In an electronic survey we found that 3 9% of the participants preferred to receive an unproven trial drug directly in the hypothetical scenario of mild Covid-19 infection This percentage increased drastically to 31 1% and 54 2% in the hypothetical scenario of severe and extremely severe infection, respectively Our survey indicates a likelihood of substantial receptivity of trial drug among actual patients in severe conditions From the perspective of deontological ethics, a trial can only be approved when potential benefits of the investigational treatment are presumed to outweigh risks, so compassionate or off-label use of investigational therapies merits evaluation","output":"Patients attitudes to unproven therapies in treating Covid-19 merit evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Avoidant coping, characterised by substance use and lack of social support seeking, is strongly associated with psychiatric disorders More recently, high levels of avoidant coping in the presence of past adverse events has been linked to high schizotypy This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on relationship between schizotypy and coping in a UK University student sample Methods: Sixty-one young adults (mean age = 20 7, 85% female) were evaluated for schizotypy, coping, anxiety, and depression prior to the COVID19 pandemic inflicted lockdown in the UK (23/03/2020) They were subsequently re-recruited to assess key aspects of mental wellbeing one month after lockdown Results: Paired t-tests revealed a significant increase in depression levels, but not perceived stress or anxiety, one month after lockdown Dominant coping strategy (avoidant or approach) was not altered in response to lockdown Mediation analyses revealed that higher overall schizotypy was associated with higher, clinically relevant, levels of depression and this relationship was significantly mediated by the use of avoidant coping during but not prior to lockdown Secondary mediation analyses revealed this relationship being mostly driven by the Cognitive Disorganisation subscale Conclusion: This study indicates that during the Coronavirus lockdown in the UK individuals who used avoidant coping strategies and those with higher levels of schizotypy experienced higher levels of depression We suggest that introduction of individualised interventions and training to enhance the use of functional coping strategies may build resilience in those at risk of mental health problems faced with adversity","output":"The effect of schizotypy and coping strategy on mental well-being during COVID19 lockdown in UK students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first case was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on December 12, 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely to other countries since January 2020.

At Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (GOSH) there were 50 suspected cases. This report summarises the physiotherapy input to these patients outside of PICU. The rheumatology team were allocated the COVID-19positive ward and therefore were able to be involved in the evolving understanding of the clinical presentation and management of this new disease. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: 50 children were admitted to GOSH with suspected PIMS-TR COVID-19, of these, 36 were admitted to PICU. The mean length of stay in PICU was 4.6 days and the median 3.5 days (Range 1C16 days). The mean total length of stay in hospital was 11 days (range 2C94 days). 42% were male and 57% female and the age ranged from 5 weeks -17 years, but the mean age was 9 yrs. Most were previously well, but 3 had asthma, 2 diabetes, 1 obese, 1 with liver disease and 2 with sickle cell disease. The physiotherapy provided included assessment and relatively quickly it was recognised that these patients had a specific pattern of muscle weakness (proximal>distal) and so the Manual Muscle Test of 8 muscle groups (MMT8) and the Childhood Myositis Assessment Score (CMAS) were adopted as outcomes. The initial mean MMT8 score was 56/80 (42C79) and mean CMAS score 20/52 (4C51) Assessment of respiratory function, mobility and safety of postural changes including sitting to standing, gait and managing the stairs was also included. The treatment provided included breathing exercises and specific muscle strengthening that was progressed as able. Advice to the nursing and medical staff was provided to ensure that patients were safe while they were regaining strength and stability. Gait re-education and stairs assessment was completed before discharge. The patients have now been placed into a multidisciplinary assessment programme to follow up the long-term outcomes including physiotherapy outcomes. At the 2 months follow up the mean MMT8 was 72/80 and the mean CMAS is 46/52 indicating that there may be a long-term impact upon musculoskeletal function in young people. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: At GOSH the rheumatology physiotherapy team were redeployed to the temporary general paediatrics service. This service was responsible for the patients who were diagnosed with this new and evolving disease and who were transferred from the PICU. The physiotherapy team started to recognise the extent of their illness including postural instability, muscle weakness, severe fatigue, and joint involvement. The children also had impairment in respiratory function and cardiac function. It was recognised that mobility was limited for many reasons and care was required in the intensity and frequency of exercise and level of activity. Initially moving around the bed was exhausting and had to be effective and safe before progressing to weight-bearing and walking. Because the physiotherapy team were musculoskeletal specialists, they were able to consider different outcome measures and quickly decided upon using the MMT8 and the CMAS as well as assessing joint range of movement and muscle length. Respiratory assessments were also completed. It was also recognised that as the hospital had rapidly developed the COVID-19ward (Hedgehog ward) and as the staff were from many different areas of the hospital effective communication between this new team had to be established and within weeks a daily MDT meeting was started that ensured all aspects of each patients care were discussed to enable complete co-ordinated treatment of the patient. This meeting allowed staff to contribute to decisions about treatment as well as ensuring the nursing staff were informed about safety for each child regarding mobility. The meeting also allowed for discharge planning to ensure that every child was safe to be discharged and was able to physically manage at home. A weekly psychosocial meeting was also developed and so the psychological and social factors for each child and their family could also be considered and supported. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: The hospital planned and prepared for the Pandemic and staff were placed together to work in different ways. Because of the diversity of the skills of the staff it was possible to recognise the many systems that were affected by the disease and to pull together the expertise of the staff to be able to provide a high level and holistic clinical management for each and every child. It has also been possible to explore outcome measures and to be able to work with each other and to learn and discuss treatments moving forwards. The speed in which a completely new service was established was impressive especially as there had been a misunderstanding initially that children would probably not be severely affected by COVID-19. The importance of physiotherapy treatment in order to enable these young people to regain strength, mobility and function was apparent and with the longer term follow up it is demonstrating that several of these patients need longer term care and treatment after discharge. The outcome measures that are being used for the longer term follow up; CMAS, MMT8, 6 min walking test as well as neurological examinations and questionnaires to assess function and psychological well-being and fatigue are able to be used if other patients develop this disease and these measures can be used nationwide in order to enable a cohesive approach to managing PIMS-TR COVID-19.","output":"O17 Physiotherapy experience of treating patients with PIMS-TR COVID-19 following stepdown from PICU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research study explored changes in family-centered care practices for hospitalized infants and families due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reusable masks made from surgical sterilization wrap represent such an innovative approach with social media frequently referring to them as \\"N95 alternatives.\\" This material was tested for particle filtration efficiency and breathability to clarify what role they might have in infection prevention and control. METHODS: A heavyweight, double layer sterilization wrap was tested when new and after 2, 4, 6, and 10 autoclave sterilizing cycles and compared with an approved N95 respirator and a surgical mask via testing procedures using a sodium chloride aerosol for N95 efficiency testing similar to 42 CFR 84.181. Pressure testing to indicate breathability was also conducted. RESULTS: The particle filtration efficiency for the sterilization wrap ranged between 58% to 66%, with similar performance when new and after sterilizing cycles. The N95 respirator and surgical mask performed at 95% and 68% respectively. Pressure drops for the sterilization wrap, N95 and surgical mask were 10.4 mmH2O, 5.9 mmH2O, and 5.1 mmH2O, respectively, well below the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health limits of 35 mmH2O during initial inhalation and 25 mmH2O during initial exhalation. CONCLUSIONS: The sterilization wrap's particle filtration efficiency is much lower than a N95 respirator, but falls within the range of a surgical mask, with acceptable breathability.

However, few modeling studies have been performed on the sources of PM2.5, especially the impacts of emission reduction strategies. In this study, the Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System (NAQPMS) with an online tracer-tagging module was adopted to investigate source sectors of PM2.5 and a series of sensitivity tests were conducted to investigate the impacts of different sector-based mitigation strategies on PM2.5 pollution. The response surfaces of pollutants to sector-based emission changes were built. The results showed that resident-related sector (resident and agriculture), fugitive dust, traffic and industry emissions were the main sources of PM2.5 in Zhengzhou, contributing 49%, 19%, 15% and 13%, respectively. Response surfaces of pollutants to sector-based emission changes in Henan revealed that the combined reduction of resident-related sector and industry emissions efficiently decreased PM2.5 in Zhengzhou. However, reduced emissions in only the Henan region barely satisfied the national air quality standard of 75 g/m3, whereas a 50%-60% reduction in resident-related sector and industry emissions over the whole region could reach this goal. On severely polluted days, even a 60% reduction in these two sectors over the whole region was insufficient to satisfy the standard of 75 g/m3. Moreover, a reduction in traffic emissions resulted in an increase in the O3 concentration. The results of the response surface method showed that PM2.5 in Zhengzhou decreased by 19% in response to the COVID-19 lockdown, which approached the observed reduction of 21%, indicating that the response surface method could be employed to study the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on air pollution.

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, exhaustion and difficulties at work can seriously endanger the mental health of medical workers. The aim of this study was to examine whether resilience is a moderator of the association between burnout and subjective wellbeing among medical workers at the time of the pandemic. Methods. The research was conducted on a sample of 521 medical workers (354 female), among whom were 245 phy-sicians and 276 medical technicians. The average age of the respondents was 38.66 years. Data were collected using online questionnaires comprising the Brief Resilience Scale, the Work Burnout Scale, the Short Subjective Well-being Scale, and the Sociodemographic Data Questionnaire. Regression and interaction analysis (by SPSS macro \\"PROCESS 3.5'') was used for data analysis and processing. Results. The results showed that burnout was a significant negative predictor of subjective well-being of medical workers (ss =-0.19;p < 0.01) and a significant positive predictor of subjective well-being (ss = 0.40;p < 0.01), as well as that the interaction of resilience and burnout was a significant positive predictor of subjective well-being (ss = 0.09;p < 0.01). In subjects who had developed resilience at the level of +1 standard deviation (SD), the negative effect of burn-out on subjective well-being was 2.8 times lower than in subjects who had resilience at the level of-1 SD. Conclusion. The study confirmed that resilience reduces the negative connection between burnout and subjective well-being, which is a significant argument that medical workers should be provided with resilience training programs to prevent burnout and preserve mental health during a pandemic.","output":"Resilience as a moderator in the relationship between burnout and subjective well-being among medical workers in Serbia during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons have experienced disproportionately higher rates of hospitalization and death attributable to COVID-19 than have non-Hispanic White (White) persons (1-4).

Previous studies have revealed unsatisfactory accuracy in bodyweight estimation, due to the tapes' length-based weight categories. Therefore, we developed a digital algorithm allowing continuous length-based estimation of weight and age. The aim of this study was to compare the new algorithm with the PaedER regarding accuracy in estimating bodyweight and recommendation of medical airway equipment. METHODS Patients with a body length suitable for the PaedER were included in this single centre, prospective clinical observation trial after obtaining informed written parental consent. Bodyweight estimations by the algorithm and PaedER within  10% and  20% of the actual bodyweight were compared. Furthermore, medical airway equipment suggested by the PaedER and algorithm were compared with the equipment actually used for anaesthesia.

Collective monitoring through the analysis of biomarkers in wastewater is a new complementary approach developed due to progress in analytical chemistry. It supports epidemiological studies for the estimation of the prevalence of viral infectious diseases within communities connected to the same wastewater sewage network. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this type of approach has developed widely and rapidly around the world, due to its anticipated benefits. The article builds on early work published since January 2020 in a rapidly evolving literature. It shows that the method has limitations related in particular to the sampling strategy, analytical matrix effects, interlaboratory variability of results, and also uncertainties about individual viral excretion in feces. In almost all cases, it uses genomic detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus by quantitative PCR and is therefore unable to characterize its infectivity. The results showed a relatively good relation between genome concentrations in wastewater and numbers of confirmed cases. The virus detections seemed to appear a few days before the changes observed on the basis of the clinical and test screenings and can alert the health authorities to the geographical progression of an expected epidemic or to anticipate their reaction in the event of a new spike of the current epidemic. Knowledge of the evolutionary trends of wastewater virus contamination in cities, or even in city districts, also makes it possible to better target geographically and over time the public health management actions intended to prevent the circulation of the virus in the population served by their sewerage systems. In connection with health surveillance, the method is intended to contribute to the development of epidemiological models to predict the evolution of the pandemic at the local level. It is expected to develop into a permanent surveillance network over the territories, providing early, real-time epidemiological indications.

One favored mechanism to explain the role of viruses in the genesis of autoimmunity is molecular mimicry. An immunoinflammatory blinding lesion called herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) that follows ocular infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is suggested to result from a CD4(+) T-cell response to a UL6 peptide of HSV that cross-reacts with a corneal autopeptide shared with the immunoglobulin G2a(b) (IgG2a(b)) isotype. The present report reevaluates the molecular mimicry hypothesis to explain HSK pathogenesis. Our results failed to reveal cross-reactivity between the UL6 and IgG2a(b) peptides or between peptide reactive T cells and HSV antigens. More importantly, animals infected with HSV failed to develop responses that reacted with either peptide, and infection with a recombinant vaccinia UL6 vector failed to cause HSK, in spite of generating UL6 reactivity. Other lines of evidence also failed to support the molecular mimicry hypothesis, such as the failure to affect HSK severity upon tolerization of susceptible BALB/c and B-cell-deficient mice with IgG2a(b) or UL6 peptides. An additional study system revealed that HSK could be induced in mouse strains, such as the OT2 x RAG1(-/-) mice (T cell receptor transgenic recognizing OVA(323-339)) that were unable to produce CD4(+) T-cell responses to any detectable HSV antigens.

Our primary objective was to develop artificial intelligence capable of predicting sepsis earlier using a minimal set of streaming physiological data in real-time. METHODS AND FINDINGS A total of 29,552 adult patients were admitted to the intensive care unit across five regional hospitals in Memphis, TN over 18 months from January 2017 to July 2018. From these, 5,958 patients were selected after filtering for continuous (minute-by-minute) physiological data availability. A total of 617 (10.4%) patients were identified as sepsis cases, using the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) criteria. Physiomarkers, a set of signal processing features, were derived from five physiological data streams including heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), captured every minute from the bedside monitors. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used for classification. The model accurately predicted sepsis up to a mean and 95% confidence interval of 17.4  0.22 hours before sepsis onset, with an average test accuracy of 83.0% (average sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.757, 0.902, and 0.781, respectively). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that salient physiomarkers derived from continuous bedside monitoring are temporally and differentially expressed in septic patients. Using this information, minimalistic artificial intelligence models can be developed to predict sepsis earlier in critically ill patients.","output":"Temporal Differential Expression of Physiomarkers Predicts Sepsis in Critically Ill Adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For preventive interventions in school mental health to be effective, it is essential to have valid and reliable screening instruments that can detect students in need of more support.

The aim of DAMASCUS is to identify areas of practice variability and their potential association with differences in short- and medium-term clinical outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS DAMASCUS is an international, collaborative, prospective observational study, recruiting patients from over 200 sites across six continents. The study opened in October 2020, with a rolling start. Identification of new sites will cease in February 2021 and data collection will cease in August 2021. All adult patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis (radiologically or intraoperatively) at each participating centre will be included. The primary objective of DAMSCUS is to assess for national and international variability in the presentation and index management of acute diverticulitis (medical, interventional radiology and surgical). Secondary objectives include assessing 30-day and 6-month clinical outcome data (re-admission, re-intervention, morbidity and mortality) and variations in surgical procedures for those undergoing surgery. All data will be recorded and managed using a secure REDCap electronic data capture tool and analysed using Stata (SE) version 16.1.

Previously, the characterization of ice adhesion of icephobic materials by shear force is usually performed without direction discrimination along the surface whatever the surface is anisotropic or not. In this work, we studied the direction-dependent ice adhesion strength on groove-shaped micro-nano-structured aluminum alloy surfaces formed using a femtosecond laser. It is found that the ice adhesion strength on the surfaces exhibits anisotropy, which corresponds to a smaller ice adhesion strength in the direction parallel to the groove than that orthogonal to the groove. Furthermore, it is found that the ice adhesion strength decreases with the increase in groove width in the orthogonal direction, while it does not change much in the parallel direction. The anisotropic ice adhesion strength is attributed to the change of wettability and morphology in the two directions. The findings in this work suggest that anisotropic ice adhesion should be fully considered when designing an icephobic micro-nano-structured metal structure, which is of great significance to the characterization and application of icephobic materials.","output":"Anisotropic Ice Adhesion of Micro-Nano-Structured Metal Surface by a Femtosecond Laser"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Hospitals are expected to operate at a high performance level even under exceptional conditions of peak demand and resource disruptions. This understanding is not mature yet and there are wide areas of possible improvement. In particular, the fast mobilization and reconfiguration of resources frequently result into the severe disruption of elective activities, worsening the quality of care. This becomes particularly evident during the on-going coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. More resilient resource allocation strategies, that is, which adapt to the dynamics of the prevailing circumstance, are needed to maximize the effectiveness of health-care delivery. In this study, a simulation approach was adopted to assess and compare different hospital's adaptive resource allocation strategies in responding to a sudden onset disaster mass casualty incident (MCI). METHODS A specific set of performance metrics was developed to take into consideration multiple objectives and priorities and holistically assess the effectiveness of health-care delivery when coping with an MCI event. Discrete event simulation (DES) and system dynamics (SD) were used to model the key hospital processes and the MCI plan. RESULTS In the daytime scenario, during the recovery phase of the disaster, a gradual disengagement of resources from the emergency department (ED) to restart ordinary activities in operating rooms and wards returned the best performance. In the night scenario, the absorption capacity of the ED was evaluated by identifying the current bottleneck and assessment of the benefit of different resource mobilization strategies. CONCLUSIONS The present study offers a robust approach, effective strategies and new insights to design more resilient plans to cope with MCIs. It becomes particularly relevant when considering the risk of indirect damage of emergencies, where all the available resources are shifted from the care of the ordinary to the \\"disaster\\" patients, like during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.

In India, research shows that almost every woman goes through some level of disrespect and abuse during childbirth, more so in states such as Bihar where over 70% of women give birth in hospitals. OBJECTIVE: 1) To understand how women experience and attach meaning to respect, disrespect and abuse during childbirth; and 2) document womens expectations of respectful care. METHODS: Body mapping, an arts-based participatory method, was applied. The analysis is based on in-depth interviews with eight women who participated in the body mapping exercise at their homes in urban slums and rural villages. Analysis was guided by feminist relational discourse analysis. FINDINGS: Women reported their experiences of birthing at home, public facilities, and private hospitals in simple terms of what they felt good and bad. Good experiences included being spoken to nicely, respecting privacy, companion of choice, a bed to rest, timely care, lesser interventions, obtaining consent for vaginal examination and cesarean section, and better communication. Bad experiences included unconsented interventions including multiple vaginal examinations by different care providers, unanesthetized episiotomy, repairs and uterine exploration, verbal, physical, sexual abuse, extortion, detention and lack of privacy. DISCUSSION: The body maps capturing birth experiences, created through a participatory method, accurately portray womens respectful and disrespectful births and are useful to understand womens experience of a sensitive issue in a patriarchal culture. An in-depth understanding of womens choices, experiences and expectations can inform changes practices in and policies and help to develop a culture of sharing birth experiences.

The adaptation and transformation of nephrology services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain was a urgent need. During this period is worth noting that outpatient nephrology consultations were carried out largely virtually. In conclusion, the pandemic has clearly impacted clinical activity in Spanish Nephrology departments including ours at Virgen de las Nieves University hospital (Granada), reducing elective activity. METHOD: At the beginning of the pandemic, we quickly adapted by designing an outpatient healthcare model adapted to the situation. With a virtual model we established direct communication via online almost in \\"real time\\" between primary care and our Nephrology Service consultation, avoiding unnecessary travel of patients and relatives, risk exposures to interpersonal and reducing the cost and the public crowds in the hospital. Based on inter-consultation criteria adapted to the guidelines and consensus documents of different societies, we established a new intercommunication system between Primary Care Physicians and external nephrology consultations, to FILTER consultations that did not require unnecessary exposures and reducing the cost of healthcare and the waiting time among others. Between June 2020 and December 2021, we received 372 cases referred from Primary Care for a first virtual assessment in the high-resolution nephrology clinic, clinical recommendations were effectively issued regarding complementary tests, treatment  and the need to refer to our Nephrology outpatient clinic for study and follow-up or not. RESULTS: Of the 372 patients evaluated VIRTUALLY, 38 were referred by Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) of which 35 were discharged with follow-up by their Primary Care Physician, 37 patients were referred by eGFR <30 ml / min / 1.73m2 being discharged 29, 66 patients were referred by eGFR between 30-60 ml / min / 1.73m2, being discharged 51 , 15 had Albumin / creatinine ratio (ACR ) between 30-300 mg / gr discharging 100%, 22 cases were consulted for ultrasound renal abnormalities and 18 of them were discharged, 5 were referred for apparently non-urological hematuria, not requiring nephrological follow-up in any case, the reason for referral \\"other causes\\" had n = 102 of which the main reason was \\"loss of an appointment in consultation during the pandemic\\", nephrectomy, kidney transplants with decompensation, family history of hereditary kidney disease (PKD, Alport ) without follow up need in n=95 of cases In Spain the activity of presential care in outpatient Nephrology consultations was suspended in 47% of the services, carrying out activity through telephone calls in 98.9%, that is, in the majority of Spanish hospitals. In 16.5% of the centers, telemedicine was the only form of external clinical visits. In 57% of the centers, outpatient follow-up tests were stopped during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The actual COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that a transformation and adaptation plan based on the optimization of resources, the implementation of telemedicine and the reorganization of our healthcare activity is necessary. The activity of presential care in outpatient Nephrology consultations was suspended in 47% of the Spanish Nephrology services(1).

PTSD is complicated by impaired plasticity and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity, hyperactivity of the amygdala, and impaired fear extinction. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a promising candidate for treatment due to its multimodal action that enhances plasticity and calms hyperexcitability. CBDs mechanism in the mPFC of PTSD patients has been explored extensively, but literature on the mechanism in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is lacking. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we examined current literature regarding CBD in PTSD and overlapping symptomologies to propose a mechanism by which CBD treats PTSD via corticoraphe circuit. Acute CBD inhibits excess 5-HT release from DRN to amygdala and releases anandamide (AEA) onto amygdala inputs. By first reducing amygdala and DRN hyperactivity, CBD begins to ameliorate activity disparity between mPFC and amygdala. Chronic CBD recruits the mPFC, creating harmonious corticoraphe signaling. DRN releases enough 5-HT to ameliorate mPFC hypoactivity, while the mPFC continuously excites DRN 5-HT neurons via glutamate. Meanwhile, AEA regulates corticoraphe activity to stabilize signaling. AEA prevents DRN GABAergic interneurons from inhibiting 5-HT release so the DRN can assist the mPFC in overcoming its hypoactivity. DRN-mediated restoration of mPFC activity underlies CBDs mechanism on fear extinction and learning of stress coping.","output":"Cannabidiol and the corticoraphe circuit in post-traumatic stress disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new normal policy during the COVID-19 pandemic needs public involvement.

However, wind components are highly affected by the terrain topography introducing a large degree of uncertainty in forest fire spread predictions. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce wind field models that estimate wind speed and direction at very high resolution to reduce such uncertainty. Such models are time consuming models that are usually executed under strict time constrains. So, it is critical to minimize the execution time, taking into account the fact that in many cases it is not possible to execute the model on a supercomputer, but must be executed on commodity hardware available on the field or at control centers. This work introduces a new parallelization approach for wind field calculation based on Python multiprocessing to accelerate wind field evaluation. The results show that the new approach reduces execution time using a single personal computer.","output":"Wind Field Parallelization Based on Python Multiprocessing to Reduce Forest Fire Propagation Prediction Uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sildenafil is a potent selective, reversible inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Social distancing is one such preventive measure. People express their opinions freely through social media platforms like Twitter, which can be shared among other users. The articulated texts from Twitter can be analyzed to find the sentiments of the public concerning social distancing. Objective: To understand and analyze public sentiments towards social distancing as articulated in Twitter textual data. Methods: Twitter data specific to Canada and texts comprising social distancing keywords were extrapolated, followed by utilizing the SentiStrength tool to extricate sentiment polarity of tweet texts. Thereafter, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was employed for sentiment classification. Evaluation of performance was measured with a confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 measure. Results: This study resulted in the extraction of a total of 629 tweet texts, of which, 40% of tweets exhibited neutral sentiments, followed by 35% of tweets showed negative sentiments and only 25% of tweets expressed positive sentiments towards social distancing. The SVM algorithm was applied by dissecting the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing data. Performance evaluation resulted in an accuracy of 71%. Upon using tweet texts with only positive and negative sentiment polarity, the accuracy increased to 81%. It was observed that reducing test data by 10% increased the accuracy to 87%.

In several specific contexts, translation has been shown to be modulated by the presence of a phase-separating protein and under conditions which promote phase separation, and likely many more await discovery. A powerful tool for determining the rules for condensate-dependent translation is the use of engineered RNA sequences, which can serve as reporters for translation efficiency. This Perspective will discuss design features to consider in engineering RNA reporters to determine the role of phase separation in translational regulation. Specifically, we will cover (i) how to engineer RNA sequence to recapitulate native protein/RNA interactions, (ii) the advantages and disadvantages for commonly used reporter RNA sequences, and (iii) important control experiments to distinguish between binding- and condensation-dependent translational repression.

Besides aerosol transmission, SARS-CoV-2 is also propagated through contact with virus-contaminated surfaces. As such, the development of effective biofunctional materials that can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 are critical for pandemic preparedness. Such materials will enable the rational development of antiviral devices with prolonged serviceability reducing the environmental burden of disposable alternatives. This research reveals the novel use of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) to 3D print porous Cobalt-Chromium-Molybdenum (Co-Cr-Mo) superalloy with potent antiviral activity (100% viral inactivation in 30 mins). The porous material was rationally conceived using a multi-objective surrogate model featuring track thickness (tt) and pore diameter (?d) as responses. The regression analysis found the most significant parameters for Co-Cr-Mo track formation to be the interaction effects of scanning rate (Vs) and laser power (Pl) in the order PlVs > Vs > Pl. Contrastively, the pore diameter was found to be primarily driven by the hatch spacing (Sh). The study is the first to demonstrate the superior antiviral properties of 3D printed Co-Cr-Mo superalloy against an enveloped virus used as biosafe viral model of SARS-CoV-2. The material significantly outperforms the viral inactivation time of other broadly used antiviral metals such as copper and silver from 5 hours to 30 minutes. As such the study goes beyond the current state-of-the-art in antiviral alloys to provide extra-protection to combat the SARS-COV-2 viral spread.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact on the health and disease process according to the COVID-19 evolution in the Brazilian Indigenous population. METHODS: Data was collected from press releases by the Health Ministry and a descriptive analysis of the numbers of Indigenous individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil was carried out. RESULTS: In February 2021, there were 41,855 confirmed cases of Indigenous individuals infected by the SARS-CoV-2, including 4,387 active cases, 36,809 recovered cases, and 549 deaths. The Brazilian Indigenous population is distributed in over 300 ethnic groups and, due to the high number of deaths by the COVID-19, many of these groups are endangered. The elderly are the most affected age group, and they play a fundamental role among the Indigenous population for transmitting their customs mainly orally. Indigenous populations do not have proper access to transport to specialized health centers, since many areas are inaccessible and other cases require air or river transportation, which many times results in late assistance. When managing the COVID-19, it is important to emphasize the need for social isolation to prevent the virus from spreading among the Indigenous groups, mainly due to their contact with other ethnic groups represented by missionaries, hunters, and wood explorers, among others. CONCLUSION: The adoption of practices that can reduce the virus transmission among the Indigenous population and provide them with better access to treatment, mainly for the elderly, must be prioritized in Brazil.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic evolution in the Brazilian Indigenous population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die Arbeitsbedingungen im Allgemeinen Sozialen Dienst (ASD) der Jugend?mter und die Folgen fr den Kinderschutz gerieten in der Corona-Pandemie schnell in den Fokus der ?ffentlichen Aufmerksamkeit und wurden kontrovers diskutiert.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, population-based control-matched analysis. The study population included attendees to two outdoor music festivals held in Catalonia (North-East Spain). The primary objective was to compare the incidence of COVID-19 within the 3-to-10 days following the event between attendees and a population-based control group. FINDINGS: The analysis included 18,275 and 27,347 attendees to the first and second festivals, respectively, and their corresponding controls. The post-festival 7-day cumulative COVID-19 incidence among attendees and controls was 4.14% (95% CI 3.86-4.44) vs. 1.69% (1.51-1.88) for the first festival (RR 2.46; 2.16-2.80), and 2.42% (2.35-2.61) and 1.10% (0.99-1.2) for the second festival (RR 2.19; 1.92-2.51).

Thus, improving the quality of life of older people is a priority. Centenarians reach extreme longevity in a relatively good health status, escaping or delaying fatal or strongly invalidating diseases. Therefore, studying processes involved in longevity is important to explain the biological mechanisms of health and well-being, since knowledge born from this approach can provide valuable information on how to slow aging. We performed the present study in a well characterized very homogeneous sample of 173 people from Western Sicily, to update existing literature on some phenotypic aspects of aging and longevity and to propose a range of values for older people. We classified 5 age groups, from young adults to centenarians, to understand the age and gender-related variations of the different parameters under study. We collected anamnestic data and performed anthropometric, bioimpedance, molecular, haematological, oxidative, and hematochemical tests, adopting a multidimensional analysis approach. An important evidence of the present study is that there are differences related to both age and gender in several biomarkers. Indeed, gender differences seem to be still poorly considered and inadequately investigated in aging as well as in other medical studies. Moreover, we often observed comparable parameters between young and centenarians rather than non-agenarians and centenarians, hypothesizing a sort of slowdown, almost followed by a reversal trend, in the decay of systemic deterioration. The study of centenarians provides important indications on how to slow aging, with benefits for those who are more vulnerable to disease and disability.

The aim of the current study was to learn about the response of Australian SPC services to COVID-19 and its consequences in order to inform pandemic practice and policy. METHODS A cross-sectional, anonymous survey was administered online from May to July 2020. Email invitations were sent to 160 providers delivering 503 SPC services listed in the Australian Palliative Care Services Directory. Survey questions asked about service responses to COVID-19, impacts on care quality, and perceived benefits/disadvantages for palliative care clients post-pandemic. Open-ended responses were thematically coded using an established framework that classifies SPC pandemic responses under: 'stuff', 'staff', 'space', 'systems', 'separation', 'sedation', 'communication' and 'equity'. RESULTS Complete survey responses were received from 28 providers on behalf of 100 SPC services (response rates of 17%/20% respectively): 29 consultative, 25 community home-based, 21 outpatient, 15 inpatient wards/units, eight inpatient hospice and two other services. Responses were reported across all framework categories except 'sedation'. Concerns centred on: inadequate support for self-management, psychosocial needs and bereavement for clients living at home; pressures on staff capacity and wellbeing; and a perceived lack of health system preparedness for a potential future surge. Rapid implementation of telehealth across Australia was perceived to offer potential benefits to palliative care in the longer term, if provided with ongoing support. CONCLUSIONS Meeting COVID-19-related challenges requires SPC to be agile and responsive.

DC EXO are eobiotic, meaning they are well-tolerated by the host; moreover, they can be custom-tailored for immune-regulatory or -stimulatory functions, thus presenting attractive opportunities for immune therapy. Previously we documented the efficacy of immunoregulatory DCs EXO (regDCs EXO) as immunotherapy for inflammatory bone disease, in an in-vivo model. We showed a key role for encapsulated TGF?1 in promoting a bone sparing immune response. However, the on- and off-target effects of these therapeutic regDC EXO and how target signaling in acceptor cells is activated is unclear. In the present report, therapeutic regDC EXO were analyzed by high throughput proteomics, with non-therapeutic EXO from immature DCs and mature DCs as controls, to identify shared and distinct proteins and potential off-target proteins, as corroborated by immunoblot. The predominant expression in regDC EXO of immunoregulatory proteins as well as proteins involved in trafficking from the circulation to peripheral tissues, cell surface binding, and transmigration, prompted us to investigate how these DC EXO are biodistributed to major organs after intravenous injection. Live animal imaging showed preferential accumulation of regDCs EXO in the lungs, followed by spleen and liver tissue. In addition, TGF?1 in regDCs EXO sustained downstream signaling in acceptor DCs. Blocking experiments suggested that sustaining TGF?1 signaling require initial interaction of regDCs EXO with TGF?1R followed by internalization of regDCs EXO with TGF?1-TGF?1R complex. Finally, these regDCs EXO that contain immunoregulatory cargo and showed biodistribution to lungs could downregulate the main severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) target receptor, ACE2 on recipient lung parenchymal cells via TGF?1 in-vitro.

Due to these challenges, subsequent implementations of preventive measures in response to COVID-19 recurrences or other pandemics could present difficulties for decision makers. A better understanding of the factors underlying the public acceptance of COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical preventive measures may therefore contribute greatly to the design of more effective public communication during future pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical prevention measures in France. The specific objectives were (1) to examine the publics acceptance of COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical prevention measures and (2) to assess the association of the publics acceptance of these prevention measures and their perception of COVID-19. METHODS: Data were collected from 2004 individuals through an online survey conducted 6-8 weeks after the first lockdown in France. For objective 1, participants were asked the extent to which they supported 8 COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical preventive measures using a 4-point Likert scale. For objective 2, COVID-19Crelated perceptions were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale from an adapted version of Wittes Extended Parallel Process Model. Sociodemographic and environmental variables were also collected. The publics acceptance factors were estimated using an unweighted least squares factorial analysis, and their associations with perceptions of COVID-19, expressed as rate ratios (RR) and 95% CIs, were estimated using generalized linear Poisson regression models. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package. RESULTS: The acceptance rate reached 86.1% for individual protective measures, such as making masks mandatory in public open spaces, and 70.0% for collective restrictions, such as isolating the most vulnerable people (1604/2004, 80%) or forbidding public gatherings (n=1590, 79.3%). The least popular restrictions were closing all schools/universities and nonessential commerce such as bars and restaurants (n=1146, 57.2%).

Variables of the study included the number of ischaemic stroke patients, the proportions of recanalisation therapies, stroke severity during admission based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, functional outcome at discharge based on the modified Rankin Scale, and relevant workflow metrics. We compared the outcome between two six-month periods, namely the pre-COVID-19 period (March 2019 to September 2019) and the COVID-19 period (March 2020 to September 2020). Results: There were 131 and 156 patients, respectively, from the pre-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period.

Our results demonstrated the homogenous use of mushroom species for cultural purposes (e.g. ritual foods). Yet, we detected a remarkable difference in the role mushrooms play in providing income: Hutsuls in Ukraine use forest products as a main (rarely additional) source of income, while Romanian Hutsuls use them solely as additional income. Romanians on both sides considered mushrooms mainly as food and did not sell them (probably due in part to less abundance in the area). We also documented the fear of local residents that forest management and protected areas could suppress the right to collect wild mushrooms.

Our RNA-Seq analysis followed by confirmatory Q-RT-PCR revealed that elevated MCPIP1 levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes upregulated transcripts encoding proteins involved in signal transmission and cellular remodeling and downregulated transcripts of factors involved in metabolism. These data are consistent with our proteomic analysis, which showed that MCPIP1 expressing adipocytes exhibit upregulation of proteins involved in cellular organization and movement and decreased levels of proteins involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, MCPIP1 adipocytes are characterized by decreased level of insulin receptor, reduced insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, as well as depleted Glut4 level and impaired glucose uptake. Overexpression of Glut4 in 3T3-L1 cells expressed WTMCPIP1 rescued adipogenesis. Interestingly, we found decreased level of MCPIP1 along with an increase in body mass index in subcutaneous adipose tissue.

Based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4, achieving inclusive and quality education for all, this study designed two feasible learning models for the solution of sustainable learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, GPAM-WATA and Paper-and-Pencil test (PPT). The GPAM-WATA, a web-based dynamic assessment, offers online learning to most of the populations impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, while PPT makes the vulnerable groups access to learning possible with the aid of paper-based delivery. A quasi-experimental design was adopted, and both learning models were applied to a junior high school English reading course in Taiwan. A total of 122 seventh graders were randomly assigned to the GPAM-WATA group and PPT group for self-directed learning. The findings show that the GPAM-WATA is a sustainable educational technique that facilitates a better improvement in English reading performance. The PPT also has a positive effect on English reading performance, although not significantly if compared with the GPAM-WATA. This study suggests that GPAM-WATA is effective for English reading instruction in an online learning environment.

This study evaluated 111In-DANBIRT for the visualization of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS ApoE-/- mice, fed an atherogenic diet up to 20 weeks (n = 10), were imaged by SPECT/CT 3 hours post injection of 111In-DANBIRT (~ 200 pmol, ~ 40 MBq). Focal spots of 111In-DANBIRT were visible in the aortic arch of all animals, with an average Target-to-Background Ratio (TBR) of 1.7  0.5. In vivo imaging results were validated by ex vivo SPECT/CT imaging, with a TBR up to 11.5 (range 2.6 to 11.5). Plaques, identified by Oil Red O lipid-staining on excised arteries, co-localized with 111In-DANBIRT uptake as determined by ex vivo autoradiography. Subsequent histological processing and in vitro autoradiography confirmed 111In-DANBIRT uptake at plaque areas containing CD68 expressing macrophages and LFA-1 expressing inflammatory cells. Ex vivo incubation of a human carotid endarterectomy specimen with 111In-DANBIRT (~ 950 nmol, ~ 190 MBq) for 2 hours showed heterogeneous plaque uptake on SPECT/CT, after which immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated co-localization of 111In-DANBIRT uptake and CD68 and LFA-1 expressing cells.

We aimed to examine the acceptability of remote prescribing and 'medication-by-post' in SRH. STUDY DESIGN An online survey assessing attitudes towards remote management was distributed in three UK SRH clinics and via an integrated sexually transmitted infection (STI) postal self-sampling service. Logistic regressions were performed to identify potential correlates. RESULTS There were 1281 participants (74% female and 49% <25 years old). Some 8% of participants reported having received medication via post and 83% were willing to receive chlamydia treatment and contraceptive pills by post. Lower acceptability was observed among participants who were: >45 years old (OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.23-0.81)), screened for STIs less than once annually (OR 0.63 (0.42-0.93)), concerned about confidentiality (OR 0.21 (0.90-0.50)), concerned about absence during delivery (OR 0.09 (0.02-0.32)) or unwilling to provide blood pressure readings (OR 0.22 (0.04-0.97)). Higher acceptability was observed among participants who reported: previously receiving medication by post (OR 4.63 (1.44-14.8)), preference for home delivery over clinic collection (OR 24.1 (11.1-51.9)), preference for home STI testing (OR 10.3 (6.16-17.4)), ability to communicate with health advisors (OR 4.01 (1.03-15.6)) and willingness to: register their real name (OR 3.09 (1.43-10.6)), complete online health questionnaires (OR 3.09 (1.43-10.6)) and use generic contraceptive pills (OR 2.88 (1.21-6.83)).

Our objective was to determine the proficiency of telemedicine in diagnosis of pelvic floor disorders and if an initial telemedicine visit impacted the rate of surgical management compared to an in-person evaluation. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all new patients referred to a single attending provider in female pelvic medicine at a tertiary care referral center who were seen via a telemedicine visit in the first 2 months of telehealth adoption during the COVID pandemic. New telemedicine patients were then compared to patients seen for a new in-person visit over the same time period the previous year. Via chart review, we collected demographic data, primary diagnoses rendered following visit completion and treatment (medical versus surgical) chosen. We compared the rate of surgical posting, number of visits from initial visit until the date of surgery, and rate of surgery cancellation in women seen for a pelvic floor disorder as a new in-person versus by telemedicine. Results: A total of 310 new patient visits were queried: 182 (59%) that took place in person between June 1 and July 30, 2019 and 128 via telemedicine over the same timeframe in 2020 (41%). Table 1 presents comparative demographic data, primary diagnoses and surgical procedures that resulted in each cohort. For women with a diagnosis of stress or mixed urinary incontinence, the rate of surgical posting for a sling procedure in-person- v. by telemedicine was 25% and 38%, P = 0.176. For women with a diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse, the rate of surgical posting in-person v. by-telemedicine was 42% and 47%, P = 0.578.

It is characterized by destruction of the underlying lung parenchyma resulting in multiple small, thin-walled cavities and is often accompanied by empyema and bronchopleural fistulae. REVIEW: NP in children was first reported in children in 1994, and since then there has been a gradual increase in cases, which is partially explained by greater physician awareness and use of contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, and by temporal changes in circulating respiratory pathogens and antibiotic prescribing. The most common pathogens detected in children with NP are pneumococci and Staphylococcus aureus. The underlying disease mechanisms are poorly understood, but likely relate to multiple host susceptibility and bacterial virulence factors, with viralCbacterial interactions also possibly having a role. Most cases are in previously healthy young children who, despite adequate antibiotic therapy for bacterial pneumonia, remain febrile and unwell. Many also have evidence of pleural effusion, empyema, or pyopneumothorax, which has undergone drainage or surgical intervention without clinical improvement. The diagnosis is generally made by chest imaging, with CT scans being the most sensitive, showing loss of normal pulmonary architecture, decreased parenchymal enhancement and multiple thin-walled cavities. Blood culture and culture and molecular testing of pleural fluid provide a microbiologic diagnosis in as many as 50% of cases. Prolonged antibiotics, draining pleural fluid and gas that causes mass effects, and maintaining ventilation, circulation, nutrition, fluid, and electrolyte balance are critical components of therapy. Despite its serious nature, death is uncommon, with good clinical, radiographic and functional recovery achieved in the 5C6 months following diagnosis. Increased knowledge of NPs pathogenesis will assist more rapid diagnosis and improve treatment and, ultimately, prevention. CONCLUSION: It is important to consider that our understanding of NP is limited to individual case reports or small case series, and treatment data from randomized-controlled trials are lacking. Furthermore, case series are retrospective and usually confined to single centers. Consequently, these studies may not be representative of patients in other locations, especially when allowing for temporal changes in pathogen behaviour and differences in immunization schedules and antibiotic prescribing practices.","output":"Necrotizing pneumonia: an emerging problem in children?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technological innovations often create new markets and this gives incentives to learn about their associated profitabilities. However, this decision depends not only on the underlying uncertain profitability, but also on attitudes towards risk. We develop a decision-support tool that accounts for the impact of learning for a potentially risk-averse decision maker. The Kalman filter is applied to derive a time-varying estimate of the process, and the option is valued as dependent on this estimation. We focus on linear stochastic processes with normally distributed noise. Through a numerical example, we find that the marginal benefit of learning decreases rapidly over time, and that the majority of investment times occur early in the option holding period, after the holder has realized the main benefits of learning, and that risk aversion leads to earlier adoption. We find that risk-aversion reduces the value of learning and thus reduces the additional value of waiting and observing noisy signals through time.","output":"Kalman filter approach to real options with active learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Brazil is one of the countries with the highest rates of alcohol-related traffic infractions, but little is known about the profile of the drivers who commit them. Identifying the characteristics of impaired drivers is essential for planning preventive actions. OBJECTIVE: To compare drug use and driving behavior profiles of drivers with and without alcohol-related infractions. METHODS: 178 drivers stopped at routine roadblocks were assessed by traffic agents who conducted standard roadblock procedures (document verification; request of a breathalyzer test [BT]). Drug use and driving behavior data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Subjects were divided into three groups: drivers who refused the BT (RDs, n = 72), drivers who tested positive on the BT (PDs, n = 34), and drivers who had committed other infractions (ODs, n = 72). RESULTS: The proportion of alcohol use in the last year was higher among RDs (100%) than in the PD and OD groups (97.1% and 72.2% respectively, p < 0.001). Lifetime prevalence of cannabis and cocaine use for the overall sample was 44.3% and 18.2%, respectively. Fewer individuals in the OD group (31.5%) reported having been stopped at roadblocks in the previous year compared to the PDs (55.9%) and RDs (48.6%, p = 0.03). However, a higher proportion of RDs reported drunk driving in the same period (87.5%; PD 69.7%; OD 26.9%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Essential differences among groups were observed. RDs had a higher proportion of alcohol use and drunk driving in the previous year; drivers who fit into this particular group may be unresponsive or less responsive to social deterrence and enforcement actions.","output":"Drug use and driving behaviors among drivers with and without alcohol-related infractions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most traditional image registration algorithms aimed at aligning a pair of images impose well-established regularizers to guarantee smoothness of unknown deformation fields. Since these methods assume global smoothness within the image domain, they pose issues for scenarios where local discontinuities are expected, such as the sliding motion between the lungs and the chest wall during the respiratory cycle. Furthermore, an objective function must be optimized for each given pair of images, thus registering multiple sets of images become very time-consuming and scale poorly to higher resolution image volumes. Using recent advances in deep learning, we propose an unsupervised learning-based image registration model. The model is trained over a loss function with a custom regularizer that preserves local discontinuities, while simultaneously respecting the smoothness assumption in homogeneous regions of image volumes.

However, none of the existing formalisms leverage the structured and computable information that emerge from the evidence-based guideline development process. Thus, we here propose a FHIR-based guideline representation format that is structurally aligned to the knowledge artifacts emerging during the process of evidence-based guideline development. MethodsWe identified the information required to represent evidence-based clinical practice guideline recommendations and reviewed the knowledge artifacts emerging during the evidence-based guideline development process. Then we conducted a consensus-based design process with domain experts to develop an information model for guideline recommendation representation that is structurally aligned to the evidence-based guideline recommendation development process and a corresponding representation based on evidence-based medicine (EBM)-on-FHIR resources. ResultsThe information model of clinical practice guideline recommendations and its EBMonFHIR-based representation contain the clinical contents of individual guideline recommendations, a set of metadata for the recommendations, the ratings for the recommendations (e.g., strength of recommendation, certainty of overall evidence), the ratings of certainty of evidence for individual outcomes (e.g., risk of bias) and links to the underlying evidence (systematic reviews based on primary studies). We created profiles and an implementation guide for all FHIR resources required to represent a complete clinical practice guideline and used the profiles to implement an exemplary clinical guideline recommendation. ConclusionsOur EBMonFHIR-based representation of clinical practice guideline recommendations allows to directly link the evidence assessment process through systematic reviews and evidence grading, and the underlying evidence from primary studies to the resulting guideline recommendations.

However, the issue of access for vulnerable groups such as elderly people, people with disabilities, financially less well off people and the unbanked, has never been fully addressed. Then, in 2020, the COVID-19 lockdown threw a glaring spotlight on accessibility. For millions of vulnerable people, a trip outdoors to make a financial transaction could have life-threatening consequences. Digital financial services were vital lifelines for millions in the lockdown, but those unable to access them were severely disadvantaged. Financial services providers, deluged with requests for help from customers unable to access digital services, were brought face to face with the problem of poor accessibility. That makes this an excellent time to ask: What problems do vulnerable people face in accessing digital financial services and what can UK financial services providers do about them? This paper addresses that issue, drawing on in-depth qualitative and quantitative research carried out in 2018C2019 and selectively updated in June 2020. Data, interviews with organisations representing vulnerable people, and comments from vulnerable people themselves, provide a picture of the access problems that they face. The main finding is that financial services institutions still have insufficient knowledge about accessible systems and processes, and about user-demand for them. More work is expeditiously needed.

Software engineering education plays an essential role in keeping students up to date with software technologies, products, and processes that are commonly applied in the software industry. The software development project is one of the most important parts of the software engineering course, because it covers the practical side of the course. This type of project helps strengthening students skills to collaborate in a team spirit to work on software projects. Software project involves the composition of software product and process parts. Software product part represents software deliverables at each phase of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) while software process part captures team activities and behaviors during SDLC. The low-expectation teams face challenges during different stages of software project. Consequently, predicting performance of such teams is one of the most important tasks for learning process in software engineering education. The early prediction of performance for low-expectation teams would help instructors to address difficulties and challenges related to such teams at earliest possible phases of software project to avoid project failure. Several studies attempted to early predict the performance for low-expectation teams at different phases of SDLC.

This disease poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems because screening and surveillance capacity is often severely limited, especially during the beginning of the outbreak; this can fuel the outbreak, as many patients can unknowingly infect other people. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect and analyze posts related to COVID-19 on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China. To our knowledge, this infoveillance study employs the largest, most comprehensive, and most fine-grained social media data to date to predict COVID-19 case counts in mainland China. METHODS: We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million people, approximately half the entire monthly active Weibo user population. Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and analyzed around 15 million COVID-19Crelated posts from our user pool from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify sick posts, in which users report their own or other peoples symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19. Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China. RESULTS: We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline. CONCLUSIONS: Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.","output":"Using Reports of Symptoms and Diagnoses on Social Media to Predict COVID-19 Case Counts in Mainland China: Observational Infoveillance Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The inflammatory pathology observed in severe COVID-19 disease caused by the 2019 novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by elevated serum levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines, including interferon gamma, interleukin 8 (IL-8), and interleukin 6 (IL-6).

In this observational study we recorded objective data on sleep macro- and microarchitecture repeatedly over several nights before and during the Covid-19 government-imposed lockdown. The main objective was to evaluate changes in patterns of sleep duration and architecture during home confinement using the pre-confinement period as a control. METHODS: Participants were regular users of a sleep-monitoring headband that records, stores, and automatically analyses physiological data in real time, equivalent to polysomnography. We measured: sleep onset duration (SOD), total sleep time (TST), duration of sleep stages (N2, N3 and REM), and sleep continuity. Via the user's smartphone application participants filled-in questionnaires on how lockdown changed working hours, eating behaviour, and daily-life at home.

Pooled emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and lack of personal accomplishment (PA) were 51% (95% CI 42C61%), 52% (95% CI 39C65%), and 28% (95% CI 25C31%), respectively. This study demonstrated that nearly half of the healthcare workers experienced burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the studies that were included, non-frontline COVID-19 exposed healthcare personnel also experienced burnout. From high to lower middle-income countries, there was a gradient in the prevalence of total burnout, EE, and lack of PA. Further studies on burnout in low and lower-middle-income countries are suggested. A uniform diagnostic tool for the assessment of burnout is warranted.","output":"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Burnout Among Healthcare Workers During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence and mortality of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) are rising; outcomes appear to differ by race and ethnicity.

However, no apparent studies have reported national-level data on buprenorphine diversion. METHODS Case report data were drawn from a quarterly survey of prescription drug diversion completed by a national sample of law enforcement and regulatory agencies who engage in drug diversion investigations. Quarterly rates of buprenorphine diversion per 100 000 population and 100 000 prescriptions dispensed were calculated for the period 2002 through 2019. Population-based diversion rates were also calculated by U.S. region. RESULTS In total, 9670 cases of diverted buprenorphine were reported across all 50 states and the District of Columbia during the study period. Buprenorphine diversion rates, per 100 000 population, were characterized by an accelerating increase over time; increases in diversion rates from 1st quarter 2002 through 4th quarter 2006 were not statistically significant, yet from 1st quarter 2007 through 4th quarter 2019, the rate of diversion cases increased by 0.0067 cases per 100 000 per quarter (p < 0.001). Buprenorphine diversion rates per 100 000 prescriptions dispensed indicated a gradual increase over time; from 3rd quarter 2010 through 4th quarter 2019, diversion rates showed a statistically significant increase of 0.28 cases (p = 0.037) per quarter on average. The Northeast was the only region that did not observe an increase in the average quarterly change in buprenorphine diversion rates after 2006.

A pre-registered, cross-sectional survey study was carried out among 234 Hong Kong parents of children with SEN, investigating the associations of stigmatized identity, perceived discrimination, and subjective well-being under the impact of these social events. Utilizing the Bayesian modelling, we found that highly self-stigmatized parents not only perceived more daily-life discriminating behaviors against them, but also reported having higher distress, more negative emotions, and lower life satisfaction. A higher perceived impact of social events and more discrimination were also associated with lower well-being. Additionally, stigmatized identity, perceived discrimination, and perceived impact of social events demonstrated unique associations with well-being variables, indicating they were substantial stressors.

A literature search on PubMed, Ovid, and EMBASE databases was conducted, and articles pertinent to identified search terms were extracted. A snow-ball search strategy was followed in order to retrieve additional relevant articles. It was reported that viral spread may occur during the asymptomatic phase of infection, and viral load was suggested to be a useful marker to assess disease severity. In contrast to immune response against viral infections, cytotoxic T lymphocytes decline in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be partially explained by direct invasion of T lymphocytes or apoptosis activated by SARS-CoV-2. Dysregulation of the urokinase pathway, cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by FXa and FIIa, and consumption coagulopathy were the proposed mechanisms of the coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19.

This qualitative study explored barriers and enablers to pulmonary rehabilitation in low- and middle-income countries from the perspective of healthcare professionals with pulmonary rehabilitation experience in these settings. Online-based semi-structured in-depth interviews with healthcare professionals were undertaken to data saturation, exploring lived barriers and enablers to pulmonary rehabilitation in their low- or middle-income country.

An initial rigid image-to-patient registration may not be optimal for the entire lung volume, as the lung tissue anatomy is likely to have shifted since the time of computer tomography (CT) acquisition. The accuracy of the initial rigid registration will also be affected throughout the procedure by breathing, coughing, patient movement and tissue displacements due to pressure from bronchoscopy tools. A method to minimize the negative impact from these factors by updating the registration locally during the procedure is needed and suggested in this paper. METHODS The intraoperative local registration method updates the initial registration by optimization in an area of special interest, for example, close to a biopsy position. The local registration was developed through an adaptation of a previously published registration method used for the initial registration of CT to the patient anatomy. The method was tested in an experimental breathing phantom setup, where respiratory movements were induced by a robotic arm. Deformations were also applied to the phantom to see if the local registration could compensate for these. RESULTS The local registration was successfully applied in all 15 repetitions, five in each of the three parts of the airway phantom. The mean registration accuracy was improved from 11.8-19.4 mm to 4.0-6.7 mm, varying to some degree in the different segments of the airway model. CONCLUSIONS A local registration method, to update and improve the initial image-to patient registration during navigated bronchoscopy, was developed.

We collected presenting data from 22446 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. Outcomes were admission to hospital, COVID-19 result, organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular or renal), and death, by record review at 30 days. Results Adults were acutely unwell (median NEWS2 score 4) and had high rates of admission (67.1%), COVID-19 positivity (31.2%), organ support (9.8%) and death (15.9%).

The aim of this study was to explore the function and mechanism of MAPK signaling pathway in enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection of human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. METHODS Apoptosis of RD cells was observed using annexin V-FITC/PI binding assay under a fluorescence microscope. Cellular RNA was extracted and transcribed to cDNA. The expressions of 56 genes of MAPK signaling pathway in EV71-infected RD cells at 8h and 20h after infection were analyzed by PCR array. The levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF- in the supernatant of RD cells infected with EV71 at different time points were measured by ELISA. RESULTS The viability of RD cells decreased obviously within 48h after EV71 infection. Compared with the control group, EV71 infection resulted in the significantly enhanced releases of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and TNF- from infected RD cells (p<0.05). At 8h after infection, the expressions of c-Jun, c-Fos, IFN-, MEKK1, MLK3 and NIK genes in EV71-infected RD cells were up-regulated by 2.08-6.12-fold, whereas other 19 genes (e.g. AKT1, AKT2, E2F1, IKK and NF-B1) exhibited down-regulation. However, at 20h after infection, those MAPK signaling molecules including MEKK1, ASK1, MLK2, MLK3, NIK, MEK1, MEK2, MEK4, MEK7, ERK1, JNK1 and JNK2 were up-regulated. In addition, the expressions of AKT2, ELK1, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-B p65, PI3K and STAT1 were also increased. CONCLUSION EV71 infection induces the differential gene expressions of MAPK signaling pathway such as ERK, JNK and PI3K/AKT in RD cells, which may be associated with the secretions of inflammatory cytokines and host cell apoptosis.","output":"Differential gene expressions of the MAPK signaling pathway in enterovirus 71-infected rhabdomyosarcoma cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination is considered one of the most promising and socioeconomically sustainable strategy to help control the pandemic and several vaccines are currently being distributed in nationwide mass immunization campaigns.

The availability of treatment is important for those in need of cure, but by now it is a well-shown fact that health is generally determined to a much greater extent by other factors. Genetic constitution, lifestyle choices and socio-economic environment largely explain why some of us become ill or die earlier than others who remain healthy (Mackenbach 1996; McKeown 1976; Wilkinson and Marmot 2003). While some of these factors fall under the control of an individual, the majority does not. Research increasingly indicates how remarkably sensitive our health seems to be to what has become known as the social determinants of health. These factors generally fall beyond the control of an individual, but can nonetheless be influenced on a population level. This causes a shift in the focus of health policy from the classic provision of health care to policies specifically designed to influence the causal factors of ill-health in different non-medical fields. The flipside of that evolution is a significant increase of the states influence in the sphere of individual lives. A pertinent question remains the one that asks for the legitimate role of governments in modifying, discouraging or prohibiting behaviors that lead to ill-health. To what extent can and should we hold public policy responsible for us leading a healthy life?

Enlargement of the injection site&rsquo;s draining lymph nodes is increasingly reported, but is not yet widely recognised as being possibly associated with recent vaccination. As patients at risk of a severe course of COVID-19, indicated by their medical history such as a previous diagnosis of malignancy, receive priority vaccination, newly palpable lymph nodes raise concerns of disease progression. In this case series, we report on five patients who presented with enlarged lymph nodes after COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Sonography guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed in five patients presenting with PET-positive and/or enlarged lymph nodes after COVID-19 vaccination with either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination had been carried out in all cases, with an interval of between 3 and 33 days prior to FNA. Three of five patients had a history of neoplasms. The vaccine was administered into the deltoid muscle, with subsequent enlargement of either the cervical, supra-, infra- or retroclavicular, or axillary lymph nodes, in four out of five cases ipsilaterally. In all cases, cytology and additional analyses showed a reactive lymphadenopathy without any sign of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of newly enlarged lymph nodes after recent COVID-19 vaccination should be considered reactive in the first instance, occurring owing to stimulation of the immune system. A clinical follow-up according to the patient&rsquo;s risk profile without further diagnostic measures is justified. In the case of preexisting unilateral cancer, vaccination should be given contralaterally whenever possible. Persistently enlarged lymph nodes should be re-evaluated (2 to) 6 weeks after the second dose, with additional diagnostic tests tailored to the clinical context. Fine needle aspiration is a well established, safe, rapid and cost-effective method to investigate an underlying malignancy, especially metastasis.

New cases of cervical cancer presented to our clinic in more advanced stages (34.6% cases of FIGO stage III during the pandemic vs. 22.4% before the pandemic, p-value = 0.047). These patients faced significantly more changes in treatment plans, postponed surgeries, and postponed radio-chemotherapy treatment. From the full cohort of cervical cancer patients, 160 were early stages eligible for curative intervention who completed a three-year follow-up period. The disease-free survival and overall survival were not influenced by the surgical treatment of choice, or by the SARS-CoV-2 infection (log-rank p-value = 0.449, respectively log-rank p-value = 0.608). The individual risk factors identified for the three-year mortality risk were independent of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed significantly fewer cases of cervical cancer diagnosed per year during the first 24 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, blaming the changes in healthcare system regulations that failed to offer the same conditions as before the pandemic. Even though we did not observe significant changes in disease-free survival of early-stage cervical cancers, we expect the excess of cases diagnosed in later stages to have lower survival rates, imposing the healthcare systems to consider different strategies for these patients while the pandemic is still ongoing.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Surgical Treatment Methods for Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: A Population-Based Study in Romania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social systems are characterized by an enormous network of connections and factors that can influence the structure and dynamics of these systems Among them the whole economical sphere of human activity seems to be the most interrelated and complex All financial markets, including the youngest one, the cryptocurrency market, belong to this sphere The complexity of the cryptocurrency market can be studied from different perspectives First, the dynamics of the cryptocurrency exchange rates to other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies can be studied and quantified by means of multifractal formalism Second, coupling and decoupling of the cryptocurrencies and the conventional assets can be investigated with the advanced cross-correlation analyses based on fractal analysis Third, an internal structure of the cryptocurrency market can also be a subject of analysis that exploits, for example, a network representation of the market In this work, we approach the subject from all three perspectives based on data from a recent time interval between January 2019 and June 2020 This period includes the peculiar time of the Covid-19 pandemic;therefore, we pay particular attention to this event and investigate how strong its impact on the structure and dynamics of the market was Besides, the studied data covers a few other significant events like double bull and bear phases in 2019 We show that, throughout the considered interval, the exchange rate returns were multifractal with intermittent signatures of bifractality that can be associated with the most volatile periods of the market dynamics like a bull market onset in April 2019 and the Covid-19 outburst in March 2020 The topology of a minimal spanning tree representation of the market also used to alter during these events from a distributed type without any dominant node to a highly centralized type with a dominating hub of USDT However, the MST topology during the pandemic differs in some details from other volatile periods","output":"Complexity in Economic and Social Systems: Cryptocurrency Market at around COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 greatly disrupted the global supply chain of nasopharyngeal swabs, and thus new products have come to market with little data to support their use.

The participants were 6,000 Japanese men and women (aged 20C64 years old) who were registered with a research company. After excluding participants with invalid responses, a total of 5,158 participants were included in the analysis. The questionnaire included the following items: demographic characteristics;socioeconomic status;and changes in household income, diet, dietary behavior, and lifestyle since before the COVID-19 pandemic (November 2019) to the present (November 2020). Changes in household income and demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status were compared using the 2 test. The association between changes in household income and dietary habits was examined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Household income had decreased for 1,144 participants (22.2%). In this group, a high proportion were in their 50s, were high school graduates, and had household income under 2 million yen in 2019. Decrease in household income was negatively associated with vegetable intake, frequency of eating out, time spent on breakfast, and time spent exercising, and positively associated with frequency of drinking and time spent on lunch. The results of this study suggest that decrease in household income during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with expansion of economic disparities and changes in dietary habits, such as vegetable intake and mealtimes.

Difficulties in accessing treatment may contribute to this problem. Guided self-help based on the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy (GSH-CBT) is one way of promoting access to psychological treatment. Moreover, because the therapists role in GSH-CBT is limited to supporting the patient, this role could be assumed by trained and supervised lay providers (LPs) instead of licensed providers. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of GSH-CBT guided by LPs for primary threshold or subthreshold GAD in older adults. METHODS: We will conduct a multisite randomized controlled trial comparing an experimental group receiving GSH-CBT guided by LPs (n = 45) to a wait-list control group (n = 45). Treatment will last 15 weeks and will be based on a participants manual. Weekly telephone sessions with LPs (30 min maximum) will be limited to providing support. Data will be obtained through clinician evaluations and self-assessment questionnaires. Primary outcomes will be the tendency to worry and severity of GAD symptoms. Secondary outcomes will be anxiety symptoms, sleep difficulties, functional deficit, diagnosis of GAD, and cognitive difficulties. For the experimental group, measurements will take place at pre- and post-treatment and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. For the control group, three evaluations are planned: two pre-treatment evaluations (before and after the waiting period) and after receiving treatment (post-treatment). The efficacy of GSH-CBT will be established by comparing the change in the two groups on the primary outcomes. DISCUSSION: This project will provide evidence on the efficacy of a novel approach to treat GAD in older adults. If effective, it could be implemented on a larger scale and provide many older adults with much needed mental health treatment through an expanded workforce.

An online survey was used to collect socio-demographic data, and the symptoms of depression and anxiety and satisfaction with life using Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), and the 5-items Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 59.35 and 54.34%, respectively, and the score of satisfaction with life was 20.51  6.42 among Chinese college students during the pandemic. After controlling for covariates, students in urban areas (AOR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.61C0.87), with good family economic levels (AOR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.66C0.91), and having psychological counseling (AOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.42C0.73) were positively associated with depression symptoms; meanwhile, higher anxiety symptoms were observed among medical students (AOR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.69C0.95).

The chapter includes discussion of the theory of the modern drivers of the evolution of agricultural comparative advantage as economies grow. It asks: to what extent are the actual trade patterns in East Asia consistent with that theory? The actual trade patterns are somewhat inconsistent with the theory, which is because trade-related policies have restricted agricultural trade of East Asian economies in various ways. In particular, several countries have restricted their exports of key farm products while their incomes were low, which implies the imposition of a tax on agriculture. Other countries have gradually raised barriers to agricultural imports as the international competitiveness of their farmers declined in the course of economic growth and industrialisation. A tradition of gradually moving away from taxing and toward protecting farmers relative to producers in non-farm sectors is identified. But this process should not be taken as given. Some richer countries are reducing their agricultural protection, following the agricultural reforms of West European countries. Also there are new and cheaper means of achieving the policy objectives of agricultural policies, even in the regions poorer countries, which allow countries to move away from less-efficient price- and trade-distorting policy instruments to more efficient ones for redistributing the benefits of economic growth and integration. While switching to these new measures is not a trivial task, doing so would help integrate regional trade in these products and provide better options for responding to supply shocks such as the COVID-19 epidemic and local events associated with climate change. ?

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses many workflow challenges for healthcare systems. Elective cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) exams were postponed until safety protocols were instituted. Since reopening, imaging labs are managing COVID-19 safety triaging, exam backlog, and increased referrals, thus innovative solutions for process improvement are needed. PURPOSE: An accelerated compressed sensing (CS) real-time (RT) technique offers dynamic cardiac imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution without image degradation. We sought to evaluate the efficiency of a rapid RT CMR protocol with a goal to decrease scan time without compromising study quality and comprehensiveness. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 219 CMRs (Siemens Magnetom Sola 1.5T) performed 09/01/2020 - 10/15/2020. After excluding 81 exams due to heterogeneous protocols (Figure 1), we analyzed 138 CMR exams using standard cardiomyopathy or myocarditis protocols. CMR studies utilized either a rapid RT short axis (SAX) cine (spatial resolution of 2.5 mm2 or better and temporal resolution of 55 ms or better) or standard breath-held (BH) SAX cine protocol (Figure 2). Protocols were chosen by the interpreting physician. Previous internal quality control demonstrated similar volumetric quantification between RT and BH SAX cines. RT cines were reconstructed inline using a CS-based method. We analyzed the length of time needed to complete each protocol and the number of series performed. Statistical analysis included student t-test with p value <0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Of 138 analyzed CMR exams, there were 23 rapid protocols and 115 standard protocols performed. The mean image acquisition time for the rapid protocol was significantly shorter at 26  6 minutes (range 18-44 min) vs 33  6 minutes (range 22-49 min) for the standard protocol, p < 0.001. This represents a mean relative reduction in scan time of 21%. More time was saved in rapid myocarditis (scan time 25  6 min vs 34  6 min, p = 0.01; relative time reduction 26%) vs rapid cardiomyopathy protocols (scan time 27  6 min vs 31  6 min, p = 0.04; relative time reduction 13%). There was no significant difference in the number of series performed (62  14 series in rapid vs 67  11 series in standard protocols, p = 0.09). T1 and T2 maps constituted the same percentage of acquired images regardless of protocol used (T1 maps 1.8% vs 1.7% for cardiomyopathy, 1.4% vs 1.4% for myocarditis in standard vs rapid protocols respectively; T2 maps 1.8% vs 1.7% for cardiomyopathy, 5.6% vs 5.8% for myocarditis in standard vs rapid protocols respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A rapid CMR protocol utilizing a CS-based RT imaging is significantly shorter as compared to the standard protocol with adequate diagnostic quality.

Blood RNA is an important biological resource for precision medicine and translational medicine. However, few studies have assessed the human transcriptome profiles and microbial communities composition and diversity of peripheral blood from different cell isolation methods, which could affect the reproducibility of researches. We collected peripheral blood from three healthy donors and processed it immediately. We used RNA sequencing to investigate the effect of three leukocyte isolation methods including buffy coat (BC) extraction, red blood cell (RBC) lysis and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation with the comparison with whole blood (WB), through analyzing the sensitivity of gene detection, the whole transcriptome profiling and microbial composition and diversity. Our data showed that BC extraction with high globin mRNA mapping rate had similar transcriptome profiles with WB, while RBC lysis and PBMC isolation depleted RBCs effectively. With the efficient depletion of RBC and distinct compositions of leukocyte subsets, RNA-seq of RBC lysis and PBMC isolation uniquely detected genes from specific cell types, like granulocytes and NK cells. In addition, we observed that the microbial composition and diversity were more affected by individuals than isolation methods. Our results showed that blood cell isolations could largely influence the sensitivity of detection of human genes and transcriptome profile.

In the UK, a childs cumulative cancer risk increases from 1 in 4690 from birth to aged 1, to 1 in 470 by age 15. Once diagnosed, access to treatments offers survival to adulthood for over 80%. Tumour diagnoses are at a later stage and mortality is higher when compared with those in other parts of Europe. This means higher risk, more intensive therapies for a cure. Some CYPs are known to experience delays to diagnosis which may further contribute to poor outcomes. This study aims to understand the current pathway of childhood cancer referrals and diagnosis and quantify diagnostic intervals in the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective multicentre observational study including all tertiary childhood cancer treatment centres in the UK. CYP (0C18 years) with a new diagnosis of cancer over the study period will be invited to participate. Data will be collected at initial diagnosis and 5 years after diagnosis. Data will include demographic details, clinical symptoms, tumour location, stage and clinical risk group. In addition, key diagnostic dates and referral routes will be collected to calculate the diagnostic intervals. At 5 years follow-up, data will be collected on refractory disease, relapse and 1-year and 5-year survival.

In a screen for new models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identified human H522 lung adenocarcinoma cells as naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite complete absence of ACE2 expression. Remarkably, H522 infection requires the E484D S variant; viruses expressing wild-type S are not infectious. Anti-S monoclonal antibodies differentially neutralize SARS-CoV-2 E484D S in H522 cells as compared to ACE2-expressing cells. Sera from vaccinated individuals block this alternative entry mechanism, whereas convalescent sera are less effective. Though the H522 receptor remains unknown, depletion of surface heparan sulfates block H522 infection. Temporally resolved transcriptomic and proteomic profiling reveal alterations in cell cycle and the antiviral host cell response, including MDA5-dependent activation of type-I interferon signaling.

Objective: Assess the practical performance of RT-PCR based surveillance protocols, and the extent of undetected SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Shenzhen, China. Design: Cohort study nested in a public health response. Setting: Shenzhen, China; January-May 2020. Participants: 880 PCR-negative close-contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 400 residents without known exposure (main analysis). Fifty-seven PCR-positive case contacts (timing analysis). Measurements: Virological testing by RT-PCR. Measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in PCR-negative contacts 2-15 weeks after initial testing using total Ab ELISA. Rates of undetected infection, performance of RT-PCR over the course of infection, and characteristics of seropositive but PCR-negative individuals were assessed. Results: The adjusted seropositivity rate for total Ab among 880 PCR-negative close-contacts was 4.1% (95%CI, 2.9% to 5.7%), significantly higher than among residents without known exposure to cases (0.0%, 95%CI, 0.0% to 1.0%). PCR-positive cases were 8.0 times (RR; 95% CI, 5.3 to 12.7) more likely to report symptoms than the PCR-negative individuals who were seropositive, but otherwise similar. RT-PCR missed 36% (95%CI, 28% to 44%) of infected close-contacts, and false negative rates appear to be highly dependent on stage of infection. Limitations: No serological data were available on PCR-positive cases. Sample size was limited, and only 20% of PCR-negative contacts met inclusion criteria.

A semi-quantitative CT scoring system was used for estimating lung abnormalities of each lobe. Results: : All patients received nasal cannula or/and high-flow mask oxygen therapy. Admission occurred 9 days (IQR, 5-13) after symptom onset. The median in-hospital period was 18 days (IQR, 11-26). The last follow-up chest CT was performed 66 days (IQR, 61-77) after symptom onset. Total CT scores in follow-up decreased significantly compared to that of performed in-hospital ([3, IQR, 0-5] to [13, IQR, 10-16], P < 0.001). Predominant patterns on follow-up chest CT performed 64 days after symptom onset were subpleural parenchymal bands (47%, 9/19) and complete radiological resolution (37%, 7/19). Consolidation absorbed earlier than ground-glass opacity did, and subpleural parenchymal bands were the longest-lasting feature during radiological resolution. Conclusions: : Radiological abnormalities in patients of severe COVID-19 could be completely absorbed with no residual lung injury in more than two months follow-up. Serial chest CT scans could be used as a monitoring modality to help clinician better understand the disease course.","output":"Follow-up Chest CT findings from discharged patients with severe COVID-19: an 83-day observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the data of Turkish health care workers practicing chest medicine on their coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) status and related parameters. METHODS This descriptive study included online survey data that the Turkish Thoracic Society conducted with its members in two phases starting in June and December 2020. The 33-item survey included demographic data, smoking status, the presence of any chronic diseases, occupation, working status, and non-work-related and work-related COVID-19 exposure characteristics. RESULTS Of 742 responses, 299 (40.3%) reported that they had contracted COVID-19. The second survey detected a higher frequency of health care workers who had contracted COVID-19 (12.1% versus 57.4%, p<0.001) than the first survey. The analysis of the association between study parameters and COVID-19 in health care workers using logistic regression revealed statistical significance with working at the onset of the outbreak (OR 3.76, 95%CI 1.09-12.98, p=0.036), not working at the time of survey (OR 5.69, 95%CI 3.35-9.67, p<0.001), COVID-19 history in colleagues (OR 2.27, 95%CI 1.51-3.41, p<0.001), any non-work-related COVID-19 exposure (OR 4.72, 95%CI 2.74-8.14, p<0.001), COVID-19 exposure at home (OR 6.52, 95%CI 3.52-12.08, p<0.001), and COVID-19 history in family members (OR 8.16, 95%CI 5.52-12.08, p<0.001) after adjusting for age and sex. The study also observed an inverse relationship between the use of aprons and goggles and COVID-19 in health care workers.

In the current study, 108 LILRB1 alleles were identified by screening the LILRB1 locus from the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 database. Forty-six alleles that occurred in three or more individuals encode 28 LILRB1 allotypes, and the inferred LILRB1 allotypes were then grouped into 9 LILRB1 D1-D2 variants for further analysis. We found that variants 1, 2, and 3 represent the three most frequent LILRB1 D1-D2 variants and the nine variants show frequency differences in populations. The binding assay demonstrated that variant 1 bound to HLA class I with the highest avidity, and all tested LILRB1 D1-D2 variants bound to HLA-C with lower avidity than to HLA-A and -B. Locus-specific polymorphisms at positions 183, 189, and 268 in HLA class I and dimorphisms in HLA-A (positions 207 and 253) and in HLA-B (position 194) affect their binding to LILRB1. Notably, the electrostatic interaction plays a critical role in the binding of LILRB1 to HLA class I as revealed by electrostatic analysis and by comparison of different binding avidities caused by polymorphisms at positions 72 and 103 of LILRB1. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the population genetics and binding abilities of LILRB1.

INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the experimental arm of GETAFIX will receive standard treatment for COVID-19 at the discretion of the treating clinician plus favipiravir. These patients will receive a loading dose of favipiravir on day 1 of 3600mg (1800mg 12 hours apart). On days 2-10, patients in the experimental arm will receive a maintenance dose of favipiravir of 800mg 12 hours apart (total of 18 doses). Patients randomised to the control arm of the GETAFIX trial will receive standard treatment for COVID-19 at the discretion of the treating clinician. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome being assessed in the GETAFIX trial is the efficacy of favipiravir in addition to standard treatment in patients with COVID-19 in reducing the severity of disease compared to standard treatment alone. Disease severity will be assessed using WHO COVID 10 point ordinal severity scale at day 15 +/- 48 hours. All randomised participants will be followed up until death or 60 days post-randomisation (whichever is sooner). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to the experimental versus control arm using computer generated random sequence allocation. A minimisation algorithm incorporating a random component will be used to allocate patients. The factors used in the minimisation will be: site, age (16-50/51-70/71+), history of hypertension or currently obsess (BMI>30 or obesity clinically evident; yes/no), 7 days duration of symptoms (yes/no/unknown), sex (male/female), WHO COVID-19 ordinal severity score at baseline (1/2or 3/4). BLINDING (MASKING): No blinding will be used in the GETAFIX trial. Both participants and those assessing outcomes will be aware of treatment allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): In total, 302 patients will be randomised to the GETAFIX trial: 151 to the control arm and 151 to the experimental arm. There will be an optional consent form for patients who may want to contribute to more frequent PK and PD sampling. The maximum number of patients who will undergo this testing will be sixteen, eight males and eight females. This option will be offered to all patients who are being treated in hospital at the time of taking informed consent, however only patients in the experimental arm of the trial will be able to undergo this testing.

We explore the expression profiles of SARS-CoV-2 host genes, their population variations, associated genetic variants, age- and sex-dependency in normal individuals. SARS-CoV-2 host genes are provisionally defined as the human genes that are experimentally validated or bioinformatically predicted to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Genes exhibiting most variable expression include ACE2, CLEC4G, CLEC4M, CD209 (interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein); REEP6 (a receptor accessory protein expressed in the olfactory epithelium); SLC27A2 and PKP2 (inhibit virus replication); and PTGS2 (mediates fever response). SNP rs4804803, associated with SARS severity, affects expression of CLEC4G and CD209. Genetic variants of proteases associated with SARS-CoV-2 entry (TMPRSS2, CTSB, and CTSL) are strongly associated with their expression variation, suggesting a genetic contribution to phenotypic variations in multiple organs upon virus attack. The most significant age-dependent gene is ACE2, the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Others include TGF- family member GDF15, mediating inflammation, and VKORC1, possibly explaining vitamin K deficiency in COVID-19. TIMM10 and ERGIC1 exhibit significant sex differences.

In light of the disappointing findings in previous surveys, a survey was conducted to assess patient perceptions and characterize patient experiences/levels of satisfaction with post-surgical pain management. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Survey included a random sample of US adults who had undergone surgery within 5 years from the survey date. Participants were asked about their concerns before surgery, severity of perioperative pain, pain treatments, perceptions about post-surgical pain and pain medications, and satisfaction with treatments they received. RESULTS Of the 300 participants, 86% experienced pain after surgery; of these, 75% had moderate/extreme pain during the immediate post-surgical period, with 74% still experiencing these levels of pain after discharge. Post-surgical pain was the most prominent pre-surgical patient concern, and nearly half reported they had high/very high anxiety levels about pain before surgery. Approximately 88% received analgesic medications to manage pain; of these, 80% experienced adverse effects and 39% reported moderate/severe pain even after receiving their first dose. STUDY LIMITATIONS Key study limitations include the relatively small population size, potential for recall bias associated with the 14-month average time delay from surgery date to survey date, and the inability to account for influences of type of surgery and intraoperative anesthetic/analgesic use on survey results. CONCLUSIONS Despite heightened awareness and clinical advancements in pain management, there has been little improvement in post-surgical analgesia as measured by this survey of post-surgical patients.","output":"Incidence, patient satisfaction, and perceptions of post-surgical pain: results from a US national survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disorder in children, and the prevalence of paediatric type 1 and type 2 diabetes continue to rise globally.

HISTORY: Rehabilitation developed in a piecemeal way, focused on specific problems: spinal cord injury, burns, polio, stroke, back pain, equipment and adaptations etc. Rehabilitation is also provided using other names (e.g. intermediate care). Patients with complex needs do not fit easily within this system. SYSTEM FAILURE: After Covid-19, patients have problems that cross existing condition-specific and/or treatment-specific services. Covid-19 has exposed the lack of any coherent organisational principle underlying development or commissioning of rehabilitation services. Consequently, in order to have their needs met, patients either have to engage with two or more separate services or they receive good management for some problems and sub-optimal management for other problems. THE GOALS: The multitude of small specific services need to coalesce into an integrated service able to meet all the needs of any patient referred. Second, rehabilitation needs to be fully integrated into all healthcare services. A SOLUTION: The purpose of healthcare is to 'improve our health and well-being .a??.a??. to stay as well as we can to the end of our lives'. (NHS constitution) All healthcare services need to consider patients holistically, giving equal attention to disease, disability, and distress.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 40 patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-artery occlusion were treated in five European centers. Clinical and procedural data were collected; self-reported angiographic results and neurologic outcome (discharge and 90 days) were assessed in a standardized manner. RESULTS The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at admittance was 16; no patient was treated after 12 h. Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) was received by 65 % of patients. The territorial distribution was as follows: 87.5 % in the anterior circulation: 62.5 % middle cerebral artery and 25 % internal carotid artery (ICA) terminus, comprising 20 % tandem occlusions; and 12.5 % in the posterior circulation, all of which were vertebrobasilar. Revascularization of TICI 2b-3 was achieved in 38 of 40 (95 %) treatments. Additional devices were utilized in 11 of 40 (28 %) cases after a mean of 2.6 passes with EmboTrap prior to switching. The mean number of EmboTrap passes needed was 1.8, with a mean procedural time to reperfusion of 54 min. One patient (2.5 %), who had not received IVT, experienced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage post-interventionally. Procedural complications were encountered in 2 of 40 cases (5 %); both patients exhibited ICA dissection that was treated conservatively without clinical sequelae. There were no device-related complications. Of 23 available patients, 8 (35 %) had a good outcome after 90 days. CONCLUSION The procedural results from these five centers suggest that EmboTrap is technically safe.

As RHDV does not replicate in cell culture, variant viruses were selected by serially passaging a highly virulent RHDV field isolate in immunologically na?ve laboratory rabbits that were passively immunised 18C24 hours post-challenge with a neutralising monoclonal antibody. After seven passages, two amino acid substitutions in the P2 domain of the capsid protein became fixed within the virus population. Furthermore, a synonymous substitution within the coding sequence of the viral polymerase appeared and was also maintained in all subsequent passages. These findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that RHDV evolution can be experimentally manipulated to select for virus variants with altered phenotypes, in this case partial immune escape.","output":"An in vivo system for directed experimental evolution of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis continues.

Due to the necessity of certain and fundamental solutions regarding this fact, in the last part of our study, suggestions were made on how these groups, including street vendors, can participate in the management. Disadvantaged groups are the groups most affected by these crises in times of local, regional, national, or international disasters and crises.

The nature and magnitude of these two impacts are not directly comparable, but both have contributed to profoundly transforming the region. As extreme COVID-19 containment measures were implemented nationwide, the tourism industry contracted by 98% as over 23 million visitors failed to arrive in 2020 and 400 daily flights stopped landing at Cancun Airport. Sargassum accumulations on Caribbean beaches, and their collection, containment and removal had been a challenging socioeconomic issue in the Caribbean region years before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the tourist industry. We explore Becks concept of a risk society as an approach to these socioenvironmental impacts. We analyze five premises about risk society, combining them with a mainly ethnography methodology involving 61 informants. We present the results in terms of impacts. Using the concept of trajectory based on pandemic event chronology, we review the main stages of the pandemic during the research period (May to July 2020) and how the studied population worked to prevent virus infection and spread. We employ narratives to analyze risk perception both of the Sargassum influx and the pandemic. The discussion highlights the importance of moving beyond nature/society dichotomies and dualisms. In summary, the profound transformations caused by these impacts provide a unique opportunity for the Mexican Caribbean to reconstitute itself in a way that encompasses the world risk society concept, perhaps in a more socially and environmentally resilient incarnation.","output":"Covid-19 and Sargassum blooms: impacts and social issues in a mass tourism destination (Mexican Caribbean)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Unique patient identification remains a challenge in many health care settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Without national-level unique identifiers for whole populations, countries rely on demographic-based approaches that have proven suboptimal. Affordable biometrics-based approaches, implemented with consideration of contextual ethical, legal, and social implications, have the potential to address this challenge and improve patient safety and reporting accuracy. However, limited studies exist to evaluate the actual performance of biometric approaches and perceptions of these systems in LMICs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance and acceptability of fingerprint technology for unique patient matching and identification in the LMIC setting of Kenya. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study conducted at an HIV care and treatment facility in Western Kenya, an open source fingerprint application was integrated within an implementation of the Open Medical Record System, an open source electronic medical record system (EMRS) that is nationally endorsed and deployed for HIV care in Kenya and in more than 40 other countries; hence, it has potential to translate the findings across multiple countries. Participants aged >18 years were conveniently sampled and enrolled into the study. Participants left thumbprints were captured and later used to retrieve and match records. The technologys performance was evaluated using standard measures: sensitivity, false acceptance rate, false rejection rate, and failure to enroll rate. The Wald test was used to compare the accuracy of the technology with the probabilistic patient-matching technique of the EMRS. Time to retrieval and matching of records were compared using the independent samples 2-tailed t test. A survey was administered to evaluate patient acceptance and satisfaction with use of the technology. RESULTS: In all, 300 participants were enrolled; their mean age was 36.3 (SD 12.2) years, and 58% (174/300) were women. The relevant values for the technologys performance were sensitivity 89.3%, false acceptance rate 0%, false rejection rate 11%, and failure to enroll rate 2.3%. The technologys mean record retrieval speed was 3.2 (SD 1.1) seconds versus 9.5 (SD 1.9) seconds with demographic-based record retrieval in the EMRS (P<.001). The survey results revealed that 96.3% (289/300) of the participants were comfortable with the technology and 90.3% (271/300) were willing to use it. Participants who had previously used fingerprint biometric systems for identification were estimated to have more than thrice increased odds of accepting the technology (odds ratio 3.57, 95% CI 1.0-11.92). CONCLUSIONS: Fingerprint technology performed very well in identifying adult patients in an LMIC setting. Patients reported a high level of satisfaction and acceptance. Serious considerations need to be given to the use of fingerprint technology for patient identification in LMICs, but this has to be done with strong consideration of ethical, legal, and social implications as well as security issues.","output":"Implementation of Fingerprint Technology for Unique Patient Matching and Identification at an HIV Care and Treatment Facility in Western Kenya: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, is an RNA virus that has inherent high rate of mutation Due to the mutations, the virus evolves at a rapid pace that helps them to survive better inside the host One of the hotspots of pharmacological interventions is to inhibit binding of virus with the host cells, which is mediated by Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors present on the human cells This study was conducted with an aim to identify and characterise the mutation (s) present in the Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 Towards this, an in silico methodology was used, and the mutations on Spike glycoprotein were identified by comparing the Spike glycoprotein of first reported sequence from Wuhan wet seafood market virus with the available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian isolates Our analysis revealed the presence of twenty-five mutations in Spike glycoprotein among Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates These mutations spread all over the protein and can be clustered at least into four distinct positions Further, mutations at eleven positions exhibited alterations in the secondary structure of the polypeptide chain We also investigated the influence of these mutations on overall protein dynamics and have shown that they affect the dynamic stability of the Spike glycoprotein","output":"Identification of twenty-five mutations in surface glycoprotein (Spike) of SARS-CoV-2 among Indian isolates and their impact on protein dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"#x203A; Infection of the respiratory tract is the most common reason for seeking medical advice and hospital admission in children.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-five plasma doses collected by plasmapheresis from COVID-19 convalescent donors were subjected to MB plus visible light PRT. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD S1 epitope IgGs antibodies were quantified by ELISA. Titres of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies (NtAbs) were measured before and after the PRT process. A Spearman's correlation was run to determine the relationship between antibody neutralisation ability and SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA ratio. Pre- and post-inactivation neutralising antibody titres were evaluated using a Wilcoxon test. RESULTS The plasma pathogen reduction procedure did not diminish NtAbS titres and so did not cause a change in the viral neutralisation capacity of CCP. There was a strong correlation between pre-and post-PRT NtAbs and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgGs titres. DISCUSSION Our results showed PRT with MB did not impair the CCP passive immunity preserving its potential therapeutic potency. Therefore, PRT of CCP should be recommended to mitigate the risk for transmission of transfusion-associated infectious disease. There is a good correlation between SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres determined by ELISA and the neutralising capacity.

METHOD From 1990 to 2007, patients with rectal tumour below 6 cm from the anal verge and treated by open or laparoscopic curative intersphincteric resection were included in a retrospective comparative study. Surgery included total mesorectal excision with internal sphincter excision and protected low coloanal anastomosis. Neoadjuvant treatment was given to patients with T3 or N+ tumours. Recurrence and survival were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the Logrank test. Function was assessed using the Wexner continence score. RESULTS Intersphincteric resection was performed in 175 patients with low rectal cancer: 110 had laparoscopy and 65 had open surgery. The two groups were similar according to age, sex, body mass index, ASA score, tumour stage and preoperative radiotherapy. Postoperative mortality (zero) and morbidity (23%vs 28%; P = 0.410) were similar in both groups. There was no difference in 5-year local recurrence (5%vs 2%; P = 0.349) and 5-year disease-free survival (70%vs 71%; P = 0.862). Function and continence scores (11 vs 12; P = 0.675) were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION Intersphincteric resection did not alter long-term tumour control of low rectal cancer. The safety and efficacy of the laparoscopic approach for intersphincteric resection are suggested by a similar short- and long-term outcome as obtained by open surgery.","output":"Intersphincteric resection for low rectal cancer: laparoscopic vs open surgery approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oropouche virus (ORO), family Bunyaviridae, is the second most frequent cause of arboviral febrile illness in Brazil.

Innate immune response is critical for the host defense against viral infection and the dysregulation of the host innate immune responses probably aggravates SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the high morbidity and lethality of COVID-19. It has been reported that some coronavirus proteins play an important role in modulating innate immunity of the host, but few studies have been conducted on SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we screened the viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the viral ORF6, ORF8 and nucleocapsid proteins were potential inhibitors of type I interferon signaling pathway, a key component for antiviral response of host innate immune. All the three proteins showed strong inhibition on type I interferon (IFN-?) and NF-&#954;B-responsive promoter, further examination revealed that these proteins were able to inhibit the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) after infection with Sendai virus, while only ORF6 and ORF8 proteins were able to inhibit the ISRE after treatment with interferon beta.

There is a growing interest in the development of novel agents, while our understanding of molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma continues to expand. With identification of various molecular pathways in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis, potential targets for drug development have been pursued with the use of monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors. Although preclinical studies with multiple targeted therapies demonstrated encouraging results in pancreatic cancer, only erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, showed a marginal survival benefit in a phase III clinical trial, when combined with gemcitabine. As further signaling pathways and their importance in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis are better understood, further clinical trials will need to be designed to study these targeted agents as single agents, in combination with other novel agents or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.

It is unsurprising then, that in its aftermath, arguments that regulatory reform, absent a changed culture, will be ineffective gained momentum. The succession of corporate and banking scandals post-GFC, both globally and locally, suggests that corporations and banks have failed to address their cultural failings. Meanwhile, the perceived failure of regulators to hold to account wrongdoing corporations and directors, by not prosecuting them, has weakened public confidence and trust in the financial sector, regulators and political oversight. Indeed, trust in public institutions in Western liberal democracies is at an all-time low.

An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs might be useful for triage or infection control within a hospital setting, but prior reports have been limited by small data sets, poor data quality, or both. PURPOSE: To present DeepCOVID-XR, a deep learning AI algorithm to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs, that was trained and tested on a large clinical data set. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DeepCOVID-XR is an ensemble of convolutional neural networks developed to detect COVID-19 on frontal chest radiographs, with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test results as the reference standard. The algorithm was trained and validated on 14 788 images (4253 positive for COVID-19) from sites across the Northwestern Memorial Health Care System from February 2020 to April 2020 and was then tested on 2214 images (1192 positive for COVID-19) from a single hold-out institution. Performance of the algorithm was compared with interpretations from five experienced thoracic radiologists on 300 random test images using the McNemar test for sensitivity and specificity and the DeLong test for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: A total of 5853 patients (mean age, 58 years  19 [standard deviation]; 3101 women) were evaluated across data sets. For the entire test set, accuracy of DeepCOVID-XR was 83%, with an AUC of 0.90. For 300 random test images (134 positive for COVID-19), accuracy of DeepCOVID-XR was 82%, compared with that of individual radiologists (range, 76%C81%) and the consensus of all five radiologists (81%). DeepCOVID-XR had a significantly higher sensitivity (71%) than one radiologist (60%, P < .001) and significantly higher specificity (92%) than two radiologists (75%, P < .001; 84%, P = .009). AUC of DeepCOVID-XR was 0.88 compared with the consensus AUC of 0.85 (P = .13 for comparison). With consensus interpretation as the reference standard, the AUC of DeepCOVID-XR was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.98).

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES We hypothesized that dogs with OSA could be treated safely by ex vivo activated T-cells that were generated by autologous cancer vaccination and supported by interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment with survival more than twice that reported for amputation alone. ANIMALS Osteosarcoma-bearing dogs (n = 14) were enrolled in a single-arm prospective trial after complete staging before amputation. Four healthy dogs also were treated in a safety study. METHODS Autologous cancer cell vaccinations were administered intradermally and dogs underwent leukapheresis. Mononuclear cell products were stimulated ex vivo with a T-cell-activating agent. Activated product was transfused and 5 SC IL-2 injections were administered q48h. Dogs were monitored for metastasis by thoracic radiography every 3 months. RESULTS Autologous cancer cell vaccine and activated cellular therapy (ACT) products were successfully generated. Toxicity was minimal after premedicants were instituted before ACT. With premedication, all toxicities were grade I/II. Median disease-free interval for all dogs was 213 days. One dog developed cutaneous metastasis but then experienced spontaneous complete remission. Median survival time for all dogs was 415 days. Five dogs survived >730 days. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE This immunotherapy protocol without cytotoxic chemotherapy is safe and tolerable.

This may be due in part to guidelines particularly recommending that older adults stay at home, given their elevated risk of COVID-19 complications. However, little is known about the extent to which this population experienced greater intensity in momentary loneliness during versus before the pandemic, and how this relates to their real-time contexts. Here, we build upon recent findings from the Chicago Health and Activity Space in Real-Time (CHART) study that revealed associations between momentary contexts and loneliness among older adults. We analyze ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) from both pre- and during COVID-19 among a subsample of CHART respondents (N = 110 older adults age 65C88 in 2020). Pre-pandemic data were collected across three waves from April 2018COctober 2019, and pandemic data were collected across three additional waves from JuneCSeptember 2020. Participants responded to smartphone pings (five per day for 7 days per wave; N = 5596 and N = 7826 before and during the pandemic, respectively) by reporting their momentary loneliness and context (e.g., home). Findings from multi-level regression models suggest that respondents were lonelier in mid-2020 than in years prior, as well as when at home and alone; they were also more likely to be at home during the pandemic. However, the loneliness-inducing effects of being at home (vs. outside the home) and alone (vs. with others) were weaker during versus before COVID-19. Results provide important nuance to broader trends in loneliness among older adults during the pandemic. Specifically, older adults may have adopted new technologies to support social connectedness. It is also possible that, during a time in which social and physical distancing characterized public health guidelines, these contexts grew less isolating as they became a shared experience, or that publicly shared spaces provided fewer opportunities for social engagement.","output":"Home alone together: Differential links between momentary contexts and real-time loneliness among older adults from Chicago during versus before the COVID-19 pandemic()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Postmortem studies are crucial for providing insight into emergent diseases However, a complete autopsy is frequently not feasible in highly transmissible diseases due to biohazard challenges Minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) is a needle-based approach aimed at collecting samples of key organs without opening the body, which may be a valid alternative in these cases We aimed to: (a) provide biosafety guidelines for conducting MIAs in COVID-19 cases, (b) compare the performance of MIA versus complete autopsy, and (c) evaluate the safety of the procedure Between October and December 2020, MIAs were conducted in six deceased patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, in a basic autopsy room, with reinforced personal protective equipment Samples from the lungs and key organs were successfully obtained in all cases A complete autopsy was performed on the same body immediately after the MIA The diagnoses of the MIA matched those of the complete autopsy In four patients, COVID-19 was the main cause of death, being responsible for the different stages of diffuse alveolar damage No COVID-19 infection was detected in the personnel performing the MIAs or complete autopsies In conclusion, MIA might be a feasible, adequate and safe alternative for cause of death investigation in COVID-19 cases","output":"Minimally Invasive Autopsy Practice in COVID-19 Cases: Biosafety and Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate knowledge of prior population exposure has critical ramifications for preparedness plans for future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves and vaccine prioritization strategies.

We previously reported two human monoclonal antibodies that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike and exhibit strong neutralization activity against live and pesudotyped MERS-CoV infection. Here we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD bound to the Fab fragment of MERS-27 antibody at 3.20 ? resolution. The MERS-27 epitope in the RBD overlaps with the binding site of the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4. Further biochemical, viral entry, and neutralization analyses identified two critical residues in the RBD for both MERS-27 recognition and DPP4 binding. One of the residues, Trp535, was found to function as an anchor residue at the binding interface with MERS-27. Upon receptor binding, Trp535 interacts with the N-linked carbohydrate moiety of DPP4. Thus, MERS-27 inhibits MERS-CoV infection by directly blocking both protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4.

Membrane strength is determined by the energetics and dynamics of membrane pores, whose tension-dependent nucleation and growth leads to rupture. Creation of nanoscale membrane pores is central to exocytosis, trafficking and other processes fundamental to life that require breaching of secure plasma or organelle membranes, and is the basis for biotechnologies using drug delivery, delivery of genetic material for gene editing and antimicrobial peptides. A prevailing view from seminal electroporation and membrane rupture studies is that pore growth and bilayer rupture are controlled by macroscopically long-lived metastable defect states that precede fully developed pores. It was argued that defect nucleation becomes rate-limiting at high tensions, explaining the exponential tension-dependence of rupture times [E. Evans et al., Biophys. J. 85, 2342-2350 (2003)]. Here we measured membrane pore free energies and bilayer rupture using highly coarse-grained simulations that probe very long time scales. We find no evidence of metastable pore states. At lower tensions, small hydrophobic pores mature into large hydrophilic pores on the pathway to rupture, with classical tension dependence of rupture times. Above a critical tension membranes rupture directly from a small hydrophobic pore, and rupture times depend exponentially on tension. Thus, we recover the experimentally reported regimes, but the origin of the high tension exponential regime is unrelated to macroscopically long-lived pre-pore defects. It arises because hydrophilic pores cannot exist above a critical tension, leading to radically altered pore dynamics and rupture kinetics.","output":"Membrane pore energetics and the pathways to membrane rupture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the work was to develop and validate the COVID-19 Risk Perception Scale (CoRP), a brief self-report questionnaire for individuals perceptions of risk in the COVID-19 pandemic.

But unlike previous studies which concentrated on intestinal microbiota and infection, our focus is on respiratory system's microbiota and respiratory viral infection, bearing in mind that respiratory system is a proper entry site and residence for viruses, and whereby infection, can lead to asymptomatic, mild, self-limiting, severe or even fatal infection. Finally, we overgeneralize the effects of microbiota on COVID-19 infection. In addition, we reviewed the articles about effects of the microbiota on coronaviruses and suggest some new therapeutic measures.","output":"Dual and mutual interaction between microbiota and viral infections: a possible treat for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID has largely affected organizations and individuals. The current study explores the effect of covid on food industries in the Middle East. We have found that during the pandemic, people tend to choose eating home-cooked meals instead of ordering from restaurants as they think it is unsafe to do so. This resulted in an improvement in their cooking skills. Additionally, it is clear that the availability of essential foodstuff hasnt been majorly affected by the outbreak. Our observations strongly support the fact that people are spending more money on groceries than they used to before the outbreak, and the majority prefers to do so through applications and websites that offer delivery of groceries.

COPD and asthma are public health issues in Brazil. PLATINO study reported a COPD prevalence of 15.8% and most patients (87.5%) are undiagnosed. For asthma, the overall prevalence is 10%, and 56% of them are undiagnosed. The Brazilian healthcare system is based on universal access which causes significant system overload. The main impact on spirometry is a waiting list longer than one year. Delaying access to this exam may cause sub-optimal disease management, significant prejudice to quality of life and reduction of life expectancy. This major obstacle to proper patient care inspired a public-private partnership that has been enabling broader access to spirometry since 2012. The tests are performed by technicians certified by the Brazilian Thoracic Society (SBPT) using Cosmed? MicroQuark? equipment. DESCRIPTION In March 2020, spirometry testing had to be discontinued after a formal recommendation by SBPT in face of COVID-19. This unexpected interruption with no predictable time for resuming activities was expected to impact quality of care. In order to overcome this emerging biologic hazard, we designed a portable cabin equipped with HEPA/ULPA filter to diminish the potential risk of virus spread. (Figure) The design prioritized safety, but also delivered easy assembly. The plastic cover is washable and must be sanitized after each spirometry assessment. The cabin is portable, fitting within a suitcase, an essential requirement since many technicians travel from town to town, all over the country. DISCUSSION The prototype was put to test and succeeded. We assessed interference to spirometry results, HEPA/ULPA filter functionality, easiness to assemble and sanitize the cabin, and active observation of air leakage. We started the production of 20 cabins that will be distributed among the technicians. SBPT already revised their positioning and recommended cautious resumption of the exams. When public health facilities decide to resume the spirometry tests, our technicians will be ready to safely perform them. We believe the biosafe cabin can be easily replicated by other countries, mainly developing ones, where access to healthcare is challenging and biologic hazards, such as tuberculosis, can be a significant hurdle to diagnosis and adequate management of chronic respiratory conditions. ?Figure. Images illustrate the proportions of the cabin in comparison to an adult technician and a regular suitcase (left) and the actual prototype (right).","output":"Biosafe Cabin for Spirometry in Response to COVID-19 Restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Naturally abundant quinones are important molecules, which play essential roles in various biological processes due to their reduction potential. In contrast to their universality, the investigation of reactions between quinones and proteins remains sparse. Herein, we report the development of a convenient strategy to protein modification via a biomimetic quinone-mediated oxidation at the N-terminus. By exploiting unique reactivity of an ortho-quinone reagent, the -amine of protein N-terminus is oxidized to generate aldo or keto handle for orthogonal conjugation. The applications have been demonstrated using a range of proteins, including myoglobin, ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-related modifier 2 (SUMO2). The effect of this method is further highlighted via the preparation of a series of 17 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1) analogs, followed by preliminary anti-HIV activity and cell viability assays, respectively. This method offers an efficient and complementary approach to existing strategies for N-terminal modification of proteins.","output":"Modification of N-terminal -amine of proteins via biomimetic ortho-quinone-mediated oxidation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionFinal year medical students are perceived to be ill-prepared for the challenges of a newly qualified doctor Evidence supports the suspicion that mortality and morbidity is higher on the first Wednesday of August, the day of junior doctor change over in the United kingdom1 In-situ simulation is encouraged as a strategy to improve patient safety due to its high fidelity and evidence of improved organisational learning2,3 For this reason our institute has provided a series of in-situ simulation scenarios for the foundation year one (FY1) doctors during their induction period Following Covid-19 pandemic, final year medical students were encouraged to participate in paid apprenticeships As a result, many students had prior experience and exposure to unwell patients before starting their placement as an FY1 The aim of this study was to identify whether in-situ simulation was felt to be useful and the paid apprenticeship affected confidence when compared to previous groups MethodologyFY1 Doctors at our institution were invited to participate in a high-fidelity in-situ simulated scenario in a clinical area, followed by a debrief focusing on management of a deteriorating patient, severe sepsis, and non-technical skills The study involved a pre and post-scenario questionnaire were demographic data, information on confidence and views on simulation as an educational modality and the perceived impact of the apprentice scheme were collected The data from this cohort of newly qualified doctors was compared to previous cohorts from 2014C2019 Results39 candidates participated in this years study There was a 100% response rate to both the pre and post scenario questionnaire 78% of the candidates enrolled onto the apprenticeship scheme with the majority(1/3) of the cohort finding the scheme quite useful, 5% not useful and over ? stating extremely useful When assessing confidence in management of acutely unwell patients there was no significant difference between the 2 groups All 39 candidates felt simulation was a useful learning tool and found the in-situ simulation a positive experience 95% expressed improved confidence in managing an unwell patient following the session ConclusionIn-situ simulation is a practical method for the detection of latent error and is used to reinforce learning4 This study shows that FY1 doctors regardless of whether or not they were involved in paid apprenticeship, felt simulation was an useful and felt more confident managing acutely unwell patients following the high fidelity in-situ simulation scenario ReferencesS?rensen, J L , ?stergaard, D , LeBlanc, V et al Design of simulation-based medical education and advantages and disadvantages of in situ simulation versus off-site simulation BMC Med Educ17, 20 ( 2017) https://doi org/10 1186/s12909-016-0838-3Jen MH, Bottle A, Majeed A, Bell D, Aylin P Early in-hospital mortality following trainee doctors first day at work PLoS One 2009;4(9):e7103 Published 2009 doi:10 1371/ 0007103Patterson MD, Geis GL, Falcone RA, et al In situ simulation: detection of safety threats and teamwork training in a high risk emergency department BMJ Quality & Safety 2013;22:468C477 Riley, W ;Lownik, E ;Parrotta, C ;RN, K M ;Davis, S Creating high reliability teams in healthcare through in situ simulation training Adm Sci 2011;1:14C31","output":"PG22 Is the role of in-situ simulation for foundation year one doctors justified following paid internship as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory that became popular and mainstream over the past few years. Worryingly, the QAnon conspiracy theory has implications in the real world, with supporters of the theory participating in real-world violent acts like the US capitol attack in 2021. At the same time, the QAnon theory started evolving into a global phenomenon by attracting followers across the globe and, in particular, in Europe. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how the QAnon theory became a worldwide phenomenon and how this dissemination has been happening in the online space. This paper performs a large-scale data analysis of QAnon through Telegram by collecting 4.5M messages posted in 161 QAnon groups/channels. Using Google's Perspective API, we analyze the toxicity of QAnon content across languages and over time. Also, using a BERT-based topic modeling approach, we analyze the QAnon discourse across multiple languages. Among other things, we find that the German language is prevalent in QAnon groups/channels on Telegram, even overshadowing English after 2020. Also, we find that content posted in German and Portuguese tends to be more toxic compared to English. Our topic modeling indicates that QAnon supporters discuss various topics of interest within far-right movements, including world politics, conspiracy theories, COVID-19, and the anti-vaccination movement. Taken all together, we perform the first multilingual study on QAnon through Telegram and paint a nuanced overview of the globalization of the QAnon theory.","output":"On the Globalization of the QAnon Conspiracy Theory Through Telegram"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought immense psychological pressure and disruptions to daily life for all individuals, and particularly children, parents, and families. Despite these difficulties, parents are able to show resilience through adaptive coping and positive parenting behaviors. Although there is robust research on resilience in children, very little research has tested predictors of parental resilience. The present study presents descriptive information about mothers' pandemic-related stressors and positive changes and then tests whether prepandemic maternal well-being and child effortful control predicted mothers' resilient parental outcomes (positive behavior and coping) through the mediators of maternal self-compassion, adherence to family routines, and child coping. The sample comprised 95 mothers (95.38% European American, 3.2% African American, and 1.1% Asian American) with a mean age of 38.21 years (SD = 5.71 years, Range = 25.72-51.60 years) and education ranging from a high school to an advanced degree (M = 16.26 years, SD = 2.28 years, Range = 12-21 years). Results revealed that prepandemic maternal well-being predicted adaptive coping both directly and indirectly through self-compassion. Children's effortful control predicted maternal adaptive coping indirectly through children's own adaptive coping, and predicted mothers' positive parenting behaviors directly. Posthoc models revealed adherence to routines to be a correlate and outcome, rather than predictor, of positive parenting and bidirectional relations between parent and child coping.

We hypothesize that interleukin 6 (IL-6) trans-signaling may be a critical mediator of MNC-MC crosstalk and necessary for the pathogenesis of CLAD. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained after the diagnosis of CLAD has approximately 2-fold higher IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) levels compared to matched pre-CLAD samples. Human BAL-derived MCs do not respond to treatment with IL-6 alone but have rapid and prolonged JAK2-mediated STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation when exposed to the combination of IL-6 and sIL-6R. STAT3 phosphorylation within MCs upregulates numerous genes causing increased invasion and fibrotic differentiation. MNC, a key source of both IL-6 and sIL-6R, produce minimal amounts of these proteins at baseline but significantly upregulate production when cocultured with MCs. Finally, the use of an IL-6 deficient recipient in a murine orthotopic transplant model of CLAD reduces allograft fibrosis by over 50%. Taken together these results support a mechanism where infiltrating MNCs are stimulated by resident MCs to release large quantities of IL-6 and sIL-6R which then feedback onto the MCs to increase invasion and fibrotic differentiation.","output":"Interleukin 6 trans-signaling is a critical driver of lung allograft fibrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern diagnostics is in general based on molecular biology methods.

With the migration of people, the epidemic has rapidly spread within China and throughout the world. Due to the severity of the epidemic, undiscovered transmission of COVID-19 deserves further investigation. The aim of our study hypothesized possible modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and how the virus may have spread between two family clusters within a residential building in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we monitored and traced confirmed patients and their close contacts from January 11 to February 5, 2020 in Guangzhou, China, including 2 family cluster cases and 61 residents within one residential building. The environmental samples of the building and the throat swabs from the patients and from their related individuals were collected for SARS-CoV-2 and tested with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The relevant information was collected and reported using big data tools. RESULTS: There were two notable family cluster cases in Guangzhou, which included 3 confirmed patients (family No.1: patient A, B, C) and 2 confirmed patients (family No.2: patient D, E), respectively. None of patients had contact with other confirmed patients before the onset of symptoms, and only patient A and patient B made a short stop in Wuhan by train. Home environment inspection results showed that the door handle of family No.1 was positive of SARS-CoV-2. The close contacts of the 5 patients all tested negative of SARS-CoV-2 and in good health, and therefore were released after the official medical observation period of 14-days. Finally, according to the traceability investigation through applying big data analysis, we found an epidemiological association between family No.1 and family No.2, in which patient D (family No.2) was infected through touching an elevator button contaminated by snot with virus from patient A (family No.1) on the same day. CONCLUSIONS: Contaminants with virus from confirmed patients can pollute the environment of public places, and the virus can survive on the surface of objects for a short period of time. Therefore, in addition to the conventional droplet transmission, there is also indirect contact transmission such as snot-oral transmission that plays a crucial role in community spread of the virus.","output":"The evidence of indirect transmission of SARS-CoV-2 reported in Guangzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may leave behind an altered health status early after recovery.

We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data point and also for Italy, Germany, Spain, and New York City over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. In late June 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to 14.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two-thirds of cross-country variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 14.0% between March 9 and June 30, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case-fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs.

Individuals with DS have more risk of infections with respiratory complications and present signs of auto-inflammation. They also present with multiple comorbidities that are associated with poorer COVID-19 prognosis in the general population. All this might place DS individuals at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or poorer clinical outcomes. In order to get insight into the interplay between DS genes and SARS-cov2 infection and pathogenesis we identified the genes associated with the molecular pathways involved in COVID-19 and the host proteins interacting with viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2. We then analyzed the overlaps of these genes with HSA21 genes, HSA21 interactors and other genes consistently differentially expressed in DS (using public transcriptomic datasets) and created a DS-SARS-CoV-2 network. We detected COVID-19 protective and risk factors among HSA21 genes and interactors and/or DS deregulated genes that might affect the susceptibility of individuals with DS both at the infection stage and in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our analysis suggests that at the infection stage DS individuals might be more susceptible to infection due to triplication of TMPRSS2, that primes the viral S protein for entry in the host cells. However, as the anti-viral interferon I signaling is also upregulated in DS, this might increase the initial anti-viral response, inhibiting viral genome release, viral replication and viral assembly. In the second pro-inflammatory immunopathogenic phase of the infection, the prognosis for DS patients might worsen due to upregulation of inflammatory genes that might favor the typical cytokine storm of COVID-19. We also detected strong downregulation of the NLRP3 gene, critical for maintenance of homeostasis against pathogenic infections, possibly leading to bacterial infection complications.","output":"Network analysis of Down syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 identifies risk and protective factors for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the United States (US) and elsewhere have ignited debate over whether to reinstate shelter-in-place policies adopted early in the pandemic to slow the spread of infection.

Passive eating monitoring could enhance lapse measurement via objective assessment of eating characteristics that could be markers for lapse (e.g., more bites consumed). The purpose of this study was to evaluate if passively-inferred eating characteristics (i.e., bites, eating duration, and eating rate), measured via wrist-worn device, could distinguish dietary lapses from non-lapse eating. Adults (n = 25) with overweight/obesity received a 24-week lifestyle modification intervention. Participants completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated smartphone surveys) biweekly to self-report on dietary lapses and non-lapse eating episodes. Participants wore a wrist device that captured continuous wrist motion. Previously-validated algorithms inferred eating episodes from wrist data, and calculated bite count, duration, and rate (seconds per bite). Mixed effects logistic regressions revealed no simple effects of bite count, duration, or eating rate on the likelihood of dietary lapse. Moderation analyses revealed that eating episodes in the evening were more likely to be lapses if they involved fewer bites (B = -0.16, p < .05), were shorter (B = -0.54, p < .05), or had a slower rate (B = 1.27, p < .001).

Radiomics features were extracted from non-contrast chest CT images preoperatively. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used for radiomics feature extraction and radiomics signature construction. Clinical characteristics, subjective CT findings, and radiomics signature were used to develop a predictive radiomics nomogram.

METHODS: Male C57BL/6N mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat, n = 12) or standard control diet (9 kcal% fat, n = 10) for 15 weeks. At the end of the study period, cardiac function was assessed by ultra-high frequency echocardiography, and hearts were processed for further analyses. The three-dimensional myocardial microstructure was examined ex vivo at a spatial resolution of 100  100  100 m(3) by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) at 7T. Myocardial deformation, diffusion metrics and fiber tract geometry were analyzed with respect to the different myocardial layers (subendocardium/subepicardium) and segments (base/mid-cavity/apex). Results were correlated with blood sample analyses, histopathology, and gene expression data. RESULTS: HFD feeding induced significantly increased body weight combined with a pronounced accumulation of visceral fat (body weight 42.3  5.7 vs. 31.5  2.2 g, body weight change 73.7  14.8 vs. 31.1  6.6%, both P < 0.001). Obese mice showed signs of diastolic dysfunction, whereas left-ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening remained unchanged (E/e 41.6  16.6 vs. 24.8  6.0, P < 0.01; isovolumic relaxation time 19  4 vs. 14  4 ms, P < 0.05). Additionally, global longitudinal strain was reduced in the HFD group (?15.1  3.0 vs. ?20.0  4.6%, P = 0.01), which was mainly driven by an impairment in basal segments. However, histopathology and gene expression analyses revealed no myocardial fibrosis or differences in cardiomyocyte morphology. Mean diffusivity and eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor were lower in the basal subepicardium of obese mice as assessed by DT-MRI (P < 0.05). The three-dimensional fiber tract arrangement of the left ventricle (LV) remained preserved. CONCLUSION: Fifteen weeks of high-fat diet induced alterations in myocardial diffusion properties in mice, whereas no remodeling of the three-dimensional myofiber arrangement of the LV was observed. Obese mice showed reduced longitudinal strain and lower mean diffusivity predominantly in the left-ventricular base, and further investigation into the significance of this regional pattern is required.","output":"Assessment of Myocardial Microstructure in a Murine Model of Obesity-Related Cardiac Dysfunction by Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging at 7T"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is one of the coronaviruses causing a mild common cold, but few studies have been made on this strain.

METHODS: Understanding the possible positive consequences of the pandemic on the individual level is crucial for the development of supportive psychosocial interventions. The present paper aims to: 1) evaluate the levels of PTG in the general population; 2) to identify predictors of each dimension of post-traumatic growth. RESULTS: The majority of the sample (67%, N = 13,889) did not report any significant improvement in any domain of PTG. Participants reported the highest levels of growth in the dimension of appreciation of life (2.3  1.4), while the lowest level was found in the spiritual change (1.2  1.2). Female participants reported a slightly higher level of PTG in areas of personal strength (p < .002) and appreciation for life (p < .007) compared to male participants, while no significant association was found with age. At the multivariate regression models, weighted for the propensity score, only the initial week of lockdown (between 9-15 April) had a negative impact on the dimension of relating to others (B = ?.107, 95% CI = ?.181 to ?.032, p < .005), while over time no other effects were found. The duration of exposure to lockdown measures did not influence the other dimensions of PTG.

To profile the viruses causing ARI in children admitted to a community\\\\based hospital in central Taiwan, a cross\\\\sectional study was conducted on children under 14 years of age that were hospitalized with febrile ARI. Viral etiology was determined using conventional cell culture and a commercial respiratory virus panel fast assay (xTAG RVP), capable of detecting 19 different respiratory viruses and subtype targets. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded and analyzed. The RVP fast assay identified at least one respiratory virus in 130 of the 216 specimens examined (60.2%) and rose to 137 (63.4%) by combining the results of cell culture and RVP fast assay. In order of frequency, the etiological agents identified were, rhinovirus/enterovirus (24.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (13.8%), adenovirus (11.5%), parainfluenza virus (9.2%), influenza B (8.4%), influenza A (5.4%), human metapneumovirus (4.6%), human coronavirus (2%), and human bocavirus (2%). Co\\\\infection did not result in an increase in clinical severity. The RVP assay detected more positive specimens, but failed to detect 6 viruses identified by culture. The viral detection rate for the RVP assay was affected by how many days after admission the samples were taken (P = 0.03). In conclusion, Rhinovirus/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus were prevalent in this study by adopting RVP assay.

Services were continued via teleconsultation mode during the Circuit Breaker (enhanced movement restriction) period. Specific workflow processes, IT infrastructure, and staff training were put in place to support smooth running of this service. Segregation of services into two teams based at two separate sites and implementation of stringent infection control measures surrounding the clinic visit by providers, patients and their families were incorporated to ensure safety. Measures were also taken to ensure providers mental wellbeing. Results The clinical service was continued for the majority of our patients with a lowest reduction in patient consultations to half of baseline during the Circuit Breaker period. We received positive feedback from families for teleconsultation services provided. Conclusion We have been able to continue services in our DBP clinics due to our dynamic reassessment of workflow processes and their prompt implementation in conjunction with the hospital and national public health response to the pandemic. Given that this pandemic is likely to be long drawn, our unit remains ready to constantly adjust these workflows and make adaptations as we go along, together with the support for mental health of patients, parents and staff.

Methods Adult outpatients at least 6 months after HT were screened from May 2021 to July 2021 to have their routine EMBx replaced by a combination of GEP and -cfDNA. Demographics, modification of immunosuppression (IS) and outcomes (hospital admission, rejection, and need for EMBx) were collected. Results Among 90 patients, 31 (33%) were enrolled, and 37 non-invasive tests were performed. The median time after HT was 2 years and patients were predominantly Caucasian (52%) and male (68%). 53% had a history of acute cellular rejection during the first year and 32% had cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Of the tests performed, 23 (60%) were - GEP / - -cfDNA, 10 (27%) were + GEP / - -cfDNA, 4 (11%) were - GEP / + -cfDNA and none were + GEP / + -cfDNA. Being bridged with a VAD (OR = 5.5, p=0.034) and a history of a previously treated CMV (OR = 16.0, p=0.003) were associated with a positive GEP and a negative -cfDNA result. Having received a COVID vaccine in the last 3 months did not affect GEP results (GEP was positive in 23.8% after vaccination vs 33.3% in non-vaccinated patients, p=0.690;average GEP score 29.8 vs 30.7, p=0.673). The 4 patients with a + -cfDNA (range 0.19 - 0.81%) underwent an EMBx with no significant cellular or antibody mediated rejection, thus avoiding 89% of the EMBx. No unscheduled clinic visits, emergency department or hospital admissions were recorded. After non-invasive testing, the IS was reduced in 16 cases (43.2%). IS was reduced in in 59% of patients with negative concordant tests (- GEP / - -cfDNA), 30% in patients with + GEP / - -cfDNA and no reduction in IS occurred in those with + -cfDNA. Conclusion The combination of GEP and -cfDNA for rejection surveillance allowed for a marked reduction in EMBx (89%) and for a personalized downtitration of IS without adverse events in the short term.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) broke out in 2003 and 2012, respectively. These viruses have some structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. These proteins assist the virus in infecting cells through interaction with cell receptors, penetration into the cell, and proliferation. These coronavirus proteins are modified by post-translational modifications (PTMs) which activate various functional and interactional activities of proteins. This study aimed to investigate the PTMs in SARS-CoV/CoV-2, as well as to examine the effect of these PTMs on the pathogenicity of these two viruses. Methods: In this study, PTMs sites were detected by different bioinformatics tools. Evaluation and comparison of PTMs were performed and their roles in structural proteins activities of SARS-CoV/CoV-2 coronaviruses were examined in order to gain a richer understanding of these modifications relationships with the protein activities. Results: The PTMs sum and percentages of four structural proteins of SARS-CoV/CoV-2 were evaluated, with a focus on their effects on viral replication and pathogenesis in order to develop a method for treating these diseases. According to our study results, some of the PTMs in SARS-CoV/CoV-2 were different from each other. Conclusion: It was concluded that SARS-CoV-2 had more pathogenicity than SARS-CoV.

To understand and monitor properly the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic, population based seroprevalence studies are a valid tool for the infection rates and effective prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2. Aim: In this prospective study, we assessed the changes in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates among non-vaccinated blood donors in South-Eastern Italy over May 2020 to March 2021. Methods: 8,183 healthy blood donors referring to the Transfusion Center at the University Hospital Riuniti of Foggia (Italy) for blood donation in the period May 2020-March 2021 were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS 3600. None of the considered subjects had a diagnosed symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Results: Overall, 516 resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (6.3%, 95% CI, 0.03-0.15%), 387 (4.7%) were male and 129 (1.7%) female. A statistically significant increase in the seropositive population was found from May 2020 to March 2021 (Fisher's p<0.001). The difference of the seroprevalence was significant in terms of age but not sex (2-sided p<0.05 for age; 2-sided p>0.05 for sex) in both groups. Conclusion: Our study shows a significant increase in the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors and suggests a potential role of asymptomatic individuals in continuing the spread of the pandemic.

Currently, the accumulating information on the effects of the infection regarding the demographic and clinical characteristics of the disease, as well as outcomes within different DMTs? enable us to have better practices on the management of the Covid-19 infection in pwMS. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to reveal the relationship between the demographic-clinical and therapeutic features and the outcome of Covid-19 infection in a multi-center national cohort of pwMS. METHODS: The Turkish Neurological Society-MS Study Group in association with the Italian MuSC-19 Study Group initiated this study. A web-based electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) of Study-MuSC-19 were used to collect the data. The demographic data and MS histories of the patients were obtained from the file tracking forms of the relevant clinics. RESULTS: 309 MS patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection were included in this study. Two hundred nineteen (219) were females (70.9%). The mean age was 36.9, ranging from 18 to 66, 194 of them (62.8%) were under 40. The clinical phenotype was relapsing-remitting in 277 (89.6%) and progressive in 32 (10.4%). Disease duration ranged from 0.2 years to 31.4 years. The median EDSS was 1.5, ranging from 0 to 8.5. The EDSS score was<= 1 in 134 (43%) of the patients. 91.6% of the patients were on a DMT, Fingolimod was the most frequently used drug (22.0%), followed by Interferon (20.1%). The comorbidity rate is 11.7%. We were not able to detect any significant association of DMTs with Covid-19 severity. CONCLUSION: The Turkish MS-Covid-19 cohort had confirmed that pwMS are not at risk of having a more severe COVID-19 outcome irrespective of the DMT that they are treated. In addition, due to being a younger population with less comorbidities most had a mild disease further highlight that the only associated risk factors for having a moderate to severe COVID-19 course are similar with the general population such as having comorbid conditions and being older.","output":"The outcome of a national MS-Covid-19 study: What the Turkish MS cohort reveals?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The elementary operations on matrices are of great importance and utility since they are applied in obtaining the so-called equivalent matrices, which are related to each other in many important attributes.

Method: The racially diverse sample included 193 mothers who completed an online survey during late September-early October 2020. Results: Mothers reported increases in neglect and physical and psychological aggression during the pandemic were significantly related with established measures of maltreatment risk. Furthermore, path models indicated that maternal anger and worry about childrens behavior, as well as their interaction, were significantly related to indicators of physical aggression risk and neglect during the pandemic, but only maternal anger related to increased psychological aggression during the pandemic. Conclusions: Maternal worry and anger about childrens behavior may be exacerbating risk for maltreatment under the stressful conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest affective reactions of both parental worry and anger focused on child behavior warrants greater empirical attention and consideration in intervention efforts.","output":"Role of Emotion in Child Maltreatment Risk during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] This study aims at preparing electrospun chitosan/gelatin nanofiber scaffolds reinforced with different amounts of graphene nanosheets to be used as antibacterial and wound-healing scaffolds.

Raman and transmission electron microscopies confirmed the successful reinforcement of nanofibers with graphene nanosheets. Scanning electron microscopy and porosity revealed that nanofibers reinforced with 0.15% graphene nanosheets produced the least diameter (106  30 nm) and the highest porosity (90%), in addition to their good biodegradability and swellability. However, the excessive increase in graphene nanosheet amount produced beaded nanofibers with decreased porosity, swellability, and biodegradability. Interestingly, nanofibers reinforced with 0.15% graphene nanosheets showed E. coli and S. aureus growth inhibition percents of 50 and 80%, respectively. The cell viability assay showed no cytotoxicity on human fibroblasts when cultured with either unreinforced or reinforced nanofibers. The cell migration was higher in the case of reinforced nanofibers when compared to the unreinforced nanofibers after 24 and 48 h, which is substantially associated with the great effect of the graphene nanosheets on the cell migration capability.

The objective was to assess the impact of the pandemic in contact tracing and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in contacts of patients with pulmonary TB in Catalonia (Spain). METHODS: Contact tracing was carried out in cases of pulmonary TB detected during 14 months in the prepandemic period (1/1/2019 to 28/2/2020) and 14 months in the pandemic period (1/3/2020 to 30/4/2021). Contacts received the tuberculin skin test and/or interferon gamma release assay and it was determined whether they had TB or LTBI. Variables associated with TB or LTBI in contacts (study period and sociodemographic variables) were analyzed using adjusted odds ratio OR (aOR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The pre-pandemic and pandemic periods showed, respectively: 503 and 255 pulmonary TB reported cases (reduction of 50.7%); and 4676 and 1687 contacts studied (reduction of 36.1%). In these periods the proportion of TB cases among the contacts was 1.9% (84/4307) and 2.2% (30/1381) (p = 0.608); and the proportion of LTBI was 25.3% (1090/4307) and 29.2% (403/1381) (p < 0.001). The pandemic period was associated to higher LTBI proportion (aOR=1.3; 95%CI 1.1-1.5), taking into account the effect on LTBI of the other variables studied as sex, age, household contact and migrant status.

The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the perspective of RA patients on their insight into the current status of their disease, and to (2) investigate the patients perspective on the possible added value of a monitoring device based on optical spectral transmissioncalled the HandScanthat measures the location and severity of joint inflammation. A survey was distributed online among patients with RA in the Netherlands. Four-hundred and eight patients with RA completed the survey. Of these, 298 (73%) felt they have sufficient insight into their current disease status. Most respondents perceived either a large (n = 242; 59%) or small (n = 148; 36%) added value of the HandScan in their monitoring process, mostly because the device provides additional knowledge on the presence of inflammation. This perceived added value was higher for respondents experienced with the device (n = 46; p = .04). Respondents preferred monitoring with the device on every (n = 192; 47%) or most (n = 171; 42%) visits to the outpatient clinic, or even more often than on every visit (n = 17; 4%). Monitoring RA using an optical spectral transmission device is seen by patients as a possibly valuable addition to the monitoring process of inflammatory activity during visits to an outpatient clinic. Their main reason was that the device can increase insight into their current disease status. More insight may support patients in discussing treatment options with their rheumatologist.

Even if a rather mild course is assumed among pregnant women the measures to prevent transmission of the infection are of outstanding importance. METHODS: To screen asymptomatic pregnant women during admission to our university maternal hospital we focused on anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses. Hundred and fifty one women admitted to the hospital for childbirth or caesarean delivery were included. In case of suspicious anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibody levels an RT-PCR was performed to confirm an ongoing infection with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 89% showed negative results for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA antibodies, whereas 3% were borderline and 7% positive (both labeled as suspicious). In only one patient with suspicious serology we detected SARS-CoV-2-RNA in the following RT-PCR. 2% presented anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies, all being positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA. The observed positive rate of our study collective of 10.6% seemed much higher than the expected one (1.3%) based on the reports of the Robert Koch Institute and the specifications given by the test's manufacturer. The expected positive predictive value (PPV) was 4.3-6.7 times higher than the observed one. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first report of anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibody levels in the peripartum period of asymptomatic women. As the positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology poorly correlated with the confirmatory RT-PCR and the fact that mainly the detection of the virus by PCR correlates with the patient's infectiousness we suggest to rather perform a SARS-CoV-2-PCR-based admission screening in perinatal centers to prevent the spread of the disease.","output":"Peripartal anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA/IgG in asymptomatic pregnant women during regional SARS-CoV-2-outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The older population has a high mortality with COVID-19 and this cohort often presents atypically with infection.

METHODS: Cramer-Rao lower bound optimization was performed to determine optimal monopolar and optimal 2D samplings of the b-M1 space based on noise performance. Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate the bias and variability in estimates obtained using the proposed optimal samplings and conventional monopolar sampling. Diffusion MRI of the liver was performed in 10 volunteers using 3 IVIM acquisitions: conventional monopolar, optimized monopolar, and b-M1 -optimized gradient waveforms (designed based on the optimal 2D sampling). IVIM parameter maps of diffusion coefficient, perfusion fraction, and blood velocity SD were obtained using nonlinear least squares fitting. Noise performance (SDs), stability (outlier percentage), and test-retest or scan-rescan repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients) were evaluated and compared across acquisitions. RESULTS: Cramer-Rao lower bound and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated improved noise performance of the optimal 2D sampling in comparison to monopolar samplings. Evaluating the designed b-M1 -optimized waveforms in healthy volunteers, significant decreases (p < 0.05) in the SDs and outlier percentages were observed for measurements of diffusion coefficient, perfusion fraction, and blood velocity SD in comparison to measurements obtained using monopolar samplings. Good-to-excellent repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients  0.77) was observed for all 3 parameters in both the right and left liver lobes using the b-M1 -optimized waveforms.

METHODS: The subjects were 35 patients with COVID-19, and clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator were classified as having severe COVID-19. RESULTS: All 35 patients were diagnosed as having mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at admission, but the severity aggravated to severe in 8 patients (22.9%) in hospital. Hepatocellular-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum AST and/or ALT levels to &#8805; 3 times the ULN, was seen in 2 patients (5.7%), and cholestasis-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum ALP, ?3-GTP and/or total bilirubin levels to &#8805; twice the ULN, was seen in 4 patients (11.4%). A total of 9 patients (25.7%) fulfilled the criteria for liver injury. The percentage of patients with liver injury was higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in the remaining patients (P = 0.001). Both the hepatic CT attenuation values and the liver-to-spleen attenuation (L/S) ratios at admission were lower in the former patients than in the latter patients (P < 0.001).

RESULTS About 10% of the respondents had experienced high levels of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms since the SARS outbreak. Respondents who had been quarantined, or worked in high-risk locations such as SARS wards, or had friends or close relatives who contracted SARS, were 2 to 3 times more likely to have high PTS symptom levels, than those without these exposures. Respondents' perceptions of SARS-related risks were significantly positively associated with PTS symptom levels and partially mediated the effects of exposure. Altruistic acceptance of work-related risks was negatively related to PTS levels. CONCLUSIONS The psychological impact of stressful events related to an infectious disease outbreak may be mediated by peoples' perceptions of those events; altruism may help to protect some health care workers against these negative impacts.","output":"The psychological impact of the SARS epidemic on hospital employees in China: exposure, risk perception, and altruistic acceptance of risk."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Obesity has emerged as a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To inform treatment considerations the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 complications and the influence of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors deserves continued attention. OBJECTIVE: To determine if obesity is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 complications and mortality and examine the relationship between BMI, race, ethnicity, distressed community index and COVID-19 complications and mortality. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 1,019 SARS-CoV-2 positive adult admitted to an academic medical center (n = 928) and its affiliated community hospital (n-91) in New York City from March 1 to April 18, 2020. RESULTS: Median age was 64 years (IQR 52C75), 58.7% were men, 23.0% were Black, and 52.8% were Hispanic. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 75.2%; median BMI was 28.5 kg/m(2) (25.1C33.0). Over the study period 23.7% patients died, 27.3% required invasive mechanical ventilation, 22.7% developed septic shock, and 9.1% required renal replacement therapy (RRT). In the multivariable logistic regression model, BMI was associated with complications including intubation (Odds Ratio [OR]1.03, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]1.01C1.05), septic shock (OR 1.04, CI 1.01C1.06), and RRT (OR1.07, CI 1.04C1.10), and mortality (OR 1.04, CI 1.01C1.06). The odds of death were highest among those with BMI  40 kg/m(2) (OR 2.05, CI 1.04C4.04). Mortality did not differ by race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic distress score, though Black and Asian patients were more likely to require RRT. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Severe complications of COVID-19 and death are more likely in patients with obesity, independent of age and comorbidities. While race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status did not impact COVID-19 related mortality, Black and Asian patients were more likely to require RRT. The presence of obesity, and in some instances race, should inform resource allocation and risk stratification in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","output":"Obesity is independently associated with septic shock, renal complications, and mortality in a multiracial patient cohort hospitalized with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genesis of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was from Wuhan city, China in December 2019, which was later declared as a global pandemic in view of its exponential rise and spread around the world.

Activation of the Jak-Stat pathway by Interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-/) in lung epithelial cells is critical for innate immunity to respiratory viruses. Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that transcriptional regulation by IFN-/ required the formation of Interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3) complex consisting of Stat1, Stat2, and Irf9 transcription factors. Furthermore, IFN / receptor activates multiple signal transduction pathways in parallel to the Jak-Stat pathway and induces several transcription factors at mRNA levels resulting in the secondary and tertiary rounds of transcription. Transcriptional factor profiling in the transcriptome and RNA analysis revealed that Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) was rapidly induced by IFN-/ and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in multiple cell types. Studies in mutant cell lines lacking components of the ISGF-3 complex revealed that IFN- induction of Egr-1 was independent of Stat1, Stat2, or Irf9. Activation of the Mek/Erk-1/2 pathway was implicated in the rapid induction of Egr-1 by IFN- in serum-starved mouse lung epithelial cells. Interrogation of multiple microarray datasets revealed that respiratory viruses including coronaviruses regulated Egr-1 expression in human lung cell lines. Furthermore, Egr-1 inducible genes including transcription factors, mediators of cell growth, and chemokines were differentially regulated in the human lung cell lines after coronavirus infection, and in the lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients. Rapid induction by interferons, TLR ligands, and respiratory viruses suggests a critical role for Egr-1 in antiviral response and inflammation with potential implications for human health and disease.","output":"Regulation of early growth response-1 (Egr-1) gene expression by Stat1-independent type I interferon signaling and respiratory viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: During the late autumn to winter season (October to December) in the Republic of Korea, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen causing lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Interestingly, in 2014, human coronavirus (HCoV) caused not only upper respiratory infections but also LRTIs more commonly than in other years. Therefore, we sought to determine the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and severity of illnesses associated with HCoV infections at a single center in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with positive HCoV respiratory specimens between October 2014 and December 2014 who were admitted to Severance Childrens Hospital at Yonsei University Medical Center for LRTI. Charts of the patients with HCoV infection were reviewed and compared with RSV infection. RESULTS: During the study period, HCoV was the third most common respiratory virus and accounted for 13.7% of infections. Coinfection was detected in 43.8% of children with HCoV. Interestingly, one patient had both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63. Mild pneumonia was most common (60.4%) with HCoV, and when combined with RSV, resulted in bronchiolitis. Two patients required care in the intensive care unit. However, compared with that of RSV infection, the disease course HCoV was short. CONCLUSION: Infections caused by HCoVs are common, and can cause LRTIs. During an epidemic season, clinicians should be given special consideration thereto.

We attributed patients to each pediatric intern on the basis of notes written during their pediatric hospital medicine rotation to compare intern exposures with common inpatient diagnoses before and during the pandemic. We compared the median number of notes written per intern per block overall, as well as for each common inpatient diagnosis. RESULTS Median counts of notes written per intern per block were significantly reduced in the COVID-19 group compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (96 [interquartile range (IQR): 81-119)] vs 129 [IQR: 110-160]; P < .001). Median intern notes per block was lower in the COVID-19 group for all months except February 2021. Although the median number of notes for many common inpatient diagnoses was significantly reduced, they were higher for mental health (4 [IQR: 2-9] vs 2 [IQR: 1-6]; P < .001) and suicidality (4.5 [IQR: 2-8] vs 0 [IQR: 0-2]; P < .001).

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between October, 2020 and June, 2021, participants aged 18 years from San Diego, California, USA and Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico who injected drugs within the last month underwent interviews and testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. Binomial regressions identified correlates of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. RESULTS: Of 386 participants, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 36.3% (95% CI: 31.5%-41.1%); 92.1% had detectable IgM antibodies. Only 37.5% had previously been tested. Seroprevalence did not differ by country of residence. None tested RNA-positive. Most (89.5%) reported engaging in 1 protective behavior [e.g., facemasks (73.5%), social distancing (46.5%), or increasing handwashing/sanitizers (22.8%)].

Although it is essential for public health efforts to comprehensively identify which interventions have the largest impact on preventing new cases, most of the modeling studies that support such decision-making efforts have only considered a very small set of interventions. In addition, previous studies predominantly represented interventions as independent or examined a single scenario in which every possible intervention was applied. Reality has been more nuanced, as a subset of all possible interventions may be in effect for a given time period, in a given place. In this paper, we use cloud-based simulations and a previously published Agent-Based Model of COVID-19 (Covasim) to measure the individual and interacting contribution of interventions on reducing new infections in the US over 6 months. Simulated interventions include face masks, working remotely, stay-at-home orders, testing, contact tracing, and quarantining. Through a factorial design of experiments, we find that mask wearing together with transitioning to remote work/schooling has the largest impact.

Significant progress has been made in understanding the roles of canonical RNA sensing pathways in the host recognition of CHIKV; however, less is known regarding antagonism of CHIKV by cytosolic DNA sensing pathways like that of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING). With the use of cGAS or STING null cells we demonstrate that the pathway restricts CHIKV replication in fibroblasts and immune cells. We show that DNA accumulates in the cytoplasm of infected cells and that CHIKV blocks DNA dependent IFN- transcription. This antagonism of DNA sensing is via an early autophagy-mediated degradation of cGAS and expression of the CHIKV capsid protein is sufficient to induce cGAS degradation. Furthermore, we identify an interaction of CHIKV nsP1 with STING and map the interaction to 23 residues in the cytosolic loop of the adaptor protein. This interaction stabilizes the viral protein and increases the level of palmitoylated nsP1 in cells. Together, this work supports previous publications highlighting the relevance of the cGAS-STING pathway in the early detection of (+)ssRNA viruses and provides direct evidence that CHIKV interacts with and antagonizes cGAS-STING signaling.","output":"Chikungunya virus antagonizes cGAS-STING mediated type-I interferon responses by degrading cGAS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To develop a rapid detection reagent for SARS-CoV-2 antigen for the auxiliary diagnosis of new coronary pneumonia (COVID-19), and perform the methodological evaluation and clinical evaluation of the reagent.

The identification of SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney of COVID-19 patients suggests renal tropism of SARS-CoV-2. However, whether there is a specific target of SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney remains unclear. Herein, by using in silico simulation, co-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling, and rational design of antagonist peptides, we demonstrate that kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1), a molecule dramatically upregulated upon kidney injury, binds with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates its attachment to cell membrane, with the immunoglobulin variable Ig-like (Ig V) domain of KIM1 playing a key role in this recognition. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain and KIM1 is potently blockaded by a rationally designed KIM1-derived polypeptide AP2. In addition, our results also suggest interactions between KIM1 Ig V domain and the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, pathogens of two severe infectious respiratory diseases. Together, these findings suggest KIM1 as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

RESULTS: A total of 70 participants took part in the study, 35 participants had received one dose, and 35 had not been vaccinated. Participants described a willingness to be vaccinated to keep themselves and those around them safe and to avoid restrictions. Barriers to uptake included: (1) perceived lack of need for COVID-19 vaccinations, (2) concerns about the efficacy of vaccinations, (3) concerns about safety, and (4) access issues. Uptake appeared to be influenced by age and health status, trust in government, and knowledge and understanding of science. Introduction of vaccine passes may provide a motive for having a vaccine but may be viewed as coercive. CONCLUSION: Participants were hesitant, rather than opposed, and had questions about their need for, and the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Young people did not consider themselves to be at risk of becoming ill from COVID-19, did not think the vaccination was effective in preventing transmission, and did not think sufficient research had been conducted regarding possible long-term side-effects. Concerns were exacerbated by a lack of trust in government, and misunderstanding of science. To promote uptake, public health campaigns should focus on the provision of information from trusted sources that explains the benefits of vaccination and addresses safety concerns more effectively.

The clustering results reveal that congestion maps of days of the same group have substantial similarity in their traffic conditions and dynamic.

Second, a consensus day is identified in each cluster as the most representative day of the community according to the congestion maps. Third, this information obtained from the historical data is used to predict traffic congestion propagation and travel times. Thus, the first measurements of a new day are used to determine which consensual day is the closest to this new day. The past observations recorded for that consensual day are then used to predict future traffic conditions and travel times.

METHODS: This multicenter, prospective noninferiority cohort study investigated the effect of a POCUS performing team in patient encounters for dyspnea. Before-and-after surveys assessing medical decision-making were administered to attending physicians. Primary outcome was change in most likely diagnosis after POCUS. This was assessed for noninferiority between encounters where the primary or US team performed POCUS. Secondary outcomes included change in differential diagnosis, confidence in diagnosis, interventions considered, and image quality. RESULTS: There were 156 patient encounters analyzed. In the primary team group, most likely diagnosis changed in 40% (95% confidence interval 28-52%) of encounters vs. 32% (95% confidence interval 22-41%) in the US team group.

We aimed to identify mechanisms underlying the racial/ethnic disparities in IPV among SGM, focusing on childhood experiences of violence, structural inequalities, and sexual minority stress. METHOD: 308 SGM assigned female-at-birth (AFAB; 82 White, 133 Black, 93 Latinx; age 16-31) self-reported on minor psychological, severe psychological, physical, and sexual IPV victimization and perpetration, and three proposed mechanisms: childhood violence (child abuse, witnessing interparental violence), structural inequalities (economic stress, racial discrimination), and sexual minority stressors (internalized heterosexism, anti-SGM victimization, low social support). Indirect effects of race on IPV victimization via hypothesized mechanisms were estimated using logistic regression with 5,000 bootstrapped samples. RESULTS: Compared to White participants, Black participants were 2.5-7.03 times more likely to report all eight IPV types; Latinx participants were 2.5-4.8 times more likely to experience four IPV types. Univariate indirect effects analyses indicated that these racial/ethnic disparities were partially explained by higher economic stress, racial/ethnic discrimination, and childhood violence experiences (for Black and Latinx participants) and lower social support (Black participants). In multivariate models, the most robust indirect effects were through racial/ethnic discrimination and childhood violence.

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by nucleotide analogs provides a promising antiviral strategy. One common group of RdRp inhibitors, 2'-modified nucleotides, are reported to exhibit different behaviors in the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp transcription assay. Three of these analogs, 2'-O-methyl UTP, Sofosbuvir, and 2'-methyl CTP, act as effective inhibitors in previous biochemical experiments, while Gemcitabine and ara-UTP show no inhibitory activity. To understand the impact of the 2'-modification on their inhibitory effects, we conducted extensive molecular dynamics simulations and relative binding free energy calculations using the free energy perturbation method on SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex (RTC) with these five nucleotide analogs. Our results reveal that the five nucleotide analogs display comparable binding affinities to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and they can all be added to the nascent RNA chain. Moreover, we examine how the incorporation of these nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) analogs will impact the addition of the next nucleotide. Our results indicate that 2'-O-methyl UTP can weaken the binding of the subsequent NTP and consequently lead to partial chain termination.

In 2013C2014, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreak led to $900 million to $1.8 billion in annual losses to US swine producers. Passive lactogenic immunity remains the most promising and effective way to protect neonatal suckling piglets from enteric diseases like PEDV. Protecting suckling piglets through lactogenic immunity is dependent on trafficking of pathogen-specific IgA plasmablasts to the mammary gland and accumulation of secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies in milk, defined as the gut-mammary-sIgA axis. Due to an impermeable placenta, piglets are born agammaglobulinic, and are highly susceptible to a plethora of infectious agents. They rely solely on colostrum and milk antibodies for maternal lactogenic immunity. Previous advances in the development of live and attenuated vaccines for another devastating diarrheal virus of pigs, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), provide insights into the mechanisms of maternal immunity and piglet protection. In this chapter, we will review previous research on TGEV-induced lactogenic immunity to provide a historical perspective on current efforts for PEDV control and vaccines in the swine industry. Identifying factors that influence lactogenic immunity and the gut-mammary-sIgA axis may lead to improved vaccine regimens for PEDV and other enteric pathogens in gestating swine and improved overall herd immunity, swine health and industry productivity.","output":"Lactogenic immunity and vaccines for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV): Historical and current concepts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the infection of a novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)], has become a pandemic.

A predictive estimation approach for the quanta emission rate (ERq) was recently proposed for SARS-CoV-2 using the droplet volume concentration of various expiratory activities. This study assesses the strength of the approach and uses novel predictive estimates of ERq to compare the contagiousness of respiratory pathogens. Methods: We applied the predictive approach to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS, measles virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, coxsackievirus, seasonal influenza virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and compared ERq estimates to values reported in literature. We calculated infection risk in a prototypical classroom and barracks to assess the relative ability of ventilation to mitigate airborne transmission. Results: Our median standing and speaking ERq estimate for SARS-CoV-2 (2.6 quanta hour (h)-1) is similar to active, untreated TB (3.1 h-1), higher than seasonal influenza (0.17 quanta h-1), and lower than measles virus (15 quanta h-1). We calculated event reproduction numbers above 1 for SARS-CoV-2, measles virus, and untreated TB in both the classroom and barracks for an activity level of standing and speaking at low, medium and high ventilation rates of 2.3, 6.6 and 14 liters per second per person, respectively. Conclusions: Our predictive ERq estimates are consistent with the range of values reported over decades of research. In congregate settings, current ventilation standards are unlikely to control the spread of viruses with upper quartile ERq values above 10 quanta h-1, such as SARS-CoV-2, indicating the need for additional control measures.","output":"THE AIRBORNE CONTAGIOUSNESS OF RESPIRATORY VIRUSES: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MITIGATION"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) is an interdisciplinary and dynamic modelling approach for the study of todays global challenges.

We propose a simple method to calculate a figure of merit FC to provide an early characterization of the disease status in country C. METHODS We use mathematical tools to adjust a Gaussian function to the daily increase of infected patients. Maximum value and full width half maximum of the Gaussian are characteristics of the development of the development of the pandemic in each country. These parameters are supplemented by the testing volume and the mortality rate to produce just one characterizing parameter: FC. In addition, the stability of the Gaussian fits was calculated within an entire week towards the end of the study period. Seventeen different countries were fully considered, while others are considered when discussing particular properties. Data employed is publically available. FINDINGS Fitted Gaussian functions render effective information about the development of COVID-19. The number of critical days vary between 11 (South Korea) and 52 (Mexico). FC varies between 1 (Australia) and 899 (Mexico). The epidemic appears stabilized in some countries and unstable in others. Some large countries are experiencing fast development of the propagation of the disease with high FC. A correlation between low (high) values of the mortality rate (and to some extent FC) and the presence (absence) of BCG vaccination is exposed. INTERPRETATION The adjustment of a Gaussian to daily data of COVID-19 in each country reveals the different propagation dynamics, properly characterized by the parameters proposed here. Testing plays a clear role to control the spread of the disease. Mortality rate spans more than one order of magnitude and is somewhat related to permanent massive BCG vaccination. The figure of merit, FC, introduced here spans more than 2 orders of magnitude which makes it a useful indicator to quickly find out the status of the pandemics in each territory. Geography plays a role: low population density and isolated countries can be efficient in controlling the spread of the disease.","output":"Rapid characterization of the propagation of COVID-19 in different countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 and is mostly person-to-person transmitted through respiratory droplets. The implications of the strategies implemented to prevent COVID-19 transmission on other infectious diseases are unclear. We aimed to appraise trends in the incidence of salmonellosis, shigellosis and campylobacteriosis in Israel during COVID-19 pandemic. Positive stool samples for Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter are reported on a monthly basis to the Israel Center for Disease Control from sentinel laboratories, within the framework of a surveillance network of bacterial culture-proven enteric diseases. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 of shigellosis, salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis were calculated. Mean rates before and after the local onset of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel were compared and Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) was calculated. Joinpoint was used to evaluate secular trends. The mean age-adjusted incidence rate of shigellosis in March-July 2020 was lower than the rate observed in March-July 2018-2019 (RRR = 86.6%), but also decreased for salmonellosis (RRR = 33.0%) and campylobacteriosis (RRR = 30.0%). Using Joinpoint we have shown that the decrease observed for shigellosis was significantly sharper (Annual Percent Change (APC) = -77.7) between February 2020 and May 2020 than for salmonellosis (APC = -14.0) between July 2019 and April 2020 and for campylobacteriosis (APC = -1.1) between January 2018 and July 2020. The preventive measures applied to reduce transmission of COVID-19, including social distancing and hand washing, were ecologically associated with a decreased risk of bacterial enteric diseases in Israel.

If not cleared, apoptotic neutrophils are postulated to release histotoxic granular contents. Since numerous cellular proteins are degraded during apoptosis, we sought to determine whether functional serine proteinases are indeed released by apoptosing neutrophils in vitro. In a coculture system, cytokine-activated neutrophils induced detachment in the human epithelial cell line, A549. This process was CD18- and serine proteinase-dependent. Early apoptotic neutrophils induced significant detachment, but live, senescent, resting neutrophils and terminal, secondary necrotic neutrophils had a different effect. This detachment process was CD18-independent but serine proteinase-dependent. Similarly, detachment occurred with primary human small airway epithelial cells. Notably, epithelial cell detachment correlated with the transition of early apoptotic neutrophils to secondary necrosis and with the accumulation of elastase in the supernatant. The membrane integrity of lung epithelial cells was damaged in advance of significant cell detachment. These observations suggest that not only live activated neutrophils but also apoptosing neutrophils can reveal functional elastase activities.

METHODS: We interviewed 25 directors of OTP programs located throughout the United States. Note takers wrote summaries of each interview which were coded for topics and themes covered in the interview guide, including changes to clinic practices, take-home medications, telehealth, patient and staff reactions to new COVID-related protocols, and financial concerns for programs. RESULTS: Most programs rapidly incorporated new regulatory requirements, and directors were generally positive about the impact of increased take-home doses of medication and increased reliance on telehealth. Some directors voiced concerns about these changes, and some reported that patients missed the daily clinical contact with staff. Directors also suggested that more time was needed to assess the full impact of these changes. Financial impacts varied, although many directors were quick to point out that the ongoing opioid epidemic has delivered a steady stream of new patients, thus offsetting potential financial losses.

However, some studies have shown that the prevention and management of respiratory diseases is inadequate in these institutions. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of grassroots institutions throughout China between September and December 2020 based on the standardized Prevention and Treatment System and Capacity Building Project of Respiratory Diseases in primary care settings. The operation of the respiratory department in primary health care institutions was evaluated in terms of facilities, drugs, personnel and management of chronic diseases by means of questionnaires. Descriptive analyses were performed to calculate percentages and frequencies of key parameters. RESULTS: A total of 144 primary health care institutions were surveyed, including 51 in the east, 82 in the west, 9 in the central and 2 in the northeast. Approximately 60% of institutions had spirometers and pulse oximeters. The majority had short-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine. More than half had at least one respiratory physician and operator for spirometry. Half of the institutions carried out screening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease within the jurisdiction. The institutions in the east were superior to those in the west regarding the equipment, common drugs, medical staff, and management of respiratory diseases.

Progression of score was associated with an increase in 30-day mortality (OR 1.2). 30-day mortality was increased in patients with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (49.4% vs 29.2%). Severity of LUS score correlated with RV dysfunction (p < 0.05). Change in management occurred in 65% of patients following a combined scan. Conclusions: In COVID-19 patients there is an association between lung ultrasound score severity, RV dysfunction and mortality identifiable by combined LUS and FUSIC Heart. Our findings suggest that serial combined LUS and FUSIC Heart on COVID-19 ICU patients may aid in clinical decision making and prognostication.","output":"CORONA (COre ultRasOund of Covid in iNtensive Care & Acute Medicine) Study: National Service Evaluation of Lung and Heart Ultrasound in Intensive Care Patients With Suspected or Proven COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A viable electrochemical approach for the detection of dopamine (DA) in uric acid (UA) utilizing a silver nanoparticle-doped 2-aminodiphenylamine (AgNPs-2ADPA) electrode was invented.

METHODS: From the literature, 11 studies were randomly selected in which total or renal clearance or area under the curve of drugs in subjects with different degrees of renal impairment were predicted by PBPK models. In these published studies, drugs were given to subjects intravenously or orally. The PBPK model was generally a whole-body model whereas the GFR model was as follows: Predicted total clearance (CL(T)) = CL(T) in healthy subjects  (GFR in RI/GFR in H), Predicted AUC = AUC in healthy subjects  (GFR in H/GFR in RI), where H is the healthy subjects and RI is renal impairment. The predicted clearance or area under the curve values using PBPK and GFR models were compared with the observed (experimental pharmacokinetic) values. The acceptable prediction error was within the 0.5- to 2-fold or 0.5- to 1.5-fold prediction error. RESULTS: There were 33 drugs with a total number of 101 observations (area under the curve, total and renal clearance in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment). From PBPK and GFR models, out of 101 observations, 94 (93.1%) and 96 (95.0%) observations were within the 0.5- to 2-fold prediction error, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the predictive power of a simple GFR model is similar to a PBPK model for the prediction of clearance or area under the curve in subjects with renal impairment. The GFR method is simple, robust, and reliable and can replace complex empirical PBPK models.","output":"A GFR-Based Method to Predict the Effect of Renal Impairment on the Exposure or Clearance of Renally Excreted Drugs: A Comparative Study Between a Simple GFR Method and a Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article.","output":"Correction to: Psychological experience and coping strategies of patients in the Northeast US delaying care for infertility during the COVID-19 pandemic (Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology, (2021), 19, 1, (28), 10.1186/s12958-021-00721-4)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Targeted mass spectrometry is a promising technology for site-specific quantification of posttranslational modifications. However, a major constraint is the limited sensitivity for quantifying low-abundance PTMs, requiring the use of affinity reagents for enrichment. Herein, we demonstrate the direct site-specific quantification of ERK phosphorylation isoforms (pT, pY, pTpY) and their relative stoichiometry using a sensitive targeted MS approach termed high-pressure, high-resolution separations with intelligent selection, and multiplexing (PRISM). PRISM provides effective enrichment of target peptides into a given fraction from complex mixture, followed by selected reaction monitoring quantification. Direct quantification of ERK phosphorylation in human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) was demonstrated from as little as 25 g tryptic peptides from whole cell lysates. Compared to immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography, PRISM provided 10-fold higher signal intensities, presumably due to the better peptide recovery of PRISM. This approach was applied to quantify ERK phosphorylation dynamics in HMEC treated by different doses of epidermal growth factor at both the peak activation (10 min) and steady state (2 h). The maximal ERK activation was observed with 0.3 and 3 ng/mL doses for 10 min and 2 h time points, respectively. The dose-response profiles of individual phosphorylated isoforms showed that singly phosphorylated pT-ERK never increases significantly, while the increase of pY-ERK paralleled that of pTpY-ERK. This data supports for a processive, rather than distributed model of ERK phosphorylation.

Evidence from the initial nationwide lockdowns for COVID? 19 indicates that restricting human mobility is an effective strategy to contain the spread. While a direct correlation was observed early on, it is not known how mobility impacted COVID? 19 infection growth rates once lockdowns are lifted, primarily due to modulation by other factors such as face masks, social distancing, and the non-linear patterns of both mobility and infection growth. This paper introduces a piece-wise approach to better explore the phase-wise association between state-level COVID? 19 incidence data and anonymized mobile phone data for various states in the United States. Prior literature analyzed the linear correlation between mobility and the number of cases during the early stages of the pandemic. However, it is important to capture the non-linear dynamics of case growth and mobility to be usable for both tracking and forecasting COVID? 19 infections, which is accomplished by the piece-wise approach. The associations between mobility and case growth rate varied widely for various phases of the epidemic curve when the stay-at-home orders were lifted. The mobility growth patterns had a strong positive association of 0.7 with the growth in the number of cases, with a lag of 5 to 7 weeks, for the fast-growth phase of the pandemic, for only 20 states that had a peak between July 1st and September 30, 2020. Overall though, mobility cannot be used to predict the rise in the number of cases after initial lockdowns have been lifted. Our analysis explores the gradual diminishing value of mobility associations in the later stage of the outbreak. Our analysis indicates that the relationship between mobility and the increase in the number of cases, once lockdowns have been lifted, is tenuous at best and there is no strong relationship between these signals. But we identify the remnants of the last associations in specific phases of the growth curve.","output":"Exploring the relationship between mobility and COVID? 19 infection rates for the second peak in the United States using phase-wise association"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives While general principles related to vaccination hesitancy have been well-researched, reports on reluctance to be vaccinated for COVID-19 in the US are somewhat surprising given the diseases substantive disruption of everyday life.

Therefore, this study sought to identify factors associated with reported likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 among US adults in late January 2021. Study Design We used the Prolific online research panel to survey a nationally representative sample of 1,017 US adults. Methods Respondents were asked about their behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccination, trust in science, perceptions related to COVID-19, and selected sociodemographic factors. We computed associations between those 11 independent variables and likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 using multiple linear regression. Results Around 73.9% of respondents indicated at least some likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Trust in science and perceived seriousness of COVID-19 were positively associated, and identifying as Black or African American was negatively associated, with intention to get vaccinated.

Yet, their cardiovascular health risks are still unclear. We aimed to summarize the evidence base on this topic by conducting an updated umbrella review. RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 7 systematic reviews, totaling 183 studies and reports, ranging from in vitro and in animal studies to clinical studies in apparently healthy volunteers and patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. Overall, acute EVC use was associated with several toxic effects at molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and system level. In addition, EVC impacted adversely on blood pressure (BP) management, caused tachycardia, and worsened arterial stiffness. Finally, EVC use was associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events, including atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction, even if the causal link is still debated. Most reviews highlighted that the detrimental impact of EVC was of lesser magnitude of that of TCC. In addition, the differential impact of liquids and nicotine was not clearly disentangled. Finally, no review included studies on HNBC. SUMMARY: The present umbrella review suggests that EVC, and likely HNBC, despite clearly causing an increase in overall cardiovascular risk, may represent a temporary lesser evil than TCC in a risk-reduction or risk-modification strategy, aiming for eventual abstinence from all tobacco or nicotine products.","output":"Vaping Cardiovascular Health Risks: an Updated Umbrella Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID 19 is the first pandemic events that happen in Oman which requires all residents and nationals to practice quarantine and social distancing, there could be certain issues related to culture values and community that affect the practice of these measures.

Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a respiratory pathogen and causes severe infections with nonspecific symptoms. This study reports the hMPV occurrence and dissemination in southern Brazil and compares the frequency of occurrence of this virus and the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) in the epidemiological weeks in a three-year period (2009-2011). METHODS In total, 545 nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens from individuals with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) who were negative for other seven respiratory viruses were analyzed for the presence of hMPV. Human metapneumovirus was detected by direct immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS hMPV was detected in 109 patients from the main geographic regions of the southernmost state of Brazil, presenting similar overall prevalence in males (46.8%) and females (53.2%). Among children who were less than six years old, hMPV was detected in 99 samples of all age groups, with a higher frequency in infants who were less than one year old (45.7%) compared to all other age groups until six years. hMPV and hRSV infection occurred in almost the same epidemiological weeks (EWs) of each year, with peaks of incidence between EW 31/37 and EW 26/38 for the years 2009 and 2011, respectively. hMPV was further detected in several cases of SARS and it was the only virus detected in three deaths.

Results: A total of 1111 responded to the survey. The mean age of the participants was 33 years old, with mean years of experience of about 6.95 years. The majority of respondents (n=949) (85.4%) work in urban areas and come from various regions, including the west (n=407) (36.6%), east (n=195) (17.6%), north (n=150) (13.5%), south (n=150) (13.5%) and central region (n=209) (18.8%). More than half of the respondents were physicians (n=750) (67.5%) from different specialties, and the mean number of covid-19 patients seen by physicians was 5.68% per day. Conclusion: Participants in this study showed a positive attitude toward pulmonary rehabilitation. They believe their patients would benefit from Pulmonary rehabilitation, are interested in referring post-covid-19 patients to rehabilitation providers and co-managing their care, and would like more educational opportunities in order to increase their knowledge of the safety and efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation.","output":"Saudi Physicians' Awareness and Practice of Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Post-COVID-19 Syndrome Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the transmission of health records sharing and maintaining the integrity of data to receive the end-user is not consistent. Already, some countries decide to conduct lockdown using data models. In this scenario, the end user loss of integrity, loss of confidentiality and security on health records impacts the patients. The security of electronic health records (EHR) is a challenging task especially in COVID-19 like situations. It is a necessity to share secure EHR to physicians and patients which plays a vital role in COVID-19, and also data availability, scalability, and performance of data to receive the end-user is the loss of integrity. In this paper, we proposed an integrated approach of blockchain 4.0 technology used in IoT-based cloud environment that reduce the latency while transmission of health care records and introduce the blockchain-based electronic health records named as BEHR transmission between the physicians and patients.

Internationally, several groups developed non-conventional COVID-19 era emergency ventilator strategies as a stopgap measure when conventional ventilators were unavailable. Here, we compared our FALCON emergency ventilator in a rabbit model and compared its safety and functionality to conventional mechanical ventilation. METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits (n = 5) received mechanical ventilation from both the FALCON and a conventional mechanical ventilator (Engstr?m Carestation?) for 1 h each. Airflow and pressure, blood O(2) saturation, end tidal CO(2), and arterial blood gas measurements were measured. Additionally, gross and histological lung samples were compared to spontaneously breathing rabbits (n = 3) to assess signs of ventilator induced lung injury. RESULTS: All rabbits were successfully ventilated with the FALCON. At identical ventilator settings, tidal volumes, pressures, and respiratory rates were similar between both ventilators, but the inspiratory to expiratory ratio was lower using the FALCON. End tidal CO(2) was significantly higher on the FALCON, and arterial blood gas measurements demonstrated lower arterial partial pressure of O(2) at 30 min and higher arterial partial pressure of CO(2) at 30 and 60 min using the FALCON. However, when ventilated at higher respiratory rates, we observed a stepwise decrease in end tidal CO(2). Poincar plot analysis demonstrated small but significant increases in short-term and long-term variation of peak inspiratory pressure generation from the FALCON. Wet to dry lung weight and lung injury scoring between the mechanically ventilated and spontaneously breathing rabbits were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Although conventional ventilators are always preferable outside of emergency use, the FALCON ventilator safely and effectively ventilated healthy rabbits without lung injury. Emergency ventilation using accessible and inexpensive strategies like the FALCON may be useful for communities with low access to medical resources and as a backup form of emergency ventilation.

METHODS: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (2004C2016) a nationally representative sample with data available for children aged 2C15 years was used. Physical activity time, recreational screen time, and sleep time were calculated from time use diaries and classified as meeting guidelines or not based on the age-specific 24-h movement guidelines. Child general health and functional status were measured using the multidimensional Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Associations between meeting guidelines and PedsQL were assessed using linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: 8919 children were included. Each additional guideline met was associated with a 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39C0.65) increase in PedsQL total score. Compared with meeting no guidelines, the effect of meeting physical activity guidelines alone ( = 0.93, 95% CI 0.42C1.44) was larger compared to meeting screen ( = 0.66, 95% CI 0.06C1.27) or sleep time ( = 0.47, 95% CI 0.04C0.89) guidelines alone. The highest increment was observed in meeting both screen time and physical activity guidelines ( = 1.89, 95% CI 1.36C2.43).

OBJECTIVES We assess social indicators among people living in Arizona that are associated with access, use, and barriers to seeking HC services. RESEARCH DESIGN We analyzed data (n=8073) from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to describe demographic and health characteristics among persons by HC access and use, and for whom costs were a barrier to seeking care. RESULTS Among Arizona adults, 13.5% reported lacking HC coverage, 28.7% reported lacking a personal doctor, and medical costs were a barrier to seeking care for 14.1%. Arizonans aged 18-34 years or with a high school education or less more often reported lacking HC coverage, a personal doctor, or not visiting a doctor because of costs. Past year medical and dental checkups were less common among less educated (high school) and never married persons. Hispanic persons more often reported lacking HC coverage or not visiting a doctor because of costs, and less often reported past year dental checkups. CONCLUSIONS BRFSS can be analyzed to identify and quantify unique HC disparities, and the findings can serve as the basis for improving HC in communities.

Study Design and Setting Scientific databases were systematically searched to identify relevant trials of HCQ/CQ in COVID-19 published until 10th September, 2020. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tools for randomized trials and non-randomized studies of interventions were used to assess risk of bias of included studies. A 10-item Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) harms extension was used to assess for quality of harms reporting. Results Sixteen trials including fourteen randomized and two non-randomized trials met the inclusion criteria. The results from included trials were conflicting, lacked effect estimates adjusted for confounders and baseline disease severity or comorbidities in many cases, and recruited a fairly small cohort of patients. None of the clinical trials met the CONSORT criteria in full for reporting harms data in clinical trials. None of the sixteen trials had an overall low risk of bias, while four of the trials had high, critical, and serious risk of bias. Biases observed in these trials arise from the randomization process, potential deviation from intended interventions, outcome measurement, selective reporting, confounding, participant selection, and/or classification of interventions Conclusion In general, the quality of currently available evidence for the effectiveness of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 is suboptimal. The importance of a properly designed and reported clinical trial cannot be overemphasized amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its dismissal could lead to poorer clinical and policy decisions resulting in wastage of already stretched invaluable healthcare resources.","output":"Use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19: How good is the quality of randomized controlled trials?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comprehensive analyses of viral genomes can provide a global picture on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and help to predict the oncoming trends of pandemic.

However, commonly consumed fermented and prebiotic-containing foods have not been well-tested. The aim of the present study was to determine whether consumption of fermented food and food-derived prebiotics is associated with cognitive performance, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in psychiatrically healthy medical students under psychological stress. METHODS: The study protocol with data analysis plan was prospectively registered. Food consumption was evaluated with a 7-day dietary record. Cognitive performance was modeled with academic examination performance in relation to subject knowledge. Pre-exam depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 372 medical students (22.7  1.1 years of age, 66% female) completed the study. No relationship was observed between cognitive performance under stress and either fermented food (adjusted  0.02, 95% CI ?0.07C0.11, p = 0.63) or food-derived prebiotics consumption (adjusted  ?0.00, 95% CI ?0.09C0.09, p = 0.99). High intake of fermented food was associated with more severe depressive (adjusted  0.11, 95% CI 0.01C0.20, p = 0.032) and anxiety symptoms under stress (adjusted  0.13, 95% CI 0.04C0.22, p = 0.0065); however, no such link was observed for food-derived prebiotics (adjusted  0.03, 95% CI ?0.07C0.13, p = 0.50 and ?0.01, 95% CI ?0.11C0.08, p = 0.83, for depression and anxiety, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Under psychological stress in medical students, consumption of fermented food and food-derived prebiotics appears to be not associated with cognitive performance. High intake of fermented food, but not food-derived prebiotics, may be associated with severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The safety of fermented food in this regard therefore requires further clarification.","output":"Association Between Consumption of Fermented Food and Food-Derived Prebiotics With Cognitive Performance, Depressive, and Anxiety Symptoms in Psychiatrically Healthy Medical Students Under Psychological Stress: A Prospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is seen that anime, which is a Japanese animation type, with the food scenes in it, cause the curiosity and interest of the anime viewers from different cultures towards Japanese cuisine.

As no effective novel drugs are available currently, drug repurposing is an alternative intervention strategy. Here we present an in silico drug repurposing study that implements successful concepts of computer-aided drug design (CADD) technology for repurposing known drugs to interfere with viral cellular entry via the spike glycoprotein (SARS-CoV-2-S), which mediates host cell entry via the hACE2 receptor. Methods: A total of 4015 known and approved small molecules were screened for interaction with SARS-CoV-2-S through docking studies and 15 lead molecules were shortlisted. Additionally, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and glycyrrhizic acid (GA) were selected based on their reported anti-viral activity, safety, availability and affordability. The 18 molecules were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Results: The MD simulation results indicate that GA of plant origin may be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 intervention, pending further studies. Conclusions: Repurposing is a beneficial strategy for treating COVID-19 with existing drugs. It is aimed at using docking studies to screen molecules for clinical application and investigating their efficacy in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-S.

However, specific tools and interventions are needed for people with severe mental illness (SMI) who have a life-threatening illness. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the scientific evidence on tools and interventions in palliative care for this group. METHODS Systematic searches were done in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Embase databases, supplemented by reference tracking, searches on the internet with free text terms, and consultations with experts to identify relevant literature. Empirical studies with qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods designs concerning tools and interventions for use in palliative care for people with SMI were included. Methodological quality was assessed using a critical appraisal instrument for heterogeneous study designs. Stepwise study selection and the assessment of methodological quality were done independently by two review authors. RESULTS Four studies were included, reporting on a total of two tools and one multi-component intervention. One study concerned a tool to identify the palliative phase in patients with SMI. This tool appeared to be usable only in people with SMI with a cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, two related studies focused on a tool to involve people with SMI in discussions about medical decisions at the end of life. This tool was assessed as feasible and usable in the target group. One other study concerned the Dutch national Care Standard for palliative care, including a multi-component intervention. The Palliative Care Standard also appeared to be feasible and usable in a mental healthcare setting, but required further tailoring to suit this specific setting. None of the included studies investigated the effects of the tools and interventions on quality of life or quality of care.

Here we propose a simulation-based method to detect positions under convergent evolution in large protein alignments, without prior knowledge on the phenotype and environmental constraints. A phylogeny is inferred from the data and used in simulations to estimate the expected number of amino-acid changes in stable evolutionary constraints (null model) for each position. Similarly, we count the number of mutations towards the same amino acid in the data and test if they are occurring more often than expected. We applied our method to two real datasets: HIV reverse transcriptase and fish rhodopsin, and to HIV-like simulated data. On the latter, with known convergent events and substitution model, we detected on average two third of these events, with a low fraction of false positives. With HIV data, one knows that drug resistance mutations (DRMs) are convergent. Even without any knowledge of patient treatment status, we retrieved more than 70% of positions corresponding to known DRMs. On the rhodopsin dataset, four substitutions are supposed to be convergent, as they change the maximum wavelength absorption of the photoreceptor and occurred several times independently during evolution. We detected three of them.

Carers experienced distress as they navigated a foreign culture and environment without adequate communication and processes in place for their inclusion. We recommend deliberate efforts to provide a more inclusive environment that better supports and prepares carers for their new role.","output":"Carers' Experiences, Needs, and Preferences During Inpatient Stroke Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review of Qualitative Studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although SARS-CoV-2 is visualized on electron microscopy, there is an increasing demand for widely applicable techniques to visualize viral components within tissue specimens. Viral protein and RNA can be detected on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively. Herein, we evaluate the staining performance of ISH for SARS-CoV-2 and an IHC directed at the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and compare these results to a gold standard, tissue quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We evaluated FFPE sections from 8 COVID-19 autopsies, including 19 pulmonary and 39 extrapulmonary samples including the heart, liver, kidney, small intestine, skin, adipose tissue, and bone marrow. We performed RNA-ISH for SARS-CoV-2 on all cases with IHC for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR performed on selected cases. Lungs from 37 autopsies performed before the COVID-19 pandemic served as negative controls. The ISH and IHC slides were reviewed by 4 observers to record a consensus opinion. Selected ISH and IHC slides were also reviewed by 4 independent observers. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on both the IHC and ISH platforms. Within the postmortem lung, detected viral protein and RNA were often extracellular, predominantly within hyaline membranes in patients with diffuse alveolar damage. Among individual cases, there was regional variation in the amount of detectable virus in lung samples. Intracellular viral RNA and protein was localized to pneumocytes and immune cells. Viral RNA was detected on RNA-ISH in 13 of 19 (68%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19. Viral protein was detected on IHC in 8 of 9 (88%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19, although in 5 cases the stain was interpreted as equivocal. From the control cohort, FFPE blocks from all 37 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-ISH, whereas 5 of 13 cases were positive on IHC. Collectively, when compared with qRT-PCR on individual tissue blocks, the sensitivity and specificity for ISH was 86.7% and 100%, respectively, while those for IHC were 85.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The interobserver variability for ISH ranged from moderate to almost perfect, whereas that for IHC ranged from slight to moderate. All extrapulmonary samples from COVID-19-positive cases were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 is detectable on both RNA-ISH and nucleocapsid IHC. In the lung, viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein is predominantly extracellular and within hyaline membranes in some cases, while intracellular locations are more prominent in others. The intracellular virus is detected within pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and possibly immune cells. The ISH platform is more specific, easier to analyze and the interpretation is associated with the improved interobserver agreement. ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR failed to detect the virus in the heart, liver, and kidney.","output":"Comparison of RNA In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry Techniques for the Detection and Localization of SARS-CoV-2 in Human Tissues."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study evaluates the nature and intensity of anxiety, interpretations of the COVID-19 pandemic and coping modalities of hospitalized patients with mental illness compared with their caregivers.

Routine blood examination, biochemical indicators and coagulation function analysis were simultaneously performed in all participants. RESULTS: There was no sex predominance in NCPP. The NCPP were frequently encountered in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The mean age of NCPP (5616 years) was higher than IP (4717 years), but without statistical difference. Although most results of routine laboratory tests between NCPP and IP had no significant differences, some laboratory tests showed an obvious change in NCPP. It was observed that NCPP had significantly decreased white blood cells, alkaline phosphatase and d-dimer compared with IP. However, the results of lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen were significantly increased in NCPP compared with IP. The diagnostic model based on a combination of 18 routine laboratory indicators showed an area under the curve of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.777-0.814), with a sensitivity of 46.93% and specificity of 90.09% when using a cut-off value of 0.598.

Discovering an effective treatment for this disease, particularly in severe cases, has become the subject of intense scientific investigation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: This study was conducted as a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial. Fifty-nine patients with severe COVID-19 infection who did not respond to initial treatments were randomly assigned into two groups. One group received IVIg (human)four vials daily for three days (in addition to initial treatment), while the other group received a placebo. Patients demographic, clinical, and select laboratory test results, as well as the occurrence of in-hospital mortality, were recorded. Results: : Among total study subjects, 30 patients received IVIg and 29 patients received a placebo. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory tests were not statistically different ( P > 0.05) between the two groups. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in the IVIg group compared to the control group (6 [20.0%] vs. 14 [48.3%], respectively;P = 0.022). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that administration of IVIg did indeed have a significant impact on mortality rate (aOR = 0.003 [95% CI: 0.001C0.815];P = 0.042). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the administration of IVIg in patients with severe COVID-19 infection who did not respond to initial treatment could improve their clinical outcome and significantly reduce mortality rate. Further multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are nonetheless required to confirm the appropriateness of this medication as a standard treatment.

Interfering with the interaction of viral antigens with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor is a promising strategy by blocking the infection of the coronaviruses into human cells. We have implemented a novel protein engineering technology to produce a super-potent tetravalent form of ACE2, coupled to the human immunoglobulin g1 Fc region, using a self-assembling, tetramerization domain from p53 protein. This high molecular weight Quad protein (ACE2-Fc-TD) retains binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding spike protein and can form a complex with the spike protein plus anti-viral antibodies. The ACE2-Fc-TD acts as a powerful decoy protein that out-performs soluble monomeric and dimeric ACE2 proteins and blocks both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection with greatly enhanced efficacy. The ACE2 tetrameric protein complex promise to be important for development as decoy therapeutic proteins against COVID-19. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, ACE2 decoy is unlikely to be affected by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 that are beginning to appear in variant forms. In addition, ACE2 multimeric proteins will be available as therapeutic proteins should new coronaviruses appear in the future because these are likely to interact with ACE2 receptor.","output":"A Super-Potent Tetramerized ACE2 Protein Displays Enhanced Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated catastrophic job loss, high unemployment rates, and severe economic hardship in renter households. As a result, housing precarity and the risk of eviction increased and worsened during the pandemic, especially among people of color and low-income populations. This paper considers the implications of this eviction crisis for health and health inequity, and the need for eviction prevention policies during the pandemic. Eviction and housing displacement are particularly threatening to individual and public health during a pandemic. Eviction is likely to increase COVID-19 infection rates because it results in overcrowded living environments, doubling up, transiency, limited access to healthcare, and a decreased ability to comply with pandemic mitigation strategies (e.g. social distancing, self-quarantine, and hygiene practices). Indeed, recent studies suggest that eviction may increase the spread of COVID-19 and that the absence or lifting of eviction moratoria may be associated with an increased rate of COVID-19 infection and death. Eviction is also a driver of health inequity as historic trends and recent data demonstrate that people of color are more likely to face eviction and associated comorbidities. Black people have had less confidence in their ability to pay rent and are dying at 2.1 times the rate of non-Hispanic whites. Indigenous Americans and Hispanic/Latinx people face an infection rate almost 3 times the rate of non-Hispanic whites. Disproportionate rates of both COVID-19 and eviction in communities of color compound negative health effects and make eviction prevention a critical intervention to address racial health inequity. In light of the undisputed connection between eviction and health outcomes, eviction prevention, through moratoria and other supportive measures, is a key component of a pandemic control strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread and death.","output":"Eviction, Health Inequity, and the Spread of COVID-19: Housing Policy as a Primary Pandemic Mitigation Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have an adverse effect on the progression of multiple cancers, including prostate cancer, due to the ensuing cytokine storm and associated oncogenic signaling. Epidemiological data showing increased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in men suggests a potential role for androgen in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we present evidence for the transcriptional regulation of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 and co-receptor TMPRSS2 by androgen in mouse tissues and human prostate and lung cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. In an overexpression model, and the prostate and lung cells, Camostat C a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, required for viral fusion to the host cell. Importantly, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens such as enzalutamide/AR-PROTAC, or Camostat treatment attenuated the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry in lung and prostate cells. Together, our preclinical data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluations of the TMPRSS2 inhibitors, androgen-deprivation therapy and androgen receptor antagonists alone or in combination with anti-viral drugs as early as clinically possible to prevent inflammation driven COVID-19 progression.","output":"Targeting androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 as a therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As part of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the district of Heinsberg developed into an infectiological epicentre for Germany in February 2020. Our hospital, which is located in the immediate vicinity, reacted very quickly in addition to adapting patient care by implementing an organizational structure for recording SARS-CoV-2-positive employees, patients and their contact persons. OBJECTIVES: The infections recorded in contact tracing were analysed and, based on an exemplary outbreak, infection chains and follow-up processes were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Comprehensive data on contact types, oropharyngeal swab results for SARS-CoV-2 and quarantine days were documented and retrospectively evaluated using a self-developed database. RESULTS: Of the 568 employees recorded by in-house contact tracing, 32 employees (1.2%, na?= 2567) were detected as SARS-CoV-2 positive. Of those, 50% (na?= 16) tested positive due to contact tracing, 15.6% (na?= 5) were recorded by routine smears and 34.4% (na?= 11) were returning travellers. The variable PCR results of the control smears from these positive employees were noticeable. In 18.8% (na?= 6) of the initially negative control smears, positive PCR results were found in the following control smear. The inhouse contact tracing team was able to detect infection clusters on non-COVID-19 wards at an early stage and, together with clinical hygiene and the public health department, initiated comprehensive measures to limit the spread of the virus. Infection chains could thus be interrupted.

SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, and other coronaviruses encode capping proteins in its genome that modify the 5' untranslated region of the viral genome and mRNA. Capping viral RNAs promotes translation, prevents degradation, and reduces the activation of host immune responses. This process is initiated by the viral proteins nsp13 and nsp12, which cleave the 5' phosphate group and transfer a GMP from GTP to the 5' end of the nascent (+)ssRNA. The nsp14-nsp10 complex then catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the N7 position of the GMP cap, generating Cap-0. Finally, the nsp16-nsp10 complex utilizes SAM to catalyze the 2'-O-methylation of the first ribonucleotide, generating Cap-1. Several structures of the nsp16-nsp10 complex have been solved previously for SARS-CoV, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 with SAM, Cap-0 and Cap-0-RNA bound to the complex as well as the products of the reactions. Recently, we determined the first structure of nsp16-nsp10 with Cap-0-RNA and Cap-1 RNA, revealing that Mn2+ coordinates the first four nucleotides of the bound RNA to orient the 2'-OH of the ribose of the first nucleotide toward the methyl group of SAM for catalysis. Herein, we also show the first apo-crystal structure of nsp16 determined in which neither SAM nor RNA substrates bound. This new structure and comparison to structures with substraces and products bound, will reveal critical movements of the enzyme for binding substates. This study shows an important set of structures of the viral 2'-O-methyltransferases revealing unique features of this complex that could be used for molecular dynamics studies and designing coronavirus-specific inhibitors.","output":"Structural studies reveal unique features of nsp16 from SARS-CoV-2, a protein essential for immune system evasion and a possible drug target."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of a teacher in the Faculty of Health Sciences involves teaching students, preparing lessons, and participating in other activities such as research projects and management processes.

However, there are no published data on the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam for vHABP/VABP. These nosocomial infections are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and are increasingly complicated by growing rates of resistance and the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. This study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared with meropenem for the treatment of vHABP/VABP in a US hospital setting. METHODS: A short-term decision tree followed by a long-term Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years associated with ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem in the treatment of patients with vHABP/VABP. Pathogen susceptibility and clinical efficacy were informed by the Program to Assess Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS) database and ASPECT-NP, respectively. A US healthcare sector perspective was adopted, capturing direct costs borne by third-party payers or integrated health systems, and direct health effects for patients. RESULTS: In the confirmed treatment setting (post-susceptibility results), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem was US$12,126 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); this reduced when used in the early treatment setting (before susceptibility results) at $4775/QALY. CONCLUSION: Ceftolozane/tazobactam represents a highly cost-effective treatment option for patients with vHABP/VABP versus meropenem when used in either the confirmed or early treatment setting; with increased cost-effectiveness shown in the early setting.

Here, we report a binder-free covalent coating of phase-selectively disordered TiO(2) on a hydroxylated silicon oxide (SiO(2)) substrate through rapid microwave treatment. We found that Ti-O-Si and Ti-O-Ti bonds were formed through a condensation reaction between the hydroxyl groups of the disordered TiO(2) and Si substrate, and the disordered TiO(2) nanoparticles themselves, respectively. This covalent coating approach can steadily hold the active photocatalytic materials on the substrates and provide long-term stability. The binder-free disordered TiO(2) coating film can have a thickness (above 38 m) with high surface integrity with a strong adhesion force (15.2 N) against the SiO(2) substrate, which leads to the production of a rigid and stable TiO(2) film. This microwave treated TiO(2) coating film showed significant volatile organic compounds degradation abilities under visible light irradiation. The microwave coated selectively reduced TiO(2) realized around 75% acetaldehyde degradation within 12 hours and almost 90% toluene degradation after 9 hours, also retains stable photodegradation performance during the cycling test. Thus, the microwave coating approach allowed the preparation of the binder-free TiO(2) film as a scalable and cost-effective method to manufacture the TiO(2) film that shows an excellent coating quality and strengthens the application as a photocatalyst under severe conditions.","output":"Binder-free TiO(2) Hydrophilic Film Covalently Coated by Microwave Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several animal species are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as documented by case reports and serological and in vivo infection studies. However, the susceptibility of many animal species remains unknown. Furthermore, the expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, such as the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L (CTSL), cellular proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein activation, are largely unexplored in most species. Here, we generated primary cell cultures from the respiratory tract of domestic and wildlife animals to assess their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, the presence of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL within respiratory tract compartments was investigated in a range of animals, some with unknown susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Productive viral replication was observed in the nasal mucosa explants and precision-cut lung slices from dogs and hamsters, whereas culture models from ferrets and multiple ungulate species were non-permissive to infection. Overall, whereas TMPRSS2 and CTSL were equally expressed in the respiratory tract, the expression levels of ACE2 were more variable, suggesting that a restricted availability of ACE2 may contribute to reduced susceptibility. Summarized, the experimental infection of primary respiratory tract cell cultures, as well as an analysis of entry-factor distribution, enable screening for SARS-CoV-2 animal reservoirs.","output":"Investigations on SARS-CoV-2 Susceptibility of Domestic and Wild Animals Using Primary Cell Culture Models Derived from the Upper and Lower Respiratory Tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging efficacy and safety data have led to the authorization of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, but most trials excluded patients with active malignancies.

Methods: 660 adult cancer patients received a survey, in paper or electronic format, between 31 January 2021 and 15 February 2021. The survey included patients clinical characteristics, perceptions of COVID-19 and vaccination, vaccine knowledge, cancer health literacy, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). The primary outcome was the intended acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in cancer patients. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify factors associated with intended acceptance. Results: The intended acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination was 17.9%. A total of 487 (73.8%) believed that vaccination could prevent them from infection. Over 70% worried about vaccine negative effects on cancer and its side effects. Factors associated with intended acceptance included higher level of belief in vaccine on preventing them from getting COVID-19, less worry about long-term side effects of vaccine, lower level of cancer health literacy, and normal HADS (Depression scale). Conclusions: To improve vaccine acceptance rate, public education campaigns specific to cancer patients to gain their trust in efficacy and relieve their worries are needed.","output":"Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination in Cancer Patients in Hong Kong: Approaches to Improve the Vaccination Rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: At the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health care systems were severely disrupted in many countries and in particular, elderly people vulnerable to COVID-19 may have been reluctant to receive their medical treatment. Methods: We conducted interrupted time series analyses (ITSA) using nationwide medical utilization data, with focus on different disease categories for the patients of 65C84-year-olds, i.e., acute upper respiratory infections (AURIs) vs. chronic diseases. Results: AURIs and chronic diseases showed a sharp contrast with respect to the change in healthcare service utilisation. First, the utilisation rate for chronic diseases changed little whereas for AURIs it dropped by 20.4% year-over-year (yoy) at the onset of the pandemic (week 6, 2020). Second, as social distancing relaxed (week 17, 2020), the AURIs patients trended up and even reached to 7.8% above yoy whereas no significant change found for chronic diseases. Conclusions: The uninterrupted treatment for chronic diseases in contrast to the AURIs implies that the governmental and public responses to the pandemic outbreak worked for efficient healthcare provision to non-COVID patients as well as effective slowdown against the COVID transmission.","output":"Non-COVID-19 Healthcare Utilisation for Elderly People at the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ground-level ozone (O3) pollution has been steadily getting worse in most parts of eastern China during the past 5 years The non-linearity of O3 formation with its precursors like nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are complicating effective O3 abatement plans The diagnosis from space-based observations, i e the ratio of formaldehyde (HCHO) columns to tropospheric NO2 columns (HCHO / NO2), has previously been proved to be highly consistent with our current understanding of surface O3 chemistry HCHO / NO2 ratio thresholds distinguishing O3 formation sensitivity depend on regions and O3 chemistry interactions with aerosol To shed more light on the current O3 formation sensitivity over China, we have derived HCHO / NO2 ratio thresholds by directly connecting satellite-based HCHO / NO2 observations and ground-based O3 measurements over the major Chinese cities in this study We find that a VOC-limited regime occurs for HCHO / NO2 4 2 The HCHO / NO2 between 2 3 and 4 2 reflects the transition between the two regimes Our method shows that the O3 formation sensitivity tends to be VOC-limited over urban areas and NOx-limited over rural and remote areas in China We find that there is a shift in some cities from the VOC-limited regime to the transitional regime that is associated with a rapid drop in anthropogenic NOx emissions, owing to the widely applied rigorous emission control strategies between 2016 and 2019 This detected spatial expansion of the transitional regime is supported by rising surface O3 concentrations The enhanced O3 concentrations in urban areas during the COVID-19 lockdown in China indicate that a protocol with simultaneous anthropogenic NOx emissions and VOC emissions controls is essential for O3 abatement plans","output":"Spatial and temporal changes of the ozone sensitivity in China based on satellite and ground-based observations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: This cross-sectional study investigated rural Kansas healthcare resources relevant to COVID-19 at the county level in the context of population characteristics Methods: The federal Area Health Resource File was used to assess system capacity and critical care-related resources and COVID-19-related risk factors at the county level Data were described with summary statistics, cross-tabulations, and bivariate tests to discern differences across county rurality categories (2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes) Results: Kansas has 105 counties Metropolitan counties had an average of 1 5 physicians (M D or D O , any specialty) per 1,000 people, while rural counties had 0 8 A total of 63 5% of rural counties had no anesthesia providers and 100 0% of rural counties had no pulmonary disease physicians While 96 counties have at least one hospital, nearly 90% rural counties had no intensive care unit (ICU) services The percent of the population estimated to be over 65 was higher among rural counties (24 2%) than metropolitan counties (19 3%) On average, rural counties had nearly twice as many deaths per 1,000 people by cardiovascular disease and more chronic obstructive pulmonary disease deaths than metropolitan and nonmetropolitan/urban adjacent counties Conclusions: Kansas faced limited ICU capabilities and physician workforce shortages in rural counties, both in primary care and specialties such as anesthesia and pulmonology In addition, nonmetropolitan/urban adjacent and rural population age structures and mortality rates potentially demonstrated an increased risk to overwhelm local healthcare systems This may have serious implications for rural health, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Is Rural Kansas Prepared?

MethodsA 1-year longitudinal multicenter study was conducted in 5 NH during the period December 2019 to March 2021. The inclusion criteria used were residents aged 65 years or over, living in the NH permanently, with a diagnostic test for COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and/or serological test. The main variable was symptomatic COVID-19, with at least one of the following symptoms (fever, respiratory difficulties, cough, diarrhea, sudden urinary incontinence and disorientation or delirium). Three assessments were performed: baseline, six and twelve months follow-up.

Except for the direct burden of the COVID-19, collateral damage has been identified concerning other diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of the lockdown on the non-COVID-19 patients' outcome in a tertiary gastroenterology department. Methods: Patients admitted to our department during the lockdown period (23 March- 4 May 2020) and during the respective previous year's timeframe were recruited. Sex, age, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, final diagnosis, therapeutic management, duration of hospitalization, and outcome were evaluated. A direct comparison was performed to investigate the potential impact of the lockdown on the duration of hospitalization and the final outcome. Results: A total of 161 patients were included to our analysis with 1:1 male:female ratio and mean age 70.86 years. Most of the cases experienced gastrointestinal tract bleeding, biliary stone disease manifestations, or gastrointestinal malignancy complications, and 85.1% were discharged. Fewer patients were hospitalized during the lockdown period (40%), whereas the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer (7.69+/-4.55 vs. 5.76+/-4.36 days). Binary logistic regression analysis and sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the quarantine was associated with increased prevalence of negative outcomes (odds ratio 5.21, 95% confidence interval 1.66-16.34;P=0.005), especially in cases with gastrointestinal malignancy and acute pancreatitis (P=0.045 and P=0.041, respectively).

The mean PM2.5 concentration during the study period was 145 g/m3, and the 10 investigated toxic elements accounted for 0.31% of the PM2.5 mass. The total non-cancer risk (HI) and total cancer risk (TCR) of the selected toxic elements exceed the US EPA limits for children and adults. The HI for children was 2.3 times that for adults for all periods, which is likely due to the high inhalation rate per unit body weight for children. While the TCR for adults was 1.7 times that of children, which is mainly attributed to potential longer exposure duration for adults. The HI and TCR of the toxic elements during full lockdown were reduced by 66% and 58%, respectively, compared to their pre-lockdown levels. The HI and TCR were primarily attributable to Mn and As, respectively. Health risks during haze episodes were significantly higher than the average levels during COVID-19 lockdowns, though the HI and TCR of the selected toxic elements during full-lockdown haze episodes were 68% and 17% lower, respectively, than were the levels during pre-lockdown haze episodes. During the study period, fugitive dust and steel-related smelting were the highest contributors to HI and TCR, respectively, and decreased in these emission sources contributed the most to the lower health risks observed during the full lockdown.

The laparoscopic approach represents a new challenge, especially when lesions are located in the superior or posterior part of the liver. We discuss the case of an 81-year-old patient with a single synchronous liver metastasis involving the left hepatic vein and leaning into the middle hepatic vein at the common trunk, where we performed a simultaneous laparoscopic colonic resection with a left sectionectomy extended to segment 4a. The strategic approach to the Arantius ligament by joining the left and middle hepatic vein allowed us to avoid a major liver hepatectomy, preserve the liver parenchyma, reduce complications, enhance patient recovery, and perform the entire procedure by laparoscopy. Our example suggests that the Arantius approach to the left hepatic vein and the common trunk could be a feasible approach to consider in laparoscopic surgery for lesions located in their proximity.","output":"Laparoscopic Resection of Synchronous Liver Metastasis Involving the Left Hepatic Vein and the Common Trunk Bifurcation: A Strategy of Parenchyma-Sparing Resection with Left Sectionectomy and 4a Subsegmentectomy by Arantius Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and subsequent need for disease transmission mitigation efforts have significantly altered the delivery of cancer care (e.g., rise of telemedicine), including within the field of integrative oncology.

Clinical services transitioned from an array of in-person appointment-based services, such as acupuncture and massage, and group programs, such as yoga and nutrition seminars to a combination of live-streamed and on-demand virtual group programs and one-on-one virtual appointments for services such as acupressure and self-care massage. Group program volume grew from 2189 in-person program patient visits in the 6 months prior to onset of the COVID pandemic to 16,366 virtual (e.g., live-streamed or on-demand) patient visits in the first 6 months of the pandemic. From a research perspective, two integrative oncology studies, focused on yoga and music therapy, respectively, were transitioned from in-person delivery to a virtual format. Participant accrual to these studies increased after the transition to virtual consent and intervention delivery.
