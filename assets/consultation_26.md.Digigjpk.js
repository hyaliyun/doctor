Seven epitope peptides (n-Sp1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14) were confirmed to bind with HLA-A2 and potentially be presented by antigen presenting cells to induce host immune responses. Tetramers containing these peptides could interact with specific CD8+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients, and one dominant epitope (n-Sp1) was defined. In addition, these epitopes could activate and generate epitope-specific T cells in vitro, and those activated T cells showed cytotoxicity to target cells. Meanwhile, all these epitopes exhibited high frequency of variations. Among them, n-Sp1 epitope variation 5L>F significantly decreased the proportion of specific T cell activation; n-Sp1 epitope 8L>V variant showed significantly reduced binding to HLA-A2 and decreased the proportion of n-Sp1-specific CD8+ T cell, which potentially contributes to the immune escape of SAR-CoV-2.","output":"CD8+ T cell epitope variations suggest a potential antigen presentation deficiency for spike protein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lung rest has been recommended during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Whether positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) confers lung protection during ECMO for severe ARDS is unclear. We compared the effects of three different PEEP levels whilst applying near-apnoeic ventilation in a model of severe ARDS treated with ECMO. METHODS: Acute respiratory distress syndrome was induced in anaesthetised adult male pigs by repeated saline lavage and injurious ventilation for 1.5 h. After ECMO was commenced, the pigs received standardised near-apnoeic ventilation for 24 h to maintain similar driving pressures and were randomly assigned to PEEP of 0, 10, or 20 cm H(2)O (n=7 per group). Respiratory and haemodynamic data were collected throughout the study. Histological injury was assessed by a pathologist masked to PEEP allocation. Lung oedema was estimated by wet-to-dry-weight ratio. RESULTS: All pigs developed severe ARDS. Oxygenation on ECMO improved with PEEP of 10 or 20 cm H(2)O, but did not in pigs allocated to PEEP of 0 cm H(2)O. Haemodynamic collapse refractory to norepinephrine (n=4) and early death (n=3) occurred after PEEP 20 cm H(2)O. The severity of lung injury was lowest after PEEP of 10 cm H(2)O in both dependent and non-dependent lung regions, compared with PEEP of 0 or 20 cm H(2)O. A higher wet-to-dry-weight ratio, indicating worse lung injury, was observed with PEEP of 0 cm H(2)O. Histological assessment suggested that lung injury was minimised with PEEP of 10 cm H(2)O. CONCLUSIONS: During near-apnoeic ventilation and ECMO in experimental severe ARDS, 10 cm H(2)O PEEP minimised lung injury and improved gas exchange without compromising haemodynamic stability.","output":"Effect of positive end-expiratory pressure on lung injury and haemodynamics during experimental acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and near-apnoeic ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent 2018 Declaration of Astana recognized primary health care (PHC) as a means to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Following this declaration, country progress on operationalization of the PHC agenda and attainment of UHC has been stalled by the new challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has also disrupted the continuity of essential health service provision and tested the resilience of the regions health systems. METHODS: In accordance with this, the WHO Regional Office for Africa convened the Fifth Health Sector Directors Planning and Policy Meeting across the 47 Member States of the Region. The two-day forum focused on building health system resilience to facilitate service continuity during health threats, PHC revitalization, and health systems strengthening towards UHC. RESULTS: The Regional Forum provided evidence on building resilient health systems in the WHO African Region and engaged participants in meaningful and critical discussion. It is from these discussions that four key themes emerged: (1) working multisectorally/intersectorally, (2) moving from fragmentation to integration, (3) ensuring implementation and knowledge exchange, and (4) rethinking resilience and embracing antifragility. These discussions and associated groupings by thematic areas lend themselves to recommendations for the WHO. CONCLUSIONS: This paper details the proceedings and key findings on building resilient health systems, the four themes that emerged from participant deliberation, and the recommendations that have emerged from the meeting. Deliberations from the Regional Forum are critical, as they have the potential to directly inform policy and program design, given that the meeting convenes health sector technocrats, who are at the helm of policy design, action, and implementation.","output":"Building health system resilience in the context of primary health care revitalization for attainment of UHC: proceedings from the Fifth Health Sector Directors Policy and Planning Meeting for the WHO African Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This rapid expert consultation responds to a request from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) concerning questions about necessary data elements, sources of data, gaps in collection, and suggestions for data system design and integration to improve modeling and decision-making for COVID-19.

Ang1 acts as an agonist to maintain normal vessel function, whereas Ang2 acts as a Tie2 antagonist. Ang2 is increased in macular edema, sepsis, and other conditions, in which it blocks Ang1-mediated signaling, causing vascular dysfunction and contributing to disease pathology. Therefore, Ang2 is an attractive therapeutic target. Previously, we reported a Tie2 ectodomain variant that selectively binds Ang2 and acts as soluble ligand trap to sequester Ang2; however, the mechanism of Ang2-binding selectivity is unknown. In the present study, we used directed protein evolution to enhance Ang2-binding affinity of this Tie2 ectodomain trap. We examined contributions of individual residues in the ligand-binding interface of Tie2 to Ang1 and Ang2 binding. Surprisingly, different combinations of Tie2 residues were found to bind each ligand, with hydrophobic residues binding both ligands and polar residues contributing selectively to either Ang1 or Ang2 binding. Our analysis also identified a single Tie2 residue, His168, with a pivotal role in both Ang1 and Ang2 binding, enabling competition between binding ligands. In summary, this study reports an enhanced-affinity Ang2-selective ligand trap with potential for therapeutic development and reveals the mechanism behind its selectivity. It also provides the first analysis of contributions of individual Tie2 residues to Ang1 and Ang2 binding and identifies selectivity-determining residues that could be targeted in the future design of small molecule and other inhibitors of Ang2 for the treatment of vascular dysfunction.","output":"Intrinsic differences in the mechanisms of Tie2 binding to angiopoietins exploited by directed evolution to create an Ang2-selective ligand trap"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is tremendous interspecific variability in O3 sensitivity among C3 species, but variation among C4 species has been less clearly documented. It is also unclear whether stomatal conductance and leaf structure such as leaf mass per area (LMA) determine the variation in sensitivity to O3 across species. In this study, we investigated leaf morphological, chemical, and photosynthetic responses of 22 genotypes of four C4 bioenergy species (switchgrass, sorghum, maize and miscanthus) to elevated O3 in side-by-side field experiments using free-air O3 concentration enrichment (FACE). The C4 species varied largely in leaf morphology, physiology, and nutrient composition. Elevated O3 did not alter leaf morphology, nutrient content, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and respiration in most genotypes, but reduced net CO2 assimilation in maize and photosynthetic capacity in sorghum and maize. Species with lower LMA and higher stomatal conductance tended to show greater losses in photosynthetic rate and capacity in elevated O3 compared to species with higher LMA and lower stomatal conductance. Stomatal conductance was the strongest determinant of leaf photosynthetic rate and capacity. The response of both area- and mass-based leaf photosynthetic rate and capacity to elevated O3 were not affected by LMA directly, but negatively influenced by LMA indirectly through stomatal conductance. These results demonstrate that there is significant variation in O3 sensitivity among C4 species with maize and sorghum showing greater sensitivity of photosynthesis to O3 than switchgrass and miscanthus. Interspecific variation in O3 sensitivity was determined by direct effects of stomatal conductance and indirect effects of LMA. This is the first study to provide a test of unifying theories explaining variation in O3 sensitivity in C4 bioenergy grasses. These findings advance understanding of O3 tolerance in C4 grasses and could aid in optimal placement of diverse C4 bioenergy feedstocks across a polluted landscape.","output":"Testing unified theories for ozone response in C4 species."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seeks to achieve interoperability with other organizations, including non-VA community and regional health information exchanges (HIEs). OBJECTIVE This study aims to understand the perspectives of leaders involved in implementing information exchange between VA and non-VA providers via a community HIE. METHODS We interviewed operational, clinical, and information technology leaders at one VA facility and its community HIE partner. Respondents discussed their experiences with VA-HIE, including barriers and facilitators to implementation, and the associated impact on health care providers. Transcribed interviews were coded and analyzed using immersion-crystallization methods. RESULTS VA and community HIE leaders found training to be a key factor when implementing VA-HIE and worked cooperatively to provide several styles and locations of training. During recruitment, a high-touch approach was successfully used to enroll patients and overcome their resistance to opting in. Discussion with leaders revealed the high levels of complexity navigated by VA providers and staff to send and retrieve information. Part of the complexity stemmed from the interconnected web of information systems and human teams necessary to implement VA-HIE information sharing. These interrelationships must be effectively managed to guide organizational decision making. CONCLUSIONS Organizational leaders perceived information sharing to be of essential value in delivering high-quality, coordinated health care. The VA continues to increase access to outside care through the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION) Act. Along with this increase in non-VA medical care, there is a need for greater information sharing between VA and non-VA health care organizations.

Since the virus was first identified in December 2019, the number of deaths have been propagating exponentially, causing countries across the world, including Malaysia, to increase emergency measures to combat the virus. Due to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic does not discriminate its victims, it is of paramount importance to construct a plan for management of the dead for all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including the unidentified deceased, as an essential portion of the humanitarian forensic action approach. This document provides an overview on ways to maximize the local collective capacity from various government agencies to manage the dead based on the prevailing regulations and legislation in the country, in preparation for possible large scale deaths from this pandemic. The National Institute of Forensic Medicine Malaysia has improvised procedures and guidelines for management of the dead within the existing regulations in order to achieve a balance between medicolegal requirements and the safety of personnel managing the bodies of the deceased with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection; at the site of death, during transport, during postmortem procedures, storage and preparation before and during burial or cremation as well as environmental cleaning and disinfection, involving various agencies in the country. A form of temporary controlled burial is as an option to allow the reinvestigation of a decedent to help formally identify victims of the pandemic such as undocumented migrants or refugees who were previously not identified. Due to the different legal requirements and mortality rates between countries, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the management of the dead.

The recurrent spreading of CoVs imposes an ongoing threat to global health and the economy. Since no specific therapy for these CoVs is available, any beneficial approach (including nutritional and dietary approach) is worth investigation. Based on recent advances in nutrients and phytonutrients research, a novel combination of vitamin C, curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid (VCG Plus) was developed that has potential against CoV infection. System biology tools were applied to explore the potential of VCG Plus in modulating targets and pathways relevant to immune and inflammation responses. Gene target acquisition, gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were conducted consecutively along with network analysis. The results show that VCG Plus can act on 88 hub targets which are closely connected and associated with immune and inflammatory responses. Specifically, VCG Plus has the potential to regulate innate immune response by acting on NOD-like and Toll-like signaling pathways to promote interferons production, activate and balance T-cells, and regulate the inflammatory response by inhibiting PI3K/AKT, NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways. All these biological processes and pathways have been well documented in CoV infections studies. Therefore, our findings suggest that VCG Plus may be helpful in regulating immune response to combat CoV infections and inhibit excessive inflammatory responses to prevent the onset of cytokine storm. However, further in vitro and in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings with system biology tools.

No vaccine/therapeutic is currently licensed for humans. Human-to-human transmission was previously reported during outbreaks and NiV could be isolated from respiratory secretions, but the proportion of cases in Malaysia exhibiting respiratory symptoms was significantly lower than that in Bangladesh. Previously, we showed that primary human basal respiratory epithelial cells are susceptible to both NiV-Malaysia (M) and -Bangladesh (B) strains causing robust pro-inflammatory responses. However, the cells of the human respiratory epithelium that NiV targets are unknown and their role in NiV transmission and NiV-related lung pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Here, we characterized NiV infection of the human respiratory epithelium using a model of the human tracheal/bronchial (B-ALI) and small airway (S-ALI) epithelium cultured at an air-liquid interface. We show that NiV-M and NiV-B infect ciliated and secretory cells in B/S-ALI, and that infection of S-ALI, but not B-ALI, results in disruption of the epithelium integrity and host responses recruiting human immune cells. Interestingly, NiV-B replicated more efficiently in B-ALI than did NiV-M. These results suggest that the human tracheal/bronchial epithelium is favourable to NiV replication and shedding, while inducing a limited host response. Our data suggest that the small airways epithelium is prone to inflammation and lesions as well as constituting a point of virus entry into the pulmonary vasculature. The use of relevant models of the human respiratory tract, such as B/S-ALI, is critical for understanding NiV-related lung pathogenesis and identifying the underlying mechanisms allowing human-to-human transmission.","output":"Characterization of Nipah virus infection in a model of human airway epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Western Balkans, as elsewhere around the world, governments took extraordinary measures to effectively contain the spread of COVID-19, measures that entailed serious restrictions to individual freedoms.

Immunophenotyping of tumors is an essential tool to evaluate the immune function of patients with immunodeficiency or autoimmunity. Therefore, this study aims to find the potential tumor antigen of LGG and identify the suitable population for cancer vaccination based on the immune landscape. METHOD: The genomic and clinical data of 529 patients with LGG were obtained from TCGA, the mRNA_seq data of normal brain tissue were downloaded from GTEx. Differential expression gene and mutation analysis were performed to screen out potential antigens, K-M curves were carried out to investigate the correlation between the level of potential antigens and OS and DFS of patients. TIMER dataset was used to explore the correlation between genes and immune infiltrating cells. Immunophenotyping of 529 tumor samples was based on the single-sample gene sets enrichment analysis.

GPs spend almost a fifth of their patient facing time addressing non-medical problems such as social isolation, financial struggles, and bereavement. Recent research suggests that holistic approaches linking social care to primary care may be cost-effective in supporting patients. Social Prescribing (SP) is an approach which could help individuals by sign posting and referral to non-clinical services, which can promote improvements in mental health and wellbeing, building resilience using community assets. The EmotionMind Dynamic (EMD) is a lifestyle coaching programme that supports individuals suffering from anxiety or depression referred from the health and social care sectors. EMD offers a unique, non-clinical mixed-modality approach combining coaching, mentoring, counselling skills, teaching and mindfulness. EMD is an adaptable, guided self-help tool that can be used as a preventative, supportive or reactive measure for improving mental health and wellbeing. Methods SROI methodology will be used to evaluate the EMD service. The aim of the SROI analysis is to develop a programme-level theory of change to establish how inputs (e.g. costs, staffing) are converted into outputs (e.g. numbers of clients seen), and subsequently into outcomes that matter to clients impacted by EMD coaching (e.g. improved mental wellbeing). Fifty participants will be recruited including clients who have completed the EMD programme and new clients participating in the online blended learning format. Face-to-face and blended learning formats will offer six sessions over a three-month period. A mixed-method approach will collect quantitative and qualitative from questionnaires and interviews. Outcomes will measure improvements in mental wellbeing and self-efficacy. Wellbeing valuation will be applied to quantify and value outcomes.

Mutations of its genomic RNA frequently occur during viral replication, which is believed to be a force contributing to viral evolution. Nevertheless, accumulating evidences show that some JEV strains may have actually arisen from RNA recombination between genetically different populations of the virus. We have demonstrated that RNA recombination in JEV occurs unequally in different cell types. In the present study, viral RNA fragments transfected into as well as viral RNAs synthesized in mosquito cells were shown not to be stable, especially in the early phase of infection possibly via cleavage by exoribonuclease. Such cleaved small RNA fragments may be further degraded through an RNA interference pathway triggered by viral double-stranded RNA during replication in mosquito cells, resulting in a lower frequency of RNA recombination in mosquito cells compared to that which occurs in mammalian cells. In fact, adjustment of viral RNA to an appropriately lower level in mosquito cells prevents overgrowth of the virus and is beneficial for cells to survive the infection.

DESIGN: CC nurses (RNs) and physicians (MDs) from the American Medical Association Coping with COVID survey were matched by gender, race, years in practice, and role with non-CC clinicians to determine likelihood of ITL in relation to burnout and CI. SETTING: U.S. Healthcare organizations; JulyDecember 2020. SUBJECTS: One hundred sixty-five CC RNs and 148 CC MDs (n = 313) matched with 165 non-CC RNs and 148 non-CC MDs from 83 healthcare organizations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Burnout was measured with a single, validated question that mainly reflects emotional exhaustion (EE), and CI was determined by asking if respondents worried about doing things that compromised their integrity moderately or to a great extent. ITL included those moderately, likely, or definitely, intending to leave. Burnout correlated strongly with CI (tetrachoric r = 0.704 [0.606C0.803]; P < 0.001). Of 626 subjects, 59% experienced burnout, 24% CI, and 33% ITL. CC RNs experienced burnout more often (76%) than non-CC RNs (62%; P < 0.01) and CC MDs (51%; P < 0.001). CI was more frequent in CC RNs (44%) than non-CC RNs (23%) and CC MDs (16%; P < 0.001). In multivariate regressions, CC clinicians experiencing burnout had 50% greater odds of ITL than non-CC clinicians experiencing burnout; odds of ITL were substantially higher (odds ratio, 2.8C3.2) in those with CI regardless of location or burnout. In the ICU, those feeling valued by their organization had one-third the odds of ITL. CONCLUSIONS: Burnout (EE) is high (>50%) among CC RNs and MDs, which may result in losses of CC clinicians while demand rises. Preventing CI independent of burnout may reduce turnover in all settings and especially in ICUs. Feeling valued may promote staff retention.","output":"Compromised Integrity, Burnout, and Intent to Leave the Job in Critical Care Nurses and Physicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community health workers (CHWs) are effective in improving public health, and many states are developing policy to support the workforce. In 2019, the Louisiana legislature created the CHW Workforce Study Committee (Committee) of at least half CHWs to study the workforce and provide the state with policy recommendations. The Committee followed national best practices in CHW engagement. A CHW and an academic team identified CHWs and employers statewide, administered a survey in partnership with a CHW professional association, and conducted in-depth interviews with CHWs and employers. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize survey data and applied thematic analysis was used to interpret interview transcripts. Sixty-five CHWs and 37 employers participated in the survey. Twenty-one CHWs and 15 employers completed interviews. Survey data indicated that Louisiana CHW roles and activities are consistent with national research. Interviews revealed a lack of knowledge about CHWs among key stakeholders, CHW workforce challenges including lack of community and professional resources, and differing ideas about the value of common workforce development practices such as standardized training and credentialing. Findings suggest a need for widespread education about CHWs and support for CHW participation in professional associations to address common workforce challenges.

Current guidelines on the efficacy of its use is not well delineated with limited studies analyzing the risk of thromboembolic events during treatment. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the risk of arterial and venous thromboembolisms from CPT in patients with COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive literature review of Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and EMBASE from inception to June 2021. Title and abstract screening and full-text screening was done in duplicate by two independent reviewers. All randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that analyzed adult COVID-19 patients undergoing CPT were included for analysis. Editorials, conference abstracts, narrative reviews, case series, containing less than 100 patients were excluded. The primary outcome analyzed was the risk of thrombotic events in CPT + standard therapy vs standard therapy alone. Meta-analysis was done using a random-effects model using the Revman 5 software. RESULTS Of 1774 studies identified from our search, three randomized (n= 660 patients), and one non-randomized matched cohort study) (n = 96 patients) were included for analysis. The risk ratio for thrombotic events was 2.33, favoring the CPT group (95% CI, [0.70, 7.72], P = 0.17, I2 = 29%). Subgroup analyses showed that CPT + standard therapy was associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality (RR = 0.70 [0.49, 0.98], P = 0.04, I2 = 0%). No significant difference in cardiovascular events (RR = 0.90 [0.67, 1.20], P = 0.48, I2 = 0%), hypertension (RR = 1.67 [0.56, 4.98], P = 0.35, I2 = 0%), and septic shock (RR = 0.97 [0.40, 2.35], P = 0.94, I2 = 41%) was found between CPT + standard therapy and standard therapy alone. CONCLUSION We found treatment of COVID-19 with standard therapy + CPT was not associated with an increase in the risk of thromboembolic events. CPT was associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality but not of MACE, hypertension, or septic shock.

While bat, camel, and human DPP4 support MERS-CoV infection, several DPP4 orthologs, including mouse, ferret, hamster, and guinea pig DPP4, do not. Previous work revealed that glycosylation of mouse DPP4 plays a role in blocking MERS-CoV infection. Here, we tested whether glycosylation also acts as a determinant of permissivity for ferret, hamster, and guinea pig DPP4. We found that, while glycosylation plays an important role in these orthologs, additional sequence and structural determinants impact their ability to act as functional receptors for MERS-CoV. These results provide insight into DPP4 species-specific differences impacting MERS-CoV host range and better inform our understanding of virus-receptor interactions associated with disease emergence and host susceptibility.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV is a recently emerged zoonotic virus that is still circulating in the human population with an 35% mortality rate. With no available vaccines or therapeutics, the study of MERS-CoV pathogenesis is crucial for its control and prevention. However, in vivo studies are limited because MERS-CoV cannot infect wild-type mice due to incompatibilities between the virus spike and the mouse host cell receptor, mouse DPP4 (mDPP4). Specifically, mDPP4 has a nonconserved glycosylation site that acts as a barrier to MERS-CoV infection. Thus, one mouse model strategy has been to modify the mouse genome to remove this glycosylation site. Here, we investigated whether glycosylation acts as a barrier to infection for other nonpermissive small-animal species, namely, ferret, guinea pig, and hamster. Understanding the virus-receptor interactions for these DPP4 orthologs will help in the development of additional animal models while also revealing species-specific differences impacting MERS-CoV host range.","output":"Permissivity of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Orthologs to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Is Governed by Glycosylation and Other Complex Determinants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is not deadly in terms of its mortality rate?3 1% in the US And almost as many people die because of wrong medication or hospital errors It is deadly in terms of the ease and rapidity with which it spreads?through droplets of spit And when economies and societies were local and regional in scale, spit did not travel far But with globalization, especially under finance capitalism, spit travels far, as its carriers move freely?from Wuhan to wherever in a week COVID-19 is a disease of globalization It needs to be countered by instantaneous intervention by the WHO and by National Health Services","output":"COVID-19: disease of global capitalism excursions into spatial epidemiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 unprecedentedly threatens the public health at worldwide level.

A periumbilical single-port technique reduces the size of the access wound, usually to 3-4 cm. However, in the presence of large phlegmon or fistulae, the risk of conversion is higher and the extraction site might be enlarged. A suprapubic Pfannenstiel incision reduces the risk of incisional hernia compared to umbilical access and might provide the possibility to perform sigmoidectomy with a hybrid technique. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of laparoscopic sigmoidectomy through a single suprapubic transverse access for large diverticular phlegmon. METHODS Consecutive patients with a diverticular inflammatory mass  5 cm, with or without sigmoid-vesical fistula, were considered candidates for laparoscopic sigmoidectomy through a 5-cm single-port suprapubic (SPSP) access, extended (if required) to match the size of the inflammatory mass. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent SPSP sigmoidectomy at our institution in April 2014-April 2017. All procedures were completed by SPSP access, with no intraoperative complications or need for additional trocar placement. Eight patients had a sigmoid-vesical fistula (bladder sutured in three patients). The splenic flexure was mobilized in nine patients. Median operative time was 178 min and median hospital stay was 5.5 days (iqr 4-6). Postoperative complications occurred in four patients and included one subcutaneous hematoma, one urinary tract infection, and two superficial wound infections. After a median follow-up time of 25 months (interquartile range 15-38), all patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms, with no incisional hernias reported. CONCLUSIONS SPSP sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis is feasible and effective, minimizing the size of the access wound and avoiding increased risk of hernia.

The electronic HECTIS health record registry was interrogated for the total number of patients that were seen per month. These were further categorised according to mechanism of injury (stab, gunshot, blunt assault and road traffic injuries). Penetrating (stab and gunshot) and blunt assault victims were collectively grouped as violent trauma. Results. The mean total number of patients seen decreased by 53% during the hard lockdown period. There was a moderate reduction (15%) in patients with gunshot injuries seen during the hard lockdown phase, but there was an 80% increase in the post-lockdown period. The proportion of patients injured in road traffic collisions pre lockdown, hard lockdown and immediate post lockdown was 16.4%, 8.9% and 11.1%, respectively. Patients injured in road traffic collisions decreased by 74% during the hard lockdown period and maintained a reduction of 32% during the immediate post-lockdown period.

There have been little critical analyses of the methodological approaches. Our objective is to review and summarize statistical and modelling methods used to investigate the effects of weather and climate on infectious diseases associated with water, in order to identify limitations and knowledge gaps in developing of new methods.

The most commonly used methods were grouped in two clusters: process-based models (PBM) and time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE). In general, PBM methods were employed when the bio-physical mechanism of the pathogen under study was relatively well known (e.g. Vibrio cholerae); TS-SE tended to be used when the specific environmental mechanisms were unclear (e.g. Campylobacter). Important data and methodological challenges emerged, with implications for surveillance and control of water-associated infections. The most common limitations comprised: non-inclusion of key factors (e.g. biological mechanism, demographic heterogeneity, human behavior), reporting bias, poor data quality, and collinearity in exposures. Furthermore, the methods often did not distinguish among the multiple sources of time-lags (e.g. patient physiology, reporting bias, healthcare access) between environmental drivers/exposures and disease detection. Key areas of future research include: disentangling the complex effects of weather/climate on each exposure-health outcome pathway (e.g. person-to-person vs environment-to-person), and linking weather data to individual cases longitudinally.","output":"Challenges in developing methods for quantifying the effects of weather and climate on water-associated diseases: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 affected 29 countries.

METHODS: Phone interviews were conducted with 103 patients with mild COVID-19 in Israel over a 6-month period (April 2020 to October 2020). Patients were recruited via social media and word to mouth and were interviewed up to 4 times, depending on reports of their unresolved symptoms. Inclusion criteria required participants to be residents of Israel aged 18 years or older, with positive COVID-19 real-time PCR results and nonsevere symptoms. The onset, duration, severity and resolution of symptoms were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 44% (45/103), 41% (42/103), 39% (40/103) and 38% (39/103) of patients experienced headache, fever, muscle ache and dry cough as the first symptom respectively. Smell and taste changes were experienced at 3.9  5.4 and 4.6  5.7 days (mean  standard deviation (SD)) after disease onset respectively. Among prevalent symptoms, fever had the shortest duration (5.8  8.6 days), and taste and smell changes were the longest-lasting symptoms (17.2  17.6 and 18.9  19.7 days; durations censored at 60 days). Longer recovery of the sense of smell correlated with the extent of smell change. At the 6-month follow-up, 46% (47/103) of the patients had at least one unresolved symptom, most commonly fatigue (22%, 23/103), smell and taste changes (15%, 15/103 and 8%, 8/103 respectively) and breathing difficulties (8%, 8/103).

It works by adding a harmonic boost potential to smooth biomolecular potential energy surface and reduce energy barriers. GaMD greatly accelerates biomolecular simulations by orders of magnitude. Without the need to set predefined reaction coordinates or collective variables, GaMD provides unconstrained enhanced sampling and is advantageous for simulating complex biological processes. The GaMD boost potential exhibits a Gaussian distribution, thereby allowing for energetic reweighting via cumulant expansion to the second order (i.e., \\"Gaussian approximation\\"). This leads to accurate reconstruction of free energy landscapes of biomolecules. Hybrid schemes with other enhanced sampling methods, such as the replica exchange GaMD (rex-GaMD) and replica exchange umbrella sampling GaMD (GaREUS), have also been introduced, further improving sampling and free energy calculations. Recently, new \\"selective GaMD\\" algorithms including the ligand GaMD (LiGaMD) and peptide GaMD (Pep-GaMD) enabled microsecond simulations to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of small-molecule ligands and highly flexible peptides. The simulations then allowed highly efficient quantitative characterization of the ligand/peptide binding thermodynamics and kinetics. Taken together, GaMD and its innovative variants are applicable to simulate a wide variety of biomolecular dynamics, including protein folding, conformational changes and allostery, ligand binding, peptide binding, protein-protein/nucleic acid/carbohydrate interactions, and carbohydrate/nucleic acid interactions. In this review, we present principles of the GaMD algorithms and recent applications in biomolecular simulations and drug design.","output":"Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD): principles and applications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The physiological impact of wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), in particular filtering-face-piece 3 (FFP3) masks, has increasingly been gaining importance since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Design/methodology/approach The research method is a qualitative interpretivist philosophical approach with a quantitative data collection. Short questionnaires were conducted via e-mails with attached links via SurveyMonkey. The sample was the group of people who had been in active urban life before the pandemic and had been actively working at the office spaces. Findings Separate learning/working spaces were urged at home, at least for the set intervals in the daytime. Production in the kitchen also acted as an interactive production and entertainment. Balconies and terraces were re-discovered and acted as \\"urban-substitute open spaces\\". The living room became the new venue for domestic interaction especially during working-learning breaks, for watching movies, personal care or reading sessions. Computers, tablets and smartphones became the urban activity base due to online meeting applications for social reasons, online shopping, working and learning. The separation of domains at home became essential. Research limitations/implications The study only focuses domestic uses of white-collar workers;during the lock-down period, Covid-19 pandemic. Sampling constraints are the employees who were active urban life before the pandemic and working at the office space. Sharing the house at least with one other roommate, sibling or spouse with or without children. Individuals who had not been working outside the home before the pandemic, people aged over 65, retired, permanent home workers, housewives, freelancers and other such demographic structures are excluded from the study. Social implications Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first wave lockdown began between early March-June 2020, and millions of people were confined to the dwellings. \\"Staying home\\" stood for working-learning-shopping-interacting online, more production in the kitchen, using the living room as a domestic multi-functional venue, spending time on the terraces and balconies as domestic open spaces.

We examined the impact of these tiered restrictions, and alternatives for lockdown stringency, timing, and duration, on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19. METHODS: We fit an age-structured mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to data on hospital admissions and hospital bed occupancy (ISARIC4C/COVID-19 Clinical Information Network, National Health Service [NHS] England), seroprevalence (Office for National Statistics, UK Biobank, REACT-2 study), virology (REACT-1 study), and deaths (Public Health England) across the seven NHS England regions from March 1, to Oct 13, 2020. We analysed mobility (Google Community Mobility) and social contact (CoMix study) data to estimate the effect of tiered restrictions implemented in England, and of lockdowns implemented in Northern Ireland and Wales, in October, 2020, and projected epidemiological scenarios for England up to March 31, 2021. FINDINGS: We estimated a reduction in the effective reproduction number (Rt) of 2% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0-4) for tier 2, 10% (6-14) for tier 3, 35% (30-41) for a Northern Ireland-stringency lockdown with schools closed, and 44% (37-49) for a Wales-stringency lockdown with schools closed. From Oct 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, a projected COVID-19 epidemic without tiered restrictions or lockdown results in 280a??000 (95% projection interval 274a??000-287a??000) hospital admissions and 58a??500 (55a??800-61a??100) deaths. Tiered restrictions would reduce hospital admissions to 238a??000 (231a??000-245a??000) and deaths to 48a??600 (46a??400-50a??700). From Nov 5, 2020, a 4-week Wales-type lockdown with schools remaining open-similar to the lockdown measures announced in England in November, 2020-was projected to further reduce hospital admissions to 186a??000 (179a??000-193a??000) and deaths to 36a??800 (34a??900-38a??800). Closing schools was projected to further reduce hospital admissions to 157a??000 (152a??000-163a??000) and deaths to 30a??300 (29a??000-31a??900). A projected lockdown of greater than 4 weeks would reduce deaths but would bring diminishing returns in reducing peak pressure on hospital services. An earlier lockdown would have reduced deaths and hospitalisations in the short term, but would lead to a faster resurgence in cases after January, 2021. In a post-hoc analysis, we estimated that the second lockdown in England (Nov 5-Dec 2) reduced Rt by 22% (95% CrI 15-29), rather than the 32% (25-39) reduction estimated for a Wales-stringency lockdown with schools open. INTERPRETATION: Lockdown measures outperform less stringent restrictions in reducing cumulative deaths. We projected that the lockdown policy announced to commence in England on Nov 5, with a similar stringency to the lockdown adopted in Wales, would reduce pressure on the health service and would be well timed to suppress deaths over the winter period, while allowing schools to remain open. Following completion of the analysis, we analysed new data from November, 2020, and found that despite similarities in policy, the second lockdown in England had a smaller impact on behaviour than did the second lockdown in Wales, resulting in more deaths and hospitalisations than we originally projected when focusing on a Wales-stringency scenario for the lockdown.

A population of about 150 dreamers currently enrolled at a public university in Delaware were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey contained questions about demographics, mental health, academics, immigration, COVID-19 infection, and unemployment, in addition to mental health screens for anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and stress (PSS-10).

Rates of anxiety and depression in our sample were significantly higher than those recently reported for college students overall, suggesting that dreamers may be experiencing a more severe mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that pandemic-induced concerns about finances, COVID-19 infection, immigration, and unemployment (among other factors) were associated with greater anxiety, stress, and depression among the dreamers in our sample.

However, narrowing scope disregards the impact of other causes and types of limb amputation (LA) diminishing the true incidence and societal burden. We explored the rates of LEA and upper extremity amputation (UEA) by level of amputation, sex and age over 14 years in Saskatchewan, Canada. METHODS: We calculated the differential impact of amputation type (LEA or UEA) and level (major or minor) of LA using retrospective linked hospital discharge data and demographic characteristics of all LA performed in Saskatchewan and resident population between 2006 and 2019. Rates were calculated from total yearly cases per yearly Saskatchewan resident population. Joinpoint regression was employed to quantify annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC). Negative binomial regression was performed to determine if LA rates differed over time based on sex and age. RESULTS: Incidence of LEA (31.86  2.85 per 100,000) predominated over UEA (5.84  0.49 per 100,000) over the 14-year study period. The overall LEA rate did not change over the study period (AAPC -0.5 [95% CI - 3.8 to 3.0]) but fluctuations were identified. From 2008 to 2017 LEA rates increased (APC 3.15 [95% CI 1.1 to 5.2]) countered by two statistically insignificant periods of decline (2006-2008 and 2017-2019). From 2006 to 2019 the rate of minor LEA steadily increased (AAPC 3.9 [95% CI 2.4 to 5.4]) while major LEA decreased (AAPC -0.6 [95% CI - 2.1 to 5.4]). Fluctuations in the overall LEA rate nearly corresponded with fluctuations in major LEA with one period of rising rates from 2010 to 2017 (APC 4.2 [95% CI 0.9 to 7.6]) countered by two periods of decline 2006-2010 (APC -11.14 [95% CI - 16.4 to - 5.6]) and 2017-2019 (APC -19.49 [95% CI - 33.5 to - 2.5]). Overall UEA and minor UEA rates remained stable from 2006 to 2019 with too few major UEA performed for in-depth analysis. Males were twice as likely to undergo LA than females (RR = 2.2 [95% CI 1.99-2.51]) with no change in rate over the study period. Persons aged 50-74 years and 75+ years were respectively 5.9 (RR = 5.92 [95% Cl 5.39-6.51]) and 10.6 (RR = 10.58 [95% Cl 9.26-12.08]) times more likely to undergo LA than those aged 0-49 years. LA rate increased with increasing age over the study period. CONCLUSION: The rise in the rate of minor LEA with simultaneous decline in the rate of major LEA concomitant with the rise in age of patients experiencing LA may reflect a paradigm shift in the management of diseases that lead to LEA. Further, this shift may alter demand for orthotic versus prosthetic intervention. A more granular look into the data is warranted to determine if performing minor LA diminishes the need for major LA.","output":"Trends of limb amputation considering type, level, sex and age in Saskatchewan, Canada 2006-2019: an in-depth assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental health problems are over-represented in doctors and medical students. However, stigma and 'a culture of shame' are formidable barriers to mental health services and consequently many doctors and medical students with mental health difficulties continue to suffer in silence despite the availability of effective treatment. Indeed, a recent study on over 2100 female physicians who met the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder revealed that 50% were reluctant to seek professional help due to fear of exposure to stigma. Left untreated or undertreated, mental health problems in doctors can result in impairment of occupational functioning, compromise patient safety and place considerable strain on the economy (by increasing the amount of sick leave taken). Moreover, the consequences of mental health stigma in the medical profession can be fatal. Dr Daksha Emson, a psychiatrist with bipolar affective disorder, tragically killed herself and her baby daughter during a psychotic episode. An independent inquiry into Dr Emson's death concluded that she was the victim of stigma in the National Health Service. The mental health of medical students and doctors, in all of its aspects, must therefore be addressed with the urgency that it demands.

Virality, however, has been conceptualised as a key attribute of social media platforms. A tension therefore emerges between to encouraging good virality while limiting bad virality. To examine how platforms have dealt with this , the article analyses the policies of two platforms, Facebook and YouTube, alongside the EU Code of Practice which they have both signed. The analysis reveals that they focus on the circulation of mis/disinformation, developing an apparatus of security around it. This consists of a set of strategies, techno-material tools for the enforcement of the strategies, measures for disciplining users, and procedures for legitimating and re-adjusting the whole apparatus. However, this apparatus is not fit for the purpose of addressing mis/disinformation for two reasons: firstly, its primary objective is to sustain the platforms and not to resolve the problem of mis/disinformation;secondly it obscures the question of production of mis/disinformation. Ultimately, addressing mis/disinformation in a comprehensive manner requires a more thorough and critical social inquiry.

Endpoints were queried using single target and multiplexed immunoassays. RESULTS Unique membrane-fluidizing properties and biomarker signatures suggest that azelates are not prodrugs. DEA decreased cytokine signaling from pattern recognition receptors in human dendritic cells, disabled membrane attack of cholera toxin in vitro, and prevented immunosuppression by anthrax lethal toxin in vitro and in vivo. In the murine sepsis model, DEA increased survival and reduced organ damage.

RESULTS: Prevalence of ADHD was positively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence and crude mortality rates on bivariate analyses, though the strength of this association was low. On multivariate regression, prevalence of ADHD was negatively associated with COVID-19 prevalence and crude mortality rates, though only the former finding was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The association between ADHD and COVID-19 prevalence and mortality at a national level is inconsistent, modest, and may be largely due to confounding factors such as age, lifestyle factors, and medical comorbidities.","output":"Is There a Relationship Between ADHD and COVID-19 Prevalence and Mortality Indices?

A retrospective cluster study was conducted to evaluate long-term sexual and urinary functioning after RARP and Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy (LRP) based on real-world data from 12 Dutch hospitals. METHODS: Data was collected from patients who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2012. A mixed effect model was used to evaluate differences between groups on urinary and sexual functioning (EPIC-26). Additionally, a regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between these functional outcomes and, among others, hospital volume. RESULTS: 1370 (65.1%) patients participated, 907 underwent RARP and 463 LRP, with a median follow-up time of 7.08 years (SD = 0.98). The RARP group showed a statistically and clinically significant better urinary functioning compared to the LRP group (p = 0.002). RARP showed also a shorter procedure time (p=<0.001), reduced blood loss (p=<0.001), and a higher chance of neurovascular bundle preservation (39.8% vs 29.1%; p=<0.01). CONCLUSION: RARP resulted in better long-term urinary function compared to LRP.

Even though the direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are diminishing, they may still affect CMC patients clinical outcomes. The present study aims to assess these lasting impacts. Methods: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted online on the Carenity platform from December 7th, 2020 to April 8th, 2021. It included adult patients from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, living with any CMC. Results: 3,359 CMC patients were included in the study, 72% woman, mean age 55 years old, most frequently affected by type 2 diabetes (20%), asthma (16%) or multiple sclerosis (15%). Medical consultations were still strongly impacted: 33% had theirs rescheduled or cancelled since September 2020, and 34% of patients consulted their doctor less frequently as compared to before the pandemic. Of the 21% who were using a wearable device or health application on a daily basis to monitor their condition, 56% changed the way they used it. During the crisis, 42% used teleconsultation, especially in Spain (60%) and the United Kingdom (58%). Only 47% of them intend to use it after the health crisis. Patients still report experiencing impacts on their well-being: Patients reported feeling worse than before the pandemic (48% physically, 62% psychologically). 49% of patients reported they needed more information, on the risks linked to vaccination in their specific situation (93%) or to their condition or treatment (84%). 59% also would like to be better aware of their eligibility for the vaccine, especially in Germany (81%).

The impact on patient outcomes and the interplay between these comorbidities and the therapeutic options currently available, including tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and newer biological therapies, are also explored. As newer RA therapies are developed, and patients gain wider and earlier access to advanced therapies, in part due to the emergence of biosimilars, it is important to consider the prevention or treatment of comorbidities as part of the overall management of RA.","output":"The Key Comorbidities in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lonicera japonica is a wide-spread member of the Caprifoliaceae (honeysuckle) family utilized in traditional medical practices. This twining vine honeysuckle is also a much-sought ornamental, in part due to its dynamic flower coloration, which changes from white to gold during development. The molecular mechanism underlying dynamic flower coloration in L. japonica was elucidated by integrating whole genome sequencing, transcriptomic analysis, and biochemical assays. Here, we report a chromosome-level genome assembly of L. japonica, comprising nine pseudo-chromosomes with a total size of 843.2 Mb. We also provide evidence for a whole genome duplication event in the lineage leading to L. japonica, which occurred after its divergence from Dipsacales and Asterales. Moreover, gene expression analysis not only revealed correlated expression of the relevant biosynthetic genes with carotenoid accumulation, but also suggested a role for carotenoid degradation in L. japonica's dynamic flower coloration. The variation of flower color is consistent with not only the observed carotenoid accumulation pattern, but also with the release of volatile apocarotenoids that presumably serve as pollinator attractants. Beyond novel insights into the evolution and dynamics of flower coloration, the high-quality L. japonica genome sequence also provides a foundation for molecular breeding to improve desired characteristics.","output":"The honeysuckle genome provides insight into the molecular mechanism of carotenoid metabolism underlying dynamic flower coloration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To understand the impact of COVID-19 on radiology trainee experience and well-being.

In contrast, the assays with animal hyperimmune sera have only been used in in vitro assays. Finding an animal that faithfully reproduces all the characteristics of the disease in humans is difficult. Some models may be more complex to work with, such as monkeys, or require genetic manipulation so that they can express the human ACE2 receptor, as in the case of mice. Although some models are more promising, possibly the use of more than one animal model represents the best scenario.

We investigated multimorbidity and inflammatory biomarkers in relation to the increasing liver fibrosis risk to delineate 8-year all-cause mortality trajectories in 1929 older adults from the population-based Salus in Apulia Study. Liver fibrosis risk was assumed using the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, assigned to three liver fibrosis risk groups (low, intermediate, high). In the secondary analyses, the APRI score was also calculated to allow for comparisons. Male subjects (prevalence difference: ?13.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): ?18.96 to ?8.03), a higher multimorbidity burden (effect size, ES: ?0.14, 95% CI: ?0.26 to ?0.02), a higher prevalence of physical frailty (ES: 6.77, 95% CI: 0.07 to 13.47), and a more pronounced inflammatory pattern as indicated by tumor growth factor- circulating levels (ES: ?0.12, 95% CI: ?0.23 to ?0.01) were significantly more common in the highest-risk FIB-4 score group. Liver function characterized by lipid profile and platelet levels worsened with increasing FIB-4 risk score. The 8-year risk of death was nearly double in subjects in the highest-risk FIB-4 score group, even after controlling for possible confounders. Furthermore, a steeper mortality curve was clearly observed for FIB-4 scores as compared with the APRI scoring system with respect to liver fibrosis risk. In conclusion, using a scoring tool based on simple routine biomarkers to detect liver fibrosis risk may enhance biological knowledge of age-related outcomes of chronic liver disease and be helpful in the clinical setting to identify subjects at risk for adverse health-related outcomes, including mortality.","output":"Liver Fibrosis and 8-Year All-Cause Mortality Trajectories in the Aging Cohort of the Salus in Apulia Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel Corona Virus pandemic beginning from Wuhan, China primarily affects the respiratory tract but its has impacted clinical practice across a range of specialities including neurology. We review the bearing of the 2019 NCoV infection on neurological practice. Neurological manifestations are less common than respiratory manifestations, yet conspicuous, affecting nearly over a third of hospitalized individuals. These may be classified in to early - headache, dizziness, hyposmia and hypogeusia and late - encephalopathy. Rarely but surely, a very small proportion of infected individuals might present with stroke. Certain neurological conditions, including cerebrovascular disease in both China and Italy and dementia in Italy predispose to infection and more severe manifestations, requiring intensive care unit admission. There is no convincing evidence that the manifestations, course and outcome of various neurological disorders is impacted by 2019 nCoV infection. Concerns of an increased risk of febrile seizures offset by a reduced frequency of infection in the paediatric age group. Individuals with multiple sclerosis might potentially experience both true and pseudorelapses. Besides a direct effect, 2019 nCoV has tremendously affected neurological care by disrupting the continuity of care and the availability of neurological medicines worldwide. Neurologists should respond to this challenge by developing and sustaining innovative methods of providing care as well as alerting the society at large to adopt measures to contain the spread of 2019 nCoV.","output":"2019-NCoV: What every neurologist should know?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is the disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (termed SARS coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2).

Contact tracing smartphone apps are among a raft of measures introduced to reduce spread of the virus, but their uptake depends on public choice. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to ascertain the views of citizens in Wales on their intended use of a COVID-19 contact tracing smartphone app, including self-proposed reasons for or against use and what could lead to a change of decision. METHODS: We distributed an anonymous survey among 4000 HealthWise Wales participants in May 2020. We adopted a mixed methods approach: responses to closed questions were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics; open question responses were analyzed and grouped into categories. RESULTS: A total of 976 (24.4%) people completed the survey. Smartphone usage was 91.5% overall, but this varied among age groups. In total, 97.1% were aware of contact tracing apps, but only 67.2% felt sufficiently informed. Furthermore, 55.7% intended to use an app, 23.3% refused, and 21.0% were unsure. The top reasons for app use were as follows: controlling the spread of the virus, mitigating risks for others and for oneself, and increasing freedoms. The top reasons against app use were as follows: mistrusting the government, concerns about data security and privacy, and doubts about efficacy. The top response for changing ones mind about app use from being willing to being unwilling was that nothing would; that is, they felt that nothing would cause them to become unwilling to use a contact tracing app. This was also the top response for changing ones mind from being unwilling to being willing to use contact tracing apps. Among those who were unsure of using contact tracing apps, the top response was the need for more information. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents demonstrated a keenness to help themselves, others, society, and the government to avoid contracting the virus and to control its spread. However, digital inclusion varied among age groups, precluding participation for some people. Nonetheless, unwillingness was significant, and considering the nature of the concerns raised and the perceived lack of information, policy and decision-makers need to do more to act openly, increase communication, and demonstrate trustworthiness if members of the public are to be confident in using an app.","output":"To Use or Not to Use a COVID-19 Contact Tracing App: Mixed Methods Survey in Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technological skills development is a central issue for a countrys educational and social policies.

These studies employed asynchronous online discussions in which participants were asked to respond to weekly prompts. A study facilitator moderated the discussion, encouraging participants to respond to both the prompts and comments of other participants. In the first pilot (n=8), participants engaged in a collective exploration of different symptoms of pre-frailty and frailty. The second (n=10) and third (n=10) pilots employed a hybrid approach including collaborative exploration and learning of different problem-solving therapy skills over eight weeks.

METHODS The NSQIP database was utilized to examine the clinical data of patients undergoing elective rectal resections during 2005-2013. Multivariate regression analysis was used to compare postoperative complications of patients who underwent PEx and proctectomy procedure. RESULTS We sampled a total of 7,950 patients who underwent rectal resection. Of these, 303 (3.8%) patients underwent pelvic exenteration. Mortality, morbidity, and infectious complications of patients who underwent pelvic exenteration were 1.7%, 65.7%, and 42.6%, respectively. Patients who underwent PEx had a significantly higher rate of morbidity (AOR: 2.01, P < 0.01), overall infectious complications (AOR: 1.49, P < 0.01), hemorrhagic complications (AOR: 3.36, P < 0.01), and surgical site infections (SSI) (AOR: 1.23, P = 0.04) compared to patients who underwent proctectomy.

The current commercially available veterinary vaccines are generally costly and most require high levels of biosafety for their manufacture. Consequently, we explored making a particulate vaccine candidate made transiently in plants as a more cost-effective and safer means of production.

The longitudinal effects of COVID-19-associated AKI on kidney function remain unknown. Objective: To compare the rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after hospital discharge between patients with and without COVID-19 who experienced in-hospital AKI. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at 5 hospitals in Connecticut and Rhode Island from March 10 to August 31, 2020. Patients who were tested for COVID-19 and developed AKI were screened, and those who survived past discharge, did not require dialysis within 3 days of discharge, and had at least 1 outpatient creatinine level measurement following discharge were included. Exposures: Diagnosis of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mixed-effects models were used to assess the association between COVID-19-associated AKI and eGFR slope after discharge. The secondary outcome was the time to AKI recovery for the subgroup of patients whose kidney function had not returned to the baseline level by discharge. Results: A total of 182 patients with COVID-19-associated AKI and 1430 patients with AKI not associated with COVID-19 were included. The population included 813 women (50.4%); median age was 69.7 years (interquartile range, 58.9-78.9 years). Patients with COVID-19-associated AKI were more likely to be Black (73 [40.1%] vs 225 [15.7%]) or Hispanic (40 [22%] vs 126 [8.8%]) and had fewer comorbidities than those without COVID-19 but similar rates of preexisting chronic kidney disease and hypertension. Patients with COVID-19-associated AKI had a greater decrease in eGFR in the unadjusted model (-11.3; 95% CI, -22.1 to -0.4 mL/min/1.73 m2/y; P = .04) and after adjusting for baseline comorbidities (-12.4; 95% CI, -23.7 to -1.2 mL/min/1.73 m2/y; P = .03). In the fully adjusted model controlling for comorbidities, peak creatinine level, and in-hospital dialysis requirement, the eGFR slope difference persisted (-14.0; 95% CI, -25.1 to -2.9 mL/min/1.73 m2/y; P = .01). In the subgroup of patients who had not achieved AKI recovery by discharge (n = 319), COVID-19-associated AKI was associated with decreased kidney recovery during outpatient follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.92). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of US patients who experienced in-hospital AKI, COVID-19-associated AKI was associated with a greater rate of eGFR decrease after discharge compared with AKI in patients without COVID-19, independent of underlying comorbidities or AKI severity. This eGFR trajectory may reinforce the importance of monitoring kidney function after AKI and studying interventions to limit kidney disease after COVID-19-associated AKI.","output":"Assessment of Acute Kidney Injury and Longitudinal Kidney Function After Hospital Discharge Among Patients With and Without COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penyebaran virus COVID-19 telah mengguncang perekonomian di berbagai negara, termasuk Indonesia.

For each scenario, we discuss its implications for the dynamics of herd immunity and on projections of the global impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the human population, and assess its plausibility.

Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical data and outcomes of COVID-19 positive cancer patients treated consecutively in five North London hospitals (cohort A). Outcomes recorded included time interval between most recent anti-cancer treatment and admission, severe outcome [a composite endpoint of intensive care unit (ITU) admission, ventilation and/or death] and mortality. Outcomes were compared with consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients, without a history of cancer (cohort B), treated at the primary centre during the same time period (1 MarchC30 April 2020). Patients were matched for age, gender and comorbidity. Results: The median age in both cohorts was 74 years, with 67% male, and comprised of 30 patients with cancer, and 90 without (1:3 ratio). For cohort B, 579 patients without a history of cancer and consecutively admitted were screened from the primary London hospital, 105 were COVID-19 positive and 90 were matched and included. Excluding cancer, both cohorts had a median of two comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality, comparing patients with cancer to those without, was 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4C2.5], and severe outcome (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.4C2.0) suggesting no increased risk of death or a severe outcome in patients with cancer. Cancer patients who received systemic treatment within 28 days had an OR for mortality of 4.05 (95% CI 0.68C23.95), p = 0.12. On presentation anaemia, hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia were identified predominantly in cohort A. Median duration of admission was 8 days for cancer patients and 7 days for non-cancer.

We also sought to reflect of impact of increase in televisits and overlapping symptoms of COVID 19 and upper respiratory tract infections. METHODS: Our cohort study extending from October 2017 to March 2021. We collected number of diagnoses of upper respiratory infections and number of unique clinic visits during four consecutive respiratory seasons at our primary care sites via electronic health records. RESULTS: During the recent October 2020 to March 2021 respiratory season which coincided with the second NYC Covid-19 wave, we had 11569 unique clinic visits and 39 diagnoses of an upper respiratory tract infection - incident rate of 1.29. In the three prior respiratory seasons combined, we had 40939 unique clinic visits and 833 diagnoses of an upper respiratory tract infection C incident rate of 1.49. The incident rates showed a dramatic decline using the test based method and the chi square-statistic p< 0.0001 with an incident rate ratio using a poisson exact method of 6.0359.

Insights into the interplay between PEDV infection and the innate immune system are necessary for understanding the associated mechanism of pathogenesis. The transcription factor NF-B plays an important role in regulating host immune responses. Here, we elucidated for the first time to our knowledge the potential mechanism of PEDV-mediated NF-B activation in porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). During PEDV infection, NF-B p65 was found to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and PEDV-dependent NF-B activity was associated with viral dose and active replication. Using small interfering RNAs to screen different mRNA components of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) or RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathways, we demonstrated that TLR2, TLR3 and TLR9 contribute to NF-B activation in response to PEDV infection, but not RIG-I. By screening PEDV structural proteins for their ability to induce NF-B activities, we found that PEDV nucleocapsid protein (N) could activate NF-B and that the central region of N was essential for NF-B activation. Furthermore, TLR2 was involved in PEDV N-induced NF-B activation in IECs. Collectively, these findings provide new avenues of investigation into the molecular mechanisms of NF-B activation induced by PEDV infection.","output":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection induces NF-B activation through the TLR2, TLR3 and TLR9 pathways in porcine intestinal epithelial cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper uses the mixed frequency vector autoregression model to explore the impact of economic fluctuations on infectious diseases mortality (IDM) from China perspective.

Specifically, IDM usually increases with deterioration in economic conditions, and vice versa. The empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis I derived from the theoretical analysis, which highlights that economic fluctuations can negatively affect the mortality of infectious diseases. The findings can offer revelations for the government to consider the role of economic conditions in controlling the epidemic of infectious diseases. Policymakers should adopt appropriate and effective strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of macroeconomic downturns on the mortality of infectious diseases.

This study aimed to examine the burden of ARIs among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children presenting to Western Australian (WA) EDs from 2002 to 2012. METHOD: Using a retrospective population-based cohort study linking ED records to birth and perinatal records, we examined presentation rates for metropolitan, rural and remote Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children from 469 589 births. We used ED diagnosis information to categorise presentations into ARI groups and calculated age-specific rates. Negative binomial regression was used to investigate association between risk factors and frequency of ARI presentation. RESULTS: Overall, 26% of presentations were for ARIs. For Aboriginal children, the highest rates were for those aged <12 months in the Great Southern (1233 per 1000 child-years) and Pilbara regions (1088 per 1000 child-years). Rates for non-Aboriginal children were highest in children <12 months in the Southwest and Kimberley (400 and 375 per 1000 child-years, respectively). Presentation rates for ARI in children from rural and remote WA significantly increased over time in all age groups <5 years. Risk factors for children presenting to ED with ARI were: male, prematurity, caesarean delivery and residence in the Kimberley region and lower socio-economic areas. CONCLUSION: One in four ED presentations in WA children are for ARIs, representing a significant out-of-hospital burden with some evidence of geographical disparity.

METHODS We searched six databases from inception through March 12th, 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies comparing LMWH vs UFH for thromboprophylaxis in adult trauma patients. We pooled effect estimates across RCTs and observational studies separately, using random-effects model and inverse variance weighting. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for observational studies and assessed certainty of findings using GRADE methodology. RESULTS We included 4 RCTs (879 patients) and 8 observational studies (306,747 patients). Based on pooled RCT data, compared to UFH, LMWH reduces deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (relative risk [RR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50 to 0.88, moderate certainty) and VTE (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.90, moderate certainty). As compared to UFH, LMWH may reduce pulmonary embolism (adjusted odds ratio from pooled observational studies (aOR) 0.56 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.62) and mortality (aOR from pooled observational studies 0.54, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.65), though based on low certainty evidence.

Therefore, an international research team organized by the Global Health Heat Information Network generated an inventory of the specific concerns about this nexus and began to address the issues. Three key thermal and covid-19 related topics were highlighted: 1) For the general public, going to public cool areas in the hot season interferes with the recommendation to stay at home to reduce the spread of the virus. Conflicting advice makes it necessary to revise national heat plans and alert policymakers of this forecasted issue. 2) For medical personnel working in hot conditions, heat strain is exacerbated due to a reduction in heat loss from wearing personal protective equipment to prevent contamination. To avoid heat-related injuries, medical personnel are recommended to precool and to minimize the increase in body core temperature using adopted work/rest schedules, specific clothing systems, and by drinking cold fluids. 3) Fever, one of the main symptoms of COVID-19, may be difficult to distinguish from heat-induced hyperthermia and a resting period may be necessary prior to measurement to avoid misinterpretation.

Even with the improvements in the treatment of DLBCL, around a quarter of patients will experience recurrence. The aim of this single centre retrospective study was to predict which patients would have recurrence within 2 years of their treatment using machine learning techniques based on radiomics extracted from the staging PET/CT images. Our study demonstrated that in our dataset of 229 patients (training data = 183, test data = 46) that a combined radiomic and clinical based model performed better than a simple model based on metabolic tumour volume, and that it had a good predictive ability which was maintained when tested on an unseen test set. ABSTRACT: Background: Approximately 30% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) will have recurrence. The aim of this study was to develop a radiomic based model derived from baseline PET/CT to predict 2-year event free survival (2-EFS). Methods: Patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy undergoing pre-treatment PET/CT between January 2008 and January 2018 were included. The dataset was split into training and internal unseen test sets (ratio 80:20). A logistic regression model using metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and six different machine learning classifiers created from clinical and radiomic features derived from the baseline PET/CT were trained and tuned using four-fold cross validation. The model with the highest mean validation receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) was tested on the unseen test set.

However, there is little qualitative research examining perceptions of infection control measures in the context of pandemic influenza. METHODS: Eight focus groups and one interview were conducted with a purposive sample of 31 participants. Participants were invited to discuss their perceptions of infection transmission and likely adherence to infection control measures in both non-pandemic and pandemic contexts. Infection control measures discussed included handwashing, social distancing and cough hygiene (e.g. covering mouth, disposing of tissues immediately etc.). RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed that although participants were knowledgeable about infection transmission, most expressed unfavourable attitudes toward control behaviours in non-pandemic situations. However, with the provision of adequate education about control measures and appropriate practical support (e.g. memory aids, access to facilities), most individuals report that they are likely to adhere to infection control protocols in the event of a pandemic. Of the behaviours likely to influence infection transmission, handwashing was regarded by our participants as more feasible than cough and sneeze hygiene and more acceptable than social distancing. CONCLUSION: Handwashing could prove a useful target for health promotion, but interventions to promote infection control may need to address a number of factors identified within this study as potential barriers to carrying out infection control behaviours.","output":"What infection control measures will people carry out to reduce transmission of pandemic influenza?

A reduction in pH from 6.7 to 6 in the lungs, as observed in respiratory disease, led to 20-fold, 4.0-fold, and 2.7-fold increases in lung exposure of CQ, HCQ, and AZ, respectively. Simulations indicated that the relatively high concentrations of CQ and HCQ in lung tissue were sustained long after administration of the drugs had stopped.

Vaccinia virus replication is significantly abrogated upon ATA treatment, which is associated with the inhibition of early viral gene transcription. This inhibitory effect may be attributed to two findings. First, ATA blocks the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, an event shown to be essential for vaccinia virus replication. Second, ATA inhibits the phosphatase activity of the viral enzyme H1L, which is required to initiate viral transcription. Thus, ATA inhibits vaccinia virus replication by targeting both cellular and viral factors essential for the early stage of replication.","output":"Aurintricarboxylic acid inhibits the early stage of vaccinia virus replication by targeting both cellular and viral factors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has consistently been the most frequently diagnosed gastrointestinal malady in the USA.

In the initial phase of population-based vaccination in the United States (U.S.) and United Kingdom (U.K.), vaccine hesitancy and limited access may result in disparities in uptake. METHODS: We performed a cohort study among U.S. and U.K. participants in the smartphone-based COVID Symptom Study (March 24, 2020-February 16, 2021). We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (unsure/not willing) and receipt. RESULTS: In the U.S. (n=87,388), compared to White non-Hispanic participants, the multivariable ORs of vaccine hesitancy were 3.15 (95% CI: 2.86 to 3.47) for Black participants, 1.42 (1.28 to 1.58) for Hispanic participants, 1.34 (1.18 to 1.52) for Asian participants, and 2.02 (1.70 to 2.39) for participants reporting more than one race/other. In the U.K. (n=1,254,294), racial and ethnic minorities had similarly elevated hesitancy: compared to White participants, their corresponding ORs were 2.84 (95% CI: 2.69 to 2.99) for Black participants, 1.66 (1.57 to 1.76) for South Asian participants, 1.84 (1.70 to 1.98) for Middle East/East Asian participants, and 1.48 (1.39 to 1.57) for participants reporting more than one race/other. Among U.S. participants, the OR of vaccine receipt was 0.71 (0.64 to 0.79) for Black participants, a disparity that persisted among individuals who specifically endorsed a willingness to obtain a vaccine. In contrast, disparities in uptake were not observed in the U.K. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was greater among racial and ethnic minorities, and Black participants living in the U.S. were less likely to receive a vaccine than White participants. Lower uptake among Black participants in the U.S. during the initial vaccine rollout is attributable to both hesitancy and disparities in access.","output":"Racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and uptake"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other cities in China in 2019 has become a global pandemic as declared by World Health Organization (WHO) in the first quarter of 2020 .

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created common questions among patients with ADPKD. In this review, we discuss COVID-19 concerns centered around a patient with a common clinical vignette. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: We performed PubMed and Google scholar searches for English, peer-reviewed studies related to COVID-19, ADPKD, CKD, tolvaptan, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and vaccination. We also evaluated transplant data provided by the Ontario Trillium Gift of Life Network. METHODS: Following an assessment of available literature, this narrative review addresses common questions of patients with ADPKD in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. KEY FINDINGS: Data regarding the risk of developing COVID-19 and the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with ADPKD remain limited, but patients with ADPKD with impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), kidney transplants, or on dialysis are likely at similar increased risk as those with generally defined CKD. We provide strategies to improve virtual care, which is likely to persist after the pandemic. Current evidence suggests ACEi, ARB, and tolvaptan treatment should be continued unless contraindicated due to severe illness. When available, and in the absence of a severe allergy, vaccination is recommended for all patients with ADPKD. LIMITATIONS: This narrative review is limited by a paucity of high-quality data on COVID-19 outcomes in patients specifically with ADPKD.

The data were collected, utilizing a self-report online questionnaire, from a sample of 521 Bangladeshi adults. Results showed significant gender differences in COVID-19 fear, stress, and sleep quality and also a significant association between these variables. Mediation results revealed that stress fully mediated the association between COVID-19 fear and sleep quality for males and partially mediated it for females.

This study examined the effect of air filtration and ultra-violet (UV) light sterilisation on detectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 and other microbial bioaerosols. MethodsWe conducted a crossover study of portable air filtration and sterilisation devices in a repurposed surge COVID ward and surge ICU. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) cyclonic aerosol samplers and PCR assays were used to detect the presence of airborne SARS-CoV-2 and other microbial bioaerosol with and without air/UV filtration. ResultsAirborne SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the ward on all five days before activation of air/UV filtration, but on none of the five days when the air/UV filter was operational; SARS-CoV-2 was again detected on four out of five days when the filter was off. Airborne SARS-CoV-2 was infrequently detected in the ICU. Filtration significantly reduced the burden of other microbial bioaerosols in both the ward (48 pathogens detected before filtration, two after, p=0.05) and the ICU (45 pathogens detected before filtration, five after p=0.05). ConclusionsThese data demonstrate the feasibility of removing SARS-CoV-2 from the air of repurposed surge wards and suggest that air filtration devices may help reduce the risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated structural brain correlates of burnout severity in medical professionals using a voxel-based morphometric technique. Nurses in active service underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Two core dimensions of burnout, namely, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, were assessed using self-reported psychological questionnaires. Levels of emotional exhaustion were found to be negatively correlated with gray matter (GM) volumes in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and left insula. Moreover, levels of depersonalization were negatively correlated with GM volumes in the left vmPFC and left thalamus.

In patients with refractory CRS, use of several other agents as third-line therapy (including siltuximab, ruxolitinib, anakinra, dasatinib, and cyclophosphamide) has been reported on an anecdotal basis. At our institution, anakinra has become the standard treatment for the management of steroid-refractory ICANS with or without CRS, based on recent animal data demonstrating the role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of ICANS/CRS.

METHOD: A qualitative explorative study was conducted, which involved ten semi-structured individual telephone interviews with social workers. The study sample included employees within the social service, working in a specialised case unit who had experience of referring children and/or adolescents to the medical home model called H?lsofam. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings of the current study indicated that working with H?lsofam has offered social workers a way into the health care sector and an active collaborative working situation, with focus on organised work across the silos of care services. However, the findings raised the question of whether or not all children and adolescents have the same possibility to receive care from H?lsofam. CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that the H?lsofam model had a positive impact on the interrelations between the social service and the health care sector.

Methods: An online survey of psychological and sleep by using Questionnaire Star program from 5th to 19th February 2020 was conducted. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised was used to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related stress symptoms. Meanwhile, Questionnaires of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Insomnia Severity Index were respectively used to assess the severity of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 3 134 subjects were included. Among the included subjects, 15.5% (487), 24.9% (779), 28.7% (899) and 30.9% (968) of the subjects had COVID-19-related stress symptoms, anxiety, depression and insomnia after the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. The severity levels of anxiety, depression and insomnia were significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to prior to the outbreak (all P<0.01). Furthermore, the subjects' stress response to the COVID-19 outbreak was an independent risk factor for increased anxiety, depression and insomnia after the outbreak. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in related stress response and widespread increase in anxiety, depression, and insomnia outside Hubei Province, China in the general population. The aggravation of anxiety, depression and insomnia is associated with stress levels. Our data demonstrate that the widespread psychological and insomnia problems in the general population need to be addressed at the early phase of the pandemic.","output":"[Stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia in adults outside Hubei province during the COVID-19 pandemic]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide. Systematic analysis of lung cancer survivors at molecular and clinical levels is warranted to understand the disease course and clinical characteristics. Methods: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted in 65 patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, of which 13 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer. The study was conducted from February 4 to April 11, 2020. Results: During the course of treatment, lung cancer survivors infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) had shorter median time from symptom onset to hospitalization (P = 0.016) and longer clinical symptom remission time (P = 0.020) than non-cancer individuals. No differences were observed among indicators such as time from symptom onset to hospitalization and symptom remission time between medium-term and short-term survivors. The expression of ACE2 (P = 0.013) and TMPRSS2 (P &lt;0.001) was elevated in lung cancer survivors as compared with that in non-cancer individuals. Conclusions: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels were higher at resection margins of lung cancer survivors than those in normal tissues of non-cancerous individuals and may serve as factors responsible for the high susceptibility to COVID-19 among lung cancer survivors.

It plays an important role in proteolytic processes in the kidney, cardiovascular regulation, immune response, cell proliferation, foetal development etc. It is an important neuropeptidase and amyloid-degrading enzyme which makes NEP a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, it plays a preventive role in development of cancer, obesity and type-2 diabetes. Recently a role of NEP in COVID-19 pathogenesis has also been suggested. Despite intensive research into NEP structure and functions in different organisms, changes in its expression and regulation during brain development and ageing, especially in age-related pathologies, is still not fully understood. This prevents development of pharmacological treatments from various diseases in which NEP is implicated although recently a dual-acting drug sacubitril-valsartan (LCZ696) combining a NEP inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker has been approved for treatment of heart failure. Also, various natural compounds capable of upregulating NEP expression, including green tea (EGCG), have been proposed as a preventive medicine in prostate cancer and AD.

We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a dataset of 10.7 million patients, of whom 0.9 million have vaccination data, to describe outcomes in vaccinated CLD patients. Methods: We identified all CLD patients with or without cirrhosis regardless of vaccination status who had SARS-CoV-2 testing in the N3C Data Enclave as of 1/15/2022. We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rates of breakthrough infections and Cox survival analyses to associate vaccination status with all-cause mortality at 30 days among infected CLD patients. Results: We isolated 278,457 total CLD patients: 43,079 (15%) vaccinated and 235,378 (85%) unvaccinated. Of the 43,079 vaccinated CLD patients, 32,838 (76%) were without cirrhosis and 10,441 (24%) were with cirrhosis. Estimated incidence rates for breakthrough infections were 5.6 and 5.1 per 1,000 person-months for 27,235 fully vaccinated CLD patients without cirrhosis and for 8,218 fully vaccinated CLD patients with cirrhosis, respectively. Of the 68,048 unvaccinated and 10,441 vaccinated CLD patients with cirrhosis in our cohort, 15% and 3.7%, respectively, developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The combined 30-day all-cause rate of mechanical ventilation (without death) or death after SARS-CoV-2 infection for unvaccinated and vaccinated CLD patients with cirrhosis were 15.2% and 7.7%, respectively. Compared to unvaccinated patients with cirrhosis, full vaccination was associated with a 0.34-times adjusted hazard of death at 30 days. Conclusions: In this N3C Data Enclave study, breakthrough infection rates were similar amongst CLD patients with and without cirrhosis. Full vaccination was associated with a 66% reduction in risk of all-cause mortality among CLD patients with cirrhosis after infection. These results provide an additional impetus for increasing vaccination uptake among patients with severe liver disease.","output":"Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Infection Outcomes in Vaccinated Patients with Chronic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis: A National COVID Cohort Collaborative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 17 March 2020, Ontario's courthouses shut their doors as the civil justice system locked down with the rest of the province Regular court operations were suspended due to the state of emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic This was followed by a flurry of activity as courts drew up plans to resume operations as soon as possible The \\"new normal\\" became virtual hearings, either by video conference, in writing, or by telephone As Attorney General Douglas Downey said, \\"We've modernized the legal system by about 25 years in 25 days \\" Has the revolution arrived?

Of all the mental health conditions, major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of global health-related burden. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many uncertain factors affecting mental health accumulated, such as virus transmission, blockade and ban, public transport restrictions, closure of schools and enterprises, and reduction of social interaction, which led to an increase in the potential risk of MDD, further increasing the global health-related burden. Methodology To better clarify the public interest in major depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, a Google Trends analysis was employed with data from December 2019 to December 2021, taking the cumulative diagnosis rate and cumulative mortality rate of COVID-19 as the reference standard, The changes in public interest and behavior in online searching for major depressive disorder in the three countries most affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus (i.e. the United States, Brazil, and India) were evaluated. Results We observed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, public interest in major depressive disorder increased significantly on the Internet. At the same time, compared with the United States, this upward trend is more prominent in India and Brazil. The study found that the major depressive disorder search index of the United States reached the maximum at the end of September 2021, the major depressive disorder search index of Brazil reached the maximum at the beginning of July 2021, and the major depressive disorder search index of India reached the maximum at the beginning of June 2021. The above time nodes are the first turning point of decline after the continuous surge of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the United States, Brazil, and India, indicating that there is an important time correlation between the surge of COVID-19 cases and the public online search term major depressive disorder. Conclusion The Google Trends analysis shows that public interest in major depressive disorder is on the rise under the COVID-19 pandemic and that COVID-19 may be associated with MDD. These findings deserve further exploration, especially as a growing body of research reports suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the prevalence of MDD. The epidemic alerts the vast majority of countries to urgently strengthen mental health systems and provide patients with the necessary interventions based on the determinants of poor mental health.","output":"Significantly Increased Public Interest in Major Depressive Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights From a Google Trends Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel emerging enteric coronavirus found in pigs. Intestinal enteroids, which partially recreate the structure and function of intestinal villi-crypts, have many physiological similarities to the intestinal tissues in vivo. Enteroids exhibit advantages in studying the interactions between intestines and enteric pathogens. To create a novel infection model for PDCoV, we developed an in vitro system to generate porcine intestinal enteroids from crypts of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of pigs. Enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, stem cells, proliferating cells, and goblet cells were found in the differentiated enteroids. Replication of PDCoV was detected in the cultured enteroids by immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. Double immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated that PDCoV was present in Sox9-positive intestinal cells and Villin1-positive enterocytes. There were multiple cellular responses shown as changes of transcription of genes related to mucosal immunity, antiviral genes, and marker genes of stem cells and other cells in the enteroids infected with PDCoV. We conclude that the 2-D enteroids derived from porcine jejunum can be used as an in vitro multicellular model for the investigation of pathogenesis and host immune responses to porcine enteric pathogens, such as PDCoV.","output":"Utility Evaluation of Porcine Enteroids as PDCoV Infection Model in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Africa is the second most populous continent after Asia comprising 54 countries Given the healthcare system deficiencies in Africa, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was expected to be disastrous The first case of COVID-19 on the continent was reported in Egypt on 14 February 2020 By 13 May, cases had been reported in all 54 countries Several practice guidelines specific to radiation oncology departments have been published, including prioritisation criteria for postponing radiotherapy, continuation of treatment, hypofractionation or even omitting radiotherapy The oncology community in Africa has suddenly needed to protect both patients and caregivers and to ensure continuity of essential clinical services despite several challenges Considering equipment unavailability, lack of human resources and poor infrastructure, tailoring COVID-19 pandemic management to the African context seems mandatory and a unified approach to guideline development in this context is encouraged In this article, we discuss contextual issues coming into play, highlighting steps to be taken by radiotherapy centres in Africa to mitigate fallouts from the current pandemic to ensure the safety of our patients and staff as well as the impact on future care","output":"Cancer care and COVID-19: tailoring recommendations for the African radiation oncology context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study predicts handwashing behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Rajshahi is one of the cleanest, most peaceful cities in Bangladesh, but the inhabitants often feel uncomfortable about smokers who smoke in public places and often on transport. Smoking frequency is very high among males compared to females, and a large number of smokers are building or road construction laborers and people involved in offering different services such as transportation, vending from vans, etc. The practice of smoking in this area is destructive for mental and physical health especially for students compared to other professionals because the city is known as the City of Education. METHODS: The study analyzes smokers characteristics, general health, and their (smokers) perception of smoking in public places. Cross-sectional data were collected randomly from 160 smokers through face-to-face questionnaire survey. The determinants of complexities with regard to social environment and human health were studied using frequency distribution, chi-square test, and binary and multinomial logistic regression analysis using IBM SPSS version 24. RESULTS: Frequency distributions reveal that 93.8% of smokers believe that smoking creates public health hazards, 51.3% of smokers think it causes breathing complexities for non-smokers, 48.8% of smokers feel smoking causes air pollution, 68.8% of smokers think smoking causes gastric problems, 24.4% of smokers had headache problems due to smoking and cigarette fumes, 86.3% of smokers learnt smoking from friends, 48.8% of smokers smoke due to their addiction and 25.6% for depression, and 80.6% usually smoke after having a meal. The chi-square test reveals that class of smokers was significantly associated with frequency of heartbeat rate, starting smoking at specific age level was significantly associated with suffering from diseases, category of smoking articles was significantly associated with suffering from disease, class of smokers was significantly associated with causes for smoking, and starting smoking at specific age level was significantly associated with profession of the smokers at 1% level of significance respectively. A significant odds ratio was found (OR = 6.363, 95% CI 1.918C21.104, p < 0.01) for the profession group of students/labour at 1% level; their outcomes for suffering from diseases such as gastric problem and fever/headache/others were 6.363 times those for the profession group of service/other smokers. CONCLUSION: Smoking in public places should be restricted because non-smokers cannot breathe freely and it is not healthy for them to inhale smoke indirectly, which has many adverse effects on public health. The study also reveals that the majority of the smokers have gastric problems, abnormal heartbeat rates, frequent headaches, depression and addiction problems, etc., and that they believe that smoking causes significant health hazard on human health and social environment.

European countries have taken different measures to surge ICU capacity, but little is known on the extent. A country level analysis was conducted to compare hospitalisation rates of COVID-19 patients in acute and intensive care and the levels of surge capacity for intensive care beds across 16 European countries and Lombardy region during the first wave of the pandemic (28 February to 31 July). Methods: : We used data on infection rates and numbers of current and/or cumulative COVID-19 patients in acute and intensive care in 16 countries and Lombardy region to analyse the burden on hospitals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on COVID-19 hospitalisations was continuously extracted since 20 March, 2020 from publicly available sources. To evaluate whether hospital capacities were exceeded, we retrieved information on hospital and ICU surge capacity. Treatment days and mean length of hospital stay were calculated to assess hospital utilisation by COVID-19 patients during the first wave. Results: : Pre-pandemic hospital and ICU capacity varied widely across countries. In no studied country did the utilisation of acute care bed capacity by COVID-19 patients exceed 38.3%. However, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Lombardy would not have been able to treat all COVID-19 patients during the first wave without ICU surge capacity. Indicators of hospital utilisation were not consistently related to the numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The mean number of hospital days associated with one SARS-CoV-2 case ranged from 1.3 (Norway) to 11.8 (France). Conclusion: In many countries, the increase of ICU capacity was important to accommodate the high demand for intensive care during the first COVID-19 wave. Our study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 incidence is not the only aspect when it comes to the burden of hospital care for COVID-19 but rather the utilisation of hospital resources as shown by cumulative hospital days and mean length of stay during the first wave.

The measured DCLs are decoupled into radiative carrier lifetime ((R)) and nonradiative carrier lifetime ((NR)), via utilization of the experimental DCL data, and then very carefully investigated as a function of driving current over a wide range of operating temperatures. Next, to understand the measurement results of temperature-dependent (R) and (NR) characteristics, thermodynamic analysis is conducted, which enables to look deeply into the temperature-dependent behavior of the carriers. On the basis of the results, we reveal that thermal droop is originated by the complex dynamics of multiple closely interrelated physical factors instead of a single physical factor.

We explain this output-pandemia tradeoff as resulting from a shock to subsistence health demand that is larger at higher capital utilization in a model with entrepreneurs and workers. The health system moves closer to saturation as the gap between supply and subsistence narrows, which worsens consumption and income inequality. An externality distorts utilization, because firms do not internalize that lower utilization relaxes healthcare saturation. The optimal policy response includes lockdowns and transfers to workers. Quantitatively, strict lockdowns and large transfer hikes can be optimal and yield sizable welfare gains because they prevent a sharp rise in inequality. Welfare and output costs vary in response to small parameter changes or deviations from optimal policies. Weak lockdowns coupled with weak transfers programs are the worst alternative and yet are in line with what several emerging and least developed countries have implemented.","output":"A macroeconomic model of healthcare saturation, inequality and the output-pandemia tradeoff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronotype describes a person's general preference for mornings, evenings, or neither. It is typically conceptualized as a continuous unidimensional spectrum from morningness to eveningness. Eveningness is associated with poorer outcomes across a myriad of physical and mental health outcomes. This preference for later sleep and wake times is associated with increased risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation in both clinical and community samples. However, the mechanisms underlying the negative consequences of this preference for evenings are not fully understood. Previous research has found that sleep disturbances may act as a mediator of this relationship. The present study aimed to explore the associations between chronotype and affective outcomes in a sample of students. Additionally, it aimed to investigate the potential role of insomnia as a mediator within these relationships. Participants (n = 190) completed an anonymous self-report survey of validated measures online which assessed chronotype, insomnia symptoms, and a range of affective outcomes (defeat, entrapment, suicide risk, stress, and depressive and anxious symptomology). Eveningness was associated with more severe or frequent experiences of these outcomes, with participants that demonstrated a preference for eveningness more likely to report poorer affective functioning and increased psychological distress. Mediation analysis found the relationship between chronotype and these outcome measures was completely or partially mediated by insomnia symptom severity measured by the validated Sleep Condition Indicator insomnia scale. Taken together, these findings add further evidence for the negative consequences of increased eveningness. Additionally, our results show that chronotype and sleep disturbances should be considered when assessing mental well-being. Implementing appropriate sleep-related behavior change or schedule alterations can offer a tool for mitigation or prevention of psychological distress in students that report a preference for later sleep and wake times.","output":"Insomnia symptoms mediate the association between eveningness and suicidal ideation, defeat, entrapment, and psychological distress in students."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zizania latifolia is a perennial aquatic vegetable, whose symbiosis with the fungus Ustilago esculenta (member of Basidiomycota, class Ustilaginaceae) results in the establishment of swollen gall formations. Here, we analyzed symbiotic relations of Z. latifolia and U. esculenta, using a triadimefon (TDF) treatment and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Specifically, accurately identify the whole growth cycle of Z. latifolia. Microstructure observations showed that the presence of U. esculenta could be clearly observed after gall formation but was absent after the TDF treatment. A total of 17,541 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, based on the transcriptome. According to gene ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway results, plant hormone signal transduction, and cell wall-loosening factors were all significantly enriched due to U. esculenta infecting Z. latifolia; relative expression levels of hormone-related genes were identified, of which downregulation of indole 3-acetic acid (IAA)-related DEGs was most pronounced in JB_D versus JB_B. The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that IAA, zeatin+trans zeatin riboside, and gibberellin 3 were increased under U. esculenta infection. Based on our results, we proposed a hormone-cell wall loosening model to study the symbiotic mechanism of gall formation after U. esculenta infects Z. latifolia. Our study thus provides a new perspective for studying the physiological and molecular mechanisms of U. esculenta infection of Z. latifolia causing swollen gall formations as well as a theoretical basis for enhancing future yields of cultivated Z. latifolia.[Formula: see text] The author(s) have dedicated the work to the public domain under the Creative Commons CCO \\"No Rights Reserved\\" license by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.","output":"Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Symbiotic Mechanism of Ustilago esculenta-Induced Gall Formation of Zizania latifolia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In nowadays, we have entered the new era of pandemics and the significance of virus detection deeply impacts human society.

The present study aims to use breath VOC analysis to develop a model that can discriminate between patients who have positive cultures and who have negative cultures with a high sensitivity. METHODS/DESIGN: The Molecular Analysis of Exhaled Breath as Diagnostic Test for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (BreathDx) study is a multicentre observational study. Breath and bronchial lavage samples will be collected from 100 and 53 intubated and ventilated patients suspected of VAP. Breath will be analysed using Thermal Desorption C Gas Chromatography C Mass Spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). The primary endpoint is the accuracy of cross-validated prediction for positive respiratory cultures in patients that are suspected of VAP, with a sensitivity of at least 99% (high negative predictive value).

As a result, children may be susceptible to anxiety and digital eye strain, highlighting a need for population interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate whether a digital behavior change intervention aimed at promoting physical activity could reduce children's anxiety and digital eye strain while undergoing prolonged homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, homeschooled grade 7 students at 12 middle schools in southern China were recruited through local schools and randomly assigned by the school to receive (1:1 allocation): (1) health education information promoting exercise and ocular relaxation, and access to a digital behavior change intervention, with live streaming and peer sharing of promoted activities (intervention), or (2) health education information only (control). The primary outcome was change in self-reported anxiety score. Secondary outcomes included change in self-reported eye strain and sleep quality. RESULTS: On March 16, 2020, 1009 children were evaluated, and 954 (94.5%) eligible children of consenting families were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Children in the intervention (n=485, 6 schools) and control (n=469, 6 schools) groups were aged 13.5 (SD 0.5) years, and 52.3% (n=499) were male. The assigned interventions were completed by 896 children (intervention: n=467, 96.3%; control: n=429, 91.5%). The 2-week change in square-root-transformed self-reported anxiety scores was greater in the intervention (-0.23, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.20) vs control group (0.12, 95% CI 0.09-0.16; unadjusted difference -0.36, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.08; P=.02). There was a significant reduction in square-root-transformed eye strain in the intervention group (-0.08, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.06) compared to controls (0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.09; difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.03; P=.02).

This study examines the evolution of anxiety over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, testing for differential experiences among vulnerable populations. METHODS: Phase 1 of the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey details the frequency of anxiety among a nationally representative sample of adults from April 23, 2020 through July 21, 2020. Negative binomial regression assessed differences in the frequency of anxiety among demographic, income, health and employment status cohorts. Propensity score matching to the 2019 National Health Interview Survey allowed previous anxiety and health status to be included in the model. RESULTS: Anxiety frequency for 944,719 individuals was observed over three months. Whites, blacks and Hispanics showed increasing frequency of anxiety over the time period, particularly blacks. Prior to COVID-19, 13% of respondents reported regular or semiregular anxiety, compared to 25-35% during the pandemic. Regression analysis suggests that frequent anxiety was highly and positively correlated with COVID-19 case fatality rate and higher levels of frequency were observed among those with poor health, incomes below $25,000, and without paid employment. LIMITATIONS: Causal inference was not able to be investigated due to the cross-sectional study design. CONCLUSIONS: While blacks showed lower levels of anxiety initially, the proportion of the population experiencing regular anxiety increased nearly 20% over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a subset of infected subjects, pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and eventually death can occur. Frail patients and those with comorbidities are believed to be at increased risk of severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis have a hematologic malignancy that causes multi-organ dysfunction and can be at higher risk of complications and death. The International Society of Amyloidosis (ISA) has issued a guidance (Kastritis et al. BJH 2020, https://cms.cws.net/content/isaamyloidosis.org/files/ISA%20recommendations%20Covid-19%20v_%203_3.pdf) for patients with amyloidosis during the pandemic and called for an international data collection in April 2020. Aim of this study is to report the preliminary data of the ongoing international survey regarding systemic AL amyloidosis and COVID-19. Methods: The survey was proposed by the ISA Board and approved by the coordinating institution's Ethics Committee. All members of the ISA were invited to participate by email and a link for participation is online on ISA website. RedCap software was used for the data collection. Results: Twelve Institutions requested the access to the data collection system from 7 countries. At the data lock of July 26, 2020, 29 patients with systemic amyloidoses were collected from 7 different Institutions. Systemic AL amyloidosis patients reported so far were 19: 12 from the Pavia Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center (Italy), 3 from the Boston Medical Center (USA), and 1 patient each from the Columbia University Hospital (New York, USA), Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, Spain), Clinica Universitaria de Navarra (Navarra, Spain) and Amyloidosis Centrum (Heidelberg, Germany). Eleven (58%) had heart involvement, 8 (42%) had kidney and two or more organs were involved in 9 patients (47%). The most frequent comorbidities reported were history of hypertension in 7 (37%) and cardiovascular diseases in 3 (16%). Four (21%) patients were newly diagnosed and treatment-na?ve at the time SARS-CoV-2 infection was documented. The remaining 15 patients had received a median number of 2 previous lines of therapy (range 1-3). Nine (47%) patients were on active chemotherapy at the time of COVID-19 infection. Five were receiving daratumumab combinations, and the 4 remaining patients were on cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone, oral melphalan and dexamethasone, lenalidomide and ixazomib. Relevant concomitant medications were anti-hypertensive drugs in 26% of cases and diuretics in 21%. One patient was on dialysis. COVID-19-related symptoms were fever 11 (58%), cough 8 (42%), anosmia and ageusia. Pneumonia was documented in 10 (53%) patients, 5 of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (26%). Four of them were treated with non-mechanical ventilation and one accessed intensive care support. Three of the 5 patients with severe COVID-19 had heart involvement, 2/5 had concomitant heart and kidney involved and 3 was infected while on active chemotherapy. Azytromicin was used in 6 (26%) cases, which was in combination with hydroxycloroquine in 4 of them. Three patients received steroids as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, while anticoagulant therapy was used only in two cases. Lopinavir, tocilizumab and sarilumab were used in one patient each. Four patients (21%) died in the whole cohort. Three had ARDS and one patient died few weeks after the recovery of COVID-19 infection. All deceased patients had heart involvement, 2 were on active therapy (daratumumab plus bortezomib and ixazomib plus dexamethasone). Two patients with kidney involvement at diagnosis, one with ARDS and one with a radiological documented pneumonia treated with non-mechanical ventilation recovered from COVID-19 but developed subsequent worsening of renal function, requiring dialysis in one case. Conclusions: The fatality rate and the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 in this series is in the higher range of reports from the general population. Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in renal failure in patients with renal AL amyloidosis.

Clinical symptoms of smell and taste dysfunction are prominent features of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to elucidate the factors associated with smell and taste dysfunction amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A retrospective review of a multi-hospital health network's COVID-19 database between March and June 2020 was performed. Patients with self-reported smell or taste loss were included. Demographic information, patient comorbidities, and mortality data was obtained. There were 2892 patients included in this analysis and 117 reported smell or taste loss (4.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4%-4.8%). The proportion of females with smell or taste loss was significantly higher than males (6.3% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.001), whereas no differences existed between ethnicity or smoking status. When compared with age of 30-40 years, the age group of 10-20 years were most likely to present with smell or taste dysfunction (odds ratio [OR] 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-26.12; P = 0.01). The majority of specific comorbidities were not associated with increased incidence of smell or taste dysfunction. Outpatient healthcare workers were more likely to present with smell or taste loss (OR 3.2, CI 1.8-5.47; P < 0.001). The mortality rate among COVID-19 patients with smell or taste dysfunction was significantly lower than those without (0% vs. 20.3%; P < 0.001).

Recently it was reported that the SARS-Cov-2 viral infection induces acute pulmonary epithelial senescence followed by fibrosis, although the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we examine roles of alveolar epithelial stem cell senescence and senescence-associated differentiation disorders in pulmonary fibrosis, exploring the mechanisms mediating and preventing pulmonary fibrogenic crisis. Notably, the TGF- signalling pathway mediates alveolar epithelial stem cell senescence by mechanisms involving suppression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene in pulmonary fibrosis. Alternatively, telomere uncapping caused by stress-induced telomeric shelterin protein TPP1 degradation mediates DNA damage response, pulmonary senescence and fibrosis. However, targeted intervention of cellular senescence disrupts pulmonary remodelling and fibrosis by clearing senescent cells using senolytics or preventing senescence using telomere dysfunction inhibitor (TELODIN). Studies indicate that the development of senescence-associated differentiation disorders is reprogrammable and reversible by inhibiting stem cell replicative senescence in pulmonary fibrosis, providing a framework for targeted intervention of the molecular mechanisms of alveolar stem cell senescence and pulmonary fibrosis.

The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate patients who require hospitalization from those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision-making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the prediction model risk of bias assessment criteria, and it has not been externally validated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to externally validate the C-19 index across a range of health care settings to determine how well it broadly predicts hospitalization due to pneumonia in COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We followed the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 index. We evaluated the model on two different target populations, 41,381 patients who presented with SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency department visit and 9,429,285 patients who presented with influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency department visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0-30 days. In total, we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. RESULTS: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index had a C statistic of 0.73, and the calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data, the model obtained C statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US, and South Korean data sets, respectively. The calibration was poor, with the model underestimating risk. When validated on 12 data sets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network, the C statistics ranged between 0.40 and 0.68. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 index model is low for influenza cohorts and even worse among patients with COVID-19 in the United States, Spain, and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.","output":"Implementation of the COVID-19 Vulnerability Index Across an International Network of Health Care Data Sets: Collaborative External Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E Hine was a longitudinal qualitative Kaupapa M?ori (by M?ori, for M?ori) research study involving 44 young M?ori women who were first interviewed in 2012-2013 and followed through their pregnancies and until their babies were 2 years old The present analysis of the E Hine database examines the young women's experiences of accessing welfare benefits through Work and Income Welfare benefits were not the central focus of the E Hine study, but often came up in conversations with the young women and their wh?nau (family) As a result, E Hine offers those considering ways to improve welfare benefit policy and service delivery a frank account of how young M?ori mothers and their wh?nau see and experience the system Four themes arose from participants' talk: what being on the benefit was like, their positive and negative impressions of Work and Income, and how they took control of their situation In common with other recent qualitative studies, the findings suggest potential to improve the experience of the welfare benefit system by providing support within the context of culturally-responsive, caring, trust relationships that help unlock the potential of young M?ori parents","output":"E Hine: Young Mori mothers talk about welfare benefits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic struck Ethiopia at an important juncture in its development and political path Following impressive progress in poverty reduction and human development in recent decades, driven by a state-led model, it is transitioning towards a more democratic governance structure and a more liberal economic model This article examines the countrys response to the pandemic, focusing on social protection and health systems Ethiopias experience demonstrates the importance of building shock-responsive systems for social protection, including pre-identification of vulnerable groups and a financing strategy to trigger an immediate response It also highlights how the health sector capacity can be further strengthened in anticipation of future health emergencies For example, the government could identify and build the health sector industry capacity before future shocks occur in order to quickly scale up the response Covid-19 had a disproportionate impact on women and girls due to the closure of schools;limited access to gender-based violence and health services;and the economic impact on informal sectors The article concludes by sharing key lessons for developing countries on how prioritisation of vulnerable groups and ensuring strong political commitment can support a more effective pandemic response ? 2021 The Author IDS Bulletin ?

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SBP) facilitates viral entry via ACE2 and/or NRP1 binding, with DPP4 as a potential co-receptor. These binding partners are expressed on various cell types including hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSC/HSPC) cells [1-3]. HSC/HSPCs generate blood cells and reside in the low oxygen (lowO2, 1-4%) bone marrow niches that provide critical signals for maintenance, self-renewal, and differentiation. To investigate aspects of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with HSC/HSPC such as endogenous receptor expression, SPB binding and subsequent functional alterations in native low O2, we performed transcriptional and phenotypic/functional analysis. In lowO2, we identified increased surface expression of ACE2, DPP4 and NRP1, and enhanced binding of SBP to HSC/HSPC populations which amplified proliferation of SBP bound in lowO2. ACE2 and DPP4 surface expression were 2-fold higher in HSPCs (p=0.017, p=0.001) and HSCs (p=0.010, p=0.03), and NRP1 was 1.5-fold (p=0.002) higher in HSPCs in lowO2 compared to air. Interestingly, in lowO2, overall SBP binding was enhanced in HSPC (2.2-fold, p<.001) and HSC (2.6-fold, p=.018). Although not all cells expressing ACE2/DPP4/NRP1 bind SBP (50%), all cells exhibiting SBP binding in HSC/HSPC populations are triple positive for ACE2, NRP1, and DPP4. Additionally, we observed greater than a 2-fold increase in proliferation of SBP bound vs unbound cells in replating assays in lowO2 (p<.001). These data impart compelling evidence that SBP binding/functional outcomes are unique in low O2, providing a foundation that may have potential clinical implications for COVID19 treatment and expanding our baseline understanding of SARS-CoV-2 viral binding implications.","output":"Sars-cov-2 Binding in Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells under Low Oxygen Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Health care workers experienced considerable psychological distress as a result of COVID-19 due to providing direct patient care, quarantine or self-isolation, and lockdown experience.

The four new devices include technical improvements such as controlled gripper actuation (independent leaflet capture) and continuous left atrial pressure monitoring. To date, a patient-specific device selection algorithm, and the technology's impact on procedural times and success, have not been described. METHODS We present an initial multi-center experience and short-term outcomes with the new system, suggest procedural and imaging considerations, and propose initial guidance for device selection. RESULTS Sixty-one procedures performed by three operators at two centers between November 2019 and May 2020 were analyzed. At 30-day follow-up, there were three deaths (4.9%), four neurological events (6.6%), and seven re-hospitalizations (11.5%). Fifty-nine patients achieved device and procedural success (96.7%), and there was one device-related technical issue (1.6%). Compared to the same operators utilizing the third generation MitraClip?, the G4 system resulted in a significant reduction in the median number of clips used per patient (1 IQR 1-2 vs. 2 IQR 1-3, p = .023) and a trend toward shorter device times. CONCLUSION Based on our initial experience, we found that the MitraClip? G4 system is associated with high procedural success and fewer devices needed per procedure.

Background: EAC SCCs arise in a non-ultraviolet-exposed region of the head and neck, are often locally aggressive and may metastasize to lymph nodes or distant sites. The genomic alterations underlying cutaneous SCC of other sites are well-documented; however, mutational profiles of EAC SCC are less well characterized and may contribute to the unique anatomic site, high rates of recurrence and tumor spread. We performed targeted sequencing of a cohort of primary EAC SCCs to identify recurring and potentially targetable genomic alterations. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of 7 EAC SCCs and subjected to targeted DNA sequencing using a 227-gene panel. Somatic alterations and gene copy number alterations were annotated using our validated, in-house bioinformatics pipelines. Results: In our EAC SCCs, we found recurrent alterations in TP53 and genes of receptor tyrosine kinase (eg, EGFR, FGFR) and PI3K pathways (eg, PIK3CA), similar to cutaneous SCCs of other head and neck sites.

In a prototypical example, the optimal strategy prescribes a school opening of 90 days out of 200 with the number of Covid-19 cases among the individuals related to the school increasing by about 71%, instead of the about 390% increase that would have been a consequence of full opening. As clinical fraction is low in children, these solutions could lead to very few or no symptomatic cases within the school during the whole school year.

Background: Short-time work (Kurzarbeit) has been one of the main policies used to combat the economic and labour market repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic in Germany. We examine whether and, if so, how the growing prevalence of short-time work has affected care patterns. Method: We use data from the IAB-HOPP, a longitudinal study monitored by the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB). The analytical sample includes couples with children aged 12 and younger. We employ multinomial logistic regressions in which the outcome variable is the change in the division of care work from a period before to a period during the coronavirus crisis (June to October 2020). Results: We find that among men, receiving short-time work benefits resulted in more gender-equal care patterns. The positive effect of short-time work on the division of child care is moderated by the level of education. Fathers with low or medium education are more likely to increase their child care share when receiving short-time work benefits compared to fathers with high education.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, thyroid function tests (TFT) of 236 hospitalized patients of COVID-19 along with demographic, comorbid, clinical, biochemical and disease severity records were analysed. Patients were divided into previous euthyroid or hypothyroid status to observe the effect of prior hypothyroidism on the severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: TFT abnormalities were common. Low free T3 (FT3), high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low TSH were seen in 56 (23.7%), 15 (6.4%) and 9 (3.8%) patients, respectively. The median levels of TSH (2.06 vs 1.26 mIU/mL, P = 0.001) and FT3 (2.94 vs 2.47 pg/mL, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in severe disease. Previous hypothyroid status (n = 43) was associated with older age, higher frequency of comorbidities, higher FT4 and lower FT3. TFT did not correlate with markers of inflammation (except lactate dehydrogenase); however, FT3 and TSH negatively correlated with outcome severity score and duration of hospital stay. Cox regression analysis showed that low FT3 was associated with severe COVID-19 (P = 0.032, HR 0.302; CI 0.101C0.904), irrespective of prior hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: Functional thyroid abnormalities (low FT3 and low TSH) are frequently seen in hospitalized patients of COVID-19.

METHODS: The Mayo Clinic Serology Screening Program was created to provide a voluntary, two-stage testing program for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to health care personnel. The first stage used a dried blood spot screening test initiated on June 15, 2020. Those participants identified as reactive were advised to have confirmatory testing via a venipuncture. Venipuncture results through August 8, 2020, were considered. Consent and authorization for testing was required to participate in the screening program. This report, which was conducted under an institutional review board-approved protocol, only includes employees who have further authorized their records for use in research. RESULTS: A total of 81,113 health care personnel were eligible for the program, and of these 29,606 participated in the screening program. A total of 4284 (14.5%) of the dried blood spot test results were \\"reactive\\" and warranted confirmatory testing.

The aim of the study is to present the demographic analysis of difficulties with remote learning, as perceived by students during coronavirus pandemic in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In April 2020, a nationwide online survey was conducted among adolescents aged 11-18 (N=2408). Quantitative and qualitative data were used. Teenagers were asked about the problems connected with remote learning. In order to examine the overall level of remote learning difficulties, a scale of remote learning difficulties (RLD) was devised (range 0-23 points). Differences connected with gender, age and place of residence were analysed. RESULTS: More than a half of the teenagers surveyed rated the increased demands from teachers as a major problem. This answer appeared statistically more often among girls than boys (59.6% v. 53.2%). Almost every third adolescent saw the lack of consultation (31.6%) as a significant problem. Difficulties related to learning in the remote system were most often described as considerable by the oldest students (17-18-years-old) and those living in rural areas. The big problem for them was usually much higher requirements of teachers and poor organization of distance learning. The mean level on the scale of remote learning burden was M=11.9 (SD=7.1). Technical difficulties and insufficient skills in using software constituted additional problems most frequently mentioned by students. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to pay particular attention to organizing appropriate technical conditions for remote learning, especially in rural areas, where students have complained more often than in cities about equipment and problems with access to the Internet during the pandemic.","output":"Demographic analysis of difficulties related to remote education in Poland from the perspective of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientists continue to study SARS-CoV-2, the virus currently responsible for a worldwide pandemic, to determine the best methods to inactivate the virus on surfaces and reduce the risk of contact transmission. Its classification as a Biosafety Level (BSL) -3 pathogen complicates research since few facilities have the capacity for this level of containment. Human betacoronavirus OC43 (OC43) is a good surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 based on its genetic similarity and OC43's BSL-2 classification. Two industry specific surfaces were inoculated with OC43 and sampled at timepoints that reflect typical industry timelines for sanitation. The objective was to determine the stability of OC43 on typical meat facility surfaces. OC43 was propagated on human ileocecal colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (HRT-18, ATCC CCL-244). Infectious virus was quantified by indirect immunofluorescence TCID50 assays on HRT-18 cells. Stainless steel grade 316 and polyethylene (poly top) coupons were inoculated with 100 ul of 2.51 x 106 TCID50 /ml virus by pipette in a grid pattern at room temperature (20oC) in an active biosafety cabinet in triplicate for each timepoint. Coupons were rinsed with 5 ml of sterile filtered beef extract buffer (BEB7), composed of Tris base, glycine, magnesium chloride, and beef extract pH adjusted to 7.0, at 0, 1, 4, 8, and 16 hours post inoculation (hpi). The collected rinsate was aliquoted and stored at -80oC until the TCID50 assays were conducted in batch. The 16 hpi stainless steel samples were created at the time of the poly top experiment. The TCID50 assays were run in duplicate for each sample and TCID50 /ml was calculated and averaged for each replicate. Percent recovery of infectious virus was determined for each timepoint. Virus was observed to have partially dried at 1 hpi and was completely dry at all following timepoints on both surfaces. Few infectious virions were lost between inoculation and 0 hpi collection from both surfaces. Mean percent recovery (MPR) of infectious OC43 from stainless steel and poly top at 0 hpi was 153% and 90%, respectively. At 1 hpi, the MPR from stainless steel was 65% while poly top was 123%. The variability of the assay explains these findings. Stainless steel and poly top had average recoveries of 60% and 25% at 4 hours, respectively. The lowest MPR for stainless steel was 17% at 8 hpi while the lowest MPR for poly top was 7% at 16 hpi. A higher MPR of 43% from stainless steel at 16 hpi reflects this timepoint being conducted on a different day. Infectious OC43 is still detectable on common meat facility surfaces several hours after inoculation, but our current knowledge of enveloped viruses asserts that they are inviable after drying. A maximum decrease of only 1 log TCID50 between inoculation and the 16 hpi samples means that a person could potentially be infected between cleanings if it is possible to transfer dried infectious virus from a surface to a mucous membrane. However, this is a conjecture that requires further study since the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown and no experiment to determine if this contact transfer is possible has been conducted. Currently, similar experiments with SARS are underway.","output":"Determining the Stability of Human Betacoronavirus OC43 on Different Surfaces."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relevance of Cubas medical system, its health tourism and related diplomacy in the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic for the global response to disease outbreaks In addition to Cuba being a destination for leisure tourists in the Caribbean, the renowned Cuban medical system attracts thousands of health tourists seeking low-cost but high-quality treatment This paper demonstrates how Cubas unique response to the pandemic, which included sending thousands of medical staff abroad, can inform structural and global issues and contribute to a more sustainable future Design/methodology/approach: The research in this study is primarily drawn from published academic and media sources that address Cubas medical system, its health tourism and the governments response to the recent pandemic The author, a political scientist and an author of many publications on Cuba, and the PI of a study focused on Cuban tourism, will also draw on her expertise Findings: This paper addresses the Cuban Governments ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic and places this response in the context of Cubas medical system, its health tourism and related diplomacy It reveals key lessons from Cubas response for other tourist destination states and, more broadly, for the worldwide response to global outbreaks and the management of health systems The findings will further research in diplomacy and tourism as well as inform policy and practice Research limitations/implications: This paper explores an ongoing topic and thus further research will be required following the pandemic Practical implications: This research note offers important implications for practice including providing accurate, research-based information that challenges misinformation about Cubas health system, its medical diplomacy program, health tourism and its response to COVID-19 It offers valuable lessons for public health authorities including the importance of preventative health measures, community medicine and the benefits of working globally to combat outbreaks through the sharing of medical staff and resources Social implications: This research note reveals the health, political and social implications of Cubas response in this time of crisis It shows the benefits of a robust but low-cost community-based medicine program, medical diplomacy and how a states response during crisis can moderate the global inequities and injustices such as unequal access to care that often accompany disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 Originality/value: This research note is an early analysis of a response by an important tourist destination country to the pandemic The author anticipates that the information provided to the international community via this open access journal will offer practical implications for the ongoing global efforts to manage this crisis and contribute to the research on tourism, diplomacy, justice and health policy ? 2021, Lana L Wylie","output":"Cubas response to COVID-19: lessons for the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper focuses on changes in food consumption that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its objective is to map changes at individual consumer level and identify the influence of different factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in individual food consumption. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 2,680 residents of Denmark (DK), Germany (DE), and Slovenia (SI) using quota sampling for gender, age and regional distribution. Data on consumption frequencies before and during the pandemic were collected with a food frequency questionnaire in the spring of 2020 (during the first lockdown period) for important types of fresh food and non-perishable food. Our results showed that, depending on the type of food, 15C42% of study participants changed their consumption frequency during the pandemic, compared to before. In all the study countries, the food categories with the highest rates of change were frozen food, canned food, and cake and biscuits; among the food categories with lower rates of change were bread, alcoholic drinks, and dairy products. People across all three countries shopped less frequently during lockdown and there was an overall reduction in the consumption of fresh foods, but an increase in the consumption of food with a longer shelf life in Denmark and Germany. Interestingly though, we observed diverging trends in all food categories analyzed, with some people decreasing and others increasing their consumption frequencies, demonstrating that the pandemic had different impacts on people's lifestyles and food consumption patterns. Using the method of multinomial regression analysis, we identified factors significantly (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.1) related to increases and decrease in individuals' consumption frequencies in different food categories. The factors include restrictions put in place in response to the pandemic (i.e., closure of physical workplaces, canteens, cafs and restaurants, schools, and childcare institutions), changes in households' grocery shopping frequency, individuals' perceived risk of COVID-19, income losses due to the pandemic, and socio-demographic factors. Interesting differences between the countries were detected, allowing insights into the different food cultures.

Although this zoonosis is generally not considered as fatal, the pathogen can eventually cause severe infection with septic shock, multi-organ failure and lethal pulmonary hemorrhages leading to mortality. In this study, we have performed a proteomic analysis of serum samples from leptospirosis patients (n=6), febrile controls (falciparum malaria) (n=8) and healthy subjects (n=18) to obtain an insight about disease pathogenesis and host immune responses in leptospiral infections. 2DE and 2D-DIGE analysis in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS revealed differential expression of 22 serum proteins in leptospirosis patients compared to the healthy controls. Among the identified differentially expressed proteins, 8 candidates exhibited different trends compared to the febrile controls. Functional analysis suggested the involvement of differentially expressed proteins in vital physiological pathways, including acute phase response, complement and coagulation cascades and hemostasis. This is the first report of analysis of human serum proteome alterations in leptospirosis patients, which revealed several differentially expressed proteins, including -1-antitrypsin, vitronectin, ceruloplasmin, G-protein signaling regulator, apolipoprotein A-IV, which have not been reported in context of leptospirosis previously. This study will enhance our understanding about leptospirosis pathogenesis and provide a glimpse of host immunological responses.

Objective The aims of this study were to assess prenatal screening rates of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae and to compare sociodemographic factors between those screened and those not screened. Methods The list of all women who delivered at a tertiary care hospital in Montral, Qubec, between April 2015 and March 2016, was cross-referenced with the list of samples tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. Maternal medical records were reviewed for demographic, prenatal and diagnostic information. Results Of 2,688 mothers, 2,245 women were screened at least once, but only 2,206 women had at least one valid C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae result the day of delivery (82.1%; 95% CI: 80.6%-83.5%). Infection was detected in 46/2,206 (2.1%) screened women: 42 had C. trachomatis infection, two had N. gonorrhoeae infection and two were co-infected. C. trachomatis infection was more frequent in women younger than 25 years (9.8%; 95% CI: 6.7%-13.8%) than in older women (0.8%; 95% CI: 0.4%-1.3%; p<0.001). Each increase in parity decreased the probability of being tested (adjusted odds ratio=0.89; 95% CI: 0.80%-0.97%; p=0.01).

Daily contact exposures to the virus are recorded by each user's contact tracing system and stored in the user's blockchain. Data integrity and immunity against data injection attacks were achieved via the implementation of lightweight block chaining and validation schemes. Data anonymization was also supported via the utilization of the onboard AES crypto engine. Meanwhile, support for user anonymity was incorporated into the proposed system through the implementation of an anonymous authentication protocol based on the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) approach.

Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 include myocardial injury, acute heart failure, and arrhythmias. Both de novo cardiovascular complications and pre-existing cardiovascular co-morbidities are associated with a poor prognosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can be used to assess cardiovascular structure and function non-invasively. Purpose: To investigate the association between TTE parameters and severity of disease in hospitalised adults with confirmed COVID-19 Methods: This single-centre retrospective analysis was conducted at a COVID-19 referral hospital in Indonesia. All consecutive adults hospitalised with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent TTE assessment between 3 April 2020 to 6 April 2021 were included. Comprehensive data including demographics, peak COVID-19 severity, pre-existing co-morbidities, and TTE findings were extracted from electronic medical records. Patients with mild-moderate and severe-critical disease were compared using the chi-square test and odds ratios (OR), with a confidence level of 95%. Results: A total of 488 patients were included in this study;202 with mild-moderate disease and 286 with severe-critical disease. Frequency of old age (>60 years), obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure were higher in the severe-critical group (P < 0.05).

Aims: To evaluate the association between CAC visual score and 6-month mortality in patients without history of atheromatous disease hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A single-centre observational cohort study was conducted, involving 293 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in Paris, France, between 13 March and 30 April 2020, with a 6-month follow-up. Patients with a history of ischaemic stroke or coronary or peripheral artery disease were excluded. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 6 months according to CAC score, which was assessed by analysing images obtained after the first routine non-electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography scan performed to detect COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: A total of 251 patients (mean age 64.8  16.7 years) were included in the analysis. Fifty-one patients (20.3%) died within 6 months. The mortality rate increased with the magnitude of calcifications, and was 10/101 (9.9%), 15/66 (22.7%), 10/34 (29.4%) and 16/50 (32.0%) for the no CAC, mild CAC, moderate CAC and heavy CAC groups, respectively (P = 0.004). Compared with the no calcification group, adjusted risk of death increased progressively with CAC: hazard ratio (HR) 2.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06C5.27), HR 3.1 (95% CI 1.29C7.45) and HR 4.02 (95% CI 1.82C8.88) in the mild, moderate and heavy CAC groups, respectively. Conclusions: Non-electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography during the initial pulmonary assessment of patients with COVID-19 without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease showed a high prevalence of mild, moderate and heavy CAC. CAC score was related to 6-month mortality, independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors. These results highlight the importance of CAC scoring for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and calls for attention to patients with high CAC.","output":"Coronary artery calcifications and 6-month mortality in patients with COVID-19 without known atheromatous disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation, whether secondary to drugs, genetics including congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), and/or systemic diseases including SARS-CoV-2-mediated COVID19, can predispose to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Currently, QTc assessment and monitoring relies largely on 12-lead electrocardiography. As such, we sought to train and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm to determine the QTc, and then prospectively test this algorithm on tracings acquired from a mobile ECG (mECG) device in a population enriched for repolarization abnormalities. Methods: Using over 1.6 million 12-lead ECGs from 538,200 patients, a deep neural network (DNN) was derived (n = 250,767 patients for training and n = 107,920 patients for testing) and validated (n = 179,513 patients) to predict the QTc using cardiologist over-read QTc values as the gold standard. The ability of this DNN to detect clinically-relevant QTc prolongation (e.g. QTc  500 ms) was then tested prospectively on 686 genetic heart disease (GHD) patients (50% with LQTS) with QTc values obtained from both a 12-lead ECG and a prototype mECG device equivalent to the commercially-available AliveCor KardiaMobile 6L. Results: In the validation sample, strong agreement was observed between human over-read and DNN-predicted QTc values (-1.76  23.14 ms). Similarly, within the prospective, GHD-enriched dataset, the difference between DNN-predicted QTc values derived from mECG tracings and those annotated from 12-lead ECGs by a QT expert (-0.45  24.73 ms) and a commercial core ECG laboratory [+10.52 ms  25.64 ms] was nominal. When applied to mECG tracings, the DNN's ability to detect a QTc value  500 ms yielded an area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.97, 80.0%, and 94.4%, respectively. Conclusions: Using smartphone-enabled electrodes, an AI-DNN can predict accurately the QTc of a standard 12-lead ECG. QTc estimation from an AI-enabled mECG device may provide a cost-effective means of screening for both acquired and congenital LQTS in a variety of clinical settings where standard 12-lead electrocardiography is not accessible or cost-effective.","output":"Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Assessment of the Heart Rate Corrected QT Interval Using a Mobile Electrocardiogram Device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The combinatorial study of phylogenetic networks has attracted much attention in recent times.

By solving the counting problem for the words, and on the basis of the conjecture, several simple recurrence formulas for general cases arise. Moreover, a precise asymptotic analysis is provided. Our results coincide with all current formulas in the literature for particular subclasses of tree-child networks, as well as with numerical results obtained for small networks.

Reducing childrens vulnerability and exposure to climate-related disasters is crucial to protect them against risks. Children as climate-change agents and future leaders at local, national and international level can obviously contribute to reduce vulnerabilities in families and communities and transfer knowledge to them. Moreover, children can advocate for climate change mitigation. In the long term, participation of children in the climate change mitigation programmes may lead to fewer disasters and, consequently, less risk to their health. As government policies have failed to fully address and respond to the drivers of climate-related disasters, disasters preparedness and education for children should be considered an essential activity to protect children from disasters risks. Main factors in shaping childrens behaviour and response to disaster are increasing the risk perception and knowledge of the children. When a child perceived likelihood, susceptibility and severity of a disaster (such as earthquake), then they would be able and willing to learn how to prepare for that. So far, disaster education programmes for children have mostly relied on offline school-based training. Different innovative approaches can be applied to continue education within online and digital formats including virtual reality, digital games and online platforms.

Both in the general population and in specific subgroups such as infected people or health care workers, studies have reported increased symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress. However, the reactions of individuals with mental disorders to Covid-19 have largely been neglected. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the perceived impact of Covid-19 and its psychological consequences on people with mental disorders. In this online survey, participants were asked to evaluate their disorder-specific symptoms, perceived psychosocial stress and behaviors related to Covid-19 in the current situation and retrospectively before the spread of Covid-19. The study included participants with self-identified generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder and agoraphobia (PA), illness anxiety disorder (IA), social anxiety disorder (SAD), depression (DP), obsessiveCcompulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders (ED), schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (SP), other non-specified mental disorder (other) as well as mentally healthy controls (HC). The results of bayesian parameter estimation suggest that the symptom severity of DP, GAD, IA and BDD has deteriorated as a reaction to Covid-19. Across all mental disorders and HC, self-reported psychosocial stress levels were higher during the outbreak of Covid-19 compared to before. A reduced frequency of social contacts and grocery shopping was found for all participants. People with self-identified mental disorders showed higher personal worries about Covid-19 and a higher fear of contagion with Covid-19 than did HC. According to our findings, Covid-19 may reinforce symptom severity and psychosocial stress in individuals with mental disorders.

Additional nucleolar functions, not related to ribosome biogenesis, have been discovered within the last decade. Built around multiple copies of the genes for preribosomal RNA (rDNA), nucleolar structure is largely dependent on the process of ribosome assembly. The nucleolus is disassembled during mitosis at which time preribosomal RNA transcription and processing are suppressed; it is reassembled at the end of mitosis in part from components preserved from the previous cell cycle. Expression of preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) is regulated by the silencing of individual rDNA genes via alterations in chromatin structure or by controlling RNA polymerase I initiation complex formation. Preribosomal RNA processing and posttranscriptional modifications are guided by a multitude of small nucleolar RNAs. Nearly completed ribosomal subunits are exported to the cytoplasm by an established nuclear export system with the aid of specialized adapter molecules. Some preribosomal and nucleolar components are transiently localized in Cajal bodies, presumably for modification or assembly. The nonconventional functions of nucleolus include roles in viral infections, nuclear export, sequestration of regulatory molecules, modification of small RNAs, RNP assembly, and control of aging, although some of these functions are not well established. Additional progress in defining the mechanisms of each step in ribosome biogenesis as well as clarification of the precise role of the nucleolus in nonconventional activities is expected in the next decade.","output":"Conventional and nonconventional roles of the nucleolus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great threat to public health and economy worldwide.

As patients with ILD often have severe underlying lung parenchymal involvement, and immunosuppressive therapy is common in this population, they are presumed to be at high risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonitis. Our aim was to explore demographic and clinical differences between those with ILD who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus compared to those with ILD who did not. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we identified adult, unvaccinated patients evaluated at the University of Chicago in 2020 who were enrolled in the ILD registry, and stratified by SARS-CoV-2 seropositive status. We then compared baseline clinical characteristics between SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients and assessed immunosuppressive therapy that the patient may have been on since ILD diagnosis. C-reactive protein and leukocyte subsets were evaluated at COVID diagnosis compared to the time of baseline ILD evaluation as were pulmonary function testing. Variable comparisons were determined by two-sided t-tests or chi-square tests as appropriate, and logistic regression models were fitted to assess the odds of death from COVID-19 using generalized linear models with maximum-likelihood estimation. Results: Of the 309 individuals with ILD in our cohort, 6.8% (n=21) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Those who were SARS-CoV-2 positive were younger (57 years vs 66 years; P=0.002), had baseline higher total lung capacity (81% vs 73%, P=0.045), similar forced vital capacity (71% vs. 67%, P=0.37), and similar diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (71% vs. 62%, P=0.10) at baseline. Among patients with ILD and COVID-19, 67% had received immunosuppressive therapies compared to 74% of those with ILD without COVID-19. Those with ILD and COVID-19 were also more likely to have had a diagnosis of autoimmune-related ILD (connective tissue disease-ILD or interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features) (62% vs 38%, P=0.029). Overall, the mortality hazard was highest among unvaccinated subjects with autoimmune-related ILD who had COVID-19 (OR=9.6, 95% CI=1.7-54.0; P=0.01). Discussion: SARS-CoV-2 is prevalent in ILD, and may put unvaccinated adults who are younger, with autoimmune ILD, and on immunosuppressive therapy at higher risk. This suggests a need for COVID-19 vaccinations and therapy (inpatient and outpatient) for this group of patients at high risk for COVID-19.

Accelerated plasminogen activator-induced lysis and decreased stiffness (G) of thrombin-induced FR fg clots were revealed by thomboelastography. Erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR) in afibrinogenemic plasma (Hematocrit 25C33%) was accelerated by FR fg nearly threefold that of FD fg. Stained smears disclosed frequent rouleaux formations and fibers linking stacked erythrocytes in contrast to no rouleaux by FD fg. Rouleaux formations were more pronounced at 4 C than at ambient temperatures and at fiber-membrane contacts displayed irregular, knobby membrane contours. One of several FR fg isolates also displayed incomplete fiber networks in cell-free areas. What is more, pre-mixing FR fg with each of three monoclonal IgG anti-fg antibodies at 1.5 mol/mol fg, that inhibited fibrin polymerization, prevented rouleaux formation save occasional 2C4 erythrocyte aggregates. We conclude that spontaneously generated SF fibers bound to erythrocytes forming intercellular links culminating in rouleaux formation and ensuing ESR acceleration which in clinical settings reflects hypercoagulability. Also, the results can explain the reported fg binding to erythrocytes via ligands such as CD47, stable in vivo RBC aggregates in capillaries, and red areas of pathologic thrombi.","output":"Novel characteristics of soluble fibrin: hypercoagulability and acceleration of blood sedimentation rate mediated by its generation of erythrocyte-linked fibers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common cancer internationally.

We aimed to describe maternal and neonatal safety outcomes associated with tocilizumab treatment in pregnant women with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of severe COVID-19 pregnant women, treated with tocilizumab in two Spanish hospitals between 1 March and 31 April 2020. Demographics, medical history, clinical and radiologic findings, treatment information and laboratory data of mothers and their newborns were collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 12 pregnant women were identified to have received tocilizumab during pregnancy in the two hospitals. Median gestational age at admission was 27.7 weeks (interquartile range, 18.0-36.4). Most of them received lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, two patients received corticosteroids and one received interferon beta 1B. All 12 pregnancies resulted in live births. Somatometric values were normal for all newborns, and evolution at 14 and 28 days was favourable for all of them. Hepatotoxicity was observed in 2 patients, which improved or resolved at discharge. Cytomegalovirus reactivation was detected in another patient who had also received corticosteroids for 15 days, causing a congenital infection in her newborn. Both hepatotoxicity and viral reactivation adverse events were classified as possibly related to tocilizumab administration according to Naranjo's causality algorithm.

To provide passive immunity, 18 lines of transgenic mice secreting a recombinant monoclonal antibody (Mab) neutralizing transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) into the milk were generated. The genes encoding a chimeric Mab with the variable modules of the murine TGEV-specific Mab 6A.C3 and the constant modules of a human IgG(1), isotype Mab were expressed under the control of regulatory sequences derived from the whey acidic protein, which is an abundant milk protein. The Mab 6A.C3 binds to a highly conserved epitope present in coronaviruses of several species, which does not allow the selection of neutralization escape mutants.

In this paper we exploit a natural experiment in soccer to provide clear evidence of its effects. We aim to study how social pressure from the crowd in a stadium affects both players and referees. While in normal matches crowd support may be correlated to a host of variables affecting the outcome of interest, we exploit the fact that after the health emergency for the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, soccer matches in top European Leagues have been allowed only behind closed doors, that is, without spectators in the stadiums.We use data of first and second division of 5 major European Leagues (Germany, Spain, England, Italy and Portugal) for the last 10 championships and compare several outcomes (determined by players' performance and referees' decisions) of matches played with crowd support to the same outcomes when matches were played without crowd. We find considerable effects of the pressure from the crowd: while with the support of the crowd a considerable home advantage emerges in various measures of performance (points, goals, shots, etc.), this advantage is almost halved when matches are behind closed doors.Similar effects are found for the behavior of referees: decisions of fouls, yellow cards, red cards and penalties that tend to favor home teams in normal matches, are much more balanced without crowd pressing on referees.

The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role that offers significant stimuli (i.e., gut-brain, gut-lung, and gut-liver axis) for both innate and adaptive immunity, mediating immune and metabolic homeostasis. An intricate correlation between changes in the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) and common diseases/disorders have been attributed to the invasion of pathogens, constant use of antibiotics, and hypercytokinemiaa hallmark of immune homeostasis imbalance. These factors contribute to the severity of inflammatory diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and of late the coronavirus disease, Covid-19. Probiotics (Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.) have been considered as alternative and/or adjuvant therapeutic in restoring the balance of gut microbiota for maintaining immune homeostasis and integrity. The probiotics catalyze dietary fibers and proteins to generate short-chain fatty acids and tryptophan to promote antiinflammatory cytokines, reduce epithelium permeability, reinforcing immunity in the gut mucosa, and regulating the systemic immune response. Herein, we review our overarching understanding of current applications of probiotics in amelioration of gut microbiome, and the improvement of gut barrier function and maintaining immune homeostasis. We also highlight clinical trials on probiotics with reported results for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Additionally, the looming global Covid-19 pandemic makes it prudent to highlight the role of probiotics in both the innate and adaptive human immune responses, especially amid the Covid-19 vaccination paradigm.","output":"Chapter 3 - The role of probiotics in maintaining immune homeostasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Our study aimed to evaluate the extent of family physicians' anxiety about the viral epidemic and work-related stress associated with the viral epidemic as well as examining the effects of COVID-19 vaccination period on such situations.

The responses of 500 family physicians who were accessible in this way and volunteered to participate in the study were recorded to be analysed. Of all the 500 physicians, the SAVE-9 scale was re-administered to the subgroup of 50 family physicians in the post-vaccination period. The responses were compared with those received in the pre-vaccination period. RESULTS: Of all the 500 family physicians in this study, 40.6% of them were found to be in a state of anxiety about the viral epidemic. In particular, the scores of anxiety about the viral epidemic and of work-related stress were found much higher in female physicians and in those reporting that they had inadequate income. While there was a significant decline in the scores of anxiety about the viral epidemic in the subgroup in the post-vaccination period of health care workers, no statistically significant change was found in work-related stress scores.

However, up to 35% of the population are hesitant or refuse to get vaccinated. As reproductive toxicity studies were not conducted prior to EUA, adults have expressed concern about potential adverse effects of the vaccines on fertility and reproductive health. Objective We evaluated the current reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the unvaccinated U.S. population and identified their demographic characteristics. Methods Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) was used to survey the vaccine hesitancy reasons amongst unvaccinated U.S. adult population between June 30, 2021-July 1, 2021. The project title listed for survey participants during distribution was Covid-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Survey. The study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board, and it was deemed an exemption. Users with addresses in the U.S., over the age of 18, and received no doses of any coronavirus vaccine at any time were invited to complete an anonymous 32-question survey with an estimated completion time of less than 10 minutes. The first part of the survey focused on identifying attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccines while the latter queried demographic information such as age, race/ethnicity, and relationship status. Quantitative data was analyzed using by two-sample Z-test on Microsoft Excel (version 16.44) and MATLAB (version R2021a). Results A total of 914 unvaccinated adults completed our survey (response rate 91.4%) with 53% of respondents identifying as cis-male and 42% as cis-female. Of the participants, 58% indicated COVID-19 vaccine side effects or other potential unknown long-term effects as their reason for remaining unvaccinated and 39% of them believed that COVID-19 vaccines can negatively impact reproductive health and/or fertility. Among those participants that were concerned that COVID-19 vaccines could impact fertility, 42% (p = 0.010) lived in urban settings, 46% (p > 0.001) were married, and 38% (p = 0.020) of individuals were born outside of the U.S. About 1/2 of the participants stated that more information and research conducted on the COVID-19 vaccines would encourage them to get vaccinated. Conclusions A large portion of the U.S. population remain fearful of the potential side effects associated with the coronavirus vaccines and more specifically negative impacts to their future reproductive health. These results objectively evidence that fertility concerns are significantly contributing to vaccine hesitancy and may continue to be a barrier for years to come if no interventions are made.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are known for their ability to produce credible causal impact estimates, which is why they are used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of drugs and, increasingly, to evaluate health care delivery and policy. But RCTs provide other benefits, allowing policymakers and researchers to: 1) design studies to answer the question they want to answer, 2) test theory and mechanisms to help enrich understanding beyond the results of a single study, 3) examine potentially subtle, indirect effects of a program or policy, and 4) collaborate closely to generate policy-relevant findings.

Rotavirus-induced immune responses, especially the T and B cell responses, have been extensively characterized; however, little is known about innate immune mechanisms involved in the control of rotavirus infection. Although increased levels of systemic type I interferon (IFN and ) correlate with accelerated resolution of rotavirus disease, multiple rotavirus strains, including rhesus rotavirus (RRV), have been demonstrated to antagonize type I IFN production in a variety of epithelial and fibroblast cell types through several mechanisms, including degradation of multiple interferon regulatory factors by a viral nonstructural protein. This report demonstrates that stimulation of highly purified primary human peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with either live or inactivated RRV induces substantial IFN production by a subset of pDCs in which RRV does not replicate. Characterization of pDC responses to viral stimulus by flow cytometry and Luminex revealed that RRV replicates in a small subset of human primary pDCs and, in this RRV-permissive small subset, IFN production is diminished. pDC activation and maturation were observed independently of viral replication and were enhanced in cells in which virus replicates. Production of IFN by pDCs following RRV exposure required viral dsRNA and surface proteins, but neither viral replication nor activation by trypsin cleavage of VP4. These results demonstrate that a minor subset of purified primary human peripheral pDCs are permissive to RRV infection, and that pDCs retain functionality following RRV stimulus. Additionally, this study demonstrates trypsin-independent infection of primary peripheral cells by rotavirus, which may allow for the establishment of extraintestinal viremia and antigenemia. Importantly, these data provide the first evidence of IFN induction in primary human pDCs by a dsRNA virus, while simultaneously demonstrating impaired IFN production in primary human cells in which RRV replicates. Rotavirus infection of primary human pDCs provides a powerful experimental system for the study of mechanisms underlying pDC-mediated innate immunity to viral infection and reveals a potentially novel dsRNA-dependent pathway of IFN induction.","output":"Rotavirus Structural Proteins and dsRNA Are Required for the Human Primary Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell IFN Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study is a brief review of the existing knowledge on the ENT surgeon's approach towards management of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: The ENT Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using the terms 'COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with ENT surgery. RESULTS: Elective and non urgent cases are best avoided during this time. Only absolutely essential and emergent procedures need to be carried out with the use of Personal protective equipment comprising of safety gown, N95 mask, safety goggles, disposable gloves and caps. There is a possibility of transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 through asymptomatic patients and hence all patients, even with an unknown COVID-19 status, need to undergo a preoperative screening. As all procedures under general anesthesia are aerosol generating, the use of Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for all the health care workers present in the operation theater.

The interpretation mechanism traces tokens' attentions back to words, assigning a newly proposed metric referred to as absolute word attention. Through this metric, we assess several aspects to determine if we can find important words for the classification and with meaning for the domain. We developed a broad experimental setting that involved three datasets with tweets in Brazilian Portuguese and three BERT models with support for this language. Our results are encouraging, as we were able to identify 52-82% of words with high absolute attention contributing positively to stance classification.

The sequalae of COVID-19 remains unclear, especially whether it may be associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from other diseases. MethodsWe leveraged a large prospective cohort of the UK biobank (UKBB) (N=412,096; current age 50-87) to identify associations of COVID-19 with hospitalization and mortality due to different diseases post-infection. We conducted a comprehensive survey on disorders from all systems (up to 135 disease categories). Multivariable Cox and Poisson regression was conducted controlling for main confounders. For sensitivity analysis, we also conducted separate analysis for new-onset and recurrent cases, and other sensitivity analysis such as the prior event rate adjustment (PERR) approach to minimize effects of unmeasured confounders. ResultsCompared to individuals with no known history of COVID-19, those with severe COVID-19 (requiring hospitalization) exhibited higher hazards of hospitalization and/or mortality due to multiple disorders (median follow-up=608 days), including disorders of respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and musculoskeletal systems. Increased hazards of hospitalizations and/or mortality were also observed for injuries due to fractures, various infections and other non-specific symptoms. These results remained largely consistent after sensitivity analyses. Severe COVID-19 was also associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR=14.700, 95% CI: 13.835-15.619). Mild (non-hospitalized) COVID-19 was associated with modestly increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR=1.237, 95% CI 1.037-1.476) and mortality from neurocognitive disorders (HR=9.100, 95% CI: 5.590-14.816), as well as hospital admission from a few disorders such as aspiration pneumonitis, musculoskeletal pain and other general signs/symptoms. ConclusionsIn conclusion, this study revealed increased risk of hospitalization and mortality from a wide variety of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases after COVID-19, especially for severe infections. Mild disease was also associated with increased all-cause mortality.

Despite significant progress in the prevention of many infectious diseases, a number of organizational issues remain in the area of special attention. One of them is to ensure the timeliness and completeness of vaccination coverage in the decreed age groups, which is possible only with a high level of public commitment to vaccination. During the pandemic of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), achieving a high level of vaccination coverage of the National Calendar of Preventive vaccinations is of particular relevance. Aim. Using state-of-the-art online resources, assess population vaccination adherence to develop effective communication risk management technologies for immunoprophylaxis in the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods. To assess the commitment of various population groups and professional contingents of a large industrial city to vaccine prevention, a survey of 965 parents was conducted at the initial stage, and subsequently a survey of 2,632 employees of medical organizations, including 1,422 people in the period before the COVID-19 pandemic, 572 people in the ?first wave? of the pandemic and 638 people in the ?second wave?. Instagram Facebook, Instagram, and VKontakte social networks were used to quickly obtain the necessary information (Google forms, corporate e-mails, WhatsApp, Telegram messengers, etc.). The work uses epidemiological, sociological and statistical methods of research. Results and discussion. When assessing the attitude of parents to vaccination, it was found that 78.8% of respondents were positive about vaccinations, 14.6% doubted their effectiveness and safety, and 6.6% denied their need. The main source of information that forms the attitude to vaccinations of parents was the opinion of medical professionals. In a survey of 1,422 employees, 190 people (13.3%) were identified, mainly from among the trained specialists, who themselves had a negative attitude to vaccination. When assessing the commitment of employees of medical organizations to the vaccination of a new coronavirus infection, the attitude to vaccination was ambiguous, especially in the group of secondary medical personnel and female employees of non-medical specialties, who are a potential risk group for forming a negative attitude to vaccinations and can act as ?opinion leaders? on this issue for other categories of the population. Insufficient adherence to COVID-19 vaccine prevention has also been observed in other countries among various population groups, which is a serious problem on a global scale, hindering the fight against the pandemic of a new disease, which requires corrective measures. Conclusion. In this study, using modern online resources, a rapid assessment of the vaccination adherence of various population groups (parents and medical professionals) was carried out. It is shown that the use of modern technologies and software tools makes it possible to analyze a large array of data to solve problems of overcoming communication risks. The results obtained point to the need for prompt corrective measures in terms of the introduction of educational programs to increase adherence to vaccination, especially in groups at potential risk of the disease, including medical professionals, which is a priority for health care in all countries. ? 2021, Numikom.

METHOD: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) through the MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase and SCOPUS databases. Synthesis of evidence, statements and recommendations were developed in accordance with the GRADE methodology. RESULTS: Given the limitation of the evidence, the current document represents an effort to join selected high-quality articles and experts' opinion.

Given the important role models play in both contexts, their structure and implementation be rigorously scrutinized. The ability to interrogate input/output associations without facing barriers can improve quality assurance mechanisms while satisfying privacy/confidentiality concerns and facilitating the integration of models into decision-making. This paper reports on the development of Programmable Interface for Statistical&Simulation Models (PRISM), a cloud-based platform for model accessibility. Methods: PRISM emphasizes two main principles: 1) minimal specifications on the side of model developer to make the model fit for cloud hosting, and 2) making client access completely independent of the resource requirement and software dependencies of the model. The server architecture integrates a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) infrastructure, JSON for data transfer, a routing layer for access management, container technology for management of computer resources and package dependencies, and the capacity for synchronous or asynchronous model calls. Results: We discuss the architecture, the minimal API standards that enable a universal language for access to such models, the underlying server infrastructure, and the standards used for data transfer. An instance of PRISM is available as a service via the Peer Models Network http://peermodelsnetwork.com. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate how interrogating models becomes possible in standardized fashion, in a way that is irrespective of the specifics of any model.

Some studies have suggested that diabetes is associated with a greater risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19. The primary objective of the present study was to compare the clinical features and outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with vs without diabetes. METHODS: All consecutive adult patients admitted to Amiens University Hospital (Amiens, France) with confirmed COVID-19 up until April 21st, 2020, were included. The composite primary endpoint comprised admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death. Both components were also analysed separately in a logistic regression analysis and a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 433 patients (median age: 72; 238 (55%) men; diabetes: 115 (26.6%)) were included. Most of the deaths occurred in non-ICU units and among older adults. Multivariate analyses showed that diabetes was associated neither with the primary endpoint (odds ratio (OR): 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-1.90) nor with mortality (hazard ratio: 0.73; 95%CI: 0.40-1.34) but was associated with ICU admission (OR: 2.06; 95%CI 1.09-3.92, P = .027) and a longer length of hospital stay. Age was negatively associated with ICU admission and positively associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was prevalent in a quarter of the patients hospitalized with COVID-19; it was associated with a greater risk of ICU admission but not with a significant elevation in mortality.

Although the mechanisms underlying this link are not well established, a number of potential factors may be involved. Indeed, the obesity-related vulnerability to infectious diseases could be due to chronic low-grade inflammation, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia, which lead to a weakening of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, obesity results in anatomical-functional changes by the mechanical obstacle of excessive adipose tissue that blunt the respiratory mechanisms and predisposing to respiratory infections. Subjects with obesity are also at risk of skin folds and sweat more profusely due to the thick layers of subcutaneous fat, favoring the proliferation of microorganisms and slowing the repair of wounds down. All these factors make subjects with obesity more prone to develop nosocomial infections, surgical site, skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and mycosis. Furthermore, infections in subjects with obesity have a worse prognosis, frequently prolonging hospitalization time as demonstrated for several flu viruses and recently for COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the current clinical evidence on the associations between obesity and infectious diseases highlighting physio pathological insights involved in this link.","output":"The impact of obesity on immune response to infection: Plausible mechanisms and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To study the possibility of improving the efficacy of treatment with mexidol in COVID-19 patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI).

OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study was to determine BV of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in healthy dogs and dogs with 3 stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). METHODS Healthy dogs and dogs with 3 stages of MMVD were prospectively assigned to groups based on comprehensive clinical evaluation using current guidelines. Concentrations of cTnI were measured hourly, daily, and weekly using standard and high-sensitivity immunoassays. Within- (CVI ) and between-subject (CVG ) coefficients of variability, percent reference change value (RCV), and index of individuality (IoI) were calculated. RESULTS All 10 healthy dogs and 76/112 (68%) of samples from 28 MMVD dogs had cTnI concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD) using a standard sensitivity immunoassay. Only 49/160 (31%) of healthy dog samples and no MMVD samples had cTnI below the high-sensitivity immunoassay LOD. Data analysis for the high-sensitivity immunoassay revealed CVI of 48.1%, CVG of 60.1%, RCV of 134.0%, and IoI of 0.804 in healthy dogs. In MMVD dogs, CVI was 39.6%, CVG was 80.7%, RCV was 110%, and IoI was 0.494. Of all MMVD dogs, those with Stage B2 had the lowest RCV of 91%.

Psychological resilience is essential to providing quality care through the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted narrative interviews with 14 out of 21 medical directors of COVID-19 divisions in Israeli public hospitals upon the outbreak of the pandemic and through its first wave. We adopted the Salutogenic paradigm to identify personal and organizational resources that both deterred and promoted resilience of front-line medical directors. Thematic analysis was performed based on the Sense of coherence construct, an anchor of Salutogenics. RESULTS: Low comprehensibility was compensated by ethical boundaries and managerial experience. A few organizational and personal resources promoted manageability. The hospital management both deterred and promoted resilience. In contrast to Salutogenics theory, meaningfulness was driven by the occupational calling rather than by comprehensibility and manageability. Gaps in personal resources inhibited resilience.

Regional cerebral oximetry (rSO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on the patient's forehead monitors cerebral oxygenation during surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Its purpose is to detect and manage periods of cerebral hypoxia which may otherwise go undetected, thereby reducing morbidity. But outcomes have been inconsistent, and not all cardiac departments have adopted this non-invasive, simple-to-use technology. We aimed to study the efficacy of our use of rSO2 by recording seven outcomes for each patient according to their preoperative rSO2, the mean intraoperative rSO2, and four ischemic thresholds during surgery. METHOD This is a retrospective audit of cardiac surgical patients in whom a protocol was used to maintain rSO2 above the preoperative value and studied seven major morbidity outcomes. Cerebral oximetry data were recorded for each patient and analyzed for six variables: preoperative baseline rSO2, mean intraoperative rSO2, and four ischemic thresholds defined as an area under the curve (AUC) in minutes% below the baseline rSO2,minus 10% below the baseline, minus 20% the below baselineand minus 50% below baseline. Outcomes examined were: delirium, stroke, postoperative rise in creatinine of 50 mmol, absolute creatinine of 200 mmol, need for new renal replacement therapy (RRT), hospital LOS and inpatient mortality. RESULTS Complete data were available for 166 patients. Lower mean preoperative rSO2 was associated with stroke (p=0.031), mild and severe renal dysfunction (p=0.045 and p=0.036), death-in-hospital (p=0.027) and prolonged hospital LOS (p=0.005). Lower mean intraoperative rSO2 during surgery was associated with the outcomes of renal dysfunction, mild (p=0.027), moderate (p=0.003) or severe (p=0.002), death-in-hospital (p=0.003) and prolonged hospital LOS (p=0.015).

CONCLUSION Lower preoperative rSO2 and mean intraoperative rSO2 were associated with poor outcomes, notably leading to a significant increase in hospital LOS.

Diabetes and obesity are associated with a worse prognosis in these patients. Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy (CGL) patients generally have poorly controlled diabetes and require extremely high doses of insulin. There is no documentation in the literature of cases of COVID in CGL patients. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CGL patients, and the association of their clinical and metabolic characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study carried out between July and October 2020. Clinical data collected were respiratory or other flu-like symptoms, need of hospitalization in the last three months, CGL comorbidities, and medications in use. Cholesterol, triglycerides, glycohemoglobin A1c levels, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and nasopharyngeal swab for RT-qPCR were also obtained in all CGL patients. Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the characteristics of the participants, verifying the non-adherence of the data to the Gaussian distribution. In investigating the association between categorical variables, we used Pearson's chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. A significance level of 5% was adopted. RESULTS: Twenty-two CGL patients were assessed. Eight subjects (36.4%) had reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Only one of these, also presented detectable RT-qPCR. Five individuals (62.5%) were women, median age of 13.5 years (1 to 37). Symptoms like fever, malaise, nausea, diarrhea and chest pain were present, and all asymptomatic patients were children. All subjects had inadequate metabolic control, with no difference between groups. Among positive individuals there was no difference between those with AGPAT2 (75%) and BSCL2 gene mutations (25%) (p > 0.05). No patient needed hospitalization or died. CONCLUSIONS: We described a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CGL patients with a good outcome in all of them. These findings suggest that at least young CGL patients infected by SARS-COV-2 are not at higher risk of poor outcome, despite known severe metabolic comorbidities.","output":"SARS-COV-2 infection outcomes in patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human rhinovirus (HRV) is known as one of the most important respiratory pathogens, and the clinical characteristics of HRV infection might be similar to those of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Previous studies revealed a prevalence of 7%-56% of hypokalaemia in patients taking thiazide diuretics. The clinical manifestations of hypokalaemia due to diuretics are non-specific, varying from asymptomatic to fatal arrhythmia. Diagnosis of hypokalaemia is based on the level of serum potassium. ECG is useful in identifying the more severe consequences. A high dosage of diuretics and concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of potassium depletion or cardiac arrhythmias can increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Thiazide-induced potassium depletion may cause dysglycaemia. The risk of thiazide-induced hypokalaemia is higher in women and in black people. Reducing diuretic dose and potassium supplementation are the most direct and effective therapies for hypokalaemia. Combining with a potassium-sparing diuretic or blocker of the renin-angiotensin system also reduces the risk of hypokalaemia.

The goal of this consensus statement is to examine the current evidence for performing tracheostomy in patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 and offer guidance to physicians on the preparation, timing and technique while minimizing the risk of infection to health care workers (HCW). Methods A panel comprised of intensivists and interventional pulmonologists from three professional societies representing 13 institutions with experience in managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments developed key clinical questions addressing specific topics on tracheostomy in COVID-19. A systematic review of the literature and an established modified Delphi consensus methodology were applied to provide a reliable evidenced based consensus statement and expert panel report. Results Eight key questions, corresponding to 14 decision points, were rated by the panel. The results were aggregated, resulting in eight main recommendations and five additional remarks intended to guide health care providers in the decision-making process pertinent to tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 related respiratory failure. Conclusion This panel suggests performing tracheostomy in patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation. A specific timing of tracheostomy cannot be recommended. There is no evidence for routine repeat RT- PCR testing in patients with confirmed Covid-19 evaluated for tracheostomy. To reduce the risk of infection in HCW, we recommend performing the procedure using techniques that minimize aerosolization while wearing enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE).

The current scoping review aimed to assess the significance of circulating neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and their ratio (NLR) in AIS and explore their association with post-stroke recovery trajectory. The Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework was employed to review the published papers on the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and AIS in late November 2020. Only studies published in English from 2000-2020 were included in this scoping review. Fifty-three published papers were reviewed. This review's key finding is that a canonical inflammatory response occurs in AIS just as in the case of COVID-19 and neurological involvements well described in the recent literature. An excessive circulating innate immune cells (neutrophils) and reduced circulating adaptive immune cells (lymphocytes ) are associated with poorer outcomes during the acute interventions ( reperfusion therapies) as well as the recovery trajectory. Main representatives of innate and adaptive immunity follow a canonical course in AIS and COVID-19. Exaggerated circulating innate ( elevated neutrophils and elevated NLR) and reduced adaptive immune response (lymphopenia) correlate with the worse outcome in AIS and COVID-19.

Whilst picornaviruses are known to infect various animals, their existence in dromedaries was unknown. We describe the discovery of a novel picornavirus, dromedary camel enterovirus (DcEV), from dromedaries in Dubai. Among 215 dromedaries, DcEV was detected in faecal samples of four (1.9 %) dromedaries [one (0.5 %) adult dromedary and three (25 %) dromedary calves] by reverse transcription PCR. Analysis of two DcEV genomes showed that DcEV was clustered with other species of the genus Enterovirus and was most closely related to and possessed highest amino acid identities to the species Enterovirus E and Enterovirus F found in cattle. The G+C content of DcEV was 45 mol%, which differed from that of Enterovirus E and Enterovirus F (49-50 mol%) by 4-5 %. Similar to other members of the genus Enterovirus, the 5' UTR of DcEV possessed a putative type I internal ribosome entry site. The low ratios of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ka/Ks) of various coding regions suggested that dromedaries are the natural reservoir in which DcEV has been stably evolving. These results suggest that DcEV is a novel species of the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. Western blot analysis using recombinant DcEV VP1 polypeptide showed a high seroprevalence of 52 % among serum samples from 172 dromedaries for IgG, concurring with its much higher infection rates in dromedary calves than in adults.

The African COVID-19 Critical Care Outcomes Study (ACCCOS) aimed to determine which resources, comorbidities, and critical care interventions are associated with mortality in this patient population. METHODS: The ACCCOS study was a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study in adults (aged 18 years or older) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection who were referred to intensive care or high-care units in 64 hospitals in ten African countries (ie, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Libya, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, and South Africa). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality censored at 30 days. We studied the factors (ie, human and facility resources, patient comorbidities, and critical care interventions) that were associated with mortality in these adult patients. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04367207. FINDINGS: From May to December, 2020, 6779 patients were referred to critical care. Of these, 3752 (553%) patients were admitted and 3140 (837%) patients from 64 hospitals in ten countries participated (mean age 556 years; 1890 [606%] of 3118 participants were male). The hospitals had a median of two intensivists (IQR 1C4) and pulse oximetry was available to all patients in 49 (86%) of 57 sites. In-hospital mortality within 30 days of admission was 482% (95% CI 464C500; 1483 of 3077 patients). Factors that were independently associated with mortality were increasing age per year (odds ratio 103; 102C104); HIV/AIDS (191; 131C279); diabetes (125; 101C156); chronic liver disease (348; 148C818); chronic kidney disease (189; 128C278); delay in admission due to a shortage of resources (214; 142C322); quick sequential organ failure assessment score at admission (for one factor [144; 101C204], for two factors [20; 133C299], and for three factors [366, 212C633]); respiratory support (high flow oxygenation [272; 146C508]; continuous positive airway pressure [393; 213C726]; invasive mechanical ventilation [1527; 851C2737]); cardiorespiratory arrest within 24 h of admission (443; 225C873); and vasopressor requirements (367; 277C486). Steroid therapy was associated with survival (055; 037C081). There was no difference in outcome associated with female sex (086; 069C106). INTERPRETATION: Mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is higher in African countries than reported from studies done in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Increased mortality was associated with insufficient critical care resources, as well as the comorbidities of HIV/AIDS, diabetes, chronic liver disease, and kidney disease, and severity of organ dysfunction at admission.

The inflammatory response induced by a synthetic non-nucleotide-based diABZI STING agonist, in comparison to the natural cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, is unknown.

Typically, detection of S. japonicum has occurred using the Kato-Katz technique, but this methodology, which requires skilled microscopists, has been shown to radically underestimate levels of infection. With the ever-improving capabilities of next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analysis tools, identification of satellite sequences and other highly repetitive genomic elements for use as real-time PCR diagnostic targets is becoming increasingly common. Assays developed using these targets have the ability to improve the sensitivity and specificity of results for epidemiological studies that can in turn be used to inform mass drug administration and programmatic decision making. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Utilizing Tandem Repeat Analyzer (TAREAN) and RepeatExplorer2, a cluster-based analysis of the S. japonicum genome was performed and a tandemly arranged genomic repeat, which we named SjTR1 (Schistosoma japonicum Tandem Repeat 1), was selected as the target for a real-time PCR diagnostic assay. Based on these analyses, a primer/probe set was designed and the assay was optimized. The resulting real-time PCR test was shown to reliably detect as little as 200 ag of S. japonicum genomic DNA and as little as 1 egg per gram of human stool. Based on these results, the index assay reported in this manuscript is more sensitive than previously published real-time PCR assays for the detection of S. japonicum. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The extremely sensitive and specific diagnostic assay described in this manuscript will facilitate the accurate detection of S. japonicum, particularly in regions with low levels of endemicity. This assay will be useful in providing data to inform programmatic decision makers, aiding disease control and elimination efforts.","output":"Development of a novel real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the sensitive detection of Schistosoma japonicum in human stool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the height of the COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands a shortness of intensive care beds was looming.

This article describes the Dutch context, the process of drafting the advice and reflects on the role of ethicists and lessons learned. We argue that timely interaction between clinical and ethical expertise is necessary since the distinction between medical and non-medical considerations is not as clearcut as sometimes assumed. Furthermore, pragmatic considerations related to the specifics of an epidemic are of importance, for example, in relation to prioritizing health care workers. As a consequence, any protocol already present before the pandemic would need alterations to fit the current situation. The fair innings criterion we proposed, rephrased as an argument of intergenerational solidarity, was considered reasonable by professionals as well as patient organizations. While it is desirable to draft ethical guidelines in peacetime as a matter of pandemic preparedness, the pressure of an actual crisis facilitates decision-making, although it will also complicate a more democratic approach.","output":"Ethical Advice for an Intensive Care Triage Protocol in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned from The Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indigenous and other marginalized racial/ethnic minorities have poorer health status than majority populations, including higher rates of type 2 diabetes.

This suggested that monitoring of these searches with tools including Google Trends may help monitor the pandemic itself. In Europe and North America, dermatologists reported an unexpected outbreak of cutaneous acral lesions (eg, chilblain-like lesions) in April 2020. However, external factors such as public communications may also hinder the use of Google Trends as an infodemiology tool. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess the impact of media announcements and lockdown enforcement on internet searches related to cutaneous acral lesions during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. METHODS: Two searches on Google Trends, including daily relative search volumes for (1) \\"toe\\" or \\"chilblains\\" and (2) \\"coronavirus,\\" were performed from January 1 to May 16, 2020, with the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany as the countries of choice. The ratio of interest over time in \\"chilblains\\" and \\"coronavirus\\" was plotted. To assess the impact of lockdown enforcement and media coverage on these internet searches, we performed an interrupted time-series analysis for each country. RESULTS: The ratio of interest over time in \\"chilblains\\" to \\"coronavirus\\" showed a constant upward trend. In France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, lockdown enforcement was associated with a significant slope change for \\"chilblain\\" searches with a variation coefficient of 1.06 (SE 0.42) (P=0.01), 1.04 (SE 0.28) (P<.01), and 1.21 (SE 0.44) (P=0.01), respectively. After media announcements, these ratios significantly increased in France, Spain, Italy, and the United States with variation coefficients of 18.95 (SE 5.77) (P=.001), 31.31 (SE 6.31) (P<.001), 14.57 (SE 6.33) (P=.02), and 11.24 (SE 4.93) (P=.02), respectively, followed by a significant downward trend in France (-1.82 [SE 0.45]), Spain (-1.10 [SE 0.38]), and Italy (-0.93 [SE 0.33]) (P<.001, P=0.004, and P<.001, respectively). The adjusted R2 values were 0.311, 0.351, 0.325, and 0.305 for France, Spain, Italy, and the United States, respectively, suggesting an average correlation between time and the search volume; however, this correlation was weak for Germany and the United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONS: To date, the association between chilblain-like lesions and COVID-19 remains controversial; however, our results indicate that Google queries of \\"chilblain\\" were highly influenced by media coverage and government policies, indicating that caution should be exercised when using Google Trends as a monitoring tool for emerging diseases.","output":"The Influence of Media Coverage and Governmental Policies on Google Queries Related to COVID-19 Cutaneous Symptoms: Infodemiology Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although no longer appropriate, the classical model of bureaucratic organisation (Weber) still remains the basis of public administration First major reforms in public administration were introduced by market-oriented New Public Management, but recently, as a reflection of social and political changes, Post-New Public Management approaches have developed The paper puts an emphasis on modern approaches, which do not appear in pure form but in the form of hybrids The decision on the optimal direction of public administration development is left to the states, bearing in mind that each public administration reform and hybridisation of approaches affect the complexity of public administration The paper analyses the Slovenian public administration reform, where we find that the current public administration development strategy is based on modern elements and values of different theoretical doctrines, like Post-New Public Management approaches, but (as shown by the current Covid-19 crisis) that diverse efforts are required in the future to achieve this goal ? 2021 National Academy of Sciences All rights reserved","output":"Modernisation trends in public administration in Slovenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged as a health problem worldwide.

Data from 15,998 patients, 11,914 (74.5%) males and 4,069 (25.5%) females, transplanted between 2000 and 2016 were obtained from the Liver Transplantation Spanish Registry. Survival analysis was applied to explore recipient sex as a risk factor for death. The causes of death at different follow-up duration were disaggregated by recipient sex for analysis. Short-term survival was higher in males, whereas long-term survival was higher in females. Survival at 1, 5 and 10 years post-transplant was 87.43%, 73.83%, and 61.23%, respectively, in males and 86.28%, 74.19%, and 65.10%, respectively, in females (p = 0.05). Post-LT mortality related to previous liver disease also presented sex differences. Males had 37% increased overall mortality from acute liver failure (p = 0.035) and 37% from HCV-negative cirrhosis (p < 0.001). Females had approximately 16% increased mortality when the liver disease was HCV-positive cirrhosis (p = 0.003). Regarding causes of death, non-malignancy HCV+ recurrence (6.3% vs. 3.9% of patients; p < 0.001), was more frequently reported in females. By contrast, death because of malignancy recurrence (3.9% vs. 2.2% of patients; p = 0.003) and de novo malignancy (4.8% vs. 2.5% of patients; p < 0.001) were significantly more frequent in male recipients. Cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and surgical complications were similar in both.

In this investigation, a classic dose-response model is used on the one hand to find out retrospectively the probable viral load of the infectious source patient at the time of transmission in 25 documented outbreaks. We showed that an infection due to airborne transmission at a distance from the infectious person was probably only possible in the 25 outbreaks examined, with attack rates of 4-100%, if the viral load had been higher than 1E+08 viral copies/ml. This demonstrates that the viral load estimated from the swab might overestimate a persons infectivity via aerosol, because a person is generally considered infectious, independent of the transmission way, when the viral load from the swab is 1E+06 viral copies/ml. On the other hand, a possible approach is presented to predict the probable situational Attack Rate (PARs) of a group of persons in a room through aerosol particles emitted by an infectious source patient. Four main categories of influence on the risk of infection are formed: First the emitted viruses, depending on the viral load and the amount of respiratory particles, and necessary number of reproducible viruses for infection, second the room-specific data and duration of stay of the group of people, third the activity of the exposed persons, and fourth the effect of personal protection (e.g. wearing masks from infectious and/or susceptible person). Furthermore, a simplified method is presented to calculate either the maximum possible number of persons in a room, so that probably a maximum of one person becomes infected when an infectious person is in the room, or the PARs,simple for a given number of persons, ventilation rate and time of occupancy. We additionally show, taking into account organizational preventive measures, which person-related virus-free supply air flow rates are necessary to keep the number of newly infected persons to less than 1. The simple approach makes it easy to derive preventive organizational and ventilation measures. Our results show that the volume flow rate or a person-related flow rate is a much more effective parameter to evaluate ventilation for infection prevention than the air change rate. We suggest to monitor the CO2 concentration as an easy to implement and valid measurement system for indoor spaces. Finally, we show that of the three measures, besides of wearing masks and increasing ventilation, testing contributes the most to the joint protective effect. This corresponds to the classic approach to implement protection concepts: preventing the source from entering the room and emitting viruses at all. In summary, a layered approach of different measures is recommended to mutually compensate for possible failures of any one measure (e.g. incorrect execution of tests, incorrect fit of masks or irregular window opening), to increase the degree of protection and thus reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol Transmission Indoors: A Closer Look at Viral Load, Infectivity, the Effectiveness of Preventive Measures and a Simple Approach for Practical Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays an essential role in secondary brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of ACEIs/ARBs on ICH patients with hypertension using a retrospective, single-center data analysis. METHODS: ICH patients diagnosed by computerized tomographic (CT) at Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University were included in the present research from January 2015 to December 2019. According to the medical history for the usage of antihypertensive drugs, patients were assigned into either ACEIs/ARBs group or non-ACEIs/ARBs group.

RESULTS: A total of 635 ICH patients with hypertension were included and allocated into 2 groups according to the usage of antihypertensive drugs: 281 in the ACEIs/ARBs group and 354 in the non-ACEIs/ARBs group. The results presented that the 3-months mortality and prevalence of ICH-associated pneumonia were lower in ACEIs/ARBs group than that in non-ACEIs/ARBs group (5.0% vs 11.9%, p=0.002; 58.4% vs 66.7%, p=0.031).

These precautions rely on two fundamental principles of transmission prevention: particle filtration and droplet containment. The former is the focus of NIOSH N95 testing guidelines, and the latter is an FDA guideline for respirators and surgical masks. While studies have investigated droplet containment to provide guidance for homemade mask production, limited work has been done to characterize the filtration efficiency (FE) of materials used in home mask making. In this work, we demonstrate the low-cost (<$300) conversion of standard equipment used to fit-test respirators in hospital and industrial settings into a setup that measures quantitative FEs of materials based on NIOSH N95 guidelines, and subsequently measure FEs of materials found in healthcare and consumer spaces.

METHOD: We carried out a cross-sectional, mixed-methods study in 14 public healthcare facilities that provide TB and HIV care and treatment services. Providers' perceived readiness to adopt and implement digital health was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire designed based on an adapted eHealth readiness assessment model that covers six domains: core readiness, organizational cultural readiness, value proposition readiness, technological readiness, regulatory policy readiness, and operational resource readiness. The infrastructure and human resource capacity were assessed on-site using a tool adapted from the Technology Infrastructure Checklist. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, and the significant relationship between the composite variables was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficients (r). RESULT: We assessed 14 facilities on-site and surveyed 60 TB and HIV healthcare providers. According to Cronbach's alpha test, all the six technology acceptance domains had a value of >0.8, suggesting a strong interrelatedness between the measuring items. The correlation between technological readiness and operational resource readiness was significant (r = 0.8). The providers perceived their work environment as good enough in electronic data protection, while more efforts are needed in planning, training, adapting, and implementing digital health.

This knowledge of likely spatiotemporal surges of COVID-19 is fundamental to optimal timing of public health interventions that anticipate the impending endemicity of this disease and mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","output":"Projecting the seasonality of endemic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses the growing popularity of home-based primary care (HBPC) service in the U S Other topics include the Medicare Independence at Home house call program, the introduction by the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) of virtual care into patients' home, and the reasons why family physicians should add house calls to their services like improving doctor-patient-caregiver relationships and enhancing end-of-life care","output":"House Calls: Providing Care Beyond the Office Walls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The service sector is a sector that is increasingly playing a large and essential role in many countries, including Indonesia Currently, the service sector contributes more than 45% of the economic value-added and absorbs more than 35% of the workforce Nevertheless, the service sectors critical role in the economy comes from the direct impact of the service sector through its proportion to GDP or labor statistics and its role as an intermediate input and enabler for all economic activity Even since the economic crisis that hit Asia several decades ago, the service sector has helped the Indonesian economy a lot During the Covid-19 pandemic, several service sectors experience a sharp slowdown, like tourism and hospitality Nevertheless, some sectors play an essential role in controlling and stabilize the situation like medical and economy This study aims to determine why the service sector is considered one of the most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the possible solution for each sub-sector as a community initiative","output":"Community initiatives, Digitalization of services and restoration of services sector in the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper aims to address the development of China's narrative power during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on world order. It argues that in the post-pandemic world, the emergence of the authoritarian sub-order would be prompted by China's more proactive narrative power, given that the climate of opinion is ambiguous when faced with the uncertainty of the pandemic. (This does not imply the end of the existing liberal order; instead, it features the coexistence of both orders.) To understand how China's narrative power has encouraged the emergence of the authoritarian sub-order to coexist in parallel with the dominant constitutional order, the article first reviews the existing literature concerning the changing world order. In this section, it also briefly defines and differentiates between the constitutional and authoritarian orders, what defines world order, and what distinguishes authoritarian from constitutional liberal order. Second it looks at the theoretical grounding. The nature, role and power of narratives are explored. Ideas about strategic narratives and the economics of attention are discussed. This theoretical background paves the way to examine China's narrative power during a pandemic. Lastly, it switches to the Chinese perspective to address its support for the plurality of orders and its awareness of the strength of narrative in influencing dominant ideas. It looks at how China's narrative power has been exercised from three perspectives (formation, projection and reception). Here, it mainly tackles how China has used its narrative power to spin the pandemic to its advantage in the reorganization of world order: improving its international image and advocating the authoritarian order as an alternative. China has been building its narrative along with its changing strategic diplomacy - from restrained and low-profile to proactive and assertive. In the conclusion, some reflections on China's narrative power and the implications for world order are considered.","output":"The Post-Pandemic World: between Constitutionalized and Authoritarian Orders - China's Narrative-Power Play in the Pandemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Background: The olfactory nerve has never been the shining star of neurological examination. Quite the contrary, examining the first cranial nerve is often an overlooked step. As cases of anosmia secondary to COVID-19 infection continue to rise, the 2020 pandemic has shed new light on this much-forgotten nerve, its value as an aid to diagnosis of several diseases and its central role in our daily lives. Objective: We aimed to emphasize how essential and simple clinical examination of the olfactory system can be by highlighting practical techniques and clinical tips for its assessment. We also share pearls and pitfalls in localization and differential diagnosis, which may prove valuable to busy clinicians. Methods: A broad review of the literature was conducted by searching PubMed, Cochrane and Google Scholar for articles and books containing topics regarding examination of the olfactory nerve and its anatomy, physiology and pathology. No particular inclusion or exclusion criteria were used. Results: Forty different works were found, between books and articles, from which 20 were selected after careful analysis.

The goal of this study was to create a simulated daily readout (SDR) to restore the educational value of the daily readout. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To create the SDR the following tasks were performed; selection of cases for a daily worklist for each resident rotation, comprising a combination of normal and abnormal cases; determination of the correct number of cases and the appropriate mix of imaging modalities for each worklist; development of an \\"educational\\" environment consisting of separate \\"instances\\" of both our Picture Archive Communication System and reporting systems; and the anonymization of all of the cases on the worklists. Surveys of both residents and faculty involved in the SDR were performed to assess its effectiveness. RESULTS: Thirty-two residents participated in the SDR. The daily worklists for the first 20 days of the SDR included 3682 cases. An average of 480 cases per day was dictated by the residents. Surveys of the residents and the faculty involved in the SDR demonstrated that both agreed that the SDR effectively mimics a resident's daily work on rotations and preserves resident education during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 crisis. CONCLUSION: The development of the SDR provided an effective method of preserving the educational value of the daily readout experience of radiology residents, despite severe decreases in imaging exam volume and case mix diversity during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic.","output":"Preserving Radiology Resident Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Simulated Daily Readout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 is unclear. While most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content may influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 days of respiratory symptom onset. Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500 mL of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 days. The effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility. 940 patients were randomized and 921 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Intubation or death occurred in 199/614 (32.4%) in the convalescent plasma arm and 86/307 (28.0%) in the standard of care arm; relative risk (RR) 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.43; p=0.18). Patients in the convalescent plasma arm had more serious adverse events (33.4% vs. 26.4%; RR=1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.57, p=0.034). The antibody content significantly modulated the therapeutic effect of convalescent plasma. In multivariate analysis, each standard log increase in neutralization or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity independently reduced the potential harmful effect of plasma (OR=0.74; 0.57-0.95 and OR=0.66; 0.50-0.87, respectively), while IgG against the full transmembrane Spike protein increased it (OR=1.53, 95% CI 1.14-2.05).

The research project consists of a questionnaire used to answer the key question: What is your perception of your company's preparedness for and response to the COVID-19 outbreak? Sub-questions address three key areas of employees' responses: 1) Was the airline prepared prior to the pandemic? 2). Did the airline respond appropriately to the pandemic? 3) Is the airline positioned well to recover from the pandemic? Findings indicate that airlines' risk management systems are recognized as a weakness in the organizations; however, they are taking steps to enhance their risk management protocols since dealing with the global coronavirus pandemic. Additional findings indicate that air transport companies need to move away from their reliance on the existing risk management system that is based on historical disruptions and toward a more proactive system.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of English database (PubMed, Web of Science) and Chinese database (www.cnki.net, www.cqvip.com and www.Wanfangdata.com.cn) to identify papers on family clusters of COVID-19 with children and their family members. RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving 34 children and 98 adults from 28 families were included. Fever, cough and ground-grass opacity change of chest computed tomography (CT) were the dominant features, whereas proportion of asymptomatic infections for children was higher than adults with statistical significance (32.4% and 13.3%, respectively, P < 0.05). Median time of longer incubation period (10 days) and shorter duration of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test positive period (11 days) were seen in children than adults (7 and 17 days, respectively) with statistical significance (P < 0.05). There were statistically significant differences in lymphopenia, increased C-reactive protein and abnormal chest CT between children and adult patients (P < 0.05).

Mask-wearing and handwashing can slow the spread of the virus, but currently, masks are in shortage in many countries, and timely handwashing is often impossible. In this study, the efficacy of three types of masks and instant hand wiping was evaluated using the avian influenza virus to mock the coronavirus. Virus quantification was performed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Previous studies on mask-wearing were reviewed. The results showed that instant hand wiping using a wet towel soaked in water containing 1.00% soap powder, 0.05% active chlorine, or 0.25% active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite removed 98.36%, 96.62%, and 99.98% of the virus from hands, respectively. N95 masks, medical masks, and homemade masks made of four-layer kitchen paper and one-layer cloth could block 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of the virus in aerosols. Medical mask-wearing which was supported by many studies was opposed by other studies possibly due to erroneous judgment. With these data, we propose the approach of mask-wearing plus instant hand hygiene (MIH) to slow the exponential spread of the virus. This MIH approach has been supported by the experiences of seven countries in fighting against COVID-19.

The harmonized management of biological risks in such diverse laboratories thus appears as a real challenge. Zhejiang Province in China has taken the initiative to establish a comprehensively integrated laboratory biosafety management system called SINS (Standardization, Informatization, Normalization and Systematization). The SINS model system has been introduced and adopted in 1,721 BSL-2 laboratories in Zhejiang Province, and thus lead to an increase in the number of biosafety committees from 20% to more than 95% from 2007 to 2018, and the number of biosafety laboratory managers who knows biosafety-related laws and regulations increase from 52.7% to 83.7% from 2009 to 2017. Such achievements indicate that the successful implementation of SINS model has increased the effective control of biological risks in BSL-2 laboratories of the Zhejiang Province. SINS model and its main effects on leading the improvement of laboratory biosafety management was presented in this review. The SINS model helps to strengthen laboratory biosafety and thus effectively reduces occurrence of biosafety-related incidences.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Pubmed, Embase, and the WHO Global Research Database from December 1,2019 to May 1, 2020 for relevant articles. A random effects meta-analysis was used to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each of 27 laboratory markers. The impact of age and sex on WMDs was estimated using meta-regression techniques for 11 markers. RESULTS: In total, 64 studies met the inclusion criteria. The most marked WMDs were for neutrophils (ANC) at 3.82  109 /L (2.76, 4.87), lymphocytes (ALC) at -0.34  109 /L (-0.45, -0.23), interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 32.59 pg/mL (23.99, 41.19), ferritin at 814.14 ng/mL (551.48, 1076.81), C-reactive protein (CRP) at 66.11 mg/L (52.16, 80.06), D-dimer at 5.74 mg/L (3.91, 7.58), LDH at 232.41 U/L (178.31, 286.52), and high sensitivity troponin I at 90.47 pg/mL (47.79, 133.14) when comparing fatal to nonfatal cases. Similar trends were observed comparing severe to non-severe groups. There were no statistically significant associations between age or sex and WMD for any of the markers included in the meta-regression.

With high single-dose efficacy, single-dose vaccination is optimal, preventing up to 22% more deaths than a strategy prioritizing two-dose vaccination for older adults. With low or moderate single-dose efficacy, mixed vaccination campaigns with complete coverage of older adults are optimal. However, with modest or high transmission, vaccinating older adults first with two doses is best, preventing up to 41% more deaths than a single-dose vaccination given across all adult populations.

The majority of the world's children were out of school, leading to the longest sustained period of school closures in history. We saw educators turning towards responses not aimed at collegial and community-engaged strategies for education in an emergency but at online learning cast as education/business as usual. This study explores the logic driving this global response through analyses of the documents released by three key global education actors: (1) the OECD and its paper A Framework to Guide Education Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020; (2) UNESCO's Global Education Coalition #LearningNeverStops; and (3) the World Bank's Guidance Note on Education Systems' Response to COVID-19; and Guidance Note: Remote Learning and COVID-19. The authors of this article draw on Carol Bacchi's approach to poststructural policy analysis to make visible the key concepts and binaries used within policy texts and to understand the \\"technologies of saving\\" that were invoked in each policy response, locating the education programmes, activities and actors within knowledge practices in educational reform. This article explores the World Bank, OECD and UNESCO responses using an analysis of knowledge harmonisation and difference among these institutions as well as their location as key norm-setters and governing actors in the field of education. The authors argue that all three responses privilege private-sector providers of digital technology. The consequence of these responses is that technologies of saving have centred on privatised, corporate edu-business and edu-tech aimed at online education delivery, bringing significant risks for the erasure of local knowledges. The authors' study suggests that local policymakers, including community-based and national actors, must be invited into the discussion to envision other possibilities and to name the potential destructiveness embedded in the international organisations' actions.","output":"What are we saving?

With the ongoing struggle across the globe to combat COVID-19 disease, published literature has described the role of kidney disease in COVID-19 patients based on single/multicenter experiences across the globe. We extracted data from observational studies describing comorbid CKD, AKI and CRRT and outcomes and severity of COVID-19-hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019CAugust 20, 2020 following PRISMA guidelines. Severity of COVID-19 includes intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation < 90%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilization, in-hospital admission and mortality. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate pooled estimates, and forest plots were created. In total, 29 studies with 15,017 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The overall prevalence of AKI was 11.6% [(430/3693)], comorbid CKD 9.7% [(1342/13,728)] and CRRT 2.58% [(102/3946)] in our meta-analysis. We also found higher odds of comorbid CKD (pooled OR: 1.70; 95%CI: 1.21C2.40; p = 0.002), AKI (8.28; 4.42C15.52; p < 0.00001) and utilization of CRRT (16.90; 9.00C31.74; p < 0.00001) in patients with severe COVID-19 disease.

Among them, 25 (48.1%) females and 27 (51.9%) males were depressed. The prevalence of depression was higher in preclinical years (first and second year) than in clinical years (third, fourth and final year). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression among medical students in Nepal during the pandemic was less than the findings of similar studies conducted in Nepal before the pandemic. Further studies are required to get more knowledge about the factors associated with mental health of medical students.","output":"Depression among Medical Students of a Medical College in Nepal during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has become a global public health emergency. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and its downstream targets are activated in SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected Vero E6 cells and activation of p38 MAPK enhances the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV infection. In addition, weak activation of Akt cannot prevent SARS-CoV infection-induced apoptosis in Vero E6 cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, which is constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine (Tyr)-705 and slightly phosphorylated at serine (Ser)-727 in Vero E6 cells, was dephosphorylated at Tyr-705 on SARS-CoV infection. In addition to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in virus-infected cells, other MAPKs, i.e., extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), were phosphorylated. Although inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK (PD98059 and SP600125) had no effect on phosphorylation status of STAT3, inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580 and SB202190) partially inhibited dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705. Tyr-705-phosphorylated STAT3 was localized mainly in the nucleus in mock infected cells, whereas STAT3 disappeared from the nucleus in virus-infected cells. As STAT3 acts as an activator of transcription in the nucleus, these results suggest that STAT3 lacks its activity on transcription in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.","output":"Tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT3 in SARS coronavirus-infected Vero E6 cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presentations and outcomes of inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting with dysphonia and dysphagia to investigate trends and inform potential pathways for ongoing care. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: An inner-city National Health Service Hospital Trust in London, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: All adult inpatients hospitalized with COVID-19 (N=164) who were referred to Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) for voice and/or swallowing assessment for 2 months starting in April 2020. INTERVENTIONS: SLT assessment, advice, and therapy for dysphonia and dysphagia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence of delirium, neurologic presentation, intubation, tracheostomy, and proning history were collected, along with type of SLT provided and discharge outcomes. Therapy outcome measures were recorded for swallowing and tracheostomy pre- and post-SLT intervention and Grade Roughness Breathiness Asthenia Strain Scale for voice. RESULTS: Patients (N=164; 104 men) aged 56.816.7 years were included. Half (52.4%) had a tracheostomy, 78.7% had been intubated (mean, 156.6d), 13.4% had new neurologic impairment, and 69.5% were delirious. Individualized compensatory strategies were trialed in all and direct exercises with 11%. Baseline assessments showed marked impairments in dysphagia and voice, but there was significant improvement in all during the study (P<.0001). On average, patients started some oral intake 2 days after initial SLT assessment (interquartile range [IQR], 0-8) and were eating and drinking normally on discharge, but 29.3% (n=29) of those with dysphagia and 56.1% (n=37) of those with dysphonia remained impaired at hospital discharge. A total of 70.9% tracheostomized patients were decannulated, and the median time to decannulation was 19 days (IQR, 16-27). Among the 164 patients, 37.3% completed SLT input while inpatients, 23.5% were transferred to another hospital, 17.1% had voice, and 7.8% required community follow-up for dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatients with COVID-19 present with significant impairments of voice and swallowing, justifying responsive SLT. Prolonged intubations and tracheostomies were the norm, and a minority had new neurologic presentations. Patients typically improved with assessment that enabled treatment with individualized compensatory strategies. Services preparing for COVID-19 should target resources for tracheostomy weaning and to enable responsive management of dysphagia and dysphonia with robust referral pathways.","output":"Swallowing and Voice Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19: An Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the arms race between plants and viruses, two frontiers have been utilized for decades to combat viral infections in agriculture. First, many pathogenic viruses are excluded from plant meristems, which allows the regeneration of virus-free plant material by tissue culture. Second, vertical transmission of viruses to the host progeny is often inefficient, thereby reducing the danger of viral transmission through seeds. Numerous reports point to the existence of tightly linked meristematic and transgenerational antiviral barriers that remain poorly understood. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that exclude viruses from plant stem cells and progeny. We also discuss the evidence connecting viral invasion of meristematic cells and the ability of plants to recover from acute infections. Research spanning decades and performed on a variety of virus/host combinations has made clear that, beside morphological barriers, RNA interference (RNAi) plays a crucial role in preventing - or allowing - meristem invasion and vertical transmission. How a virus interacts with plant RNAi pathways in the meristem has profound effects on its symptomatology, persistence, replication rates, and, ultimately, entry into the host progeny.","output":"Under siege: virus control in plant meristems and progeny."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has so far been the most severe global public health emergency in this century.

BACKGROUND: Sudden public health events and the prevalence of infectious diseases give nurses in infectious disease departments a heavy task load and high occupational stress, which can affect their quality of life, and which is closely related to the quality of clinical care they provide. There are few existing studies on occupational stress, psychological resilience, and the quality of life of nurses in infectious disease departments. METHODS: We collected data from infectious-disease-specialized hospitals or infectious disease departments of general hospitals in China. In total 1,536 nurses completed questionnaires: the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Scale. We use a structural equation model to test the mediating role of the psychological resilience in the relationship between occupational stress and quality of life. RESULTS: Among 1,536 participants, 88.2% experienced an effort-reward imbalance. The average scores for psychological resilience and quality of life were 56.06 (SD = 14.19) and 51.80 (SD = 8.23), respectively. Our results show that occupational stress is negatively correlated with psychological resilience (r = ?0.28, p < 0.01) and quality of life (r = ?0.44, p < 0.01). In addition, we find that psychological resilience is positively correlated with quality of life (r = 0.55, p < 0.01) and that the indirect effect of occupational stress on quality of life through psychological resilience is significant ( = ?0.036, 95% CI: 0.027 to 0.426), indicating at least a partial mediating role of psychological resilience. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of nurses in infectious disease departments felt that their jobs effort-reward imbalance was high. These nurses scores for psychological resilience were in the middle level among Chinese people generally, but their quality of life was lower than the Chinese norm. We conclude that occupational stress has an important impact on their quality of life, and psychological resilience plays a partial mediating role on this impact. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Hospital managers can benefit from paying attention to the occupational stress of nurses and helping to improve the quality of life of nurses by alleviating this occupational stress and improving psychological resilience.","output":"Occupational Stress and the Quality of Life of Nurses in Infectious Disease Departments in China: The Mediating Role of Psychological Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the trappings, if not a burden, to Editors-in-Chief (EIC) of many medical journals is that one is expected to write editorials.

The fear of becoming infected and the lockdown measures have drastically changed people's daily routine. The aim of this study is to establish the psychological impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is entailing, particularly with regards to levels of stress, anxiety and depression, and to the risks of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). METHODS: The study, carried out with a sample of 1612 subjects distributed in seven countries (Australia, China, Ecuador, Iran, Italy, Norway and the United States), allowed us to collect information about the psychological impact of COVID-19. RESULTS: The findings of this study show that the levels of stress, depression and anxiety, as well as the risks of PTSD, are higher than average in over half of the considered sample. The severity of these disorders significantly depends on gender, type of outdoor activities, characteristics of their homes, eventual presence of infected acquaintances, time dedicated to looking for related information (in the news and social networks), type of source information and, in part, to the level of education and income.

Thus, there is an urgent need for developing treatments for COVID-19. Drug repurposing, which is the process of reusing already-approved drugs for new medical conditions, can be a good way to solve this problem quickly and broadly. Many clinical trials for COVID-19 patients using treatments for other diseases have already been in place or will be performed at clinical sites in the near future. Additionally, patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, liver cirrhosis, kidney diseases, hypertension, and asthma are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Thus, the relationship of comorbidity disease with COVID-19 may help to find repurposable drugs. To reduce trial and error in finding treatments for COVID-19, we propose building a network-based drug repurposing framework to prioritize repurposable drugs. First, we utilized knowledge of COVID-19 to construct a disease-gene-drug network (DGDr-Net) representing a COVID-19-centric interactome with components for diseases, genes, and drugs. DGDr-Net consisted of 592 diseases, 26,681 human genes and 2,173 drugs, and medical information for 18 common comorbidities. The DGDr-Net recommended candidate repurposable drugs for COVID-19 through network reinforcement driven scoring algorithms. The scoring algorithms determined the priority of recommendations by utilizing graph-based semi-supervised learning. From the predicted scores, we recommended 30 drugs, including dexamethasone, resveratrol, methotrexate, indomethacin, quercetin, etc., as repurposable drugs for COVID-19, and the results were verified with drugs that have been under clinical trials.

Because the emphasis has been on spatial language, less is known about the role of hand gestures in children's spatial development. Some children are more likely to fall behind in their spatial skills than others. Children born premature (gestational age <37 weeks) constitute such a risk group. Here, we compared performance of term and preterm-born children on two non-verbal spatial tasksmental transformation and block design. We also examined relations of children's performance on these tasks to parental spatial language and gesture input and their own production of spatial language and gesture during an independent puzzle play interaction. We found that while term and preterm-born children (n = 40) as a group did not differ in the mental transformation or block design performance, children varied widely in their performance within each group. The variability in mental transformation scores was predicted by both a subset of spatial words (what aspects of spatial information) and all spatial gestures children produced. Children's spatial language and gesture were in turn related to their parents' spatial language and gesture. Parental spatial language and gesture had an indirect relation on children's mental transformation, but not block design, scores via children's spatial language, and gesture use.

SETTING: Fifteen private PICUs in Brazil. PATIENTS: Pediatric patients admitted to the PICU from March to May since 2017. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The period from March 11, 2020, to March 17, 2020, was considered the \\"intervention point\\" studied, corresponding to the suspension of school activities and the beginning of physical distancing in Brazil. During the pandemic period studied, there were 28 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (one death). The mean age was higher (p = 0.000), the length of stay was shorter (p = 0.000), but mortality rates were similar among the periods (p = 0.36). The model estimated a reduction of 1,483 PICU admissions from March 2020 to May 2020. At the end of May, there was an estimated drop of -146.6 bronchiolitis admissions (95% CI, -242.8 to -50.3; p = 0.016); -71 asthma admissions (95% CI, -93.6 to -48.63; p = 0.000); and -59 community-acquired pneumonia admissions (95% CI, -74.7 to -43.3; p = 0.000) per period.

Within this retrospective study, we analyzed inpatient hospital admissions across 18 German university hospitals during the 2020 lockdown period compared to 2018. Patients admitted to hospital between January 1 and May 31, 2020 and the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019 were included in this study. Data derived from electronic health records were collected and analyzed using the data integration center infrastructure implemented in the university hospitals that are part of the four consortia funded by the German Medical Informatics Initiative. Admissions were grouped and counted by ICD 10 chapters and specific reasons for treatment at each site. Pooled aggregated data were centrally analyzed with descriptive statistics to compare absolute and relative differences between time periods of different years. The results illustrate how care process adoptions depended on the COVID-19 epidemiological situation and the criticality of the disease. Overall inpatient hospital admissions decreased by 35% in weeks 1 to 4 and by 30.3% in weeks 5 to 8 after the lockdown announcement compared to 2018. Even hospital admissions for critical care conditions such as malignant cancer treatments were reduced. We also noted a high reduction of emergency admissions such as myocardial infarction (38.7%), whereas the reduction in stroke admissions was smaller (19.6%). In contrast, we observed a considerable reduction in admissions for non-critical clinical situations, such as hysterectomies for benign tumors (78.8%) and hip replacements due to arthrosis (82.4%). In summary, our study shows that the university hospital admission rates in Germany were substantially reduced following the national COVID-19 lockdown.

We studied whether the analysis of cellular population data (CPD), provided as part of CBC-Diff analysis by the DxH 800 analyzers (Beckman Coulter), can help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Cellular population data of the different leukocyte subpopulations were analyzed in 137 controls, 322 patients with proven COVID-19 (COVID+), and 285 patients for whom investigations were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-). When CPD of COVID+ were different from controls and COVID- patients, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to test the discriminating capacity of the individual parameters. Using a random forest classifier, we developed the algorithm based on the combination of 4 monocyte CPD to discriminate COVID+ from COVID- patients. This algorithm was tested prospectively in a series of 222 patients referred to the emergency unit. RESULTS: Among the 222 patients, 86 were diagnosed as COVID-19 and 60.5% were correctly identified using the discriminating protocol. Among the 136 COVID- patients, 10.3% were misclassified (specificity 89.7%, sensitivity 60.5%).

This chapter paves the way for such demand by combining two basic ML techniques involving unsupervised and supervised learning. Since the occurrence of Colon Cancer is somewhat rare and complex, available Colon Cancer data sets are still underdeveloped and the Colon Cancer data set that is present is complex. The data set also has very less number of samples.

Once the same set of samples are predicted using the clustering, we are extrapolating the data based on the clusters formed using a statistical approach. To reduce complex processing and remove the irrelevant features with the intent of cleaning the data set, we are applying a correlation-based approach for feature selection and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied for dimensionality reduction.

Membrane wetting in MD operations is a major concern during longterm performance. In this study, machine learning (ML) methodologies were utilized to overcome the limitations of conventional mechanistic modeling. ML applications have never been explored to investigate how operational factors, such as water flux and salt flux, are affected during long-term MD performance. Furthermore, time-dependent factors were neglected, making it difficult to analyze the relationship between effluent quality and operational factors. Therefore, this study demonstrates a novel ML-based framework designed to enhance the performance of MD. The ML-based framework consists of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and utilizes a unique pathway to explain the impact of time series among operational factors. The accuracy of forecasting has been explored by utilizing 180 h (180 datasets), that was further used and divided into training (165 datasets) and test datasets (15 datasets). Eventually, the ARIMA model demonstrated a highly precise relationship order between the model and experimental data, which can be further used to forecast membrane performance in terms of wetting and fouling. The selected ARIMA model (3,2,1) appears to be an adequate model for water and salt flux data which has been effectively used to capture the course of permeate water and salt flux by producing the smallest forecast RMSE.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether noninvasive ventilation improves outcomes among patients developing hypoxemic acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial conducted between May 2013 and September 2014 in 20 French intensive care units among 293 patients who had undergone abdominal surgery and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (partial oxygen pressure <60 mm Hg or oxygen saturation [SpO2] 90% when breathing room air or <80 mm Hg when breathing 15 L/min of oxygen, plus either [1] a respiratory rate above 30/min or [2] clinical signs suggestive of intense respiratory muscle work and/or labored breathing) if it occurred within 7 days after surgical procedure. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard oxygen therapy (up to 15 L/min to maintain SpO2 of 94% or higher) (n = 145) or NIV delivered via facial mask (inspiratory pressure support level, 5-15 cm H2O; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5-10 cm H2O; fraction of inspired oxygen titrated to maintain SpO2 94%) (n = 148). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was tracheal reintubation for any cause within 7 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes were gas exchange, invasive ventilation-free days at day 30, health care-associated infections, and 90-day mortality. RESULTS Among the 293 patients (mean age, 63.4 [SD, 13.8] years; n=224 men) included in the intention-to-treat analysis, reintubation occurred in 49 of 148 (33.1%) in the NIV group and in 66 of 145 (45.5%) in the standard oxygen therapy group within+ 7 days after randomization (absolute difference, -12.4%; 95% CI, -23.5% to -1.3%; P = .03). Noninvasive ventilation was associated with significantly more invasive ventilation-free days compared with standard oxygen therapy (25.4 vs 23.2 days; absolute difference, -2.2 days; 95% CI, -0.1 to 4.6 days; P = .04), while fewer patients developed health care-associated infections (43/137 [31.4%] vs 63/128 [49.2%]; absolute difference, -17.8%; 95% CI, -30.2% to -5.4%; P = .003). At 90 days, 22 of 148 patients (14.9%) in the NIV group and 31 of 144 (21.5%) in the standard oxygen therapy group had died (absolute difference, -6.5%; 95% CI, -16.0% to 3.0%; P = .15). There were no significant differences in gas exchange. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure following abdominal surgery, use of NIV compared with standard oxygen therapy reduced the risk of tracheal reintubation within 7 days. These findings support use of NIV in this setting.

Traditional approaches to the sociology of the professions support this, seeing professionalization as an ongoing process of enclosure, encroachment, and conflict. Recent work, however, has emphasized the fluidity and collaborative nature of professionalization projects, and placed more emphasis on inter-professional negotiations and disciplinary coexistence. In this paper, we draw on this work to analyze the harmonization of the independent Mensendieck System of medical gymnastics in Norway, and the emerging state-sponsored physiotherapy system. Our contention is that over the course of the middle decades of the 20th century, advocates of the Mensendieck System and providers of orthodox, biomedically informed physiotherapy, came together and found a way to work collaboratively in a shared space without compromising their distinctive professional identities. We argue that this approach both points to ways we might revisit traditional conflict-based analyses of the history of physiotherapy, while also suggesting new ways of imagining how the profession might change in the years to come.","output":"Boundary work: the Mensendieck system and physiotherapy education in Norway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The process of using biodesulfurization (BDS) to remove sulfur compounds in petroleum has limitations such as low efficiency and low mass transfer. Therefore, it is important to study the combined effects of biosurfactant and the strain on BDS. A thermophilic desulfurization strain, Bacillus sp. Lv13, was isolated from the oilfield and used to produce biosurfactant (BS). The strain was identified as Bacillus licheniformis, a moderate thermophilic bacterium. Its BS was identified as lipopeptide using thin-layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The emulsification efficiency after 24 h (E 24) and critical micelle concentration (CMC) were determined to be 46.93% and 30 mg L-1, respectively. The combined effects of biosurfactant and the strain on BDS was confirmed using the Gibbs assay, GC-MS and BaCl2 test. Results showed that the yield of 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP) from dibenzothiophene significantly increased after the addition of lipopeptide into the reaction system. This could be illustrated by the stabilization of emulsion, lower CMC value, higher mass transfer rate with the addition of lipopeptide, and the enhancement in the capacity of BDS as well as the catalytic ability of the microbial cell.","output":"A lipopeptide biosurfactant from Bacillus sp.

While the large majority of these patients do seroconvert after vaccination, titers have generally been lower and one study showed reduced neutralizing and inhibitory functions. One real-world population- based study compared found no increased infection rate in anti- TNF treated patients, but infection rates were low. The low event rate mandates exploration in longer-term population-based data. We used the epi-Israeli IBD Research Nucleus (IIRN) database to explore the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in IBD patients in Israel. Methods: We included all IBD patients insured in two of the four Israeli HMOs, covering 35% of the population, by validated algorithms, and selected those who received two doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. These were matched by date of vaccination 3 days and demographic variables to non-IBD controls. The primary outcome was incidence of positive COVID-19 PCR following vaccination between December, 2020 to June, 2021. Results: 12,640 IBD patients received two vaccine doses;the matched cohort included 4,946 matched pairs (total 9,892 subjects). Mean age was 50.516.1 years and median follow-up was 22 weeks (range 4.1-24.4). Fifteen (0.3%) vaccinated IBD patients tested positive compared with 15 (0.3%) vaccinated non-IBD controls (OR=1 [95%CI 0.49-2.05], p=1.0). Patients on anti-TNF and/or corticosteroids did not have a higher incidence of positivity - neither compared to the entire group nor to IBD patients treated with vedolizumab/ustekinumab, even after precise matching for demographics, underlying diseases and IBD severity. Conclusion: In a large population-based cohort of IBD patients in Israel, vaccine effectiveness was equivalent to non-IBD controls and was not influenced by treatment with anti-TNF or corticosteroids. Notwithstanding previous findings of impaired serological response in anti-TNF treated IBD patients, this real-world large-scale study shows that vaccine protection is robust in IBD patients, including those on immunosuppressive medications.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in inflammatory bowel disease patients on tumor-necrosis factor inhibitors: Real world data from a massvaccination campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A patient with COVID-19-related severe respiratory failure, with insufficient response to an antiretroviral therapy, hydroxychloroquine and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonist therapy, presented a prompt resolution of the respiratory function and improvement in the radiological picture after baricitinib at an oral dose of 4 mg per day for 2 weeks.","output":"Baricitinib as rescue therapy in a patient with COVID-19 with no complete response to sarilumab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RationaleThe COVID-19 pandemic has shifted care away from face to face encounters towards telephone and video telehealth. To accommodate this, the VA prioritized use of VA Video Connect (VVC) a software platform that connects providers with patients on their personal devices. As there may be factors particular to pulmonary or other specialty care clinics that are barriers or facilitators of VVC use, we wished to describe uptake of VVC in pulmonary clinics relative to a comparable specialty (cardiology) and primary care. We also sought to evaluate whether appropriate high-risk patient groups were being prioritized for VVC (e.g rural Veterans with limited access to VA services and older Veterans) to inform program development to facilitate wider expansion of this technology. MethodsWe collected data from the Veteran Health Administration Support Service Center (VSSC). We identified all encounters associated with a Pulmonary/Chest clinic location, Cardiology clinic, and Primary Care clinic. Among those encounters we identified all scheduled as VVC and sliced data by standard VA definitions of rurality. We compared use of VVC, as a proportion of total encounters, in September 2019 and September 2020 at the end of each fiscal year. As this study was hypothesis generating, we did not perform statistical testing though anticipate all differences would have been significant. Results We found that 0.02% of cardiology, 0.2% of pulmonary and 0.3% of primary care visits were conducted using VVC in 2019 and had increased to 6%, 6% and 14% respectively in 2020 (Table 1). During the pandemic, Veterans living in rural areas and highly rural were approximately half and one-quarter as likely to have a VVC encounter with a specialty clinic (cardiology or pulmonary) as Veterans in urban areas, respectively. Use of VVC was higher in primary care than specialty care clinics across rurality groups. Although use increased substantially across all age groups between 2019-20, it decreased with increasing age group across all three clinic types - with Veterans 85+y approximately half as likely to use VVC as Veterans 45-64y in both primary and specialty care. ConclusionsPrimary care use of video telehealth was higher than in specialty care clinics, potentially due to concerns about ability to examine and appropriately triage patients. Groups with limited access to hospital beds and at higher risk of severe complications of COVID infection were less likely to use VVC, suggesting targeted efforts are necessary to improve VVC use among high risk groups. .","output":"Video telehealth increased during COVID-19 pandemic among va pulmonary clinics, but barriers remain to reaching similar levels of use as primary care and among high risk groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technology that allows for the identification of minority cell types in complex tissues, such as immune cells in the kidney.

We investigated whether exercise training improves cognition in chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer patients 2C4 years after diagnosis. METHODS: Chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer patients, with both self-reported cognitive problems and lower than expected performance on neuropsychological tests, were randomized to an exercise or control group. The 6-month exercise intervention consisted of supervised aerobic and strength training (2 h/week), and Nordic/power walking (2 h/week). Our primary outcome was memory functioning (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised; HVLT-R). Secondary outcomes included online neuropsychological tests (Amsterdam Cognition Scan; ACS), self-reported cognition (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for multiple myeloma; MDASI-MM), physical fitness (relative maximum oxygen uptake; VO(2peak)), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), QoL (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire; EORTC QLQ C-30), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS), and anxiety (HADS). HVLT-R total recall was analyzed with a Fisher exact test for clinically relevant improvement ( 5 words). Other outcomes were analyzed using multiple regression analyses adjusted for baseline and stratification factors. RESULTS: We randomized 181 patients to the exercise (n = 91) or control group (n = 90). Two-third of the patients attended  80% of the exercise sessions, and physical fitness significantly improved compared to control patients (B VO(2peak) 1.4 ml/min/kg, 95%CI:0.6;2.2). No difference in favor of the intervention group was seen on the primary outcome. Significant beneficial intervention effects were found for self-reported cognitive functioning [MDASI-MM severity (B-0.7, 95% CI ? 1.2; ? 0.1)], fatigue, QoL, and depression. A hypothesis-driven analysis in highly fatigued patients showed positive exercise effects on tested cognitive functioning [ACS Reaction Time (B-26.8, 95% CI ? 52.9; ? 0.6) and ACS Wordlist Learning (B4.4, 95% CI 0.5; 8.3)]. CONCLUSIONS: A 6-month exercise intervention improved self-reported cognitive functioning, physical fitness, fatigue, QoL, and depression in chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer patients with cognitive problems.

Multivariate logistic and Cox regression were used to identify in-hospital independent risk factors for in-hospital COVID-19 related mortality and morbidity, measured by time to recovery.

After the adjustment for sociodemographic factors, epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, and intervention related variables, gestational age was not associated with mortality and morbidity. It is also suggested that obstetric centers and social organization healthcare can reduce the risk for mortality and morbidity, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite higher percentage of women admitted in the third trimester, we found no association between gestational age and COVID-19 mortality and morbidity.

The present survey study, endorsed by CODRAL and AIRO-L, aimed to assess how radiotherapy (RT) departments in Lombardy have dealt with the recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire dealing with the management of pandemic was developed online and sent to all CODRAL Directors on the 10th of June 2020. Answers were collected in full anonymity one week after. RESULTS: All the 33 contacted RT facilities (100%) responded to the survey. Despite the scale of the pandemic, during P1 14 (42.4%) centres managed to safely continue the activity ( 10% reduction). During P2, 10 (30.3%) centres fully recovered and 14 (42.4%) reported an increase. Nonetheless, 6 (18.2%) declared no changes and, interestingly, 3 (9.1%) reduced activities. Overall, 21 centres (63.6%) reported suspected or positive cases within healthcare workforce since the beginning of the pandemic. Staff units were quarantined in 19 (57.6%) and 6 (18.2%) centres throughout P1 and P2, respectively.

Evidence-based parenting interventions provided in early childhood have proven to be effective in preventing the onset and escalation of child mental health disorders. In a pilot randomized controlled trial, we found that participation in the Incredible Years Basic Parent Training Program (IY) improved parenting stress and positive parenting practices and decreased child internalizing and externalizing symptoms among Filipino families. A fully powered trial is needed to determine the efficacy of IY as a prevention program among Filipino families. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to describe the design and rationale of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of the web-based IY program among parents recruited from multiple community-based settings and its impact on parenting practices, parenting stress, and child problem behavior among Filipino Americans and describe the impact of COVID-19 on our study protocols. METHODS: This study uses a randomized controlled 2-arm individually randomized group treatment pretestCposttest design for 180 parentCchild dyads. Individuals are eligible if they are 18 years, live in California, and have at least one Filipino child aged 8-12 years. Consenting participants are randomly allocated to receive either the 12-week IY parenting intervention (intervention arm) or American Academy of Pediatrics Bright Future handouts and placed on a waitlist to receive IY posttrial (waitlist control arm). Primary outcomes include the Parent Practices Interview and the Parenting Stress Index. Secondary outcomes will be measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (completed by parent) and will include child internalizing and externalizing behaviors and total problems. Data are collected at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Changes made to the protocol owing to COVID-19 include administration of surveys remotely and implementation of the intervention on the web. The pandemic has provided an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based version of IY that may improve access and increase use of the intervention. Recruitment and data collection procedures are still ongoing and are expected to be completed by December 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Our research will determine whether IY promotes positive parenting practices and prevents child internalizing and externalizing behaviors in healthy but high-risk populations such as Filipino families. It will also uplift cultural narratives and add to the evidence base for web-based parenting programs and their implementation in real-world settings. If found efficacious, IY has the potential to prevent behavioral health disparities in this understudied and high-risk Filipino population and can be scaled, adapted, and implemented in other at-risk racial and ethnic minority communities.

We analyzed survey data collected from 148 farmers using a binary logit model and descriptive statistics in order to identify the potential threats to agricultural production, and the coping strategies used by farmers in marshlands. Results showed that 65% of respondents were female, and 76% of all farmers claimed perceiving threats to agricultural production in marshes. The perceived potential threats to agriculture included floods, pest infestation (millipede, fall armyworm), crop theft, and unsecure land-holding status as well as the decrease in soil fertility. Moreover, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also led to the increase in prices of agricultural inputs (pesticides, seeds), and manure that has become increasingly rare and expensive due to the drastic reduction in livestock in that region weakened by several years of civil war and insecurity. In response, farmers were combining several adaptation strategies and these included drainage, mulching, manure application, and crop diversification used by farmers for, respectively, managing floods, maintaining soil fertility, and reducing crop failure. To cope with land scarcity, both female (75%) and male farmers (60%) claimed seeking for lands in highlands and renting extra plots in the same marshes or elsewhere. Despite the strategies implemented, there is still a need to strengthen farmers knowledge of flood and pesticide management and promote the integrated pest management practices for a sustainable use of marshlands. ? 2021 The Author(s).

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the acute disease are still not well understood.

We show that IL-17 levels in serum are rapidly elevated and positively correlated to liver damage and death of the mice. In IFN-R(?/?) mice, Th17 response is enhanced and the elevated IL-17 production contributes to severe liver damage as well as detrimental inflammation because neutralization of IL-17 effectively suppresses inflammation and protects mice from liver injury. We further show that IFN- facilitates antigen-induced apoptosis of Th17 cells and adoptive transferred IFN-R(?/?), but not IFN-R(+/+); CD4(+) T cells promotes an enhanced liver damage in wild-type mice. The results demonstrate an essential role of Th17 cells in MHV-induced immunopathology and the importance of IFN- in maintaining immune balance between Th1 and Th17 responses during acute viral infection.

RECENT FINDINGS The clinical benefits of intraoperative monitoring with cerebral oximetry [near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and brain tissue oxygenation monitoring (brptiO2)] and depth of anaesthesia with bispectral index (BIS) have recently been studied in surgical (carotid endarterectomy, cerebral arteriovenous malformations resection and brain tumour resections) and neuroradiological vascular procedures. BrptiO2/PaO2 ratio is much more reliable than absolute brptiO2 readings in detecting hypoxia in arteriovenous malformation resections. NIRS can help clinicians monitor those patients receiving endovascular treatment for acute ischaemic stroke and during carotid endarterectomy, but the value of applying cerebral oximetry in patients with cerebral vasospasm needs to be further evaluated. Awake craniotomy demonstrated that because of considerable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interindividual variation, BIS titration is recommended. Thus, the presence of a frontal brain tumour did not affect ipsilateral BIS values. SUMMARY Recent studies provide interesting evidence of intraoperative monitoring of NIRS, brptiO2 and BIS. The brptiO2/PaO2 ratio is much more reliable than an absolute brptiO2 reading; NIRS helps clinicians to monitor patients who are undergoing endovascular treatment, and BIS guides the titration of anaesthesia during awake craniotomy; its values are not affected by the presence of a frontal brain tumour.","output":"Intraoperative monitoring of cerebral oximetry and depth of anaesthesia during neuroanesthesia procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Police organisations have a wealth of experience in responding to emergencies, but COVID-19 is unprecedented in terms of the speed, scale and complexity of developing doctrine and its implementation by officers. The crisis also threw into sharp relief the fact that police policy and, crucially, practice are always implemented within wider social, political and economic contexts. Using online survey data collected from 325 police officers based at forces operating across different UK contexts (cities, conurbations, towns and rural areas), we seek to understand officer experiences and perceptions of policing COVID-19. In particular, we examine whether (internally) organisational climate and (externally) the UK governments response to COVID-19 were important to (a) officers support for police use of force at times of emergency, (b) officers support for procedurally just policing at times of emergency, and (c) their health and well-being;and whether identification and perceptions of self-legitimacy mediate the associations between these variables. We show that a positive organisational climate was associated with &lt;italic&gt;less&lt;/italic&gt; support for police use of force, &lt;italic&gt;more&lt;/italic&gt; support for procedurally just policing and &lt;italic&gt;increased&lt;/italic&gt; police officer health and well-being.

Mean duration of detention was shorter at 25 days (32 pre-pandemic). Psychotic illness made up a greater proportion of diagnoses during the pandemic: 56% (27/48) compared to 44% (27/62) pre-pandemic. The next most common diagnostic group was mood and anxiety disorders, which made up 29% (14/48) of diagnoses during the pandemic, but 43% (27/62) pre-pandemic. Outcomes as measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale showed a mean improvement between admission and discharge of 6.65, compared to 5.15 pre-pandemic. HONOS scores were higher on admission during the pandemic (12.83, vs 10.88), suggesting a higher level of acuity.ConclusionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic on this Mother and Baby Unit, length of stay was shorter, a greater proportion of patients were detained under the mental health act (although length of detention was shorter) and psychotic illness was more prevalent. This study demonstrates that there were differences in this perinatal inpatient population during the pandemic and this may be a reflection on the wider impact of COVID-19 on perinatal mental health.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on an inpatient mother and baby unit: a service evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 300,000 deaths in the United States alone. Although nonpharmaceutical interventions were implemented by federal and state governments in the United States, these efforts have failed to contain the virus. Following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, however, the hope for the return to normalcy has been renewed. This hope rests on an unprecedented nationwide vaccine campaign, which faces many logistical challenges and is also contingent on several factors whose values are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: We study the effectiveness of a nationwide vaccine campaign in response to different vaccine efficacies, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated, and the daily vaccine capacity under two different federal plans. To characterize the possible outcomes most accurately, we also account for the interactions between nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines through 6 scenarios that capture a range of possible impacts from nonpharmaceutical interventions. METHODS: We used large-scale, cloud-based, agent-based simulations by implementing the vaccination campaign using COVASIM, an open-source agent-based model for COVID-19 that has been used in several peer-reviewed studies and accounts for individual heterogeneity and a multiplicity of contact networks. Several modifications to the parameters and simulation logic were made to better align the model with current evidence. We chose 6 nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios and applied the vaccination intervention following both the plan proposed by Operation Warp Speed (former Trump administration) and the plan of one million vaccines per day, proposed by the Biden administration. We accounted for unknowns in vaccine efficacies and levels of population compliance by varying both parameters. For each experiment, the cumulative infection growth was fitted to a logistic growth model, and the carrying capacities and the growth rates were recorded. RESULTS: For both vaccination plans and all nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios, the presence of the vaccine intervention considerably lowers the total number of infections when life returns to normal, even when the population compliance to vaccines is as low as 20%. We noted an unintended consequence; given the vaccine availability estimates under both federal plans and the focus on vaccinating individuals by age categories, a significant reduction in nonpharmaceutical interventions results in a counterintuitive situation in which higher vaccine compliance then leads to more total infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although potent, vaccines alone cannot effectively end the pandemic given the current availability estimates and the adopted vaccination strategy. Nonpharmaceutical interventions need to continue and be enforced to ensure high compliance so that the rate of immunity established by vaccination outpaces that induced by infections.","output":"Returning to a Normal Life via COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States: A Large-scale Agent-Based Simulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"͹״տʼʱԱֻšԺзվʲ㡢ӦԾȱѡΪϿҰȫõΪٴͻ߷ͨȡǿѧϰҲֺ̡ǿԱʹȴʩпѧӦԣʵ˿Ⱦ.","output":"[Management practice of pathology department during the epidemic period of COVID-19]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides a deep dive into several recent cases of majoritarian hate speech and violence perpetrated against Muslims in India.

Since stimulation of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis protects the endothelial barrier in acute lung injury (ALI), we hypothesised that increased Ang-(1-7)/Mas signalling may protect females over males in ALI/ARDS.Clinical data were collected from Charit inpatients. Sex differences in ALI were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Mas-deficient (Mas-/- ) mice.

In murine ALI, male WT mice had more lung edema, protein leak, and histological evidence of injury than female WT mice. Lung weight change in response to platelet-activating factor (PAF) was more pronounced in male WT and female Mas-/- mice than female WT, whereas Mas receptor expression was higher in female WT lungs. Ovariectomy attenuated protection in female WT mice and reduced Mas receptor expression. In vitro, estrogen increased Mas receptor expression and attenuated endothelial leak in response to thrombin; this effect was alleviated by Mas receptor blockade.Improved lung endothelial barrier function protects female mice from ALI-induced lung edema.

Elucidating their knowledge, attitudes and perceptions was important for customizing communication material and other information activities. METHODS: The cross-sectional online INTERACT survey targeted students in conventional programs in the five main Universities in the Cyprus Republic between 17-31 March 2020, a week either side of the first national lockdown (24 March). RESULTS: A total of 3641 students completed the survey (19% response rate): 65.5% female, 80.9% Bachelor, 41% Health/Life sciences. Amongst participants, 68.8% and 20.6% responded correctly to at least six and eight of 10 knowledge-related questions. Objective knowledge did not vary substantially according to self-evaluation of knowledge. Misconceptions were identified in 25-30%. Only 29.1% expressed positive attitude towards a hypothetical person with COVID-19 without also projecting judgement or blame. Odds of expressing positive attitude increased by 18% (95%CI 13-24%) per unit increase in knowledge. Studying at postgraduate level was predictive of better knowledge (OR of score8 1.81; 95%CI 1.34-2.46) and positive attitude (OR 1.35; 95%CI 1.01-1.80).

Interestingly, we have observed that Cry1Ac preferentially induces high specific IgG responses in intestinal fluid when it is intraperitoneally administered to mice; therefore, in the present study, we used this protocol, as a model to address the influence of systemic immunization on the induction of the intestinal IgG response. The data shown indicate that upon intraperitoneal immunization with Cry1Ac, significant intestinal specific IgG cell responses were produced in the lamina propria, accompanied by an increased frequency of intestinal IgG+ lymphocytes and epithelial cells containing IgG. Considering that FcRn is the receptor responsible for the transport of IgG in neonatal intestinal epithelia, but it is developmentally downregulated in the rodent intestine, we analysed whether upon intestinal IgG induction, FcRn mRNA expression was induced in intestinal epithelial cells, of adult mice. Whereas in intestinal epithelia of unimmunized adult mice FcRn mRNA was not detected, in Cry1Ac immunized mice it was expressed, although the level was lower in comparison with that found in neonatal epithelia. Then using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence we confirmed that the expression of the protein FcRn was induced in the intestines of adult immunized mice especially in the large intestine. Finally, we found that Cry1Ac also increased FcRn expression in isolated intestinal epithelial cells stimulated in vitro. The outcomes suggest that the expression of FcRn in intestinal epithelium might be reactivated upon immunization, and possibly facilitate IgG transport.","output":"Immunization with Cry1Ac from Bacillus Thuringiensis Increases Intestinal IgG Response and Induces the Expression of FcRn in the Intestinal Epithelium of Adult Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer represents an extremely complicated ecosystem where cancer cells communicate with non-cancer cells present in the tumour niche through intercellular contacts, paracrine production of bioactive factors and extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes [...].","output":"Advances in Cancer Metabolism and Tumour Microenvironment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Toll\\\\like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system, which recognize molecular structures on pathogens or cellular stress\\\\associated molecules.

Few studies have controlled for overall dietary patterns in egg-T2D or egg-CHD analyses, and it is unclear whether any observed elevated risks of T2D and CHD with frequent egg consumption is real or due to confounding by dietary habits. We tested the hypothesis that frequent egg consumption is associated with a higher risk of T2D and CHD risk after adjustment for overall dietary patterns among adults. DESIGN We used prospective cohort design to complete time-to-event analyses. METHODS We pooled de novo, harmonized, individual-level analyses from nine US cohorts (n = 103,811). Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios separately in each cohort adjusting for age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), exercise, smoking, alcohol intake, and dietary patterns. We pooled cohort-specific results using an inverse-variance weighted method to estimate summary relative risks. RESULTS Median age ranged from 25 to 72 years. Median egg consumption was 1 egg per week in most of the cohorts. While egg consumption up to one per week was not associated with T2D risk, consumption of 2 eggs per week was associated with elevated risk [27% elevated risk of T2D comparing 7+ eggs/week with none (95% CI: 16%-37%)]. There was little evidence for heterogeneity across cohorts and we observed similar conclusions when stratified by BMI. Overall, egg consumption was not associated with the risk of CHD. However, in a sensitivity analysis, there was a 30% higher risk of CHD (95% CI: 3%-56%) restricted to older adults consuming 5-6 eggs/week. CONCLUSIONS Our data showed an elevated risk of T2D with egg consumption of 2 eggs per week but not with <2 eggs/week. While there was no overall association of egg consumption with CHD risk, the elevated CHD observed with consumption of 5-6 eggs/week in older cohorts merits further investigation.","output":"Egg consumption, overall diet quality, and risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease: A pooling project of US prospective cohorts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The emergence of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented global catas-trophe in the 21st century as a major virus outbreak The disease as well as the different preventive measures taken to contain the disease especially quarantine and lockdown, loss of income, loss of job and financial insecurity have led to an enormous impact on the mental health of the community and various psychological problems in the form of anxiety, depression and stress Objective: This article aims to highlight the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on mental health with a special focus on depression in the general population of Odisha Methods: This is a cross-sectional study carried out among the general population of Odisha through an online semi-structured questionnaire the link of which was sent to the participants by way of e-mails, WhatsApp and other social contacts Data analysis of the received responses was done Various statistical analyses were adopted using methods like Microsoft Excel, 2013, R version 4 0 2 software, t-test and Chi-square tests Significant predictor analysis was done using logistic regression Results: The incidence of depression to the tune of 43% was found (Mild-10 28%, Moderate-16 19%, Severe-5 56%, Extremely severe C 9 96%) Risk factors associated were the younger age group (21-40 years), unmarried persons (71 5%0, students (51 1%), persons not having symptoms of COVID-19 (78 4%), and persons without jobs (47 8%) Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of depression and is the topmost priority concern It is important to take adequate measures to mitigate the severity of the impact Early identification of worsening mental health and prompt response to address the problem can prevent further damage ?@IJCRR","output":"Mental health and predictors of depression during covid-19 pandemic in general population of odisha: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES In Graves' disease (GD), autoantibodies to the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) cause hyperthyroidism.

We wanted to assess the role of targeted synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (ts/bDMARDs) and other variables in the development of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease in IRD. METHODS: An observational longitudinal study was conducted during the epidemic peak in Madrid (1 March to 15 April 2020). All patients attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital in Madrid with a medical diagnosis of IRD were included. Main outcome: hospital admission related to COVID-19. Independent variable: ts/bDMARDs. Covariates: sociodemographic, comorbidities, type of IRD diagnosis, glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). Incidence rate (IR) of hospital admission related to COVID-19 was expressed per 1000 patient-months. Cox multiple regression analysis was run to examine the influence of ts/bDMARDs and other covariates on IR of hospital admission related to COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 3951 IRD patients were included (5896 patient-months). Methotrexate was the csDMARD most used. Eight hundred and two patients were on ts/bDMARDs, mainly anti-TNF agents, and Rtx. Hospital admissions related to COVID-19 occurred in 54 patients (1.36%) with an IR of 9.15 (95% confidence interval: 7C11.9).

The spectrum of thrombotic events is wide, including in situ pulmonary thrombosis, deep-vein thrombosis and associated pulmonary embolism, as well as arterial thrombotic events (stroke, myocardial infarction, limb artery thrombosis). Unusual thrombotic events have also been reported, e.g., cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, mesenteric artery and vein thrombosis. Several hematology abnormalities have been observed in COVID-19 patients, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia (usually mild), thrombocytosis, elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin times (the latter abnormality often indicating lupus anticoagulant phenomenon), hyperfibrinogenemia, elevated von Willebrand factor levels, and elevated fibrin d-dimer. Many of these abnormal hematologic parameterseven as early as the time of initial hospital admissionindicate adverse prognosis, including greater frequency of progression to severe respiratory illness and death. Progression to overt disseminated intravascular coagulation in fatal COVID-19 has been reported in some studies, but not observed in others.

Understanding the transmission pattern of the virus and the efficacy of transmission control measures is crucial to ensuring regional and global disease control. Here we propose a simple model based on exponential infectious growth, but with a time-varying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data from the 102 countries and regions which have reported cases for more than 6 days, and, we think, has largely captured the transmission patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. We found that the damping rate, defined as the rate of the exponential decline in transmission rate, ranged from -0.125 to 0.513 d-1 globally (a negative damping rate represents acceleration in spread). The estimated peak time (when the fastest spread occurs) and the final number of infections were found to be greatly affected by the damping rate. Successful control measures, such as those implemented in China and South Korea, have resulted in a clear pattern of exponential damping in the viral spread (also shown during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The damping rate, therefore, could be used as an indicator for the efficacy of implemented control measures. Our model suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak is currently accelerating worldwide, especially rapidly in certain countries (e.g. USA and Australia) where exponential damping is yet to emerge. Consistent with the message from the World Health Organisation (WHO), we thus strongly suggest all countries to take active measures to contain this global pandemic. Slight increments in the damping rate from additional control efforts, especially in countries showing weak or no exponential damping in COVID-19 transmission, could lead to a radically more positive outcome in the fight to contain the pandemic.","output":"Exponential damping: The key to successful containment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis and risk stratification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily based on discretionary use of laboratory resources.

We hypothesized that abdominal muscle stretching as a passive operation would have a beneficial effect on a biochemical index of the activity of the sympathetic/adrenomedullary system (salivary CgA) and anxiety. METHODS Fifteen control and eighteen untreated IBS subjects underwent experimental abdominal muscle stretching for 4 min. Subjects relaxed in a supine position with their knees fully flexed while their pelvic and trunk rotation was passively and slowly moved from 0 degrees of abdominal rotation to about 90 degrees or the point where the subject reported feeling discomfort.Changes in the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), ordinate scale and salivary CgA levels were compared between controls and IBS subjects before and after stretching. A three-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with period (before vs. after) as the within-subject factor and group (IBS vs. Control), and sex (men vs. female) as the between-subject factors was carried out on salivary CgA. RESULTS CgA showed significant interactions between period and groups (F[1, 31] = 4.89, p = 0.03), and between groups and sex (F[1, 31] = 4.73, p = 0.03).

At the baseline, salivary CgA in IBS subjects (36.7 +/- 5.9 pmol/mg) was significantly higher than in controls (19.9 +/- 5.5 pmol/mg, p < 0.05). After the stretching, salivary CgA significantly decreased in the IBS group (25.5 +/- 4.5 pmol/mg), and this value did not differ from that in controls (18.6 +/- 3.9 pmol/mg).

Emerging studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased these factors due to reported increases in caregiver workload and cognitive and behavioral symptoms of the PWD. We interviewed 10 spousal caregivers of PWD from the NYU Langone Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementias Family Support Program in Summer 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to gain feedback about their experiences during the pandemic and the transition from in-person to videoconferencing that could be used to improve services and support. Caregivers discussed the challenges faced during the pandemic but also the unique opportunities the situation presented. We report here on those positive aspects of COVID-19 from the perspective of the caregivers we interviewed. METHODS: Interviews of caregivers residing with their spouses in the New York City area were conducted via videoconferencing, transcribed, deidentified, and analyzed using framework analysis methods. RESULTS: We found that caregivers reported some positive reaction to videoconferencing that included increased support group cohesion, increased convenience, feeling less obligated to participate in events, and new opportunities for social contact. Participants also discussed positive inter-couple relationship changes such as increased quality time spent together. Our findings resonate with a body of literature focused on understanding the positive aspects of caregiving.

Cardiac complications secondary to this infection are common; however, the underlying mechanisms of such remain unclear. A detailed cardiac evaluation of a series of COVID-19 individuals undergoing postmortem evaluation is provided, with four aims: 1) describe the pathologic spectrum of the myocardium; 2) compare to an alternate viral illness; 3) investigate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression; and 4) provide the first description of the cardiac findings in patients with cleared infection. Methods: Study cases were identified from institutional files and included COVID-19 (n=15; 12 active, 3 cleared), influenza A/B (n=6), and non-virally mediated deaths (n=6). Salient information was abstracted from the medical record. Light microscopic findings were recorded. An ACE2 immunohistochemical H-score was compared across cases. Viral detection encompassed SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural examination, and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Results: Male sex was more common in the COVID-19 group (p=0.05). Non-occlusive fibrin microthrombi (without ischemic injury) were identified in 16 cases (12 COVID-19, 2 influenza, and 2 controls), and were more common in the active COVID-19 cohort (p=0.006). Four active COVID-19 cases showed focal myocarditis, while one case of cleared COVID-19 showed extensive disease. Arteriolar ACE2 endothelial expression was lower in COVID-19 cases versus controls (p=0.004). ACE2 myocardial expression did not differ by disease category, sex, age or number of patient comorbidities (p=0.69, p=1.00, p=0.46, p=0.65, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry showed non-specific staining, while ultrastructural examination and ddPCR were negative for viral presence. Four (26.7%) COVID-19 patients had underlying cardiac amyloidosis. Cases with cleared infection had variable presentations. Conclusions: This detailed histopathologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and molecular cardiac series showed no definitive evidence of direct myocardial infection.

Proper social participation increases the feeling of attachment, provides a stable sense of identity, and increases one's sense of worth, belonging, and dependence on society. Lack of social participation leads to anxiety, loneliness, depression, panic, mental disorders and many other mental problems and affects society in general. A new coronavirus, called COVID-19, was identified in late December 2019 in China. After just one year, it has been reportedly infected more than 85 million people (up to January 1, 2021) worldwide, and more than 1.8 million have died. Two public health measures to break the transmission chain include quarantine and social distancing. These measures restrict gatherings or separate individuals. Due to these measures in many countries, people's participation in many social activities has been disrupted. The purpose of this study is to survey the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on home integration, community integration and productive activities. Materials & Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2020 by using the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) which measures home integration, community integration, and productive activities, along with a demographic form which were sent to 461 participants in Iran (Mean +/- SD age= 36.86 +/- 5.8 years) on WhatsApp or via email and completed online. Participants were selected from among college students, patients, people with disabilities, their families and relatives, and others who could use smartphones, computers, tablets, and laptops. The effects of Covid-19 were evaluated by analyzing the CIQ scores before and after the pandemic in SPSS v. 22 software. Results Comparing the CIQ scores before and after the pandemic, results showed that it significantly reduced home integration (P<0.0001), social integration (P<0.0001), productive activities (P<0.0001) and total score (P<0.0001). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the social life of people. In addition to health threats of this disease, the fear of being infected and losing loved ones, job, educational opportunities, recreation, freedom and support, have profound psychological effects. Not only getting infected, but also the fear of getting infected can lead to a lack of access to resources that can improve people's resistance to this disease.

We aimed to characterize the longitudinal dynamics of the antibody responses in naturally infected individuals in Chile and compared them to humoral responses induced after immunization with CoronaVac-based on an inactivated whole virus -or the BNT162b2- based on mRNA-vaccines. We also contrasted them with the respective effectiveness and efficacy data available for both vaccines. METHODS: We determined and compared the longitudinal neutralizing (nAb) and anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibody responses of 74 COVID-19 individuals (37 outpatient and 37 hospitalized) during the acute disease and convalescence. We also assessed the antibody boosting of 36 of these individuals who were immunized after convalescence with either the CoronaVac (n = 30) or the BNT162b2 (n = 6) vaccines. Antibody titres were also measured for 50 na?ve individuals immunized with two doses of CoronaVac (n = 35) or BNT162b2 (n = 15) vaccines. The neutralizing level after vaccination was compared to those of convalescent individuals and the predicted efficacy was estimated. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infection induced robust nAb and anti-N antibody responses lasting >9 months, but showing a rapid nAb decay. After convalescence, nAb titres were significantly boosted by vaccination with CoronaVac or BNT162b2. In na?ve individuals, the calculated mean titre induced by two doses of CoronaVac or BNT162b2 was 02 times and 5.2 times, respectively, that of convalescent individuals, which has been proposed as threshold of protection. CoronaVac induced no or only modest anti-N antibody responses. Using two proposed logistic models, the predicted efficacy of BNT162b2 was estimated at 97%, in close agreement with phase 3 efficacy studies, while for CoronaVac it was 50% corresponding to the lowest range of clinical trials and below the real-life data from Chile (from February 2 through May 1, 2021 during the predominant circulation of the Gamma variant), where the estimated vaccine effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 was 628C646%. INTERPRETATION: The decay of nAbs titres in previously infected individuals over time indicates that vaccination is needed to boost humoral memory responses. Immunization of na?ve individuals with two doses of CoronaVac induced nAbs titres that were significantly lower to that of convalescent patients, and similar to vaccination with one dose of BTN162b2. The real life effectiveness for CoronaVac in Chile was higher than estimated; indicating that lower titres and additional cellular immune responses induced by CoronaVac might afford protection in a highly immunized population. Nevertheless, the lower nAb titre induced by two doses of CoronaVac as compared to the BTN162b2 vaccine in na?ve individuals, highlights the need of booster immunizations over time to maintain protective levels of antibody, particularly with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The World Health Organisation/International Society of Urological Pathology (WHO/ISUP) grading system for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is prognostically important in clear cell RCC (CCRCC) and papillary RCC (PRCC), and is included in risk stratification scores for CCRCC, thus impacting on patient management. To date there are no systematic studies examining the concordance of WHO/ISUP grading between digital pathology (DP) and glass slide (GS) images. We present a validation study examining intraobserver agreement in WHO/ISUP grade of CCRCC and PRCC. METHODS: Fifty CCRCCs and 10 PRCCs were graded (WHO/ISUP system) by three specialist uropathologists on three separate occasions (DP once then two GS assessments; GS1 and GS2) separated by wash-out periods of at least two-weeks. The grade was recorded for each assessment, and compared using Cohens and Fleisss kappa. RESULTS: There was 65 to 78% concordance of WHO/ISUP grading on DP and GS1. Furthermore, for the individual pathologists, the comparative kappa scores for DP versus GS1, and GS1 versus GS2, were 0.70 and 0.70, 0.57 and 0.73, and 0.71 and 0.74, and with no apparent tendency to upgrade or downgrade on DP versus GS. The interobserver kappa agreement was less, at 0.58 on DP and 0.45 on GS. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the assessment of WHO/ISUP grade on DP is noninferior to that on GS. There is an apparent slight improvement in agreement between pathologists on RCC grade when assessed on DP, which may warrant further study.","output":"WHO/ISUP grading of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma; validation of grading on the digital pathology platform and perspectives on reproducibility of grade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown and social distancing measures have been implemented for many countries to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming of health services. However, success on this strategy depends not only on the timing of its implementation, but also on the relaxation measures adopted within each community. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate the impacts of the lockdown implemented in Hermosillo, Mexico. We compared this intervention with some hypothetical ones, varying the starting date and also the population proportion that is released, breaking the confinement. A Monte Carlo study was performed by considering three scenarios to define our baseline dynamics. Results showed that a hypothetical delay of two weeks, on the lockdown measures, would result in an early acme around May 9 for hospitalization prevalence and an increase on cumulative deaths, 42 times higher by May 31, when compared to baseline. On the other hand, results concerning relaxation dynamics showed that the acme levels depend on the proportion of people who gets back to daily activities as well as the individual behavior with respect to prevention measures. Analysis regarding different relaxing mitigation measures were provided to the Sonoran Health Ministry, as requested. It is important to stress that, according to information provided by health authorities, the acme occurring time was closed to the one given by our model.

Although the seasonal coronaviruses do not pose a threat to human life, three members of this family, i.e., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently, SARS-CoV2, may cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and lead to death. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has already caused more than 4.4 million deaths worldwide. Although much is better understood about the immunopathogenesis of the lung disease, important information about systemic disease is still missing, mainly concerning neurological parameters. In this context, we sought to evaluate immunometabolic changes using in vitro and in vivo models of hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that, besides infecting hamsters astrocytes, SARS-CoV-2 induces changes in protein expression and metabolic pathways involved in carbon metabolism, glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and synaptic transmission. Interestingly, many of the differentially expressed proteins are concurrent with proteins that correlate with neurological diseases, such as Parkinsonss disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntingtons disease. Metabolic analysis by high resolution real-time respirometry evidenced hyperactivation of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Further metabolomics analysis confirmed the consumption of many metabolites, including glucose, pyruvate, glutamine, and alpha ketoglutarate. Interestingly, we observed that glutamine was significantly reduced in infected cultures, and the blockade of mitochondrial glutaminolysis significantly reduced viral replication and pro-inflammatory response. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in vivo as hippocampus, cortex, and olfactory bulb of intranasally infected hamsters were positive for viral genome several days post-infection. Altogether, our data reveals important changes in overall protein expression, mostly of those related to carbon metabolism and energy generation, causing an imbalance in important metabolic molecules and neurotransmitters. This may suggest that some of the neurological features observed during COVID-19, as memory and cognitive impairment, may rely on altered energetic profile of brain cells, as well as an unbalanced glutamine/glutamate levels, whose importance for adequate brain function is unquestionable.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection Impacts Carbon Metabolism and Depends on Glutamine for Replication in Syrian Hamster Astrocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this performance autoethnography poetry, I report a poem which aims to question the socially constructed concepts and health care practices in times of COVID-19 pandemic.

This study investigated the effects of chlorination and/or photo-irradiation on NDMA-FP derived from RNTD, simulating an urban water environment receiving treated wastewater. After chlorination and/or photo-irradiation of RNTD, ten TPs including five new ones were identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTof-MS).

This paper proposes an improved prediction model based on multiple graph representation methods, which is GDNet-DTI that combined GCN and DeepWalk. First, a molecular map with atoms as nodes and chemical bonds as edges is generated using the SMILE sequence of drugs, and then GIN is used to extract the features of molecular map for better obtaining the complex interactions between atoms. For target proteins, the protein sequence is first represented by a word vector, and then the one-dimensional convolution is used to extract features for extracting the different levels of features. Then, based on obtained drug features and target features, a DTI-graph is generated, in which drugs and targets are represented as nodes and interactions are represented as edges. Finally, GDNet-DTI are used to obtain node neighborhood information and graph topology information of the DTI-graph. Compared with other advanced models, the results show that GDNet-DTI combined with multiple graph features can predict DTIs more accurately and effectively with DrugBank and four benchmark datasets. In addition, a case study with COVID-19 data is presented, which shows that the proposed method has the potential to predict the actual DTIs and can contribute to the development of drug discovery. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Using Molecular Graph and GDNet-DTI Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A sample of 641 participants were presented with four decision-making tasks during the first stages of the COVID-19 lockdown in Spain: The dictator game, framing problems, utilitarian/deontological and altruistic/egoistic moral dilemmas.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out in a tertiary teaching hospital in a 1\\\\year period. Older patients (aged 65 years) were recruited if they were admitted for CAP confirmed by chest radiographs. RESULTS: A cohort of 488 patients was analyzed. Infective causes were found in 137 (28.1%) patients. Bacterial, viral and mixed infections were detected in 86 (17.6%), 41 (8.4%) and 10 (2.0%) patients, respectively. Bacteriology was established mostly by sputum culture and virology by nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) viral culture.

In this study, we investigated the viral virulence determinants by constructing a series of chimeric mutants between the highly virulent strain BJ2011C and the avirulent strain CHM2013. When tested in the 2-day-old piglet model, wild-type (WT) BJ2011C caused severe diarrhea and death of the piglets within 72 h. In contrast, its chimeric derivative carrying the S gene from CHM2013 (BJ2011C-SCHM) was avirulent to the piglets. Moreover, reciprocal substitution of the BJ2011C S gene (CHM2013-SBJ) did not enable CHM2013 to gain any virulence. However, when the whole structural protein-coding region of BJ2011C (CHM2013-SPBJ) was swapped, CHM2013 started to gain the ability to efficiently colonize the intestinal tract and caused diarrhea in piglets. A further gain of virulence required additional acquisition of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of BJ2011C, and the resultant virus (CHM2013-SP + 3UTRBJ) caused more severe diarrhea and death of piglets. Together, our findings suggest that the virulence of PEDV epidemic strains is a multigenic event and that the S gene is only one of the necessary determinants.IMPORTANCE The recently emerged highly virulent PEDV variants are the major cause of the global porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) pandemic. The S gene of the variants undergoes remarkable variations and has been thought to be the virulence determinant for the enhanced pathogenesis.

World-wide, many health services have improved their surge capacity with the implementation of new temporary hospital structures, but there have been few experiences of use over time despite representing an important element as support to the hospital network in the management of COVID-19 patients. In this article, the experiences are explained in the design, execution, and use of the temporary COVID-19 Hospital H144 of the Health Service of the Principality of Asturias (Sespa), with 144 beds, which was in operation from April 1 through July 1, 2020 (without admitting patients) and from November 12, 2020 through March 5, 2121, admitting a total of 334 COVID-19 patients (66% women; 34% men) and generating 3,149 hospital stays.

Following tissue injury, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in cytokine production, primarily interleukin(IL)-1 and IL-18, and, eventually, inflammatory cell death - pyroptosis. While a balanced inflammatory response favors damage resolution and tissue healing, excessive NLRP3 activation causes detrimental effects. A key involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported across a wide range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Several pharmacological agents selectively targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome system have been developed and tested in animals and early phase human studies with overall promising results. While the NLRP3 inhibitors are in clinical development, multiple randomized trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of IL-1 blockade in atherothrombosis, heart failure and recurrent pericarditis. Furthermore, the non-selective NLRP3 inhibitor colchicine has been recently shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary disease.

For the first time, this infection was recorded in December 2019 in the Chinese province of Wuhan. The virus presumably crossed the interspecies barrier and passed to humans from a bat. Initially, the disease was considered exclusively in the context of damage to the respiratory system, but it quickly became clear that the disease also entails serious consequences from various systems, including the cardiovascular system. Among these consequences are myocarditis, myocardial damage, subsequent heart failure, myocardial infarction, and Takotsubo syndrome. On the other hand, clinical data indicate that the presence of chronic diseases in a patient aggravates the course and outcome of coronavirus infection. In this context, the relationship between COVID-19 and atherosclerosis, a condition preceding cardiovascular disease and other disorders of the heart and blood vessels, is particularly interesting. The renin-angiotensin system is essential for the pathogenesis of both coronavirus disease and atherosclerosis. In particular, it has been shown that ACE2, an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, plays a key role in Sars-CoV-2 infection due to its receptor activity.

Here we investigated the involvement of the BDNF-TrkB-KCC2 pathway in neuropathic pain caused by BPA injury. We hypothesized that activation of BDNF-TrkB may inhibit neuronal excitability by downregulating KCC2 to maintain a high intracellular Cl-concentration. We established a neuropathic pain rat model by avulsion of the lower trunk brachial plexus, and investigated the effects of the TrkB-specific antibody K-252a on the expression of BDNF, TrkB, and KCC2. METHODS We randomly divided 40 male SD rats into four groups. In the brachial plexus avulsion group, C8-T1 roots were avulsed from the spinal cord at the lower trunk level. In the K252a group, 5uL K252a was applied intrathecally daily for three days after avulsion. In the sham surgery group, expose only and without damage. The control group did not undergo any treatment. Mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia were analyzed by electronic pain measuring instrument and acetone spray method at different time points on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21 after surgery. At 21 days after surgery, the expression of BDNF and TrkB in dorsal horn neurons and GFAP in astrocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry at the C5-T1 segment of the spinal cord. The expression levels of BDNF, TrkB, and KCC2 in the C5-T1 spinal cord were measured by Western Blot at 7 and 21 days. RESULTS Mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia were significantly reduced in the K252a group compared with the brachial plexus avulsion group. Compared with the BPA group, BDNF, TrkB and GFAP were significantly decreased in the K252a group at 21 days after treatment by immunohistochemical test. In the WB test, the expressions of BDNF and TrkB in the K252a group were quantitatively detected to be decreased, while the expression of KCC2 was increased, which was obvious at 7 and 21 days.

This review describes pneumonia morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents affected by humanitarian emergencies. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases for publications reporting pneumonia morbidity or mortality among children aged 1 month to 17 years in humanitarian emergencies (eg, natural disaster, armed conflict, displacement) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). RESULTS: We included 23 papers published between January 2000 and July 2021 from 23 countries, involving refugee/displaced persons camps (n = 5), other conflict settings (n = 14), and natural disaster (n = 3). Population pneumonia incidence was high for children under 5 years of age (73 to 146 episodes per 100 patient-years); 6%-29% met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for severe pneumonia requiring admission. Pneumonia accounted for 13%-34% of child and adolescent presentations to camp health facilities, 7%-48% of presentations and admissions to health facilities in other conflict settings, and 12%-22% of admissions to hospitals following natural disasters. Pneumonia related deaths accounted for 7%-30% of child and adolescent deaths in hospital, though case-fatality rates varied greatly (0.5%-17.2%). The risk for pneumonia was greater for children who are: recently displaced, living in crowded settings (particularly large camps), with deficient water and sanitation facilities, and those who are malnourished. CONCLUSION: Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children and adolescents affected by humanitarian emergencies.

The primary outcome (60-day mortality) was 29.10% (n = 87) in the development dataset, and 39.55% (n = 159) in the external validation dataset. The performance of the 8 tested models on the external validation dataset were similar to that of the holdout test dataset, indicating that the models capture the key predictors of mortality.

Due to the high prevalence and world-wide distribution of this pathogen, it is essential to develop a sensitive and specific detection assay suitable for use in a routine diagnostic laboratory. Techniques based on PCR or real-time PCR are laborious and expensive. Detailed analysis of the HCoV-NL63 genome permitted the identification of a conserved nucleic acid sequential motif, which was sufficient for the design of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. Evaluation of the method showed that the test is specific to HCoV-NL63 and that it does not cross-react with other respiratory viruses.

A carbohydrate oral rinse is an alternative method to improve exercise performance in moderate- to high-intensity exercise with a duration of 30-75 min. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively examine the isolated effect of maltodextrin-based rinsing on exercise performance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to establish the effect of a maltodextrin-based carbohydrate oral rinse on exercise performance across various modes of exercise. Furthermore, a secondary objective was to determine the effects of moderators [(1) participant characteristics; (2) oral rinse protocols; (3) exercise protocol (i.e. cycling, running etc.) and (4) fasting] on exercise performance while using a maltodextrin-based, carbohydrate oral rinse. METHODS: Five databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, SPORTDiscus and Global Health) were systematically searched for articles up to March 2021 and screened using Covidence (a systematic review management tool). A random effects robust meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were performed using Stata Statistical Software: Release 16. RESULTS: Thirty-five articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review; 34 of these articles were included in the meta-analysis. When using a conventional meta-analytic approach, overall, a carbohydrate oral rinse improved exercise performance in comparison with a placebo (SMD = 0.15, 95% CI 0.04, 0.27; p = 0.01). Furthermore, when implementing an adjusted, conservative, random effects meta-regression model using robust variance estimation, overall, compared with placebo, a carbohydrate oral rinse demonstrated evidence of improving exercise performance with a small effect size (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI - 0.01, 0.34; p = 0.051). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that a maltodextrin-based carbohydrate oral rinse can improve exercise performance. When comparing the two meta-analytic approaches, although non-significant, the more robust, adjusted, random effects meta-regression model demonstrated some evidence of a maltodextrin-based carbohydrate oral rinse improving exercise performance overall.","output":"Maltodextrin-Based Carbohydrate Oral Rinsing and Exercise Performance: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Identifying axial length growth rate as an indicator of fast progression before initiating atropine 0.01% for myopia progression in children. METHOD: From baseline, axial length growth over six months was measured prospectively. Subjects were then initiated on atropine 0.01% if axial length growth was greater than 0.1mm per 6 months (fast progressors), axial length and spherical equivalent change measurements recorded every six months. The rate of change was compared to the baseline pre-treatment rate. If axial length change was below the threshold, subjects received monitoring only. RESULTS: 73 subjects were identified as fast progressors and commenced atropine 0.01%, (mean baseline refraction of OD -2.91.6, OS -2.91.8 and a mean baseline axial length OD 24.62  1.00 mm, OS 24.53  0.99 mm). At six months, the mean paired difference of axial length growth rate was significantly reduced by 50% of baseline (all 73 subjects, p<0.05). 53 subjects followed to 12 months, and 12 to 24 months maintained a reduced growth rate. Change in mean spherical equivalent was significantly reduced compared to pre-treatment refractive error (mean paired difference p<0.05) and at each subsequent visit. 91 children were slow progressors and remained untreated. Their axial length growth rate did not change significantly out to 24 months. Spherical equivalent changed less than -0.5D annually in this group. CONCLUSION: Identifying fast progressors before treatment initiation demonstrated a strong treatment effect with atropine 0.01% reducing their individual rate of myopia progression by 50%.

Methods: 78 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or/and valvular heart disease surgeries were randomly assigned into an early and enhanced physiotherapy care group (EEPC group; n = 39) and a conventional physiotherapy care group (CPC group; n = 39). Treatment protocol for the EEPC group included 3 Mets of physical activity and respiratory physiotherapy on zero post-operative day and an extra physiotherapy session during the first three post-operative days, whereas the CPC group was treated with usual physiotherapy care after the first post-operative day. The length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay were set as the primary study outcomes, while pre- and post-intervention measurements were also performed to assess the oxymetric and hemodynamic influence of early mobilization and physiotherapy. Results: Participants mean age was 51.9  13.8 years. Of them 48 (61.5%) underwent CABG. Baseline and peri-procedural characteristics did not differ between the two groups.

Suturing and knot tying is a basic, yet inherent part of many laparoscopic operations, and should be mastered prior to operating on patients. One common and standardized suturing technique is the C-loop technique. In the standard training setting, on a box trainer, the trainee learns the psychomotor movements of the task and the laparoscopic visuospatial orientation simultaneously. Learning the psychomotor and visuospatial skills separately and sequentially may offer a more time-efficient alternative to the current standard of training. METHODS This is a monocentric, two-arm randomized controlled trial. The participants are medical students in their clinical years (third to sixth year) at Heidelberg University who have not previously partaken in a laparoscopic training course lasting more than 2 hours. A total of 54 students are randomized into one of two arms in a 1:1 ratio to sequential learning (group 1) or control (group 2). Both groups receive a standardized introduction to the training center, laparoscopic instruments, and C-loop technique. Group 1 learn the C-loop using a transparent shoebox, thus only learning the psychomotor skills. Once they reach proficiency, they then perform the same knot tying procedure on a box trainer with standard laparoscopic view, where they combine their psychomotor skills with the visuospatial orientation inherent to laparoscopy. Group 2 learn the C-loop using solely a box trainer with standard laparoscopic view until they reach proficiency. Trainees work in pairs and time is recorded for each attempt. The primary outcome is mean total training time for each group. Secondary endpoints include procedural and knot quality subscore differences. Tertiary endpoints include studying the influence of gender and video game experience on performance. DISCUSSION This study addresses whether the learning of the psychomotor and visuospatial aspects of laparoscopic suturing and knot tying is optimal sequentially or simultaneously, by assessing total training time, procedural, and knot quality differences between the two groups. It will improve the efficiency of future laparoscopic suturing courses and may serve as an indicator for laparoscopic training in a broader context, i.e., not only for suturing and knot tying.

As one of the constituent lipids on LNP surfaces, PEGylated lipids (PEG-lipids) play an important role in defining LNP physicochemical properties and biological interactions. Previous studies indicate that LNP performance is modulated by tuning PEG-lipid parameters including PEG size and architecture, carbon tail type and length, as well as the PEG-lipid molar ratio in LNPs. Owing to these numerous degrees of freedom, a high-throughput approach is necessary to fully understand LNP behavioral trends over a broad range of PEG-lipid variables. To this end, we report a low-volume, automated, high-throughput screening (HTS) workflow for the preparation, characterization, and in vitro assessment of LNPs loaded with a therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). A library of 54 ASO-LNP formulations with distinct PEG-lipid compositions was prepared using a liquid handling robot and assessed for their physiochemical properties as well as gene silencing efficacy in murine cortical neurons. Our results show that the molar ratio of anionic PEG-lipid in LNPs regulates particle size and PEG-lipid carbon tail length controls ASO-LNP gene silencing activity. ASO-LNPs formulated using PEG-lipids with optimal carbon tail lengths achieved up to 5-fold lower mRNA expression in neurons as compared to naked ASO. Representative ASO-LNP formulations were further characterized using dose-response curves and small-angle X-ray scattering to understand structure-activity relationships. Identified hits were also tested for efficacy in primary murine microglia and were scaled-up using a microfluidic formulation technique, demonstrating a smooth translation of ASO-LNP properties and in vitro efficacy. The reported HTS workflow can be used to screen additional multivariate parameters of LNPs with significant time and material savings, therefore guiding the selection and scale-up of optimal formulations for nucleic acid delivery to a variety of cellular targets.","output":"Predictive high-throughput screening of PEGylated lipids in oligonucleotide-loaded lipid nanoparticles for neuronal gene silencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections represent highly dynamic processes, characterized by evolutionary changes and events that involve both the pathogen and the host. Among infectious agents, viruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent responsible for the currently ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic, have a particularly high mutation rate. Taking into account the mutational landscape of an infectious agent, it is important to shed light on its evolution capability over time. As new, more infectious strains of COVID-19 emerge around the world, it is imperative to estimate when these new strains may overtake the wild-type strain in different populations. Therefore, we developed a general-purpose framework to estimate the time at which a mutant variant is able to take over a wild-type strain during an emerging infectious disease outbreak. In this study, we used COVID-19 as a case-study;however, the model is adaptable to any emerging pathogen. We devised a two-strain mathematical framework to model a wild- and a mutant-type viral population and fit cumulative case data to parameterize the model, using Ontario as a case study. We found that, in the context of under-reporting and the current case levels, a variant strain was unlikely to dominate until March/April 2021. The current non-pharmaceutical interventions in Ontario need to be kept in place longer even with vaccination in order to prevent another outbreak. The spread of a variant strain in Ontario will likely be observed by a widened peak of the daily reported cases. If vaccine efficacy is maintained across strains, then it is still possible to achieve high levels of immunity in the population by the end of 2021. Our findings have important practical implications in terms of public health as policy- and decision-makers are equipped with a mathematical tool that can enable the estimation of the take-over of a mutant strain of an emerging infectious disease.","output":"Could a New COVID-19 Mutant Strain Undermine Vaccination Efforts?

Neural networks were identified through independent components analysis. Dual regression was used to characterize within-network functional connectivity alterations associated with individual differences in anhedonia. Modulation of between-network functional connectivity by anhedonia was tested using region-of-interest to region-of-interest correlational analyses. Anhedonia was associated with visual network hyperconnectivity and expansion of the visual, dorsal attention, and default networks. Additionally, anhedonia was associated with decreased between-network connectivity among default, salience, dorsal attention, somatomotor, and visual networks. Findings suggest that anhedonia is associated with aberrant connectivity and structural alterations in resting-state networks that contribute to impairments in reward learning, low motivation, and negativity bias characteristic of depression.

Being affected by the disease exposes the individual to an uncertain prognosis and a state of quarantine. These factors can predispose individuals to the development of mental symptoms during or after the acute phase of the disease. There is a need for prospective studies assessing psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the post-infection period. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests were collected at patients' homes under the supervision of trained healthcare personnel. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were classified as mild cases (N = 895) at treatment intake were further assessed for the presence of psychiatric symptoms (on average, 56.6 days after the intake). We investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 symptoms at intake and depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms approximately two months later, adjusting for previous mental health status, time between baseline and outcome, and other confounders. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear models were employed for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: A clinically significant level of depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were reported by 26.2% (N = 235), 22.4% (N = 201), and 17.3% (N = 155) of the sample. Reporting an increased number of COVID-related symptoms was associated with the presence of clinically significant levels of depressive (aOR = 1.059;95%CI = 1.002-1.119), anxiety (aOR = 1.072;95%CI = 1.012-1.134), and post-traumatic stress (aOR = 1.092;95%CI = 1.024-1.166) symptoms. Sensitivity analyses supported findings for both continuous and categorical measures.

In July 2013, rabies was confirmed among three wild ferret-badgers, prompting public health response to prevent human rabies cases. This descriptive study reports the immediate response to the reemergence of rabies in Taiwan. Response included enhanced surveillance for human rabies cases by testing stored cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with encephalitides of unknown cause by RT-PCR, prioritizing vaccine use for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) during periods of vaccine shortage and subsequent expansion of PEP, surveillance of animal bites using information obtained from vaccine application, roll out of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with vaccine stock restoration, surveillance for adverse events following immunization (AEFI), and ensuring surge capacity to respond to general public inquiries by phone and training for healthcare professionals. Enhanced surveillance for human rabies found no cases after testing 205 stored CSF specimens collected during January 2010CJuly 2013. During July 16 to December 28, 2013, we received 8,241 rabies PEP application; 6,634 (80.5%) were consistent with recommendations. Among the 6,501persons who received at least one dose of rabies vaccine postexposure, 4,953 (76.2%) persons who were bitten by dogs; only 59 (0.9%) persons were bitten by ferret-badgers. During the study period, 6,247 persons received preexposure prophylaxis. There were 23 reports of AEFI; but no anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barr syndrome, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were found. During the study period, there were 40,312 calls to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control hotline, of which, 8,692 (22%) were related to rabies.

This systematic review has two aims: to define the relationship between kinesiophobia and functional outcomes, pain and range of motion following TKR, and to evaluate published treatments for kinesiophobia following TKR. MATERIALS AND METHODS A primary search of electronic databases, grey literature, and trial registries was performed in March 2020. English-language studies recruiting adult primary TKR patients, using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) were included. Outcome measures were grouped into short (< 6 months), medium (6-12 months), and long term (> 12 months). Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort or case control studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool for randomised controlled trials. RESULTS All thirteen included papers (82 identified) showed adequately low risk of methodological bias. TSK1 (activity avoidance) correlated with WOMAC functional score at 12 months in three studies (r = 0.20 p < 0.05, R = 0.317 p = 0.001, and correlation coefficient 0.197 p = 0.005). TSK score significantly correlated with mean active range of motion (ROM) at 2 weeks [65.98 (SD = 14.51) versus 47.35 (SD = 14.48) p = 0.000], 4 weeks [88.20 (SD = 15.11) versus 57.65 (SD = 14.80) p = 0.000], and 6 months [105.33 (SD = 12.34) versus 85.53 (SD = 14.77) p = 0.000] post-operation. Three post-operative interventions improved TSK score vs control following TKR: a home-based functional exercise programme [TSK - 14.30 (SD = 0.80) versus - 2.10 (SD = 0.80) p < 0.001], an outpatient cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme [TSK 27.76 (SD = 4.56) versus 36.54 (SD = 3.58)], and video-based psychological treatment [TSK 24 (SD = 5) versus 29 (SD = 5) p < 0.01].

However, in endemic areas where individuals experience repeated Pf infections over many years, the risk of Pf-iRBC-triggered inflammatory symptoms decreases with cumulative Pf exposure. The molecular mechanisms underlying these clinical observations remain unclear. Age-stratified analyses of monocytes collected from uninfected, asymptomatic Malian individuals before the malaria season revealed an inverse relationship between age and Pf-iRBC-inducible inflammatory cytokine (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF) production, whereas Malian infants and malaria-na?ve U.S. adults produced similarly high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, monocytes of Malian adults produced more IL-10 and expressed higher levels of the regulatory molecules CD163, CD206, Arginase-1 and TGM2. These observations were recapitulated in an in vitro system of monocyte to macrophage differentiation wherein macrophages re-exposed to Pf-iRBCs exhibited attenuated inflammatory cytokine responses and a corresponding decrease in the epigenetic marker of active gene transcription, H3K4me3, at inflammatory cytokine gene loci. Together these data indicate that Pf induces epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes/macrophages toward a regulatory phenotype that attenuates inflammatory responses during subsequent Pf exposure. These findings also suggest that past malaria exposure could mitigate monocyte-associated immunopathology induced by other pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. Author Summary The malaria parasite is mosquito-transmitted and causes fever and other inflammatory symptoms while circulating in the bloodstream. However, in regions of high malaria transmission the parasite is less likely to cause fever as children age and enter adulthood, even though adults commonly have malaria parasites in their blood. Monocytes are cells of the innate immune system that secrete molecules that cause fever and inflammation when encountering microorganisms like malaria. Although inflammation is critical to initiating normal immune responses, too much inflammation can harm infected individuals. In Mali, we conducted a study of a malaria-exposed population from infants to adults and found that participants monocytes produced less inflammation as age increases, whereas monocytes of Malian infants and U.S. adults, who had never been exposed to malaria, both produced high levels of inflammatory molecules. Accordingly, monocytes exposed to malaria in the laboratory became less inflammatory when re-exposed to malaria again later, and these monocytes turned down their inflammatory genes. This study helps us understand how people become immune to inflammatory symptoms of malaria and may also help explain why people in malaria-endemic areas appear to be less susceptible to the harmful effects of inflammation caused by other pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Plasmodium falciparum malaria drives epigenetic reprogramming of human monocytes toward a regulatory phenotype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Northwell Healths development and deployment of a Transitions Care Management program specifically for coronavirus patients in the Covid-19 epicenter this past spring helped reduce the likelihood of emergency department readmissions.","output":"Prompt Launch of a Rapid Transitions Care Model Prevents Re-hospitalizations of Covid-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, serology has suffered several manufacturing and budget bottlenecks.

Two MCDA assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 N gene and ORF1ab were designed. The fastest time to detection and sensitivity of MCDA was compared to LAMP and rt-PCR using DNA standards and transcribed RNA. For the N gene, MCDA was faster than LAMP and rt-PCR by 10 and 20 min, respectively with fastest time to detection at 5.2 min. rt-PCR had the highest sensitivity with the limit of detection at 10 copies/l compared with MCDA (100 copies/l) and LAMP (500 copies/l).

Assessment of the full range of evidence generated to date to understand the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time, its determinants and the immunity it confers will have a range of clinical and policy implications for this novel pathogen. This review comprehensively evaluated evidence describing the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. METHODS: Systematic review. Keyword-structured searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer. Articles were independently screened on title, abstract and full text by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements. Data were double-extracted into a pre-designed template, and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the Public Health Ontario Meta-tool for Quality Appraisal of Public Health Evidence (MetaQAT) tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. RESULTS: 150 papers were included. Most studies (113 or 75%) were observational in design, were based wholly or primarily on data from hospitalised patients (108, 72%) and had important methodological limitations. Few considered mild or asymptomatic infection. Antibody dynamics were well described in the acute phase, up to around three months from disease onset, but the picture regarding correlates of the antibody response was inconsistent. IgM was consistently detected before IgG in included studies, peaking at weeks two to five and declining over a further three to five weeks post-symptom onset depending on the patient group; IgG peaked around weeks three to seven post-symptom onset then plateaued, generally persisting for at least eight weeks. Neutralising antibodies were detectable within seven to 15 days following disease onset, with levels increasing until days 14C22 before levelling and then decreasing, but titres were lower in those with asymptomatic or clinically mild disease. Specific and potent neutralising antibodies have been isolated from convalescent plasma. Cross-reactivity but limited cross-neutralisation with other human coronaviridae was reported. Evidence for protective immunity in vivo was limited to small, short-term animal studies, showing promising initial results in the immediate recovery phase. CONCLUSIONS: Literature on antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is of variable quality with considerable heterogeneity of methods, study participants, outcomes measured and assays used. Although acute phase antibody dynamics are well described, longer-term patterns are much less well evidenced. Comprehensive assessment of the role of demographic characteristics and disease severity on antibody responses is needed. Initial findings of low neutralising antibody titres and possible waning of titres over time may have implications for sero-surveillance and disease control policy, although further evidence is needed. The detection of potent neutralising antibodies in convalescent plasma is important in the context of development of therapeutics and vaccines.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent esophagectomy at a single center from 1994 to 2018. Among these, patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 3217 patients were reviewed and 400 (12.4%) patients had RLNP, including 56 patients with bilateral RLNP identified by laryngoscopic examination. During the postoperative managements, 10 of the 56 patients (17.9%) required tracheostomy.

Phylogenetic analysis is a potentially powerful tool for tracking the transmission pattern of the virus with a view to aiding identification of potential interventions. Toward this goal, we have created a comprehensive protocol for the analysis and phylogenetic clustering of SARS-CoV-2 genomes using Nextstrain, a powerful open-source tool for the real-time interactive visualization of genome sequencing data. Approaches to focus the phylogenetic clustering analysis on a particular region of interest are detailed in this protocol.","output":"Computational Analysis and Phylogenetic Clustering of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although respiratory symptoms dominate the clinical presentation of COVID-19, atypical, misleading non-pulmonary complaints can occur.

The lockdown caused a lifestyle changes: an increase in the use of mobile media devices (MMDs), sleep and psychiatric disorders, incorrect habits regarding food and physical activities. We investigate prevalence of admission for seizures at our emergency department (ED), during Italian lockdown, comparing with that of the same period of the previous year (2019), and the relationship with some lifestyle changes. METHODS: In this observational study, patients (4C14 years) with seizures that accessed at our ED, during Italian lockdown, were eligible. Non-epileptic events and febrile seizures were excluded. We describe two groups: patients with new-onset seizures and not. Moreover, a questionnaire concerning use of MMDs and sleep habits was administered. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were included; median age 8.03 years. Considering only paediatric medical emergencies, the prevalence of accesses for seizures was 2.6% (CI 95% 0.020C0.034), while the incidence was 0.94% (CI 95% 0.006C0.0149). There was a statistically significant difference with prevalence of previous years, (2) 102.21 (p = 0.0001). We also reported a difference in daily screen time (DST) (p = 0.001) and total sleep time (TST) (p = 0.045), in all population, between period pre- and during lockdown. A negative correlation between DST and seizures latency (Spearmans  -0.426, p = 0.038) was found. In the two groups, the results were partially overlapping. CONCLUSIONS: During lockdown period, we assisted to an increase of accesses for seizures. It is conceivable that a sleep time change and/or higher MMD use could act as triggers for seizures.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs regulate the occurrence and development of various cancers and play an important role in GC progression. X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a carcinogenic lncRNA, is involved in human tumourigenesis and is altered in GC. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a transcription factor, is involved in cancer cell metastasis and differentiation. However, the exact mechanism underlying the biological roles of XIST and JAK2 in cancer cells remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted using GES-1, HGC-27, AGS and HEK-293 T cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to detect XIST, microRNA-337 (miR-337) and JAK2 expressions. GC cell invasion was investigated by using the Transwell assay. Fluorescein reporter gene detection was used to determine the relationship between JAK2 and XIST. RESULTS: Compared with that in GES-1 cells, XIST expression was significantly up-regulated in AGS and HGC-27 cells. miR-337 expression in GC cell lines was decreased. The proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells were simultaneously inhibited by XIST knockdown, and the relationship between XIST and miR-337 was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis. JAK2 is expected to be the target gene of miR-337. MiR-337 can negatively regulate JAK2 expression in vitro. In addition, si-XIST decreased JAK2 expression by up-regulating miR-337 in vitro, thereby inhibiting GC cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, we speculated that XIST regulates JAK2 by competing with miR-337 as a competitive endogenous lncRNA in GC. CONCLUSION: We elucidated the effects of migration and invasion after XIST inhibition, at least in part, by inhibiting miR-337 expression in GC cells to regulate JAK2. These data indicate that a positive feedback loop exists between XIST and JAK2 and suggest that JAK2 and XIST play a vital role in cancer cell migration and invasion.","output":"The lncRNA XIST promotes proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells by targeting miR-337"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The past two decades have been marked by three epidemics linked to emerging coronaviruses. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the existence of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and raised the question of the neuropathogenicity of coronaviruses. The aim of this review was to summarize the current data about neurological manifestations and diseases linked to human coronaviruses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Articles have been identified by searches of PubMed and Google scholar up to September 25, 2020, using a combination of coronavirus and neurology search terms and adding relevant references in the articles. RESULTS: We found five cohorts providing prevalence data of neurological symptoms among a total of 2533 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and articles focusing on COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations including a total of 580 patients. Neurological symptoms involved up to 73% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and were mostly headache, myalgias and impaired consciousness. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were mostly non-specific encephalopathies that represented between 13% and 40% of all neurological manifestations; post-infectious syndromes including acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM, n=13), acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE, n=4), Bickerstaff's encephalitis (n=5), generalized myoclonus (n=3) and acute transverse myelitis (n=7); other encephalitis including limbic encephalitis (n=9) and miscellaneous encephalitis with variable radiologic findings (n=26); acute cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic strokes (between 1.3% and 4.7% of COVID-19 patients), hemorrhagic strokes (n=17), cerebral venous thrombosis (n=8) and posterior reversible encephalopathy (n=5). Peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were the following: Guillain-Barr syndrome (n=31) and variants including Miller Fisher syndrome (n=3), polyneuritis cranialis (n=2) and facial diplegia (n=2); isolated oculomotor neuropathy (n=6); critical illness myopathy (n=6). Neuropathological studies in COVID-19 patients demonstrated different patterns of CNS damage, mostly ischemic and hemorrhagic changes with few cases of inflammatory injuries. Only one case suggested SARS-CoV-2 infiltration in endothelial and neural cells. We found 10 case reports or case series describing 22 patients with neurological manifestations associated with other human coronaviruses. Among them we found four MERS patients with ADEM or Bickerstaff's encephalitis, two SARS patients with encephalitis who had a positive SARS-CoV PCR in cerebrospinal fluid, five patients with ischemic strokes associated with SARS, eight MERS patients with critical illness neuromyopathy and one MERS patient with Guillain-Barr Syndrome. An autopsy study on SARS-CoV patients demonstrated the presence of the virus in the brain of eight patients. CONCLUSION: The wide range of neurological manifestations and diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with multiple pathogenic pathways including post-infectious mechanisms, septic-associated encephalopathies, coagulopathy or endothelitis. There was no definite evidence to support direct neuropathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses: A narrative review for clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While it is now evident that Omicron is rapidly replacing Delta, largely due to immune escape, it is less clear how the severity of Omicron compares to Delta. In Ontario, we sought to examine hospitalization and death associated with Omicron, as compared to cases infected with Delta. We conducted a matched cohort study, considering time to hospitalization or death as the outcome. Cases were matched on gender, age, vaccination status, health region and onset date. We identified 29,594 Omicron cases that met eligibility criteria, of which 11,622 could be matched with at least one Delta case (N=14,181). There were 59 (0.51%) hospitalizations and 3 (0.03%) deaths among matched Omicron cases, compared to 221 (1.6%) hospitalizations and 17 (0.12%) deaths among matched Delta cases. The risk of hospitalization or death was 65% lower (hazard ratio, HR=0.35, 95%CI: 0.26, 0.46) among Omicron cases compared to Delta cases, while risk of intensive care unit admission or death was 83% lower (HR=0.17, 95%CI: 0.08, 0.37).

The Young Group of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) developed the first international survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in nuclear medicine (NM). The aim of this study was to perform a preliminary report of the ongoing survey. METHODS: A questionnaire of thirty questions was prepared for all NM professionals addressing three main issues: (1) new scheduling praxes for NM diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, (2) assistance of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and (3) prevention of COVID-19 spreading in the departments. An invitation to the survey was sent to the corresponding authors of NM scientific papers indexed in SCOPUS in 2019. Personal data were analysed per individual responder. Organisation data were evaluated per single department. RESULTS: Two-hundred and ninety-six individual responders from 220 departments were evaluated. Most of the responders were from Europe (199/296, 67%). Approximately, all departments already changed their scheduling praxes due to the pandemic (213/220, 97%). In most departments, scheduled diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were allowed but quantitatively reduced (112/220, 51%). A significant reduction of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (more than 20%) affected 198/220 (90%) and 158/220 (72%) departments, respectively. Incidental COVID-19 signs in NM exams occurred in 106/220 departments (48%). Few departments were closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 (36/220, 16%). Most of the responders thought that pandemic would not permanently change the work of NM departments in the future (189/296, 64%). CONCLUSIONS: According to this preliminary report of the first international survey, COVID-19 heavily impacted NM departments and professionals. New praxes for NM procedures, assistance, and prevention of COVID-19 have been applied during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in nuclear medicine departments: preliminary report of the first international survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expansion of Medicaid and establishment of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) represent a significant success story in the national effort to guarantee health insurance for children That success is reflected in the high rates of coverage and health care access achieved for children, including those in low-income families But significant coverage gaps remain-gaps that have been increasing since 2016 and are likely to accelerate with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the associated recession Using National Health Interview Survey data, we found that the proportion of uninsured children was 5 5 percent in 2018 Children continue to face coverage interruptions, and Latino, adolescent, and noncitizen children continue to face elevated risks of being uninsured Although we note the benefits of a universal, federally financed, single-payer approach to coverage, we also offer two possible reform pathways that can take place within the current multipayer system, aimed at ensuring coverage, access, continuity, and comprehensiveness to move the nation closer to the goal of providing the health care that children need to reach their full potential and to reduce racial and economic inequalities","output":"Children's Health Insurance Coverage: Progress, Problems, And Priorities For 2021 And Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As more and more workplaces physically reopen while COVID-19 remains a significant health concern, employers find themselves agonizing over when and how to do so properly, often weighing financial considerations and the need for their services against the potential health implications of being open in such precarious times.With experts at odds over the right approach, consensus decisions are unlikely, leaving leaders alone to answer some very difficult questions: Are we allowed to open?

To make the extensive use of Mg-based implants in-vivo, mechanical integrity in the physiological environment is a prerequisite. This study presents an insight into the biomechanical stability of Mg-3Zn/HA (0, 5, and 15 wt % of HA) composites in two different milieus (simulated body fluid (SBF) and serum contained SBF (m-SBF)). After 14 days of static immersion in SBF, ~65% mechanical strength was compromised in the case of 15 wt % HA reinforcement. However, the degradation rate was slowed down by ~35% with the addition of 15 wt % HA in Mg-3Zn. Mg-3Zn/HA composite, when soaked in both fluids, was found to induce apatite layer formation on the surfaces for several days. However, in the case of m-SBF immersion, 15 wt % HA facilitated less precipitation of apatite growth when compared to SBF immersion. Nevertheless, m-SBF immersed 15 wt % HA composite facilitated better corrosion resistance and excellent mechanical stability after 14 days of immersion. The approach thereby assists in establishing an effective mechanism between the degradation and mechanical stability in in-vitro immersion. In addition, this study has also developed a semi-empirical model for prediction of the compressive strength of these composites as a function of the number of days of immersion and the content of hydroxyapatite (HA). This semi-empirical model will help in predicting the biomechanical stability for long-term in-vitro exposures, which might be of use in evaluating the effect of the in-vivo environment.","output":"Assessment of biomechanical stability and formulation of a statistical model on magnesium based composite in two different milieus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pre-existing issues regarding the wellbeing and mental health of university students have subsequently been compounded by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Research signals that anxiety and depression symptomology has increased in university students following the COVID-19 outbreak, and mental wellbeing has declined. In response to concerns around mental health of students in Higher Education (HE), and to support the transition to remote working during the pandemic, we designed and implemented an 8-week wellbeing program based on positive education frameworks and practices. The online program was delivered in a West Midlands-based university in the United Kingdom, to undergraduate and postgraduate psychology students. The weekly sessions [ran through a virtual learning environment (VLE)] aimed to 1) provide students with a community and an opportunity to feel connected with other students, 2) introduce students to key concepts of wellbeing, and 3) equip students with knowledge and resources that would help sustain/improve their wellbeing. In this paper we outline how positive education, and specifically the PERMA wellbeing framework, has inspired the development of this wellbeing program (including the accompanying VLE webpages and sources of support) and future plans for evaluation. We further describe the content and delivery of this program alongside practical implications, lessons learned and important constraints.

IL-8, previously introduced as a biomarker for IPA, was also included in this study. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of IPA patients and control patients with non-infectious lung disease was collected according to clinical indications. Measurements in BALF displayed significantly higher levels of LBP (p < 0.0001), BPI (p = 0.0002) and IL-8 (p < 0.0001) in IPA compared to control patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed higher AUC for LBP (0.98, 95% CI 0.95C1.00) than BPI (0.84, 95% CI 0.70C0.97; p = 0.0301).

One particular challenge of assessing volatility forecasts is how to construct a robust proxy for the unknown true volatility. In this work, we show that the empirical loss comparison between two volatility predictors hinges on the deviation of the volatility proxy from the true volatility. We then establish non-asymptotic deviation bounds for three robust volatility proxies, two of which are based on clipped data, and the third of which is based on exponentially weighted Huber loss minimization. In particular, in order for the Huber approach to adapt to non-stationary financial returns, we propose to solve a tuning-free weighted Huber loss minimization problem to jointly estimate the volatility and the optimal robustification parameter at each time point. We then inflate this robustification parameter and use it to update the volatility proxy to achieve optimal balance between the bias and variance of the global empirical loss. We also extend this Huber method to construct volatility predictors. Finally, we exploit the proposed robust volatility proxy to compare different volatility predictors on the Bitcoin market data. It turns out that when the sample size is limited, applying the robust volatility proxy gives more consistent and stable evaluation of volatility forecasts.","output":"Volatility prediction comparison via robust volatility proxies: An empirical deviation perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel COVID-19 is having far-reaching consequences worldwide Security and security management are not immune from this influence Building on the scientific literature, this article explores the mixed impact of this unexpected macro-level phenomenon and its consequences on violent extremism and terrorism in the West, in the short and in the medium to long term The paper looks at the influence on extremist beliefs and attitudes and, moreover, it examines the effects on extremist behaviors, with an emphasis on terrorist activities, drawing on a model of terrorist attack cycle The COVID-19 pandemic can be interpreted as a global natural experiment that offers insight into causal processes, in the interplay among societal, group, and individual factors","output":"Hate in the time of coronavirus: exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on violent extremism and terrorism in the West"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid shift to online delivery in higher education.

Increasing treatment uptake can improve health and quality of life for those with PTSD. Individuals with PTSD are more likely to report poor physical functioning, which may contribute to difficulty with treatment initiation and retention. We sought to determine the effects of poor physical functioning on mental health treatment initiation and retention for individuals with PTSD. METHODS: We used data for a national cohort of veterans in VA care; diagnosed with PTSD in June 2008-July 2009; with no mental health treatment in the prior year; and who responded to baseline surveys on physical functioning and PTSD symptoms (n = 6,765). Physical functioning was assessed using Veterans RAND 12-item Short Form Health Survey, and encoded as limitations in physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health. Treatment initiation (within 6 months of diagnosis) was determined using VA data and categorized as none (reference), only medications, only psychotherapy, or both. Treatment retention was defined as having  4 months of appropriate antidepressant or  8 psychotherapy encounters. RESULTS: In multinomial models, greater limitations in physical functioning were associated with lower odds of initiating only psychotherapy (OR 0.82 [95 % CI 0.68, 0.97] for limited a little and OR 0.74 [0.61, 0.90] for limited a lot, compared to reference Not limited at all). However, it was not associated with initiation of medications alone (OR 1.04 [0.85, 1.28] for limited a little and OR 1.07 [0.86, 1.34] for limited a lot) or combined with psychotherapy (OR 1.03 [0.85, 1.25] for limited a little and OR 0.95 [0.78, 1.17] for limited a lot). Greater limitations in physical functioning were also associated with lower odds of psychotherapy retention (OR 0.69 [0.53, 0.89] for limited a lot) but not for medications (e.g., OR 0.96 [0.79, 1.17] for limited a lot). Role limitations was only associated with initiation of both medications and psychotherapy, but there was no effect gradient (OR 1.38 [1.03, 1.86] for limitations a little or some of the time, and OR 1.18 [0.63, 1.06] for most or all of the time, compared to reference None of the time). Accounting for chronic physical health conditions did not attenuate associations between limitations in physical functioning (or role limitations) and PTSD treatment; having more chronic conditions was associated with lower odds of both initiation and retention for all treatments (e.g., for 2 + conditions OR 0.53 [0.41, 0.67] for initiation of psychotherapy).

Therefore, it might be expected that an EGS service fields many consultations for postoperative patients. However, with the known overutilization of emergency department visits for nonurgent conditions, we hypothesized most postoperative consults received by an EGS service would be nonurgent and could be appropriately managed as an outpatient. METHODS We reviewed all EGS consults at a single urban safety net hospital over a 12-month period, screening for patients who had undergone surgery in the previous 12 mo. This included consultations from the emergency room and inpatient setting. Demographics, admission status, procedures performed, and other details were abstracted from the chart and Vizient reports. Consultation questions were categorized and then reviewed by an expert panel to determine if conditions could have been managed as an outpatient. RESULTS The EGS service received a total of 1112 consults, with 99 (9%) for a postoperative condition. Overall, 85% of postoperative consults were admitted after consultation, 19% underwent surgery and 21% underwent a procedure with gastroenterology or interventional radiology.

However, the best therapeutic response would be expected by combining anti-inflammatory properties, while concomitantly blocking viral replication. These combined effects should drastically reduce both infection rate and severe complications induced by novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Therefore, we explored the antiviral potency of a class of anti-inflammatory compounds that inhibit the N-Acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a bioactive lipid that mediates anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity through the activation of peroxisome proliferator receptor- (PPAR-). Similarly, this pathway is likely to be a significant target to impede viral replication since PPAR- activation leads to dismantling of lipid droplets, where viral replication of Flaviviruses and Coronaviruses occurs. Here, we show that either genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the NAAA enzyme leads to five-fold reduction in the replication of both SARS-CoV-2 and ZIKV in various cell lines. Once NAAA enzyme is blocked, both ZIKV and SARS CoV-2 replication decrease, which parallels a sudden five-fold decrease in virion release. These effects induced by NAAA inhibition occurs concomitantly with stimulation of autophagy during infection. Remarkably, parallel antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of NAAA antagonism were confirmed in ex-vivo experiments, within SARS-CoV-2 infected human PBMC cells, in which both viral genomes and TNF- production drop by ~60%. It is known that macrophages contribute to viral spread, excessive inflammation and macrophage activation syndrome that NAAA inhibitors might prevent, reducing the macrophage-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent death of COVID-19 patients.","output":"N-acylethanolamine acid amide hydrolase is a novel target for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and Zika virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a COVID-19 was a global pandemic in March 2020.

However, other factors that predispose individuals to increased chances of infection are unclear. METHODS: Data from 18,600 people screened for COVID-19 in Mumbai during the outbreak's initial phase, March 7 to June 30, 2020, were used to assess risk factors associated with COVID-19 using the odds ratio analysis. FINDINGS: Males aged 60 years having both diabetes and hypertension were at the highest risk of COVID-19 infection (M vs. F OR=2.5, 95% CI=1.34C4.67, p = 0.0049). People having both diabetes and hypertension in 20 years (OR=4.11, 95% CI=3.26C5.20, p <0.0001), diabetes and hypertension independently in 20C39 (OR=4.13, 95% CI=2.22C7.70, p <0.0001, OR=4.32, 95% CI=2.10C8.88, p = 0.0001) and 60 years (OR=2.69, 95% CI=1.87C3.87, p <0.0001, OR=2.03, 95% CI=1.46C2.82, p <0.0001), chronic renal disease in 20C39 years (OR=5.38, 95% CI=1.91C15.09, p = 0.0007) age groups had significantly higher risk of COVID-19 infection than those without comorbidity. Quarantined people had significantly lower positive odds (OR=0.59, 95% CI=0.53C0.66, p <0.001) than non-quarantined people. INTERPRETATION: Our research indicates that the risk of getting COVID-19 disease is not equal. When considering sex, age, and comorbidity together, we found that males aged 60 years and having both diabetes and hypertension had a significantly high risk of COVID-19 infection.

However, between 1999 and 2018, over 400,000 people in the United States died from opioid overdose. Excessive opioids make breathing lethally slow and shallow, a side-effect called opioid-induced respiratory depression. This doubled-edged sword has sparked the desire to develop novel therapeutics that provide opioid-like analgesia without depressing breathing. One such approach has been the design of so-called biased agonists that signal through some, but not all pathways downstream of the -opioid receptor (MOR), the target of morphine and other opioid analgesics. This rationale stems from a study suggesting that MOR-induced ?-arrestin 2 dependent signaling is responsible for opioid respiratory depression, whereas adenylyl cyclase inhibition produces analgesia. To verify this important result that motivated the biased agonist approach, we re-examined breathing in ?-arrestin 2-deficient mice and instead find no connection between ?-arrestin 2 and opioid respiratory depression. This result suggests that any attenuated effect of biased agonists on breathing is through an as-yet defined mechanism.","output":"?-arrestin 2 germline knockout does not attenuate opioid respiratory depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a collaborative global effort to construct novel therapeutic and prophylactic approaches to SARS-CoV-2 management.

A potential for severe COVID-19 disease might be hypothesized in Cushing disease patients. We present a finding of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal PCR test in an untreated Cushing disease patient. Case: A 19 year old female presented in January 2020 reporting amenorrhea and cushingoid facies. Her last menstrual period was two years ago. Low energy, fatigue, easy bruising and dark stretch marks on her legs, axillae and flanks were reported. Physical exam showed blood pressure 123/83 mmHg, pulse 89 bpm, BMI 20.80 kg/m2. She had a cushingoid appearance with fullness in the face, neck and supraclavicular area, mild proptosis, pink cheeks and a few faint lavender striae on the inner thighs and flanks. Test results relevant to or supporting a diagnosis of Cushing disease included the following: 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test: AM cortisol 23.9 ug/dl (6.7-22.6 ug/dl). Random 1019 hrs AM ACTH was 32 pg/ml (<47 pg/ml), cortisol 6.5 ug/dl (4-22ug/dl). Repeat 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test: AM cortisol was 36.5 ug/dl (4-22 ug/dl), Dexamethasone 249.2 ng/dl (140-295 expected post 1 mg DXA the night before). 24 hr urine free cortisol was 391.4 (<=45.0 ug/d). Other endocrine labs were within normal limits. Left sided hypoenhancing lesion (2mmx2mmx2mm) consistent with pituitary microadenoma was seen on pituitary MRI. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling supported the presence of central disease and left pituitary location, concordant with the MRI. The time course from first clinical presentation to surgery was impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic temporarily halting elective surgical treatments and her access to care. At August, 2020 pre-op evaluation, the COVID-19 nasopharyngeal PCR was positive. Surgery was rescheduled. She denied symptoms of COVID-19 but recalled community exposure, including known COVID-19 positive contacts, while working as a waitress. Discussion: Increased susceptibility to and increased severity of COVID-19 manifestations might be feared in Cushing disease patients due to Cushing disease-associated immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity and venous thromboembolism. In contrast, randomized control trials have shown glucocorticoids, at doses sufficient to produce iatrogenic Cushing syndrome, may improve mortality in COVID-19 patients. Although asymptomatic COVID-19 infection is known to occur in young adults, the finding of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive test in a young woman with untreated Cushing disease also raises the possibility that endogenous hypercortisolism confers a similar benefit against severe manifestations of COVID-19 infection.","output":"COVID-19 and Cushing Disease: A Protective or a Deadly Combination?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has presented as a grim and complex situation recently.

It may be caused by a viral infection or a post-viral inflammatory reaction, and many viruses have been linked to the disease. We present case of atypical thyroiditis associated with COVID-19 infection. Case Report: 27-year-old female with no significant past medical history apart from recent COVID-19 infection is referred to endocrinology for evaluation of abnormal thyroid function test. Patient states around three months ago she was experiencing the symptoms like unintentional weight loss, nausea, palpitation, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue similar to symptoms she experienced 9 years ago while she was pregnant with her daughter so she thought she is pregnant again and visited her gynecologist. But patient had pregnancy test was done and she was found to be negative but her thyroid function test showed low TSH 0.32mIU/ml (0.47-4.68mIU/ml). Patient states around same time she was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and she lost 5 pounds during that time but even after recovery from the infection she continued to lose weight and lost a total of 18 pounds in 3 months. Patient states during the time of COVID-19 infection she was having difficulty swallowing and painful swallowing but following infection patient denied any current difficulty swallowing or breathing, headache, vision changes, cold or heat intolerance, diarrhea or constipation, tremors, proximal muscle weakness, bulging of her eyes.

These sampling periods coincided with times before and during the lockdown in industrial activity and reduced agricultural activity that occurred in the region due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of reduced anthropogenic activity on groundwater quality. Approximately 17% of the wells affected by high fluoride concentrations in the post-monsoon period returned to levels suitable for human consumption in samples collected in the pre-monsoon period. This was probably due to ion exchange processes, infiltration of rainwater during the seasonal monsoon that diluted concentrations of ions including geogenic fluoride, as well as a reduction in anthropogenic inputs during the lockdown. The total hazard index for fluoride in the post-monsoon samples calculated for children, adult women, and adult men indicated that 73%, 60%, and 50% of the groundwater samples, respectively, had fluoride levels higher than the permissible limit. In this study, nitrate pollution declined by 33.4% by the pre-monsoon period relative to the post-monsoon period. The chemical facies of groundwater reverted from the Na-HCO3-Cl and Na-Cl to the Ca-HCO3 type in pre-monsoon samples. Various geogenic indicators like molar ratios, inter-ionic relations along with graphical tools demonstrated that plagioclase mineral weathering, carbonate dissolution, reverse ion exchange, and anthropogenic inputs are influencing the groundwater chemistry of this region. These findings were further supported by the saturation index assessed for the post- and pre-monsoon samples. COVID-19 lockdown considerably reduced groundwater pollution by Na+, K+, Cl-, NO3, and F- ions due to shutdown of industries and reduced agricultural activities. Further groundwater quality improvement during lockdown period there is evidence that the COVID-19 lockdown by increased HCO3 ion concentration.

COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world with the number of infected cases increased to 54.4 million with 1.32 million deaths. Different types of statistical models have been developed to predict viral infection and multiple studies have compared the performance of these predictive models, but results were not consistent. This study aimed to develop and provide easy to use model to predict the Covid-19 infection severity in the patients and to help understanding the patients condition. METHODS: This study analyzed simulated data obtained from the large database for 340 patients with an active Covid-19 infection. The study identified predictors of Covid-19 outcomes that may be measured in two different ways: the total T-cell levels in the blood with T-cell subsets and number of cells in the blood infected with virus. All measures are relatively unobtrusive as they only require a blood sample, however there is a significant laboratory cost implications for measuring the number of cells infected with virus. This study used methodological approach using two different methods showing how multiple regression and logistic regression can be used in the context of Covid-19 longitudinal data to develop the prediction models. RESULTS: This study has identified the predictors of Covid-19 infection outcomes and developed prediction models. In the regression model of Total_T Cell, the predictors BMI, comorbidity and Total_Tcell were all associated with increased levels of infection severity (p < 0.001). For BMI, the mean % of unhealthy cells increased by 0.42 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.60) and comorbidity predictor has on average 8.3% more unhealthy liver cells than without comorbidity (95% CI C 2.9% - 1.29%). The results of multivariate logistic regression model predicting the Covid-19 Infection severity were promising. The significant predictors were observed such as Age (OR 0.95, p = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.91 C 0.99), Helper T_cells (OR O.93, p = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.87 C 0.99), Basic_Tcell (OR 1.11, p = 0.001, 95% CI: 1.06 -1.71) and Comorbidity (OR 0.41, p = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.16 C 1.07). CONCLUSIONS: In this study recommendation has been provided to clinical researchers on the best way to use the various Covid-19 infections measures along with identifying other possible predictors of Covid-19 infection.

In this setting, the SARS-CoV-2 infection screening retains a great value. However, there are still limited data on the feasibility and efficacy of combined screening procedures to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including asymptomatic cases) in cancer outpatients undergoing antineoplastic therapy. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: From May 1, 2020, to June 15, 2020, during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 860 consecutive patients, undergoing active anticancer therapy, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a combined screening procedure, including a self-report questionnaire, a molecular nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and a rapid serological immunoassay (for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies). The primary endpoint of the study was to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including asymptomatic cases) in consecutive and unselected cancer outpatients by a combined screening modality. A total of 2955 SARS-CoV-2 NPS and 860 serological tests, in 475 patients with hematologic cancers and in 386 with solid tumors, were performed. A total of 112 (13%) patients self-reported symptoms potentially COVID-19 related. In 1/860 cases (< 1%) SARS-CoV-2 NPS was positive and in 14 cases (1.62%) the specific serological test was positive (overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection 1.62%). Of the 112 cases who declared symptoms potentially COVID-19-related, only 2.7% (3/112) were found SARS-CoV-2 positive. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study reporting the feasibility of a combined screening procedure (including triage, NPS and serologic test) to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients receiving active therapy, during the first epidemic wave and under the restrictive lockdown measures, in one of the active areas of the SARS-CoV-2 circulation. Lacking specific recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, a combined diagnostic screening might be more effective to detect the exact prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in neoplastic patient population. The prevalence can obviously change according to the territorial context, the entity of the restrictive measures adopted and the phase of the epidemic curve. However, its exact and real-time knowledge could be important to balance risks/benefits of oncologic treatments, avoiding (if the prevalence is low) the reduction of dose intensity or the selection of less intensive (but also less effective) anti-cancer therapies.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in 860 cancer patients with a combined screening procedure including triage, molecular nasopharyngeal swabs and rapid serological test.

An evaluation of the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with respect to a broad range of potential adverse events is needed. METHODS: We used data from the largest health care organization in Israel to evaluate the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. For each potential adverse event, in a population of persons with no previous diagnosis of that event, we individually matched vaccinated persons to unvaccinated persons according to sociodemographic and clinical variables. Risk ratios and risk differences at 42 days after vaccination were derived with the use of the KaplanCMeier estimator. To place these results in context, we performed a similar analysis involving SARS-CoV-2Cinfected persons matched to uninfected persons. The same adverse events were studied in the vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection analyses. RESULTS: In the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884,828 persons. Vaccination was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44; risk difference, 2.7 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.6), lymphadenopathy (risk ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.05 to 2.78; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 64.1 to 89.3), appendicitis (risk ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.01; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.9), and herpes zoster infection (risk ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.73; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 8.2 to 24.2).

It is used in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant gram-positive organisms. However, acute eosinophilic pneumonitis (AEP) remains a rare life-threatening adverse effect of daptomycin therapy. Case-A 65-year-old gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus presented with palpitations, dyspnea, and lethargy for four days. He did not have any fever but noted occasional nonproductive cough. He was discharged a week prior after a two-week hospitalization where he underwent treatment for MRSA septic knee arthritis, which was complicated by MRSA bacteremia and COVID-19 pneumonia. He was discharged on daptomycin and ceftaroline maintenance therapy. He was afebrile, but had tachycardia, tachypnea, and was hypoxic to 88% on room air. Pulmonary examination revealed bibasal decreased breath sounds. Investigations were notable for leukocytosis with peripheral eosinophilia of 27%. COVID-19 testing was negative twice. His chest-Xray revealed patchy bilateral opacities (Fig-1A), similar to his prior admission (Fig-1B). A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram showed bilateral, multifocal, irregular opacities (Fig-1C). Supplemental oxygen was started and daptomycin was promptly discontinued. Intravenous methylprednisolone was also initiated. Over the next two days, the patient improved significantly, was weaned off supplemental oxygen, and peripheral eosinophilia also improved. He was discharged after four days, on a prednisone taper and only ceftaroline was completed for a total of eight weeks. Discussion-Daptomycin induced AEP may present with dyspnea, fever, peripheral eosinophilia and bilateral multifocal pulmonary infiltrates, commonly within two to four weeks of drug exposure. 25% or more eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage specimen is very specific. This adverse effect of daptomycin appears to be more time-dependent than dose-dependent. Daptomycin is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant, and this altered lipid biochemistry may precipitate T-helper-2 cell-mediated interleukin-5 elaboration. This triggers eosinophil recruitment and their pulmonary migration, resulting in the characteristic pulmonary inflammatory response. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. We considered other differentials, including fungal or parasitic infections, recent COVID-19 pneumonia, and vasculitides;however, considering our patient's compatible presentation, and with a Naranjo algorithm score of six, daptomycin induced AEP was hypothesized to be the probable etiology. Management involves early recognition and discontinuation of daptomycin, with corticosteroids being used often to augment clinical recovery. The rarity of the presentation necessitates awareness and vigilance, as early discontinuation often results in an excellent prognosis and leads to future avoidance of daptomycin, whereas a missed diagnosis may be life-threatening.","output":"A case of daptomycin induced acute eosinophilic pneumonia in a patient with septic arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global health emergencies ? like COVID-19 ? pose major and recurring threats in the 21st century.

However, various threats/hazards could lead to disruption and failure of developing CIs resilience, which inevitably can lead to negative repercussions to humanity and national economy. In this regard, detailed understanding of the threats/hazards and their impacts are critical to improve a countrys preparedness for unexpected situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to conduct a critical analysis of the potential threats to governments efforts and capacity to build CI resilience. A three-stage systematic review process is adopted and a total of 35 papers are carefully selected. Results show that during the past two decades, researchers interest in exploring the threats/hazards in CIs resilience has increased. Further, most of the research publications emanate from the United States and United Kingdom. Lastly, a total of 31 threats/hazards are identified, with the most reported threats/hazards being: (1) natural disasters, (2) ageing and decay, (3) cyber threats, (4) terrorist activities, (5) contamination and (6) cascading failure/threat. The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future research on developing CIs resilience.

However, massive carbon emission during port operating aggravates the atmospheric pollution in port cities. Capturing characteristics of port carbon emission is vital to reduce GHG (greenhouse gas) in the maritime realm as well as to achieve Chinas carbon neutral objective. In this work, an integrated framework is proposed for exploring the driving factors of China ports emissions combined with stochastic effects on population, affluence and technology regression (STIRPAT), Global Malmquist-Luenberger (GML) and multiple linear regression (MLR). The port efficiency is estimated for each port and the potential driving factors of carbon emission are explored. The results indicate that port carbon emissions have a strong connection with port throughput, productivity, containerization and intermodal transshipment. It is worth noting that the containerization ratio and port physical facility with fossil-free energy improvement have positively correlated with carbon emissions. However, the specific value of waterborne transshipment shows a complex impact on carbon dioxide emission as the ratio increases. The findings reveal that China port authorities need to improve containerization ratio and develop intermodal transportation;meanwhile, it is responsible for port authorities to update energy use and improve energy efficiency in ways to minimize the proportion of non-green energy consumption in accordance with optimizing port operation management including peak shaving and intelligent management systems under a new horizon of clean energy and automatic equipment.","output":"Chinas Port Carbon Emission Reduction: A Study of Emission-Driven Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Writing diagnostic reports for medical images is a heavy and tedious work. The automatic generation of medical image diagnostic reports can assist doctors to reduce their workload and improve diagnosis efficiency. It is of great significance to introduce image caption algorithm into medical image processing. Existing approaches attempt to generate medical image diagnostic reports using image caption algorithms but without taking the accuracy of pathological information in generated diagnostic reports into account. METHODS: To solve the mentioned problem, we propose a Semantic Fusion Network (SFNet) including a lesion area detection model and a diagnostic generation model. The lesion area detection model can extract visual and pathological information from medical image, and the diagnostic report generation model can learn to fuse the two kinds of information to generate reports. Thus, the pathological information in the generated diagnostic reports can be more accurate. RESULTS: Experimental results have verified the performance of our model (Accuracy increases 1.2% on the Ultrasound Image Dataset and 2.4% on the Open-i X-ray Image Dataset), compared with the model only using visual feature to generate diagnostic reports. CONCLUSIONS: This work utilizes computer algorithms to generate the more accurate diagnostic reports for medical images automatically, which expands the application of computer-aided diagnosis and promotes the implementation of deep learning in the medical image analysis field.","output":"Generating diagnostic report for medical image by high-middle-level visual information incorporation on double deep learning models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mexico has been one of the most affected countries by COVID-19, with case rate of 1195.32 per 100,000 patients and one of the highest mortality rates worldwide.

On top of this, recent estimates suggest that 4.1% of the population has diabetes but does not have a proper diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective study in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in tertiary private hospital in Mexico City from March 15(th) to July 10(th), 2020. We classified patients as having diabetes or prediabetes if it was registered in the electronical medical record. Patients were classified as newly diagnosed diabetes if they had an HbA1c on admission greater or equal than 6.5%. A total of 144 measurements of HbA1c were done on non-diabetic patients. Eighteen patients (12.5%) had a level of HbA1c equal or higher than 6.5%, while 70 (48.6%) patients had a level between 5.7% and 6.5%. Of the patients with HbA1c levels suggesting prior diabetes, 9 (50%) of them did not have hyperglycemia (>140 mg/dl) on admission. Our findings suggest that Mexican patients with COVID-19 might need HbA1c measurements regardless of glucose levels on admission since unknown diabetes is frequent and might modify in-hospital glucose management and discharge follow up and treatment.","output":"Proportion of Patients With HbA1c Corresponding to Prediabetes and Diabetes Ranges Without Previous Diagnosis in a Covid-19 Unit in Mexico City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the non-random association between alleles at different loci. Assessing LD in thousands of genomes and/or millions of single-nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs) exhibits excessive time and memory requirements that can potentially hinder future large-scale genomic analyses. To this end, we introduce qLD (quickLD) (https://github.com/StrayLamb2/qLD), a highly optimized open-source software that assesses LD based on Pearson's correlation coefficient. qLD exploits the fact that the computational kernel for calculating LD can be cast in terms of dense linear algebra operations. In addition, the software employs memory-aware techniques to lower memory requirements, and parallel GPU architectures to further shorten analysis times. qLD delivers up to 5x faster processing than the current state-of-the-art software implementation when run on the same CPU, and up to 29x when computation is offloaded to a GPU. Furthermore, the software is designed to quantify allele associations between arbitrarily distant loci in a time- and memory-efficient way, thereby facilitating the evaluation of long-range LD and the detection of co-evolved genes.

However, very limited information is available concerning impact of co-presence of plastics and antibiotics on environment and human health. Moreover, the potential ingestion and inhalation of nano(micro)plastics due to the disposable materials has dramatically increased. With the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 in the world, disposable surgical masks and plastic bottles have been widely used by the public, and their rapid use and improper dispensing can cause to increase plastic pollution risk on human.

The results showed that antimicrobial efficiencies of the tested antibiotics were reduced (approximately 10-98%) with the plastics. Moreover, the biochemical pathways of the microbial activity changed by the plastics entrance. Polymer structure and sorption play the role on the reduction in the inhibition of pathogens.

However, the underlying cellular mechanisms that regulate expression of IL-10 in different T cell subpopulations are not yet fully elucidated. We recently showed that TNF inhibitors (TNFi) promote IL-10 expression in human CD4(+) T cells, including IL-17(+) CD4(+) T cells. Here, we further characterized the regulation of IL-10 expression via blockade of TNF signaling or other cytokine/co-stimulatory pathways, in human T cell subpopulations. Addition of the TNFi drug adalimumab to anti-CD3-stimulated human CD4(+) T cell/monocyte cocultures led to increased percentages of IL-10(+) cells in pro-inflammatory IL-17(+), IFN(+), TNF(+), GM-CSF(+), and IL-4(+) CD4(+) T cell subpopulations. Conversely, exogenous TNF strongly decreased IL-10(+) cell frequencies. TNF blockade also regulated IL-10 expression in CD4(+) T cells upon antigenic stimulation. Using time course experiments in whole peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures, we show that TNF blockade maintained, rather than increased, IL-10(+) cell frequencies in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells following in vitro stimulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Blockade of IL-17, IFN, IL-6R, or CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation did not significantly regulate IL-10 expression within CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cell subpopulations. We show that TNF blockade acts directly on effector CD4(+) T cells, in the absence of monocytes or CD4(+) CD25(high)CD127(low) regulatory T cells and independently of IL-27, resulting in higher IL-10(+) frequencies after 3 days in culture. IL-10/IL-10R blockade reduced the frequency of IL-10-expressing cells both in the presence and absence of TNF blockade. Addition of recombinant IL-10 alone was insufficient to drive an increase in IL-10(+) CD4(+) T cell frequencies in 3-day CD4(+) T cell/monocyte cocultures, but resulted in increased IL-10 expression at later time points in whole PBMC cultures. Together, these data provide additional insights into the regulation of IL-10 expression in human T cells by TNF blockade. The maintenance of an IL-10(+) phenotype across a broad range of effector T cell subsets may represent an underappreciated mechanism of action underlying this widely used therapeutic strategy.","output":"TNF Blockade Maintains an IL-10(+) Phenotype in Human Effector CD4(+) and CD8(+) T Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are common but difficult to manage since accurate tools for diagnosing malignancy are unavailable.

Collected from a comprehensive literature search, the articles included in this analysis must report malignancy cases (high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and invasive carcinoma (IC)) and MPD diameter so that two MPD cut-offs could be created. The sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios of the two cutoffs for predicting malignancy were calculated. A review of 1493 articles yielded 20 retrospective studies with 3982 resected cases.

PURPOSE To analyze the influence of zirconia implant topography on first bone implant contact (fBIC). MATERIALS AND METHODS In a prospective two-center cohort investigation 63 zirconia implants were evaluated at implant placement, prosthetic delivery, 1, 3, and 5 years. The distance (DIB) between implant shoulder and fBIC was measured at each time point in periapical radiographs at mesial and distal sites. Two-way ANOVA/Bonferroni was used to analyze the effects of time and center ( < 0.05). RESULTS Between the centers, the mean DIB varied significantly at implant placement (Freiburg [FR]: 1.4  0.6 mm; Zurich [ZH]: 0.8  0.5 mm). Thereafter, no statistically significant difference in DIB was observed, neither between centers nor between time points (prosthetic delivery: FR: 1.9  0.6 mm, ZH: 1.7  0.8 mm; 1 year: FR: 1.8  0.6 mm, ZH: 1.6  0.8 mm; 3 years: FR: 1.9  0.8 mm, ZH: 1.7  0.8 mm; 5 years: FR: 1.9  0.8 mm, ZH 1.8  0.6 mm). The overall mean DIB at prosthetic delivery to 5 years of both centers (1.8  0.7 mm) is located within the transition zone between the smooth neck and the moderately rough intraosseous part (1.6-2.0 mm from the implant shoulder). However, individual DIB values are ranging from 0.1 to 4.2 mm overlapping the transition zone. CONCLUSIONS The standard deviation of the DIB indicates that the fBIC establishes on moderately rough and smooth surfaces. Consequently, soft tissue adapts to both topographies as well.","output":"Influence of zirconia implant surface topography on first bone implant contact within a prospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is nowhere near over.

Utilizing technology to provide education via phone/smartphone, video/audio, web, text message, mobile apps, or a combination of these methods can help improve patient access and clinical outcomes, cut costs, and close gaps in care. METHODS: While numerous publications have summarized the various tools and technologies available for capturing remote clinical data and their relevance to diabetes care and self-management, this review focuses on self-educational telehealth tools available for diabetes self-management, their advantages and disadvantages, and factors that need to be considered prior to implementation. Recent relevant studies indexed by PubMed were included. RESULTS: The widespread use and popularity of phones/smartphones, tablets, computers, and the Internet by patients of all age groups, cultures, socioeconomic and geographic areas allow for increased outreach, flexibility, and engagement with diabetes education, either in combination or as an adjunct to traditional in-person visits. Demonstrated benefits of using health technologies for diabetes self-management education include improved lifestyle habits, reduced hemoglobin A1C levels, decreased health care costs, and better medication adherence. Potential drawbacks include lack of regulation, need for staff training on methodologies used, the requirement for patients to be tech savvy, privacy concerns, lag time with technology updates/glitches, and the need for more long-term research data on efficacy.

The recent surges associated with the spread of the delta variant in the U.S., coupled with political resistance to effective public health mitigation strategies, indicate that the risks experienced early in the pandemic are not likely to abate soon. This study sought to better understand the experiences, thoughts, concerns, and recommendations of HWs during one of the first major surges in the U.S. and to explore how these experiences might inform efforts to mitigate potential ongoing COVID-related negative health and psychological impacts on HWs. METHODS: HWs were recruited using a multi-faceted approach tailored to public health mitigation guidelines. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via video conference with front line HWs, support staff, and opioid use disorder service organization providers between April 1 and July 9, 2020 using the Social-Ecological Model as a framework. Interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed; transcripts were analyzed inductively and deductively using thematic analytic methods, generating major themes and subthemes. RESULTS: A total of 22 HWs participated in the study; 14 were female; 3 identified as a member of a racial or ethnic minority population.

This paper describes my experience of flipping an online classroom for a core Chemical Engineering Fluid Mechanics class to promote student engagement and collaboration in an online setting. Comparing exam scores with prior semesters involving in-person, traditional lecture-style classes suggests students need a certain degree of adjustment to adapt to this new learning mode. A decrease in Student Rating of Teaching (SRT) scores indicates that students largely prefer in-person, traditional lectures over an online flipped class, even though written comments in the SRT contained several responses favorable to flipping the class in an online setting. Overall, SRT scores on a department level also showed a similar decrease, which suggests students were less satisfied with the quality of teaching overall throughout the department, with this flipped method of instruction neither improving nor worsening student sentiment towards online learning. In addition, whereas most students liked the pre-recorded lecture videos, they were less enthusiastic about using breakout rooms to encourage student collaboration and discussion. Further thought and discussion on best practices to facilitate online student interaction and collaboration are recommended, as online learning will likely continue to grow in popularity even when in-person instruction resumes after the pandemic.","output":"Pandemic-Driven Online Teaching - the Natural Setting for a Flipped Classroom?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To provide guidance on the implementation of recommended American College of Rheumatology (ACR) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity and functional status assessment measures in telehealth settings.

The optimal supplement pattern of trace mineral also impacts the digestion and absorption in the body. For ducks, the limited knowledge of trace element requirements puzzled duck production. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of dietary inclusions of coated and uncoated trace minerals on duck growth performance, tissue mineral deposition, serum antioxidant status, and intestinal microbiota profile. A total of 1,080 14-day-old Cherry Valley male ducks were randomly divided into six dietary treatment groups in a 2 (uncoated or coated trace minerals)  3 (300, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg supplementation levels) factorial design. Each treatment was replicated 12 times (15 birds per replicate). Coated trace minerals significantly improved average daily gain (p < 0.05), increased Zn, Se, and Fe content of serum, liver, and muscle, increased serum antioxidant enzyme (p < 0.05) and decreased the excreta Fe, Zn, and Cu concentrations. Inclusions of 500 mg/kg of coated trace minerals had a similar effect on serum trace minerals and tissue metal ion deposition as the 1,000 mg/kg inorganic trace minerals. Higher concentrations of Lactobacillus, Sphaerochatea, Butyricimonas, and Enterococcus were found in birds fed with coated trace minerals. In conclusion, diets supplemented with coated trace minerals could reduce the risk of environmental contamination from excreted minerals without affecting performance. Furthermore, coated trace minerals may improve the bioavailability of metal ions and the colonization of probiotic microbiota to protect microbial barriers and maintain gut health.","output":"Comparison of Coated and Uncoated Trace Minerals on Growth Performance, Tissue Mineral Deposition, and Intestinal Microbiota in Ducks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Letter to the Editor","output":"COVID-19: indexed data speed up solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The effect of COVID-19 on pediatric trauma rates is still largely under investigation. With the potential need to reallocate human and financial resources at this challenging time, it will be useful to have detailed descriptions of the rates of pediatric trauma and understanding of how the pandemic affects these rates. Questions/Purposes: We sought to describe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of acute pediatric trauma admissions and procedures performed in a level-I trauma center in Cork University Hospital, Ireland. Methods: We compared the number of acute traumatic pediatric admissions and procedures that occurred during the first 4 weeks of a nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 with that of the same 4-week period in each of the preceding 11 years. Seasonal variables were measured and controlled for using multivariate regression analysis. Results: A total of 545 pediatric patients (under 16 years of age) were included. Over 12 years, the lowest number of acute traumatic pediatric admissions and procedures was recorded during the 2020 pandemic. There was a significant correlation between the number of school days and the number of acute traumatic admissions, as well as the procedures performed. The relationship between the number of school days and the number of trauma procedures was evident even when controlling for confounder variables of seasonal variation. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the number of acute traumatic pediatric admissions and procedures performed in our level-I trauma center, likely because of a reduction in school days. With the reopening of schools, playgrounds, and sporting events, an increase in pediatric trauma admissions is anticipated. The results of this study can help prepare institutions and regulatory bodies to plan appropriately for this new phase.","output":"Pediatric Trauma and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A 12-Year Comparison in a Level-1 Trauma Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the world health organization, the coronavirus epidemic threatens the world's health system every day Health resources in most countries are either insufficient or not fairly shared There are various problems such as the number of health personnel, the number of beds, or the number of intensive care units Using limited resources at the optimum level is the key to the country's health systems to overcome this epidemic Disease detection is an important factor in preventing the epidemic The higher the success, the more controlled the spread of the virus Whether the person has a virus or not is usually done by the PCR test In addition to the PCR method, chest X-ray images can be classified with deep learning methods Deep learning methods have become popular in academic studies by processing multi-layered images in one go and by defining manually entered parameters in machine learning This popularity reflected positively on limited health datasets In this study, it was aimed to detect the disease of people whose X-rays were taken for suspected COVID-19 In such COVID-19 studies, a binary classification has generally been made The data set includes chest X-rays of patients with COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and healthy patients Before the classification process, the data augmentation method was applied to the data set These three groups have been classified through multi-class classification deep learning models ? 2020 IEEE","output":"COVID-19 Detection Using Deep Learning Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Communicating official public health information about infectious diseases is complicated by the fact that individuals receive much of their information from their social contacts, either via interpersonal interaction or social media, which can be prone to bias and misconception. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effect of public health campaigns and the effect of socially communicated health information on learning about diseases simultaneously. Although extant literature addresses the effect of one source of information (official or social) or the other, it has not addressed the simultaneous interaction of official information (OI) and social information (SI) in an experimental setting. METHODS: We used a series of experiments that exposed participants to both OI and structured SI about the symptoms and spread of hepatitis C over a series of 10 rounds of computer-based interactions. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a high, low, or control intensity of OI and to receive accurate or inaccurate SI about the disease. RESULTS: A total of 195 participants consented to participate in the study. Of these respondents, 186 had complete responses across all ten experimental rounds, which corresponds to a 4.6% (9/195) nonresponse rate. The OI high intensity treatment increases learning over the control condition for all symptom and contagion questions when individuals have lower levels of baseline knowledge (all P values .04). The accurate SI condition increased learning across experimental rounds over the inaccurate condition (all P values .01). We find limited evidence of an interaction between official and SI about infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This project demonstrates that exposure to official public health information increases individuals knowledge of the spread and symptoms of a disease. Socially shared information also facilitates the learning of accurate and inaccurate information, though to a lesser extent than exposure to OI. Although the effect of OI persists, preliminary results suggest that it can be degraded by persistent contradictory SI over time.","output":"Understanding the Relationship Between Official and Social Information About Infectious Disease: Experimental Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aims of the present study were to obtain sleep quality and sleep timing information in a group of university students, and to evaluate the effects of a circadian hygiene education initiative. All students of the University of Padova (approximately 64,000) were contacted by e-mail (major campaigns in October 2019 and October 2020) and directed to an ad hoc website for collection of demographics and sleep quality/timing information. Participants (n=5740) received one of two sets of circadian hygiene advice ('A regular life' or 'Bright days and dark nights'). Every month, they were then asked how easy it had been to comply, and provided with the advice again. At any even month from joining, they completed the sleep quality/timing questionnaires again. Information on academic performance was obtained post hoc, together with representative samples of lecture (n=5972) and exam (n=1800) timings, plus lecture attendances (n=25,302). 52% of students had poor sleep quality and 82% showed signs of sleep deprivation. Those who joined in October 2020, after several months of lockdown and distance learning, had better sleep quality, less sleep deprivation and later sleep habits. The 'Bright days and dark nights' advice resulted in earlier get-up time/midsleep compared to the 'A regular life' advice. Significant changes in most sleep quality and sleep timing variables were observed in both advice groups over time, also in relation to pandemic-related events characterising 2020.

PARTICIPANTS: Three focus group discussions were held involving (1) people with lived experience of multiple and complex needs (n=5); (2) front-line staff from health, social care and voluntary organisations that support multiple and complex needs groups (n=7); and (3) managers and commissioners of these organisations (n=9). RESULTS: Findings from this study provide valuable perspectives of people with multiple complex needs and those that provide them with support on what may be perceived factors underlying premature mortality. Mental ill health and substance misuse (often co-occurring dual diagnosis) were perceived as influencing premature mortality among multiple and complex needs groups. Perceptions of opportunities to identify people at risk included critical life events (eg, bereavement, relationship breakdown) and transitions (eg, release from prison, completion of drug treatment). Early prevention, particularly supporting young people experiencing adverse childhood experiences, was also highlighted as a priority. CONCLUSION: High mortality in multiple and complex needs groups may be reduced by addressing dual diagnosis, providing more support at critical life events and investing in early prevention efforts.

The chapter reviews the role of international development organizations advocating for and developing frameworks in support of climate change education. This is followed by an analysis of ongoing efforts of climate change education. The chapter argues that more effective education for climate change at the primary and secondary education levels around the world requires context specific strategies that align the specific learning outcomes with the impacts of climate change in that context. Implementing those strategies requires the development of institutional capacity in schools that is aligned to the stage of institutional development of the school. The chapter explains how a multidisciplinary framework that accounts for the cultural, psychological, professional, institutional and political dimensions of the change process can support the development of collaboration and coherence in implementing those climate change education strategies. Those strategies need to also specify the particular populations that need to develop such competencies and the optimal means of delivery. The chapter also situates the literature on climate change education within the larger context of the literature on deeper learning, twenty first century skills and education system change, explaining how deeper learning in climate change education might influence attitudes and behaviors in ways that prevailing didactic approaches focused principally on the transmission of scientific knowledge do not. To develop such context specific climate change education strategies and to build the institutional capacity to implement them, the chapter makes the case for more intentional engagement of universities, in partnership with schools and non-formal education organizations. This would serve the dual role of providing support for schools in advancing climate change education, while also educating higher education students on climate change through problem based, participatory and contextually situated approaches.","output":"The Role of Universities Building an Ecosystem of Climate Change Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study in this study wanted to know about the leadership role of the Quadruple Helix in COVID-19 non-natural Disaster Management in Mataram City, West Nusa Tenggara Province.

A built-in tablet computer controls instrumental parameters and chromatogram display functions. The compact GC with dimensions of 35 cm (l)  26 cm (w)  15 cm (h) is self-contained, weighing less than 5 kg without a battery pack, and uses no auxiliary compressed gases. Our design has three main advantages over conventional portable GCs: recharging configuration of ambient air as the carrier gas using a miniature diaphragm pump, precise control of column flow by the built-in canister and EPC system, and rapid thermal desorption of the preconcentrator facilitated by intrinsic resistivity of the carbon nanotube sponge. A 30 m, 0.28 mm I.D. capillary column operated at a head pressure of 14 psi provided a peak capacity of 55 for a 10 min isothermal analysis.

In contrast to other dental clinics, the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Germany) decided not to limit dental treatment to emergencies alone, but to continue dental care for all patients, with increased safety measures. As such, health care professionals may be exposed to additional physical and mental stress. The aim of this study was to assess the perspectives of all persons involved in dental care (dentists, dental assistants, students, and patients) regarding the aspects of safety measures, anxiety about self-infection and infecting others, and other prospects in the period March to December 2020 using a questionnaire. Data collection was performed between 14 December 2020 and 23 January 2021. A total of 35 dentists (response rate of 79.5%), 23 dental assistants (65.7%), 84 students (80%), and 51 patients (21.8%) completed the survey. The patients did not notice any changes in the care received. Dentists and dental assistants reported a higher workload due to additional safety measures. The majority of dentists, students, and patients agreed that normal patient care was maintained. One-third of dental assistants would have preferred emergency treatment alone and expressed significantly higher anxiety about COVID-19 infection than all other groups (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, all groups showed a predominantly positive perspective on dental care, and anxiety about self-infection and infecting others was especially low. However, additional measures are time-consuming and compound daily patient care. This concept, based on well-established infection control, might be a viable proposal for current and future pandemics.","output":"Perspectives from Dentists, Dental Assistants, Students, and Patients on Dental Care Adapted to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this article was to present the results of empirical research conducted in enterprises of all sizes operating in Poland and Central Europe The study focused on the impact of relational capital on the prevention of and intervention in the event of a crisis in a company The author assumes that there is a link between a companys relational capital and its susceptibility to crisis phenomena The research carried out allowed different conclusions to be drawn It turns out that the studied companies were characterized by a high level of relational capital Their internal relational capitalparticularly the relations between employees and company ownerswas especially important to them Relations of the surveyed companies with external stakeholders were also important In response to the question about the role of relational capital in anti\\\\crisis measures undertaken by companies, it appears that the relational capital of the companies surveyed allowed them, in their opinion, to avoid many crisis situations Thanks to the right attitudes of the surveyed companies stakeholders, they have often managed to avoid crises This situation also applies to the recent crisis caused by COVID\\\\19 ? 2021 by the author Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"The role of relational capital in anti\\\\crisis measures undertaken by companiesconclusions from a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oropouche fever is a zoonotic dengue-like syndrome caused by Oropouche virus.

Here, we reveal a draft genome of S. japonica, which was approximately 511.49 Mb long (contig N50 size of 17.34 Mb) based on Illumina, Nanopore and Hi-C data. We reliably assembled 110 contigs into 14 chromosomes, representing 91.62% of the total genome, with an improved N50 size of 31.32 Mb based on Hi-C data. Further investigation identified 271.76 Mb (53.13%) of repetitive sequences and 31,000 protein-coding genes, of which 30,721 (99.1%) were functionally annotated. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that S. japonica separated from Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine max about 107.53 and 61.24 million years ago, respectively. We detected evidence of species-specific and common-legume WGD events in S. japonica. We further found that multiple TF families (e.g., BBX and PAL) have expanded in S. japonica, which might have led to its enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress. In addition, S. japonica harbors more genes involved in the lignin and cellulose biosynthesis pathways than the other two species. Finally, population genomic analyses revealed no obvious differentiation among geographical groups and the effective population size continuously declined since 2 Ma. Our genomic data provide a powerful comparative framework to study the adaptation, evolution and active ingredients biosynthesis in S. japonica.

We assessed the association between chronic use of RAAS blockers and mortality among inpatients with COVID\\\\19 and explored reasons for discrepancies in the literature. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included adult hypertensive patients from a prospective nationwide cohort of 3512 inpatients with COVID\\\\19 up to June 30, 2020. Cox proportional hazard models with various adjustment or propensity weighting methods were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of 30\\\\day mortality for chronic users versus non\\\\users of RAAS blockers. We analyzed data of 1160 hypertensive patients: 719 (62%) were male and 777 (67%) were older than 65 years. The main comorbidities were diabetes (n = 416, 36%), chronic cardiac disease (n = 401, 35%), and obesity (n = 340, 29%); 705 (61%) received oxygen therapy. We recorded 135 (11.6%) deaths within 30 days of diagnosis.

The repeated cross-sectional study was conducted among university students from Germany, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Turkey, and Ukraine (W1: n = 1684; W2: n = 1741). Eight items measured exposure to COVID-19 (regarding COVID-19 symptoms, testing, hospitalizing quarantine, infected relatives, death of relatives, job loss, and worsening economic status due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Coronavirus-related PTSD risk was evaluated by PCL-S. The exposure to COVID-19 symptoms was higher during W2 than W1 among students from all countries, except Germany, where, in contrast, the increase in testing was the strongest. Students from Poland, Turkey, and the total sample were more frequently hospitalized for COVID-19 in W2. In these countries, and Ukraine, students were more often in quarantine. In all countries, participants were more exposed to infected friends/relatives and the loss of a family member due to COVID-19 in W2 than W1. The increase in job loss due to COVID-19 was only noted in Ukraine. Economic status during W2 only worsened in Poland and improved in Russia. This was due to the significant wave of restrictions in Russia and more stringent restrictions in Poland. The prevalence of coronavirus-related PTSD risk at three cutoff scores (25, 44, and 50) was 78.20%, 32.70%, and 23.10%, respectively. The prediction models for different severity of PTSD risk differed. Female gender, a prior diagnosis of depression, a loss of friends/relatives, job loss, and worsening economic status due to the COVID-19 were positively associated with high and very high coronavirus-related PTSD risk, while female gender, a prior PTSD diagnosis, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, testing for COVID-19, having infected friends/relatives and worsening economic status were associated with moderate risk.","output":"Exposure to COVID-19 during the First and the Second Wave of the Pandemic and Coronavirus-Related PTSD Risk among University Students from Six CountriesA Repeated Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The primary function of the patient portal is to give patients greater access to their personal health information.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify sociodemographic differences in patient portal use and examine factors affecting patient portal utilization following the final stage of the Meaningful Use program which aimed to promote the use of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. RESEARCH DESIGN: Survey data from Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5, cycles 1, 2, and 3 were analyzed. The sample included 8291 completed surveys. Multivariable logistic regression on a selected response for each surveyed question was used to assess the racial and ethnic difference after controlling for age, sex, income, and education. SUBJECTS: Subjects included English and Spanish speaking adults in the USA. MEASURES: Measures included assessment of patient portal use, patient portal access, understanding health information, usefulness of health records, and privacy and security. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, income, and education, there was a significant association between race/ethnicity and patient portal non-users responding, \\"no need to use online medical record\\" as the reason for not using the patient portal (P = 0.005). Among the portal users, there were significant associations between race/ethnicity and health care provider maintaining an EHR (P = 0.006), being offered access to their portal (P < 0.001), understanding health information in the portal (P = 0.004), finding the portal useful for health monitoring (P < 0.001), reporting concern about unauthorized access (P = 0.017), and keeping information from health care providers (P = 0.012).

Aims To describe the role of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) as the sole available non-invasive diagnostic test for symptomatic patients with suspected CAD in a hub center for cardiovascular emergencies in the presence of limited access to hospital facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Results From March 9th to April 30th, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a consecutive cohort of symptomatic patients with high clinical suspicion of CAD and clinical indication to CCTA were enrolled in a hub hospital in Milan, Italy. When obstructive coronary artery disease was detected (>70% diameter stenosis in a proximal coronary segment or >90% stenosis in any coronary segment) patients were referred to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Clinical follow-up was assessed in patients in whom ICA was considered deferrable. Overall, 58 consecutive patients were included. Ten (17.2%) symptomatic patients underwent ICA according to CCTA findings, while in 48 (82.8%) patients ICA was deferred. No clinical events were recorded after a mean follow-up of 49.7  16.8 days. In nine out of ten patients referred to ICA, severe coronary artery disease was confirmed and treated accordingly. Changes in medical therapy were significantly more prevalent in patients with vs. those without CAD at CCTA. CONCLUSION: We report a potential pivotal role for CCTA in the triage of non-COVID-19 patients with suspected CAD during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Methods An experiment in a 2  2 factorial design was conducted with two dietary intake levels (100% and 75% of nutrition recommendation) and two broiler chicken lines (fat and lean). Two lines of hens (n = 384 for each line) at 23th week of age were randomly divided into 4 treatments with 12 replicates of 16 birds. The experiment started at 27th week of age (5% egg rate) and ended at 54th week of age. Hatched eggs from the medium laying period were collected. Real time PCR analysis was used to analyse the MYOD1, MYF5 and MYF6 mRNA levels of E7, E9, E11, E13 and E15 body tissues and E17, E19 and E21 chest and thigh muscle samples. Results The results indicated that there were significant effects of line, dietary intake, and interactions between them on MYOD1, MYF5 and MYF6 gene mRNA expression levels in embryonic tissues. Low daily feed intake did not change the expression trend of MYOD1 mRNA in either line, but changed the peak values, especially in lean line. Low daily feed intake altered the trend in MYF5 mRNA expression level in both lines and apparently delayed its onset. There was no apparent effect of low daily feed intake on the trends of MYF6 mRNA expression levels in either line, but it significantly changed the values on many embryonic days. Conclusion Maternal nutrient restriction affects myogenesis and is manifested in the expression of embryonic MYOD1, MYF5, and MYF6 genes.

This study aimed at determining the mechanisms of myocardial localization and fast liver clearance of (99m)Tc-TMEOP. METHODS Subcellular distribution of (99m)Tc-TMEOP was determined in excised rat heart tissue by differential centrifugation. The effect of cyclosporin A on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of (99m)Tc-TMEOP was evaluated by both ex vivo biodistribution and in vivo planar imaging studies. RESULTS Subcellular distribution studies showed that more than 73% of (99m)Tc-TMEOP was associated with the mitochondrial fraction. Comparison with subcellular distribution of (99m)Tc-sestamibi showed no significant difference in the mitochondrial accumulation between the two tracers. Biodistribution studies in the presence of cyclosporin A revealed an increase in kidneys and liver uptake of (99m)Tc-TMEOP, suggesting the involvement of multidrug resistance transporters in determining its pharmacokinetic profile. CONCLUSIONS The heart uptake mechanism of (99m)Tc-TMEOP is similar to that of the other reported monocationic (99m)Tc cardiac agents and is associated with its accumulation in the mitochondria. Cyclosporin A studies indicate that the fast liver and kidney clearance kinetics is mediated by P-glycoprotein (Pgp), supporting the potential interest of this radiotracer for imaging Pgp function associated with multidrug-resistant tumours.","output":"Studies of the myocardial uptake and excretion mechanisms of a novel 99mTc heart perfusion agent."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 has impacted orthopaedic surgery worldwide.

The present study deals with psychiatric care provided to these patients by psychologists and psychiatrists working in the home office and in the clinic. Psychologists from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at LMU Munich, together with physicians working in the clinic, established telephone-based patient care for inpatients during the acute crisis in the home office during quarantine, in which 23 patients with depressive and schizophrenic disorders participated. Psychologists then worked in the hospital with 98 hospitalized patients. Current distress and its stresses were addressed and new therapeutic components were integrated into care. The feasibility of home office, its possibilities and limitations are presented. In this study, care concepts for hospitalized patients with affective and schizophrenic disorders as well as current stress factors and psychotherapeutic concepts will be addressed. The current approach was positively evaluated by patients and physicians and is thus promising in the current situation. With the exception of patients in the acute ward, all patients and even older ones benefited from this measure. During the crisis from March to August, all psychologists worked on full-time positions with the usual treatment frequency of 1-2 sessions a week, which was especially important for elderly individuals. During the acute COVID-19 crisis, there was a pause only in the treatment of ward-wide groups and family groups. Psychologists, like physicians and nurses, had a system-relevant role to play.","output":"[Inpatient Psychiatric Treatment in the Corona-crisis by Psychologists and Psychiatrists in Home-office and in the Clinic]./ Station?re psychiatrische Versorgung in der Corona-Krise durch Psychologen und Psychiater im Homeoffice und in der Klinik"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Previous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggest antibiotics for treating episodes of asthma-like symptoms in preschool children. Further, high-dose vitamin D supplementation has been shown to reduce the rate of asthma exacerbations among adults with asthma, while RCTs in preschool children are lacking. The aims of this combined RCT are to evaluate treatment effect of azithromycin on episode duration and the preventive effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on subsequent episodes of asthma-like symptoms among hospitalised preschoolers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Eligible participants, 1C5 years old children with a history of recurrent asthma-like symptoms hospitalised due to an acute episode, will be randomly allocated 1:1 to azithromycin (10 mg/kg/day) or placebo for 3 days (n=250). Further, independent of the azithromycin intervention participants will be randomly allocated 1:1 to high-dose vitamin D (2000 IU/day+ standard dose 400 IU/day) or standard dose (400 IU/day) for 1 year (n=320). Participants are monitored with electronic diaries for asthma-like symptoms, asthma medication, adverse events and sick-leave. The primary outcome for the azithromycin intervention is duration of asthma-like symptoms after treatment. Secondary outcomes include duration of hospitalisation and antiasthmatic treatment. The primary outcome for the vitamin D intervention is the number of exacerbations during the treatment period. Secondary outcomes include time to first exacerbation, symptom burden, asthma medication and safety. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The RCTs are approved by the Danish local ethical committee and conducted in accordance with the guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Danish Medicines Agency has approved the azithromycin RCT, which is monitored by the local Unit for Good Clinical Practice. The vitamin D RCT has been reviewed and is not considered a medical intervention. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences.

Based on citizens experiences when hospitalised for COVID-19, we explore how the opinions and concerns regarding healthcare automation could not be disassociated from a context of high pressure on the health system and lack of resources, and a political discourse on AI and robotics; a situation intensified by the pandemic. Thus, through the analysis of a set of interviews, a series of issues are identified that revolve around the following: the empirical effects of imagined robots, the vivid experience of citizens with the care crisis, the discomfort of the ineffective, the virtualised care assemblages, the human-based face-to-face relationships, and the automatisation of healthcare tasks. In light of these results, we show the variability in patients perspectives on AI and robotic systems and explain it by distinguishing two interpretive repertoires that account for different views and opinions: a well-being repertoire and a responsibility repertoire. Both interpretative repertoires are relevant in order to grasp the complexity of citizens approaches to automatisation of healthcare. Attending to both allows us to move beyond the dominant (political) discourse of technology markets as the only way to respond to healthcare challenges. Thus, we can analyse and integrate patients perspectives to develop AI and robotic systems in healthcare to serve citizens needs and collective well-being.","output":"Robots in Healthcare?

However, this test is associated with increased risks of viral dissemination and environmental contamination and shows relatively low sensitivity, attributable to technical deficiencies in the sampling method. Given that COVID-19 is transmitted via exhaled aerosols and droplets, and that exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is an established modality for sampling exhaled aerosols, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in EBC offers a promising diagnostic approach. However, current knowledge on the detection and load of the virus in EBC collected from COVID-19 patients remains limited and inconsistent. The objective of the study was to quantify the viral load in EBC collected from COVID-19 patients and to validate the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 detection from EBC as a diagnostic test for the infection. METHOD EBC samples were collected from 48 COVID-19 patients using a collection device, and viral loads were quantified by RT-PCR targeting the E gene. Changes in detection rates and viral loads relative to patient characteristics and days since disease onset were statistically evaluated. RESULTS Need for mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with higher viral load (p<0.05). Need for oxygen administration or mechanical ventilation, less than 3 days since onset, and presence of cough or fever were significantly associated with higher detection rates (p<0.05). Among spontaneously breathing patients, viral load in EBC attenuated exponentially over time. The detection rate was 86% at 2 days since onset and deteriorated thereafter. In mechanically ventilated patients, detection rate and viral load were high regardless of days since onset. CONCLUSION These results support the feasibility of using RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 from EBC for COVID-19 patients within 2 days of symptom onset.","output":"RT-PCR diagnosis of COVID-19 from exhaled breath condensate: a clinical study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Covid-19 is a betacoronavirus that was initially transmitted to humans from an animal host.

The objective of this research is to analyze the possible association between the structure of the population pyramid, the Gross Domestic Product, the type of isolation and screening used to detect Covid-19 in the countries with the highest and lowest mortality from this disease. Design and Methods: Some variables take part in the Covid- 19 mortality worldwide, such as the population structure, expressed in the population pyramid by country, the type of isolation adopted in each nation, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as the type of screening that is implemented in the different countries analyzed. Results: After analyzing the mean difference in the countries with a regressive and progressive population pyramid, an association was identified between the regressive population pyramid structure and the higher mortality rate (p<0.001).

We evaluated echocardiographic correlates of transplant-free survival, re-intervention, and left ventricular (LV) function in mid-term follow-up. METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included all infants with CAS who underwent Ross by 1 year of age from 1/2000 to 9/2018. Serial echocardiograms were analyzed for LV ejection fraction (EF) and systolic and diastolic longitudinal strain (LS). The primary outcome was mortality or transplant; secondary outcomes were re-intervention and abnormal LVEF (55%). RESULTS In 40 infants (30 [75%] male; median age at Ross 51 days) with median follow-up 3.3 years (interquartile range 1.0-9.4), the primary outcome was met in 11/40 (28%). Transplant-free survival was 79%, 77%, and 69% at 1, 5, and 10 years post Ross. Predictors of transplant or death included neonatal surgery, cross-clamp time, and pre-operative left atrial dilatation and lower LVEF. Median freedom from re-intervention was at 7.1 years post Ross, with no identified associations. LV LS improved 1 year post-Ross (-21.13.8% vs. -17.45.1%, p=0.02), although LVEF did not reach significance. Lower LVEF at 1 year was related to pre-Ross LA dilatation (p=0.02), abnormal LVEF (p=0.04), and lower early diastolic LS rate (p=0.03). LVEF remained stable 3-years post Ross. CONCLUSION Both transplant-free survival and normalization of LV function post Ross in infancy are associated with pre-operative LV systolic and diastolic measures, highlighting the prognostic value of echocardiography in this population.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical staff in Jilin Province, Northeast China. The Challenge and Hindrance-Related Self-Reported Stress scale, Short Form-8 Health Survey scale, Stanford Presenteeism Scale and Task Performance Scale were adopted to assess the work stress, health status, presenteeism and task performance of medical staff. RESULTS: A total of 4,347 questionnaires were distributed among medical staff, and 4261 were valid, for an effective rate of 98.02%. The mean scores for work stress, health status, presenteeism and task performance were 2.05  0.84, 4.18  0.68, 2.15  0.79 and 4.49  0.64, respectively. The ANOVA results showed that there were significant differences in the task performance scores between different genders, ages, marital statuses, professional titles, departments and work years (P < 0.05). Work stress ( = ?0.136, P < 0.001) and presenteeism ( = ?0.171, P < 0.001) were negative predictors of task performance. Health status ( = 0.10; P < 0.001) was positive predictor of task performance. Health status ( = ?0.070; P < ?0.001) and presenteeism ( = ?0.064; P < 0.001) mediated the relationship between work stress and task performance (P < 0.001). Presenteeism mediated the relationship between health status and task performance ( = 0.07; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Work stress and presenteeism had significant negative impact on the task performance of medical staff; health status had a significant positive effect on task performance. Meanwhile, health status and presenteeism played a mediating role in the relationship between work stress and task performance, and presenteeism played a mediating role in the relationship between health status and task performance. Reasonable assignment of tasks can reduce the work stress, but to improve the performance of medical staff, we should pay more attention on improving health, such as making health-related safeguard measures, raising awareness, building a platform, etc.","output":"Work Stress, Health Status and Presenteeism in Relation to Task Performance Among Chinese Medical Staff During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A major barrier to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) cure is the latent viral reservoir, which persists despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), including across the non-dividing myeloid reservoir which is found systemically in sanctuary sites across tissues and the central nervous system (CNS).

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are renewable substitutes to petroleum-based plastics with the ability to completely mineralize in soil, compost, and marine environments. The preferred choice of PHA synthesis is from bacteria or archaea. However, microbial production of PHAs faces a major drawback due to high production costs attributed to the high price of organic substrates as compared to synthetic plastics. As such, microalgal biomass presents a low-cost solution as feedstock for PHA synthesis. Photoautotrophic microalgae are ubiquitous in our ecosystem and thrive from utilizing easily accessible light, carbon dioxide and inorganic nutrients. Biomass production from microalgae offers advantages that include high yields, effective carbon dioxide capture, efficient treatment of effluents and the usage of infertile land. Nevertheless, the success of large-scale PHA synthesis using microalgal biomass faces constraints that encompass the entire flow of the microalgal biomass production, i.e., from molecular aspects of the microalgae to cultivation conditions to harvesting and drying microalgal biomass along with the conversion of the biomass into PHA.

Adrenal insufficiency carries the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening adrenal crisis. Our study evaluated the prevalence, characteristics and recovery of patients with underlying rheumatology conditions who had received prolonged glucocorticoid treatment. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 238 patients, managed in accordance with current nationally and internationally accepted clinical guidelines. Data collected included patient demographics, historical steroid data, 09.00h cortisol/short synacthen test (SST) results and follow-up data on those with repeat assessments. RESULTS Overall, 65% of our cohort had a 09.00h cortisol <350nmol/l. On SST, 43% of patients demonstrated evidence of possible tertiary adrenal insufficiency. Prednisolone equivalent dose at time of SST was significantly higher in the group who failed SST versus those who passed; mean of 5.57mg versus 3.59mg (p= 0.005). 09.00h cortisol result correlated with 30-minute cortisol on SST (R2 = 0.20, p=0.002). 0-minute cortisol on SST correlated more strongly with 30-minute cortisol than 09.00h cortisol (R2 = 0.59, p-value <0.001). Patients with 0-minute cortisol >350nmol/L, all passed their SST. Patients who remained on prednisolone were more likely to recover (71%) versus those switched to hydrocortisone (27%), p= 0.02. Peak steroid dose was predictive of recovery; significantly lower in those who recovered (mean of 22.3mg versus 33.8mg, p= 0.03). Steroid duration was not found to be a predictor of recovery [recovery (64.2 months) versus non-recovery (55.6 months), p= 0.58]. There was no correlation found to outcome on SST with age, sex, peak steroid dose, steroid duration, underlying rheumatological condition, additional exogenous steroid use or serum sodium. CONCLUSION 43% of our patients demonstrated sub-optimal adrenal function on SST. Steroid dose at the time of SST was the only significant predictive risk factor for tertiary adrenal insufficiency. 09.00h cortisol demonstrated good correlation with outcome on SST and could represent a valid screening test to reduce need for SST if 09.00h >350nmol/L. Further prospective data is required to further characterise risk factors, predictive features of recovery and establish optimal management strategy of steroids (prednisolone vs hydrocortisone) to encourage adrenal recovery.","output":"Evaluating tertiary adrenal insufficiency in rheumatology patients on long-term systemic glucocorticoid treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells have a recognised innate-like capacity for antibacterial host defence, consequent on the specificity of their T cell receptor (TCR) for small molecule metabolites produced by a range of prokaryotic and fungal species, their effector memory phenotype, and their expression of cytotoxic molecules.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved 80 patients scheduled for PHF surgery who were randomized to receive either IC block (combined interscalene brachial plexus with superficial cervical plexus block) or ICTP block (T2 TPVB supplemented with IC block). The primary outcome was the success rate of regional anesthesia. The patient who experienced incomplete block was administered with intravenous remifentanil for rescue, or conversion to general anesthesia (GA) if remifentanil was still ineffective. Secondary outcomes included requirements of rescue anesthesia, sensory block of the surgical region, the incidence of adverse reactions, and block procedure-related complications. RESULTS: The success rate of regional anesthesia in the ICTP group was higher compared with the IC group (77.5 vs. 52.5%, p = 0.019). Intravenous remifentanil was required in 32.5% of patients in the IC group and 17.5% in the ICTP group, respectively. Conversion to GA was performed in 15% of patients in the IC group and 5% in the ICTP group. Sensory block at the medial proximal upper arm was achieved in 85% of patients in the ICTP group, whereas 10% in the IC group (p < 0.001). There was no difference between the groups with respect to the incidence of intraoperative adverse reactions. No block-related complications occurred in either group. CONCLUSION: Adding a T2 TPVB is helpful to decrease, but not absolutely avoid the occurrence of incomplete regional anesthesia during PHF surgery in elderly patients.

CASE SUMMARY: We report here a rare and catastrophic complication of use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs in a case undergoing coronary angioplasty. The patient had multiple coronary risk factors and developed acute myocardial infarction with pulmonary oedema and hypotension during hospitalization for treatment of lower respiratory tract infection and diabetic ketoacidosis. He underwent successful angioplasty of the culprit vessel but later developed hypotension attributable to retroperitoneal haemorrhage. No bleeding site was identified despite extensive evaluation of the aorta and iliac vessels. DISCUSSION: A diagnosis of SRH is considered when a patient on anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs develops retroperitoneal haemorrhage without any specific identifiable site of bleeding in the retroperitoneum. Diffuse vasculopathy and atherosclerosis or vasculitis of the small vessels in the retroperitoneum may result in rupture of the most friable vessels and result in bleeding. Intense cough, forceful vomiting or sneezing may also be responsible for traumatizing the vessels and resulting in bleeding. Most cases recover with conservative management but some may benefit from interventional occlusion of the leak or surgical decompression in cases of abdominal compartment syndrome.","output":"Spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage post-coronary angioplasty: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of reduced port laparoscopic surgery (RPS) has become increasingly popular.

Few up-to-date studies have actually assessed the impact of COVID-19 on emergency surgeries. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the pandemic relating to the emergency surgery performed, as well as morbidity and mortality rates during the first year of the pandemic (March 2020CFebruary 2021) and during the control period. In this period, the first propaedeutic surgery department and the third surgery department of the University General Hospital of Thessaloniki AHEPA in Greece provided continuous emergency general surgery services. Material and Methods: The study is in a retrospective cohort and included patients who were admitted to the Emergency Department and underwent emergency general surgery during the control period (n = 456), March 2019CFebruary 2020 and during the first year of the pandemic (n = 223), March 2020CFebruary 2021. Gender, age, type of surgical operation (morbidity), ICU need, the patients outcome, and days of hospitalization were compared. Results: A total of 679 emergency surgeries were included. Statistically significant differences emerged between the two time periods in the total number of emergency surgeries performed (p < 0.001). The most common type of surgery in the control period was associated with soft tissue infection while, during the pandemic period, the most common type of surgery was associated with the hepatobiliary system. In addition, the mortality rates nearly doubled during the pandemic period (2.2% vs. 4%). Finally, the mean age of our sample was 50.6  17.5 and the majority of the participants in both time periods were males. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic changed significantly the total number of emergency general surgeries performed.

This systematic and Meta-Analysis was intended to provide evidence on the global prevalence and determinants of case cancellation on the intended day of surgery. Methods Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/Medline; Science direct and LILACS from January 2010 to May 2020 without language restriction. The Heterogeneity among the included studies was checked with forest plot, 2 test, I2 test, and the p-values. All observational studies reporting prevalence and determinants were included. Results A total of 1207 articles were identified from different databases with an initial search. Fort-eight articles were selected for evaluation after the successive screening. Thirty-three Articles with 306,635 participants were included. The Meta-Analysis revealed that the global prevalence of case cancellation on the intended day of surgery was 18% (95% CI: 16 to 20). The Meta-Analysis also showed that lack of operation theatre facility accounted for the major reason for cancellation followed by no attendant and change in medical condition.

Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized2. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoV.","output":"LY6E impairs coronavirus fusion and confers immune control of viral disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To report a case of branch retinal artery occlusion associated with paracentral acute middle maculopathy on spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) presumably related to heavy cannabis consumption.

Factors determining individual susceptibility to acute larval cyathostominosis are unknown. Investigation of these factors could lead to novel treatment and prevention strategies. OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinicopathological and faecal microbiota changes associated with disease in individual horses in an acute larval cyathostominosis outbreak. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: The study population was a herd of 23 mixed breed horses in Ireland. The outbreak occurred in November 2018. Fourteen horses were clinically affected. Clinical status was monitored and recorded. Blood and faecal sampling allowed clinicopathological, faecal 16s rRNA gene sequencing and faecal egg count analyses. RESULTS: Two horses were euthanised, whilst 12 recovered. Common clinical signs included loose faecal consistency, weight loss and pyrexia. Consistent clinicopathological findings were borderline anaemia, leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperglobulinaemia and a reverse A: G ratio. Decreased alpha\\\\diversity of the faecal microbiota and greater relative abundance of the genus Streptococcus, class Bacilli, order Lactobacillales and family Streptococcaceae, and family Prevotelleceae was found in clinically affected horses compared to their clinically normal cohorts. An increase in obligate fibrolytic bacteria was seen in the clinically normal group compared to the clinical group. Histopathological findings of the colon and caecum revealed a severe necrotising typhlocolitis associated with cyathostomin larvae and bacterial overgrowth in the mucosa of the large intestine. MAIN LIMITATIONS: The study population in this outbreak is small. There are several confounding factors limiting this to a descriptive case series. Faecal microbiota has been shown to reflect the large intestinal microbiota but do not represent changes directly. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that acute larval cyathostominosis is associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota as well as the inflammatory stimulus of numerous emerging larvae leading to structural and functional pathology of the large intestine.","output":"Outbreak of acute larval cyathostominosis C A perfect storm of inflammation and dysbiosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many pathogenic viruses that affect man display species specificity, limiting the use of animal models.

However, limited evidence exists for critically injured patients. The objective of this study was to determine the association between hyperoxia and in-hospital mortality in adult trauma patients requiring ICU admission. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted at two level I trauma centers and one level II trauma center in CO between October 2015 and June 2018. All adult trauma patients requiring ICU admission within 24 hours of emergency department arrival were eligible. The primary exposure was oxygenation during the first 7 days of hospitalization. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital-free days and ventilator-free days. We included 3,464 critically injured patients with a mean age of 52.6 years. Sixty-five percent were male, and 66% had blunt trauma mechanism of injury. The primary outcome of in-hospital mortality occurred in 264 patients (7.6%). Of 226,057 patient-hours, 46% were spent in hyperoxia (oxygen saturation > 96%) and 52% in normoxia (oxygen saturation 90C96%). During periods of hyperoxia, the adjusted risk for mortality was higher with greater oxygen administration. At oxygen saturation of 100%, the adjusted risk scores for mortality (95% CI) at Fio(2) of 100%, 80%, 60%, and 50% were 6.4 (3.5C11.8), 5.4 (3.4C8.6), 2.7 (1.7C4.1), and 1.5 (1.1C2.2), respectively.

The strategies adopted by many countries to reduce the impact of the pandemic were mainly based on social distancing rules and on stay-at-home measures or lockdowns. These strategies had severe disruptive consequences on many sectors, including all levels of education. While the \\"traditional\\" (face-to-face) Higher Education (HE) system was unprepared for the lockdown (e.g., no plans for a massive shift to online teaching were available/ready), it reacted in an extremely quick and effective way, replacing face-to-face teaching with online teaching. While COVID-19 has been extremely challenging for education, the experience has undoubtedly provided positive inputs for the digitalization of the HE system. The question is however, if whether after the COVID-19 emergency everything will go back to the previous situation or instead if the pandemic has irreversibly changed HE. While we are still in the middle of the crisis, it is in our view beneficial to start to reflect on the challenges and open issues that emerged during this period and the lessons learned for the \\"new normal\\" (as it is often referred to). In this conceptual paper we seek to start this discussion by focusing on the following relevant aspects that should be considered to succeed in the digital transformation: broadband network infrastructure and hardware devices;e-learning software;organization of teaching activities;pedagogical issues;diversity and inclusivity;and a number of other issues.

Social connections can mitigate against loneliness, and there is evidence that the arts can support social connectedness. However, existing research on the arts and social connectedness is limited by focus on particular age groups and arts activities, as well as a reliance on typically small-scale studies. METHODS: This study reports survey data from 5892 adults in the United Kingdom, closely matched to the national profile in terms of sociodemographic and economic characteristics. It investigates the extent to which arts engagement is perceived to be linked with feelings of social connectedness, which forms of arts engagement are reported as most connecting, and how. Data were collected via the HEartS Survey, a newly designed tool to capture arts engagement in the United Kingdom and its associations with social and mental health outcomes. Demographic and quantitative data, pertaining to the extent to which arts engagement is perceived to be linked with social connectedness, were analysed descriptively. Qualitative data pertaining to respondents perceptions of how arts engagement is linked with feelings of social connectedness were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that the majority of respondents (82%) perceive their arts engagement to be linked with feelings of social connectedness at least some of the time. The forms of arts engagement most linked with feelings of social connectedness were attending a live music performance, watching a live theatre performance, and watching a film or drama at the cinema or other venue. Four overarching themes characterise how arts engagement is perceived to facilitate feelings of social connectedness: social opportunities, sharing, commonality and belonging, and collective understanding. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that arts engagement can support social connectedness among adults in the UK through multiple pathways, providing large-scale evidence of the important role that the arts can play in supporting social public health.

In this study we aimed to determine pressures generated in hemodialysis catheters during power injection of computed tomography (CT) contrast media. METHODS Three different chronic hemodialysis catheters and two acute hemodialysis catheters were included in this study. All catheters were evaluated in vitro. A total volume of 120 cc of CT contrast material was injected at rate of 10 cc/s using a power injector. The catheters were connected to the power injector using a standard connecting tubing. Pressures were simultaneously measured in the power injector as well as in the hemodialysis catheters. RESULTS The maximal measured pressures during injection in the power injector averaged 338 PSI (SD  8.7 PSI). The maximal measured pressure in the dialysis catheters ranged between 9.17 and 21.2 PSI. Pressures averaged 14.02 PSI (SD  3.34 PSI). The average pressure in the power injector was over 23 times higher than the pressure recorded at the hemodialysis catheter. None of the catheters ruptured or deformed during testing. CONCLUSIONS Pressures measured in hemodialysis catheters during power injection are lower than currently believed and markedly lower than the pressures recorded in the power injector.

Patients were polymerase chain reaction positive for COVID-19 and on their 1(st) day of admission. Heart period, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), low frequency (LF) HRV, and vagal efficiency were calculated from electrocardiogram signals. This study investigated the correlation of HRV, demographic, and laboratory parameters with hospital LOS. RESULTS: Forty-one participants were recruited, with a significant relationship, observed between hospital LOS and some demographic and clinical parameters such as lymphocyte count, age, and oxygen saturation of arterial blood. There was a negative relationship between LF and hospital LOS (r = ?0.53, 95% confidence interval: ?0.73, ?0.24). Higher vagal efficiency predicted shorter hospital LOS in patients younger than 40 years of age (19.27% shorter hospital LOS was associated with a one SD higher value of VE, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: HRV measurement is a non-invasive, inexpensive, and scalable procedure that produces several metrics, some of which are useful for predicting hospital LOS and managing treatment resources during COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Use of heart rate variability to predict hospital length of stay for COVID-19 patients: A prospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was defined as a species of beta coronavirus causing atypical respiratory disease in humans. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented health and economic crisis worldwide. Little is known about the specifics of its influence on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLWHA). In this study, we aim to investigate the prevalence and mortality in PLWHA co-infected with COVID-19. METHODS: The databases PUBMED, EMBASE, BioRxiv, and medRxiv were searched up to 9 March 2021 to explore the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA. Cohort studies and case series meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this review. RESULTS: We identified 14 eligible studies, 9 of which were cohort and 5 were case series. A total of 203,761 patients with COVID-19 were identified (7718 PLWHA vs. 196,043 non-PLWHA). Meta-analyses estimated the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA was 0.774% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00393C0.01517] and 8.814% (95% CI 0.05766C0.13245) respectively. COVID-19 co-infected PLWHA do not seem to be associated with higher mortality, as compared to non-PLWHA [relative risk (RR) 0.96 (95% CI 0.88C1.06)]. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, RR 5.2 (95% CI 4.25C6.36), hypertension and chronic cardiac disease, RR 4.2 (95% CI 1.09C16.10), and chronic kidney disease, RR 8.43 (95% CI 5.49C12.93) were associated with an increased mortality in COVID-19 co-infected PLWHA. CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA were 0.774% and 8.814%, respectively. Since most of the included studies used unmatched populations, comparisons between PLWHA and non-PLWHA should be interpreted with caution. Further investigations are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between cluster of differentiation 4 cell count, HIV viral load, antiretroviral therapy, and COVID-19 related prognosis in PLWHA.

METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase with the keywords: inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2. We included studies reporting the frequency of COVID-19 infection and outcomes (hospitalisation, need for intensive care unit care and mortality) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We estimated the pooled incidence of COVID-19 in inflammatory bowel disease and comparative risk vis-a-vis the general population. We also estimated the pooled frequency of outcomes and compared them in patients who received and did not receive drugs for inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included. The pooled incidence rate of COVID-19 per 1000 patients of inflammatory bowel disease and the general population were 4.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-11.17) and 6.59 (3.25-13.35), respectively, with no increase in relative risk (0.47, 0.18-1.26) in inflammatory bowel disease. The relative risk of the acquisition of COVID-19 was not different between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (1.03, 0.62-1.71). The pooled proportion of COVID-19-positive inflammatory bowel disease patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit care was 27.29% and 5.33% while pooled mortality was 4.27%. The risk of adverse outcomes was higher in ulcerative colitis compared to Crohn's disease. The relative risks of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and mortality were lower for patients on biological agents (0.34, 0.19-0.61; 0.49, 0.33-0.72 and 0.22, 0.13-0.38, respectively) but higher with steroids (1.99, 1.64-2.40; 3.41, 2.28-5.11 and 2.70, 1.61-4.55) or 5-aminosalicylate (1.59, 1.39-1.82; 2.38, 1.26-4.48 and 2.62, 1.67-4.11) use.

Results: Out of 3,303 participants, the quarantined people (40.9%), community workstation staffs-policemen-volunteers (CPV) (36.4%) and general public (30.7%) reported higher percentages of depression than the general medical staff (18.4%). Moreover, the quarantined people (19.1%) also showed higher prevalence of anxiety than the general public (9.1%) and the general medical staff (7.8%). The quarantined people had the highest risk of anxiety and depression, whereas the self-rated health was negatively associated with the risks of anxiety and depression.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A government hospital serving low-income and middle-income population in Amman, Jordan. PARTICIPANTS: Children under 2 years of age hospitalised with fever and/or respiratory symptoms (n=3168) from 16 March 2010 to 31 March 2013. Children with chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and newborns who had never been discharged after birth were excluded from the study. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalisation rates and markers of illness severity: admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation (MV), oxygen therapy, length of stay (LOS) and death. RESULTS: Of the 3168 subjects, 2581 (82%) had at least one respiratory virus detected, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most predominant pathogen isolated. During admission, 1013 (32%) received oxygen therapy, 284 (9%) were admitted to ICU, 111 (4%) were placed on MV and 31 (1%) children died. Oxygen therapy was higher in RSV-only subjects compared with human rhinovirus-only (42%vs29%, p<0.001), adenovirus-only (42%vs21%, p<0.001) and human parainfluenza virus-only (42%vs23%, p<0.001) subjects. The presence of an underlying medical condition was associated with oxygen therapy (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.95, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.56), ICU admission (aOR 2.51, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.68), MV (aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.28) and longer LOS (aOR1.71, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.13). Similarly, younger age was associated with oxygen therapy (0.23, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.31), ICU admission (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74), MV (0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53) and longer LOS (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.59). Pneumonia was strongly associated with longer LOS (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.60), oxygen therapy (aOR 2.94, 95% CI 2.22 to 3.89), ICU admission (aOR 3.12, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.50) and MV (aOR 3.33, 95% CI 1.85 to 6.00). Virus-specific hospitalisation rates ranged from 0.5 to 10.5 per 1000 children. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses are associated with severe illness in Jordanian children hospitalised with ARI.

Polymorphisms in the S protein can affect cleavage, viral transmission, and pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of arising S polymorphisms in vitro and in vivo to understand the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. First, we showed that the S:655Y is selected after in vivo replication in the mink model. This mutation is present in the Gamma Variant Of Concern (VOC) but it also occurred sporadically in early SARS-CoV-2 human isolates. To better understand the impact of this polymorphism, we analyzed the in vitro properties of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 isolates containing S:655Y in different lineage backgrounds. Results demonstrated that this mutation enhances viral replication and spike protein cleavage. Viral competition experiments using hamsters infected with WA1 and WA1-655Y isolates showed that the variant with 655Y became dominant in both direct infected and direct contact animals. Finally, we investigated the cleavage efficiency and fusogenic properties of the spike protein of selected VOCs containing different mutations in their spike proteins. Results showed that all VOCs have evolved to acquire an increased spike cleavage and fusogenic capacity despite having different sets of mutations in the S protein. Our study demonstrates that the S:655Y is an important adaptative mutation that increases viral cell entry, transmission, and host susceptibility. Moreover, SARS-COV-2 VOCs showed a convergent evolution that promotes the S protein processing.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have acquired mutations associated with an increased spike cleavage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background To date, there has been no computed tomography (CT) evaluation of adenovirus pneumonia in a large number of immunocompetent patients. Purpose To describe the thin-section CT findings of immunocompetent patients with adenovirus pneumonia. Material and Methods We prospectively enrolled 104 patients with adenovirus pneumonia from a military hospital. CT scans of each patient were retrospectively and independently assessed by two radiologists for the presence of abnormalities, laterality and zonal predominance of the parenchymal abnormalities, and dominant imaging patterns and their anatomic distributions. Results CT findings included consolidation (n = 92), ground-glass opacity (GGO; n = 82), septal thickening (n = 34), nodules (n = 46), bronchial wall thickening (n = 32), pleural effusion (n = 16), and lymphadenopathy (n = 3). Eighty-four patients (81%) exhibited unilateral parenchymal abnormalities and 57 (57%) exhibited lower lung zone abnormalities. The most frequently dominant CT pattern was consolidation with surrounding GGO (n = 50), with subpleural (70%) and peribronchovascular (94%) distributions. Consolidation-the second-most common pattern (n = 33)-also exhibited subpleural (79%) and peribronchovascular (97%) distributions. The dominant nodule pattern (n = 14) exhibited mixed (64%) and peribronchovascular (100%) distributions. A dominant GGO pattern was only observed in four patients; none had central distribution. Conclusion Although the manifestations of adenovirus pneumonia on CT are varied, we found the most frequent pattern was consolidation with or without surrounding GGO, with subpleural and peribronchovascular distributions. Parenchymal abnormalities were predominantly unilateral and located in the lower lung zone. If dominant consolidation findings are present in immunocompetent patients during the early stages, adenovirus pneumonia should be considered.","output":"Thin-section computed tomography findings in 104 immunocompetent patients with adenovirus pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This study investigated whether early intervention based on additional use of sidestream capnography could reduce the incidence of oxygen desaturation and hypoxic events in patients receiving propofol anesthesia during surgical abortion.

Exclusion criteria were preexisting cardiovascular disease, preexisting hypotension, bradycardia or arrhythmia, and drug allergy. Anesthesia was induced in all patients with propofol using target-controlled infusion at a target propofol plasma concentration of 4 g/ml. All patients received flurbiprofen axetil 50 mg and 0.5 g/kg fentanyl 5 min before anesthesia. Bispectral index was used and maintained between 45 and 60. Main outcome measures were apnea or abnormal ventilation status, rate of oxygen desaturation, occurrence of hypoxia and severe hypoxia, and perioperative side effects. RESULTS The experimental group had significantly higher rate of apnea or abnormal ventilation, significantly lower rate of oxygen desaturation, and significant lower occurrence of hypoxia and severe hypoxia compared to the control group. We found no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in the rates of increased oxygen supplementation, assisted ventilation, bradycardia, hypotension, dosage of atropine, dosage of ephedrine or phenylephrine, and the amount of propofol consumed.

A testing program focused on high-risk populations may be effective as part of a comprehensive university-wide mitigation strategy to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology on a Public University Campus in Washington State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza virus infections are believed to spread mostly by close contact in the community. Social distancing measures are essential components of the public health response to influenza pandemics. The objective of these mitigation measures is to reduce transmission, thereby delaying the epidemic peak, reducing the size of the epidemic peak, and spreading cases over a longer time to relieve pressure on the healthcare system. We conducted systematic reviews of the evidence base for effectiveness of multiple mitigation measures: isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantining exposed persons, school closures, workplace measures/closures, and avoiding crowding. Evidence supporting the effectiveness of these measures was obtained largely from observational studies and simulation studies. Voluntary isolation at home might be a more feasible social distancing measure, and pandemic plans should consider how to facilitate this measure. More drastic social distancing measures might be reserved for severe pandemics.","output":"Nonpharmaceutical Measures for Pandemic Influenza in Nonhealthcare Settings-Social Distancing Measures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common renal benign tumor. Treatment should be considered for symptomatic patients or for those at risk for complications, especially retroperitoneal bleeding which is correlated to tumor size, grade of the angiogenic component and to the presence of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This study reports our single-center experience with the use of selective arterial embolization (SAE) in the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic renal AMLs. METHODS In this retrospective mono-centric study, all demographic and imaging data, medical records, angiographic features, outpatient charts and follow-up visits of patients who underwent prophylactic or emergency SAE for AMLs between January 2005 and July 2016 were reviewed. Tumor size and treatment outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the procedure during follow-up. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography was used to evaluate AML shrinkage. Renal function was measured pre- and post-procedure. RESULTS Twenty-three patients (18 females, 5 males; median age, 45 years; range, 19-85 years) who underwent SAE either to treat bleeding AML (n=6) or as a prophylactic treatment (n=17) were included. Overall, 34 AMLs were embolized. TSC status was confirmed for 6 patients. Immediate technical success rate was 96% and 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Major complications occurred in 3 patients and minor post-embolization syndrome (PES) in 14 patients. The mean AML size reduction rate was 26.2% after a mean follow-up was 20.5 months (range, 0.5-56 months), and only non-TSC status was significantly associated with better shrinkage of tumor (P=0.022). Intralesional aneurysms were significantly more frequent in patients with hemorrhagic presentation (P=0.008). There was no change in mean creatinine level after SAE. CONCLUSIONS SAE is a safe and effective technique to manage renal AMLs as a preventive treatment as well as in emergency setting, with significant reduction in tumor size during follow-up. A multidisciplinary approach remains fundamental, especially for TSC patients. In addition to size, the presence of intralesional aneurysms should be considered in any prophylactic treatment decision.","output":"Selective arterial embolization of symptomatic and asymptomatic renal angiomyolipomas: a retrospective study of safety, outcomes and tumor size reduction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A type 1 diabetes patient experienced remission associated with chloroquine therapy while travelling to a malaria-endemic area.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the IgG antibody production against S and N antigens of the virus and their correlation with the time and severity of the disease. METHODS The IgG antibodies against S and N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens 72 symptomatic patients who tested real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-CoV-2 were detected using the ELISA technique. Different antibody response was compared and the correlation with the time from disease onset and the severity was evaluated. RESULTS Forty-eight of 72 (67%) patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while 24 (33%) did not have detectable antibodies. Comparison of antibody levels for N and S antibodies showed that they correlate with each other well (r= 0.81; P< 0.001). However, sensitivity of anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG and anti-N SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 30% and 60%, during the first 7 days after symptom onset (r= 0.53; P= 0.111), but increased to 73% and 68% at more than 1-week post symptom onset (r= 0.89, P= 0.111), respectively.

He underwent reconstructive surgery for the scalp wound. The wound became infected, and scalp necrosis developed following the surgery. There was no progress in wound healing in spite of conventional wound therapy. We combined maggot debridement therapy with negative-pressure wound therapy and amniotic membrane grafting for 7 months. Necrotic tissues began to be eliminated after the second use of larva therapy, and the wound became free of necrotic tissues with clear increase of granulated tissues after four treatments with maggot debridement therapy. Then, we applied negative-pressure wound therapy and amniotic membrane grafting to accelerate wound healing and improve wound closure.

Given the rapidly evolving knowledge base about the virus and changing governmental and public health recommendations, a precise answer to this question is fraught with complexity and nuance. Without robust data to inform policy, return-to-play (RTP) decisions are especially difficult for elite athletes on the suspicion that the COVID-19 virus could result in significant cardiorespiratory compromise in a minority of afflicted athletes. There are now consistent reports of athletes reporting persistent and residual symptoms many weeks to months after initial COVID-19 infection. These symptoms include cough, tachycardia and extreme fatigue.

Logistic regression was used identify variables potentially associated with adverse outcomes and those P <0.10 were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Cumulative probability for lack of adverse outcomes in patients with or without low baseline diaphragm muscle mass was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator. RESULTS The main findings of this study are that 1) patients who developed adverse outcomes had thinner diaphragm than those who did not (2.0 vs. 2.2 mm, P=0.001), 2) DT and lymphocyte count were independent significant predictors of adverse outcomes, with end-expiratory DT being the strongest (?=-708; OR=0.492; P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS Diaphragmatic ultrasound may be a valid tool to evaluate the risk of respiratory failure. Evaluating the need of mechanical ventilation treatment should be based not only on PaO2/FiO2, but on a more comprehensive assessment including DT because if the lungs become less compliant a thinner diaphragm, albeit free of intrinsic abnormality, may become exhausted, thus contributing to severe respiratory failure.","output":"Low diaphragm muscle mass predicts adverse outcome in patients hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia: an exploratory pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the spread of the coronavirus infection in Japan, the suicide rate has increased.

In this study, we investigated whether the reminiscence of scenes by natural sounds can work on the central nervous system and bring about a relaxing effect, and whether a synergistic effect can be observed by working together with the autonomic nervous system. Headphones and a questionnaire were also used. Twelve young male and female were recruited as subjects. The results showed that most of the subjects had a good impression of music, nature sounds and their mixtures. The results for music and nature sounds were mixed, but most of the subjects had a good impression of the blended sounds. The effect on relaxation, as measured by the questionnaire, was better after listening to the music than before in all conditions. In all conditions, there was a greater improvement in relaxation after listening to the music than before, and the degree of improvement was as follows: mixture > nature sounds > music. Although there was no statistical superiority, it was possible to show this trend.

Early isolation and containment is challenging. Although screening all patients with respiratory symptoms for COVID-19 has been recommended, the practicality of such an effort has yet to be assessed. METHODS: Over a 6-week period during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, our institution introduced a respiratory surveillance ward (RSW) to segregate all patients with respiratory symptoms in designated areas, where appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) could be utilized until SARS-CoV-2 testing was done. Patients could be transferred when SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative on 2 consecutive occasions, 24 hours apart. RESULTS: Over the study period, 1,178 patients were admitted to the RSWs. The mean length-of-stay (LOS) was 1.89 days (SD, 1.23). Among confirmed cases of pneumonia admitted to the RSW, 5 of 310 patients (1.61%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This finding was comparable to the pickup rate from our isolation ward. In total, 126 HCWs were potentially exposed to these cases; however, only 3 (2.38%) required quarantine because most used appropriate PPE. In addition, 13 inpatients overlapped with the index cases during their stay in the RSW; of these 13 exposed inpatients, 1 patient subsequently developed COVID-19 after exposure.

In this paper, we show how the ICD is ill-suited for classifying drug-involved deaths, many of which involve polysubstance abuse and/or illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF). Opioids identified in death certificates are categorized according to six ICD T-codes: opium (T40.0), heroin (T40.1), methadone (T40.3), other synthetic narcotics (T40.4), and other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). Except for opium, heroin, and methadone, all other opioids except those that are unspecified are aggregated in two T-codes (T40.2 and T40.4), depending upon whether they are natural/semisynthetic or synthetic opioids other than methadone. The result is a system that obscures the actual cause of most drug overdose deaths and, instead, just tallies the number of times each drug is mentioned in an overdose situation. We examined the CDCs methodology for coding other controlled substances according to the ICD and found that, besides fentanyl, the ICD does not distinguish between other licit and illicitly manufactured controlled substances. Moreover, we discovered that the CDC codes all methadone-related deaths as resulting from the prescribed form of the drug. These and other anomalies in the CDCs mortality reporting are discussed in this report. We conclude that the CDC was at fault for failing to correct the miscoding of IMF. Finally, we briefly discuss some of the public policy consequences of this error, the misguided focus by public health and safety officials on pharmaceutical opioids, their prescribers and users, and the pressing necessity for the CDC to reassess how it measures and reports drug-involved mortality.","output":"What Your Death Certificate Says About You May Be Wrong: A Narrative Review on CDCs Efforts to Quantify Prescription Opioid Overdose Deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected global mental health and well-being. However, the impact amongst homeless persons has not been fully evaluated. The ECHO study reports factors associated with depression amongst the homeless population living in shelters in France during the Spring of 2020. Methods: Interview data were collected from 527 participants living in temporary and/or emergency accommodation following France's first lockdown (02/05/20 - 07/06/20), in the metropolitan regions of Paris (74%), Lyon (19%) and Strasbourg (7%). Interviews were conducted in French, English, or with interpreters (33% of participants, ~20 languages). Presence of depression was ascertained using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results: Amongst ECHO study participants, 30% had symptoms of moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9[] 10). Multivariate analysis revealed depression to be associated with being female (aOR: 2.15; CI: 1.26-3.69), being single (aOR: 1.60; CI: 1.01-2.52), having a chronic illness (aOR: 2.32; CI: 1.43-3.78), facing food insecurity (aOR: 2.12; CI: 1.40-3.22) and participants' region of origin. Persons born in African and Eastern Mediterranean regions showed levels of depression comparable to those of French participants (30-33%) but higher than migrants from European countries (14%). Reduced rates of depression were observed amongst participants aged 30-49 (aOR: 0.60; CI: 0.38-0.95) and over 50 (aOR: 0.28; CI: 0.13-0.64), compared to 18-29-year-olds. Conclusions: Our results indicate high levels of depression among homeless persons during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The West African epidemic accelerated the clinical development of vaccines and therapeutics, leading to licensure of vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics for human use in recent years. The most widely used vaccine is based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) (VSV-EBOV). Due to its favorable immune cell targeting, this vaccine has also been used as a base vector for the development of second generation VSV-based vaccines against Influenza, Nipah, and Zika viruses. However, in these situations, it may be beneficial if the immunogenicity against EBOV GP is minimized to induce a better protective immune response against the other foreign immunogen. Here, we analyzed if EBOV GP can be truncated to be less immunogenic, yet still able to drive replication of the vaccine vector. We found that the EBOV GP glycan cap and the mucin-like domain are both dispensable for VSV-EBOV replication.

We then performed a thematic analysis to identify and construct patterns of teamwork challenges into themes. Results: We discovered two types of challenges to teamwork: material barriers related to wearing masks, gowns, and powered air purifying respirators, and spatial barriers implemented to conserve PPE and limit coronavirus exposure. Both material and spatial barriers resulted in disrupted communication, roles, and interpersonal relationships, but did so in unique ways. Material barriers muffled information flow, impeded team member recognition and role/task division, and reduced belonging and cohesion while increasing interpersonal strain. Spatial barriers resulted in mediated communication, and added physical and emotional distance between teammates and patients.

Methods: A monocentric prospective study was conducted in a French nursing home from March 17 th , 2020 to June 11 th , 2020. Because of lack of molecular tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection, probable COVID-19 cases were early identified considering only respiratory and not-respiratory symptoms and therefore preventing measures and treatments were enforced. Once available, serology tests were performed at the end of the study.A chronologic description of new cases and deaths was made together with a description of COVID-19 symptoms. Data about personal characteristics and treatments were collected and the following comparisons were performed: i) probable COVID-19 cases vs asymptomatic residents;ii) SARS-Cov2 seropositive residents vs seronegative residents. Results: Overall, 32/66 (48.5%) residents and 19/39 (48.7%) members of health-care personnel were classified as probable COVID-19 cases. A total of 34/61 (55.7%) tested residents resulted seropositive. Death occurred in 4/66 (6%) residents.

Cancellations of placements such as student assistantships severely disrupted this transition. Furthermore, a tailored teaching programme was implemented locally to aid the new doctors.MethodsA nationwide survey to graduating doctors and a focus group at The Hillingdon Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (THH) were conducted to identify concerns. We explored the students impression of the disruptive effects fof COVID-19, and the subsequent consequences this had on their preparedness and confidence. Subsequent analysis of the identified areas formed the basis of a teaching programme with 6 main domains: practical skills, attending arrest calls, prescribing independently, making referrals, prioritising jobs and on-call shifts.Results440 students across 32 UK medical schools responded to the survey. The impact of COVID-19 on OSCEs, written examinations, and student assistantships had significantly affected the students perception of preparedness in starting as doctors (respectively p=0.025;0.008;0.0005). In contrast, when measuring confidence, only changes to student assistantships had a significant effect (p=0.0005).

Methods: Plasma samples were collected from older adults (75-98 years) before and after three doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, and from younger adults (18-74 years) post-dose two, for comparison. Antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (spike protein [S], S-receptor binding domain [S-RBD], and nucleocapsid [N]) and functional activity against S were measured against the vaccine virus and variants of concern (VOC). Results: Vaccination induced greater antibody titers in older females than males, with both age and frailty associated with reduced antibody responses to vaccine antigens in males, but not females. ACE2 binding inhibition declined more than anti-S or anti-S-RBD IgG in the six months following the second dose (28-fold vs. 12- and 11-fold decreases in titer). The third dose restored functional antibody responses and eliminated disparities caused by sex, age, and frailty in older adults. Responses to the VOC were significantly reduced relative to the vaccine virus, with older males having lower titers to the VOC than females. Older adults had lower responses to the vaccine and VOC viruses than younger adults, with disparities being greater in males than females. Conclusion: Older and frail males may be more vulnerable to breakthrough infections due to low antibody responses before receipt of a third vaccine dose.

Problem: Turkey's risk map, presented in January 2021, to take local decisions in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, was based on confirmed cases only. Health, socio-economic and environmental indicators are also important for management decisions of COVID-19. The risk map to be designed by adding these indicators will support more effective decisions. Objective: The research aims to propose a clustering scheme to design a risk map of cities for Turkey. Methodology: The unsupervised clustering algorithm suggested dividing the cities of Turkey into clusters, considering health, socio-economic, environmental indicators, and the spread pattern of COVID-19. Results: We found that cities are clustered into five groups while megacity Istanbul alone formed a cluster, three of Turkey's largest cities formed another cluster. Other clusters consist of 19, 26, and 32 cities, respectively. The most important determinants which have predictive power are identified. Conclusion: The suggested clustering method can be a decision support system for policymakers to determine the differences and similarities of cities in quarantine decisions and normalization phases for the following periods of the pandemic. Originality: To the best of our knowledge, this study differs from previous studies because countries were grouped in previous studies by only considering the confirmed cases.

To make the spin waves created in different temporal modes distinguishable and enable selective readout, we control the dephasing and rephasing of the spin waves by a magnetic field gradient, which induces a controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening of the involved atomic hyperfine levels. We demonstrate that by embedding the atomic ensemble inside a low finesse optical cavity, the additional noise generated in multimode operation is strongly suppressed. By employing feed forward readout, we demonstrate distinguishable retrieval of up to 10 temporal modes. For each mode, we prove nonclassical correlations between the first and second photon. Furthermore, an enhancement in rates of correlated photon pairs is observed as we increase the number of temporal modes stored in the memory.

At 12 months, in the ultrasound substudy, valvular reflux prevalence was similar between groups (85% vs 91%, p = 0.35). CFV non-compressibility at 1 month was associated with higher rates of any PTS (61% vs 46%, p < 0.001), a higher incidence of moderate-or-severe PTS (30% vs 19%, p = 0.003), and worse QOL (difference 8.2 VEINES-QOL (VEnous INsufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study on Quality of Life) points; p = 0.004) at 24 months.

Synthesizing qualitative evidence about the birthing experiences of midwives, nurses, women, and birthing people (people who give birth and who may not identify as women), during COVID-19 can provide important information for policies and decision-making for future global pandemics. INCLUSION CRITERIA Studies including licensed midwives, licensed nurses, women, and birthing people who provided or received birthing care during the COVID-19 pandemic will be considered. Studies published from January 2020 onward will be included. The review will consider all studies that present qualitative data, including, but not limited to, research designs such as phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, feminist research, and action research. METHODS The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and LitCovid. MedArchiv, PsyArXiv, and Google Scholar will be searched for gray literature. Studies will be assessed independently by two reviewers and disagreements will be resolved through discussion or with a third reviewer. Data extraction will be completed by two reviewers. The JBI tools and resources will be used for meta-aggregation, including the creation of categories and synthesized findings.

METHOD: The sample included 70 participants diagnosed with IBD (Mage = 43.37 years, SD = 12.81), of whom 71.4% were females and 67.1% had Crohns Disease. Positive psychological variables (meaning in life, positive body image, and attachment styles), sociodemographic (age, education, gender) and clinical variables (diagnosis, disease duration, surgery) were assessed as independent variables. QoL was the dependent variable, analyzed through four domains (physical, psychological, social, environment). RESULTS: Participants with a secure attachment style reported higher QoL (physical, psychological, and social) than participants with a preoccupied attachment style. Strong positive correlations were found between positive psychological variables and QoL. Body appreciation was a significant predictor of three QoL domains (physical, psychological, and environment). Meaning in life made a unique contribution to the social QoL regression model, and it was also a significant predictor of psychological QoL. Body acceptance by others was a significant predictor of physical QoL, whereas disease duration and education predicted environment QoL. Attachment styles did not predict any QoL domain. CONCLUSION: The most significant predictors of QoL in patients with IBD were body appreciation and meaning in life. Body acceptance by others and body appreciation were the main predictors of physical QoL. Psychological interventions for patients who suffer from IBD should address body appreciation and meaning in life.","output":"Quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: the role of positive psychological factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeEnvironmental concern is getting increasing importance in consumer shopping decisions. Nevertheless, to date, sustainable packaged foods are not always the first option when consumers go shopping. This paper analyses how environmental concern moderates the role played by external factors C preference towards sustainable retailers and trust in sustainable producers C in determining consumer purchase intentions for sustainable packaged foods. Consumer involvement in eco-friendly labels, increasingly present in food packages, is investigated as indirectly impacting pro-environmental purchase intentions.Design/methodology/approachAn online survey administered to a sample of Italian food shoppers is used for the empirical analysis.

However, the performance of existing CAD for identifying COVID-19 and associated pneumonia on CXRs has been scarcely investigated. In this study, CXRs of patients with and without COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were retrospectively collected from four and one institution, respectively, and a commercialized, regulatory-approved CAD that can identify various abnormalities including pneumonia was used to analyze each CXR. Performance of the CAD was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), with reference standards of the RT-PCR results and the presence of findings of pneumonia on chest CTs obtained within 24 hours from the CXR. For comparison, 5 thoracic radiologists and 5 non-radiologist physicians independently interpreted the CXRs. Afterward, they re-interpreted the CXRs with corresponding CAD results. The performance of CAD (AUCs, 0.714 and 0.790 against RT-PCR and chest CT, respectively hereinafter) were similar with those of thoracic radiologists (AUCs, 0.701 and 0.784), and higher than those of non-radiologist physicians (AUCs, 0.584 and 0.650). Non-radiologist physicians showed significantly improved performance when assisted with the CAD (AUCs, 0.584 to 0.664 and 0.650 to 0.738). In addition, inter-reader agreement among physicians was also improved in the CAD-assisted interpretation (Fleiss' kappa coefficient, 0.209 to 0.322). In conclusion, radiologist-level performance of the CAD in identifying COVID-19 and associated pneumonia on CXR and enhanced performance of non-radiologist physicians with the CAD assistance suggest that the CAD can support physicians in interpreting CXRs and helping image-based triage of COVID-19 patients in resource-constrained environment.","output":"COVID-19 pneumonia on chest X-rays: Performance of a deep learning-based computer-aided detection system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients are recognized as important players in the pharmacovigilance system. This study aims to describe and compare the characteristics of patient reporting systems, reporting forms, awareness raising-activities, and the statistics related to patient reporting in the selected countries. Fifteen countries (eight Western countries and seven Asian countries) were purposively selected. A questionnaire survey was distributed to national pharmacovigilance authorities in those countries. Nine countries (five Western countries and four Asian countries) returned the questionnaire. A review of the websites of national pharmacovigilance centres was conducted. The proportion of patient reports in the selected Western countries ranged from 57.83% to 14.37%, while it was accounted for less than 1% in the selected Asian countries. Currently, patients in all nine countries can report adverse drug reactions online via a website. The number of clicks from the national pharmacovigilance website to reach the online reporting form range from one to five clicks. Countries with higher patient reporting rates seemed to share the following characteristics; provision of feedback, engagement with patient organizations, and implementation of several activities to raise the awareness of the general public on the importance of pharmacovigilance.

Treatment of the two diseases enables the possibility of interactions between antidepressant and antiepileptic drugs. The aim of this review was to analyze such interactions in one animal seizure model-the maximal electroshock (MES) in mice. Although numerous antidepressants showed an anticonvulsant action, mianserin exhibited a proconvulsant effect against electroconvulsions. In most cases, antidepressants potentiated or remained ineffective in relation to the antielectroshock action of classical antiepileptic drugs. However, mianserin and trazodone reduced the action of valproate, phenytoin, and carbamazepine against the MES test. Antiseizure drug effects were potentiated by all groups of antidepressants independently of their mechanisms of action. Therefore, other factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) modulation, should be considered as the background for the effect of drug combinations.","output":"How Antidepressant Drugs Affect the Antielectroshock Action of Antiseizure Drugs in Mice: A Critical Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the novel beta coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), has become an unprecedented medical, economic, and psychosocial crisis.

Several approaches exist that utilize the evolutionary information from pathogen genomic data derived from infected individuals to distinguish these groups from the background population, comprised of primarily randomly sampled individuals with undetermined epidemiological linkage. These methods are, however, limited in their ability to characterize the dynamics of these groups, or clusters of transmission. Dynamic transmission patterns within these clusters, whether it be the result of changes at the level of the virus (e.g., infectivity) or host (e.g., vaccination implementation), are critical in strategizing public health interventions, particularly when resources are limited. Phylogenetic trees are widely used not only in the detection of transmission clusters, but the topological shape of the branches within can be useful sources of information regarding the dynamics of the represented population. We evaluate the limitation of existing tree shape statistics when dealing with smaller sub-trees containing transmission clusters and offer instead a phylogeny-based deep learning system CDeepDynaTreeC for classification of transmission cluster. Comprehensive experiments carried out on a variety of simulated epidemic growth models indicate that this graph deep learning approach is effective in predicting cluster dynamics (balanced accuracy of 0.826 vs. 0.533 and Brier score of 0.234 vs. 0.466 in independent test set).

Methods This is a retrospective study based on a large healthcare computerized database including all patients that were screened for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the study period from February 23rd 2020 to March 31st 2020. A comparison was conducted between subjects tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those found negative in terms of rate of administration of hydroxychloroquine/colchicine therapy. Results An overall sample of 14,520 subjects were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1317 resulted positive. No significant difference was found in terms of rates of usage of hydroxychloroquine or colchicine between those who were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who were found negative (0.23% versus 0.25% for hydroxychloroquine, and 0.53% versus 0.48% for colchicine, respectively).

Aspergillosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in captive-bred penguin species. Currently, there is no registered vaccine to prevent aspergillosis. Recent research demonstrated that oral administration of gram-negative bacteria expressing high levels of galactose--1,3-galactose (-Gal) modulates anti--Gal immunity and protects turkeys from clinical aspergillosis caused by experimental A. fumigatus infection. The role of anti--Gal immunity in penguins has not been studied. Here, we tested the distribution of -1,3-galactosyltransferase (1,3GT) genes in the fecal microbiome of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). The occurrence of natural anti--Gal antibodies (Abs) in sera and eggs of healthy Humboldt penguins was also assessed. A trial was then conducted to test whether oral administration of Escherichia coli Nissle, expressing high -Gal levels, modulates anti--Gal immunity in a colony of Humboldt penguins. Animals in the vaccination and placebo groups were evaluated before the trial and followed for one year for aspergillosis detection using a diagnostic panel including computed tomography scans, capillary zone electrophoresis, 3-hydroxybutyrate levels, and anti-A. fumigatus Abs. Anti--Gal Abs were detected in sera (IgM and IgY) and eggs (IgY) of healthy penguins. Microbiota analysis and functional predictions revealed the presence of 1,3GT genes in the microbiota of Humboldt penguins and other penguin species. A strong decrease in anti--Gal IgM levels was observed in all animals in the placebo group three months after vaccination protocol. This decrease was not observed in E. coli Nissle-treated penguins. After the vaccination protocol, we found a positive correlation between anti-E. coli IgY and anti--Gal IgY in the E. coli Nissle group, suggesting a correlation between the presence of the bacteria and these Abs. During the study period, three penguins exhibited respiratory signs consistent with aspergillosis. Two were from the placebo group whose symptoms resolved with specific treatments, while a single vaccinated individual developed fatal respiratory aspergillosis eight months after the trial. We conclude that E. coli Nissle represents a safe potential probiotic with a protective effect against aspergillosis in Humboldt penguins that deserves to be further explored for therapeutic uses in these animals.","output":"Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of an Oral Probiotic-Based Vaccine Against Aspergillus Infection in Captive-Bred Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To validate the diagnostic accuracy of a Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA immunoassay for COVID-19 disease. Methods: In this unmatched (1:1) case-control validation study, we used sera of 181 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 176 negative controls collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic accuracy of the immunoassay was assessed against a whole spike protein-based recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo-neutralization assay. Results: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls, and 50.3% of them were hospitalized. ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had a high diagnostic accuracy with AUCs of 0.992 (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.986-0.996) and 0.977 (95%CI: 0.963-0.990), respectively. IgG assays outperformed IgA assays (p=0.008). Considering optimized cut-offs taking the 15% inter-assay imprecision assessed into account, an IgG ratio cut-off > 1.5 displayed a 100% specificity (95%CI: 98-100) and a 100% positive predictive value (95%CI: 97-100). A 0.5 cut-off displayed a 97% sensitivity (95%CI: 93-99) and a 97% negative predictive value (95%CI: 93-99). Adopting these thresholds, rather than those of the manufacturer, improved assay performance, leaving 12% of IgG ratios ranging between 0.5-1.5 as indeterminate. Conclusions: The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in a samples of patients, without any obvious gains from considering IgA serology. The optimized cut-offs are fit for rule-in and rule-out purposes, allowing determination of whether individuals have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or not in our study population.

OSA affects daily life and poses a severe threat to human health. The standard clinical method for identifying and predicting OSA events is the use of Polysomnography signals. In this paper, a novel scheme based on an ensemble of recurrence plots (RPs) and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (RPCNNs) is proposed to improve the prediction rate of OSA. First, RPs were used to represent the dynamic behavior of single electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for 60 s before and during OSA events. Then, using RPs, three prompt CNNs named ResNet-50 were fine-tuned, and their classification results were fused via the Majority Voting (MV) method to produce a final result concerning prediction. Next, the subject-independent Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation (LOSO-CV) and subject-dependent 10-fold Cross-Validation (10-fold CV) methods were used to validate the prediction rate from signals derived from the University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database. Finally, the highest achieved average accuracy for the fusion level was 91.74% and 89.45% at the 10-fold CV and LOSO-CV.

Decisions on public policy on AI are uncertain due to three features specific to the current landscape of AI, namely (i) the vagueness of the definition of AI, (ii) uncertain outcomes of AI implementations and (iii) pacing problems. Given that many potential applications of AI in the public sector concern functions central to the public sphere, decisions on the implementation of such applications are particularly sensitive. Therefore, it is suggested that public policy-makers and decision-makers in the public sector can adopt strategies from the argumentative approach in decision theory to mitigate the established great uncertainty.

However, an in-depth analysis of IFN-I signal-dependent cellular factors that govern CNS-restricted tropism in JEV infection in vivo remains to be elucidated. METHODS: Viral dissemination, tissue tropism, and cytokine production were examined in IFN-I signal-competent and -incompetent mice after JEV inoculation in tissues distal from the CNS such as the footpad. Bone marrow (BM) chimeric models were used for defining hematopoietic and tissue-resident cells in viral dissemination and tissue tropism. RESULTS: The paradoxical and interesting finding was that IFN-I signaling was essentially required for CNS neuroinflammation following JEV inoculation in distal footpad tissue. IFN-I signal-competent mice died after a prolonged neurological illness, but IFN-I signal-incompetent mice all succumbed without neurological signs. Rather, IFN-I signal-incompetent mice developed hemorrhage-like disease as evidenced by thrombocytopenia, functional injury of the liver and kidney, increased vascular leakage, and excessive cytokine production. This hemorrhage-like disease was closely associated with quick viral dissemination and impaired IFN-I innate responses before invasion of JEV into the CNS. Using bone marrow (BM) chimeric models, we found that intrinsic IFN-I signaling in tissue-resident cells in peripheral organs played a major role in inducing the hemorrhage-like disease because IFN-I signal-incompetent recipients of BM cells from IFN-I signal-competent mice showed enhanced viral dissemination, uncontrolled cytokine production, and increased vascular leakage. IFN-I signal-deficient hepatocytes and enterocytes were permissive to JEV replication with impaired induction of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes, and neuron cells derived from both IFN-I signal-competent and -incompetent mice were vulnerable to JEV replication. Finally, circulating CD11b(+)Ly-6C(+) monocytes infiltrated into the distal tissues inoculated by JEV participated in quick viral dissemination to peripheral organs of IFN-I signal-incompetent mice at an early stage. CONCLUSION: An IFN-I signal-dependent model is proposed to demonstrate how CD11b(+)Ly-6C(+) monocytes are involved in restricting the tissue tropism of JEV to the CNS.","output":"Type I IFN signaling limits hemorrhage-like disease after infection with Japanese encephalitis virus through modulating a prerequisite infection of CD11b(+)Ly-6C(+) monocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methods that enable rapid, sensitive and specific analyses of nucleic acid sequences have positive effects on precise disease diagnostics and effective clinical treatments by providing direct insight into clinically relevant genetic information. Thus far, many CRISPR/Cas systems have been repurposed for diagnostic functions and are revolutionizing the accessibility of robust diagnostic tools due to their high flexibility, sensitivity and specificity. As RNA-guided targeted recognition effectors, Cas9 variants have been utilized for a variety of diagnostic applications, including biosensing assays, imaging assays and target enrichment for next-generation sequencing (NGS), thereby enabling the development of flexible and cost-effective tests. In addition, the ensuing discovery of Cas proteins (Cas12 and Cas13) with collateral cleavage activities has facilitated the development of numerous diagnostic tools for rapid and portable detection, and these tools have great potential for point-of-care settings. However, representative reviews proposed on this topic are mainly confined to classical biosensing applications; thus, a comprehensive and systematic description of this fast-developing field is required. In this review, based on the detection principle, we provide a detailed classification and comprehensive discussion of recent works that harness these CRISPR-based diagnostic tools from a new perspective.

His respiratory symptoms and computed tomographic imaging findings consistent with coronavirus disease 2019 improved following initial intensive care, and the result of his polymerase chain reaction test became negative 3 days before discharge from the intensive care unit. However, 4 days after this first negative result, his polymerase chain reaction test result was positive again, and another 4 days later, he had a negative result once more. Eight days after the second polymerase chain reaction negative test result, the patient's test result again became positive. Finally, his polymerase chain reaction results were negative 43 days after his first hospitalization.

There have been no microbiological studies to validate their usefulness for HFMD. We selected 12 commonly used herbs for HFMD from government recommended guidelines as well as published reports and tested for their antiviral activity and anti-inflammatory activity. A water extract of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (HCT) inhibited EV71 infection significantly and was marginally active against CVA16 infection. The IC(50) (concentration to have 50% inhibitory effect) values of HCT against a Fuyang strain and a BrCr strain of EV71 were determined at 8.9 g/mL and 20.6 g/mL, respectively. Mentha haplocalyx Briq. (MHB) water extract was active against CVA16, with an IC(50) value of 70.3 g/mL. The extract did not exhibit activity against EV71 infection. Although the majority of the extracts showed no activity against viral infection, several extracts demonstrated activity in blocking proinflammatory response by viral infection.

M. oleifera is a miracle plant with antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant properties because of its high content of flavonoids, glucosides and glucosinolates. Therefore, we constructed a library of 294 phytochemicals of M. oleifera and filtered it through the FAF-Drugs4. Further, molecular docking studies of filtered phytochemicals were performed with Mpro enzyme to investigate the binding interactions. Drug likeness properties, ADMET prediction were analyzed to determine the therapeutic aspect of these compounds. Based on the binding energy score of the top 4 compounds, the results indicate that Vicenin-2 has the highest binding affinity (-8.6 kcal mol-1) as compared to the reference molecule (-8.4 kcal mol-1).

The occurrence of adverse outcomes is known to depend on both the mechanical properties and flow reduction effects of the flow diverter stent. OBJECTIVE To clarify the possibility of designing a flow diverter stent considering both hemodynamic performance and mechanical properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted based on an ideal aneurysm model with flow diverters. Structural analyses of two flow diverter models exhibiting similar flow reduction effects were performed, and the radial stiffness and longitudinal flexibility were compared. RESULTS In CFD simulations, two stents-Pore2-d35 (26.77 weave angle when fully expanded, 35 m wire thickness) and Pore3-d50 (36.65, 50 m respectively)-demonstrated similar flow reduction rates (68.5% spatial-averaged velocity reduction rate, 85.0% area-averaged wall shear stress reduction rate for Pore2-d35, and 68.6%, 85.4%, respectively, for Pore3-d50). However, Pore3-d50 exhibited greater radial stiffness than Pore2-d35 (40.0 vs 21.0 mN/m at a 3.5 mm outer diameter) and less longitudinal flexibility (0.903 vs 0.104 Nmm bending moments at 90). These measurements indicate that changing the wire thickness and weave angle allows adjustment of the mechanical properties while maintaining the same degree of flow reduction effects. CONCLUSIONS The combination of CFD and structural analysis can provide promising solutions for an optimized stent.

METHODS We retrospectively evaluated adult COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT, clinical scores, laboratory findings, and length of hospital stay. Two independent radiologists visually evaluated the pneumonia severity on chest CT (VSQS). Quantitative CT (QCT) assessment was performed using a free DICOM viewer, and the percentage of the well-aerated lung (%WAL), high-attenuation areas (%HAA) at different threshold values, and mean lung attenuation (MLA) values were calculated. The relationship between CT scores and the clinical, laboratory data, and length of hospital stay were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. The student's t-test and chi-square test were used to analyze the differences between variables. The Pearson correlation test analyzed the correlation between variables. The diagnostic performance of the variables was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used.

Based on such observations, experiments have been designed to investigate the determinism of these differences at the molecular level, and a few genes that play a major role in the innate mechanisms of defence of the species toward viral aggressions have been characterised. For example, the extraordinary resistance of SJL mice to experimental infections with hepatitis virus strain A59 is the consequence of a structural alteration of a cell adhesion molecule which normally binds to the spikes of the virus, allowing its entry into the cells. If the virus cannot bind to the molecule, or if the molecule is absent, epithelial cells of the intestine and liver are not infected and mice are resistant. In the same way, most  not to say all  laboratory strains of mice are susceptible to infections with orthomyxoviruses or flaviviruses because essential molecules, the synthesis of which is normally triggered by interferon, are defective in these mice. Wild mice, by contrast  probably because they are constantly exposed to natural infections  are resistant. Finally, some mouse strains resist experimental infections by the mouse cytomegalovirus 1 (MCMV-1) because, once infected, these mice synthesise a molecule at the surface of infected cells which allows immediate recognition and killing by natural killer (NK) cells. With the exuberant development of mouse genetics and the constant generation of new mutant alleles, it is likely that many more genes with an impact on the phenotype of resistance or susceptibility will be identified in the forthcoming years.

The existing research mainly focused on the characteristics of physical environment that supported individual innovative thinking or innovative interaction between people in building scale, which is relatively limited in this study for the campus scale since people are less likely to exchange academic information with strangers because of a lack of knowledge about their professional background. In this context, this research enriches the understanding of spatial potential for innovation by proposing a more effective way of increasing unexpected encounters with information, which are probably occurred while people passing by laboratories, seminars, or exhibitions of other disciplines. In this process, the unexpected encounters with information act as the medium or promotion factor for face-to-face interaction.

Electrospray ionization is one of the best methods to generate molecules in the gas phase, and it is uniquely capable of studying large biomolecules, including proteins. However, the molecular temperature required to study the spectroscopic properties of the molecules is very high. In this study, we developed a new, simple evaporation method using an ultrasonic nebulizer to obtain gas-phase molecules.

METHODS: A total of 182 sepsis patients were admitted to Naval Medical Center from March 2016 to April 2020 and divided into the acute respiratory distress syndrome and non-ARDS groups. Immunoblotting was employed to identify the expression of autophagy-associated protein from participants' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between mortality and the protein expression in sepsis complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. RESULTS: Among the 182 patients with sepsis included in this study, 82 patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome and 100 patients did not have acute respiratory distress syndrome. We observed that microtubule-related protein 1A/1B LC3II, Beclin-1, RAB7, and LAMP2 protein expression was significantly decreased in septic patients with ARDS, and p62 was significantly increased. Further receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that autophagy-related proteins had a high recognition ability in sepsis complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. LAMP2 protein was the best among them, and its specificity was up to 91.46%. In this study, 38 of the 82 patients with sepsis complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome died, with a mortality rate of 46.34%. We found that the autophagy level was further inhibited in the patients with death, LC3II, Beclin-1, and RAB7. However, the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 levels in the survival patients were remarkably higher than that in the dead patients. In addition, the p62 level was lower in survival patients as well. Our results indicated age and SOFA score were the independent risk factors for mortality in septic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSION: The autophagy level is significantly inhibited in septic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and autophagy-associated proteins LC3II, Beclin-1, RAB7, LAMP2, and p62 have good value for the diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of sepsis comorbid with acute respiratory distress syndrome.","output":"Diagnostic Value and Prognostic Evaluation of Autophagy-Related Protein Expression Level in Sepsis Complicated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disasters may have significant and lasting impacts on educational programs and academic achievement, yet the examination of differing patterns of school recovery after disasters is understudied. This paper focused on two aims: (i) identification of school academic recovery trajectories; and (ii) examination of potential risk factors associated with these trajectories. We used latent class growth analysis to identify school academic recovery trajectories for a cohort of 462 Texas public schools that were in the path of Hurricane Ike in 2008. Using Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) data from 2005 to 2011, we found that attendance and percent of economically disadvantaged youth emerged as significant risk factors for two identified academic recovery trajectories (High\\\\Stable and Low\\\\Interrupted). Higher levels of economically disadvantaged youth were associated with lower likelihood of falling in the High\\\\Stable trajectory, relative to the Low\\\\Interrupted trajectory. Higher levels of attendance were associated with higher likelihood of membership in the High\\\\Stable trajectory, relative to the Low\\\\Interrupted trajectory. These findings are consistent with the notion that disasters do not affect all people or communities equally.

Depression is a robust predictor of nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and engagement in HIV care; perinatal depression may affect upwards of 47% of women in SA. Evidence-based, scalable approaches for depression treatment and ART adherence in this setting are lacking. METHOD: Twenty-three pregnant women with HIV (WWH), ages 18-45 and receiving ART, were randomized to a psychosocial depression and adherence intervention or treatment as usual (TAU) to evaluate intervention feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect on depressive symptoms and ART adherence. Assessments were conducted pre-, immediately post-, and 3 months post-treatment, and included a qualitative exit interview. RESULTS: Most (67.6%) eligible individuals enrolled; 71% completed at least 75% of sessions. Compared to TAU, intervention participants had significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms at post-treatment, ? = - 11.1, t(24) = - 3.1, p < 0.005, 95% CI [- 18.41, - 3.83], and 3 months, ? = - 13.8, t(24) = - 3.3, p < 0.005, 95% CI [- 22.50, - 5.17]. No significant differences in ART adherence, social support, or stigma were found. Qualitatively, perceived improvements in social support, self-esteem, and problem-solving adherence barriers emerged as key benefits of the intervention; additional sessions were desired. CONCLUSION: A combined depression and ART adherence intervention appears feasible and acceptable, and demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy in a high-need population.

Heterologous 3rd vaccination combining mRNA and vector vaccines did not increase seroconversion at four weeks after vaccination but evolution of antibody levels beyond the first month remain unknown. Objective To assess changes in antibody response following a 3rd vaccination with mRNA or vector vaccine in KTR from month one to month three after vaccination. Design, Setting and Participants Three-month follow-up (pre-specified secondary endpoint) of a single-center, single-blinded, 1:1 randomized, controlled trial on 3rd vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in 201 KTR who did not develop SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies following two doses of an mRNA vaccine. Intervention(s) mRNA (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) or vector (Ad26COVS1) as third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Main Outcomes and Measures Main outcome was seroconversion at the second follow-up between 60-120 days after the 3rd vaccination. Subsequently, higher cut-off levels associated with neutralizing capacity and protective immunity were applied (i.e. >15, >100, >141 and >264 BAU/mL). In addition, trajectories of antibody levels from month one to month three were analyzed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 and CD8 T-cells at four weeks were compared among the 18 top responders in both groups. Results A total of 169 patients were available for the three-month follow-up. Overall, seroconversion at three months was similar between both groups (45% versus 50% for mRNA and vector group, respectively; OR=1.24, 95%CI=[0.65, 2.37], p=0.539). However, when applying higher cut-off levels, a significantly larger number of individual in the vector group reached antibody levels > 141 and > 264 BAU/mL at the three-month follow-up (141 BAU/mL: 4% vs. 15% OR=4.96, 95%CI=[1.29, 28.21], p=0.009 and 264 BAU/mL: 1% vs. 10% OR=8.75, 95%CI=[1.13, 396.17], p=0.018 for mRNA vs. vector vaccine group, respectively). In line, antibody levels in seroconverted patients further increased from month one to month three in the vector group while remaining unchanged in the mRNA group (median increase: mRNA= 1.35 U/mL and vector = 27.6 U/mL, p = 0.004). Of particular note, there was no difference in the CD4 and CD8 T-cell response between the mRNA and vector vaccine group at month one. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite a similar overall seroconversion rate at three months following third vaccination in KTR, a heterologous third booster vaccination with Ad26COVS1 resulted in significantly higher antibody levels in responders.

The infectious titers were determined before and after treatment with an in house microtitration assay on Vero E6 cells. Thirty-six plasma pool bags underwent PRT treatment. RESULTS: In all the experiments, the measured titer following riboflavin and UV treatment was below the limit of detection of microtitration assay for all the different SARS-CoV-2 strains. Despite the high copies number detected by RT-PCR for each viral strain after treatment, viruses were completely inactivated and not able to infect VERO E6 cells.

METHODS: Sixty participants underwent neuropsychological (NP), psychiatric, medical, functional, and quality of life assessments 6-8 months after acute COVID-19. Those seeking care cognitive complaints in a post-COVID-19 clinical program for Post-Acute Symptoms of COVID-19 (PASC) (Clinical Group, N=32) were compared to those recruited from the community who were not seeking care (Non-Clinical, N=28). A subset of participants underwent serological testing for pro-inflammatory cytokines C-Reactive Protein, Interleukin-6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor- in order to explore correlations with neuropsychological, psychiatric and medical variables. OUTCOME: For the entire sample, 16 (27%) had extremely low test scores (< 2(nd) %ile on at least 1 NP test). The Clinical Group with cognitive complaints scored lower than age-adjusted population norms in tests of attention, processing speed, memory, and executive function, and significantly more scored in the extremely low range than the Non-Clinical Group (38% vs. 14%, p<0.04). The Clinical Group also reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, fatigue, PTSD and functional difficulties and lower quality of life. In logistic regression analysis, scoring in the extremely low range was predicted by acute COVID-19 symptoms, current depression score, number of medical comorbidities and subjective cognitive complaints in the areas of memory, language, and executive functions. IL-6 correlated with acute COVID symptoms, number of medical comorbidities, fatigue, and measures of executive function. CRP correlated with current COVID symptoms, depression score and, inversely, with quality of life. CONCLUSION: Results suggest the existence of extremely low neuropsychological test performance experienced by some individuals months after acute COVID-19 infection, affecting multiple neurocognitive domains. This extremely low neuropsychological test performance is associated with worse acute COVID-19 symptoms, depression, medical comorbidities, functional complaints, and subjective cognitive complaints.

Thus far, however, own-perceived body matching has been investigated in situations that are incongruent with how we are used to experience and perceive our body in daily life. In the current study, we aimed to examine own-perceived body matching in a context that more closely resembles real life. More specifically, we investigated the effects of body movement dynamics and clothing cues on own-perceived body matching. We asked participants to match their own body with an externally perceived body that was a 3D-generated avatar based on participants real bodies, fitted with a computer-generated dress. This perceived body was (1) either static (non-walking avatar) or dynamic (walking avatar), (2) either bigger, smaller, or the same size as participants own body size, and (3) fitted with a dress with a size either bigger, smaller, or the same as participants own dress size. Our results suggest that movement dynamics cues did not improve the accuracy of own-perceived body matching, but that confidence about dress fit was higher for dynamic avatars, and that the difference between dynamic and static avatars was dependent on participants self-esteem. Furthermore, when participants were asked to rate the observed body in reference to how they wanted to represent themselves to others, dynamic avatars were rated lower than static avatars for the biggest-sized bodies only, possibly reflecting the influence of movement cues on amplifying socio-cultural stereotypes. Finally, while smaller body/dress sizes were systematically rated higher than bigger body/dress sizes for several self-report items, the interplay between body and dress size played an important role in participants self-report as well. Thus, while our research suggests that movement and garment dynamics, allowing for realistic, concrete situations that are reminiscent of daily life, influence own-body perception, these cues did not lead to an improvement in accuracy. These findings provide important insights for research exploring (own-) body perception and bodily self-awareness, with practical (e.g., development of online avatars) and clinical (e.g., anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder) implications.","output":"The Perceived Match Between Observed and Own Bodies, but Not Its Accuracy, Is Influenced by Movement Dynamics and Clothing Cues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact on the learning and teaching processes, particularly in healthcare education and training, because of the principal position of the cutting-edge studentCpatient interaction.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The cumulative incidence of and time to SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in blood samples, were measured. Results: Among 801 HCWs, there were 439 HCWs working in patient care for those with COVID-19, 164 HCWs working in patient care for those without COVID-19, and 198 HCWs not working in patient care. There were 580 (72.4%) women, and the median (interquartile range) age was 36 (29-50) years. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was increased among HCWs working in patient care for those with COVID-19 (54 HCWs [13.2%; 95% CI, 9.9%-16.4%]) compared with HCWs working in patient care for those without COVID-19 (11 HCWs [6.7%; 95% CI, 2.8%-10.5%]; hazard ratio [HR], 2.25; 95% CI, 1.17-4.30) and HCWs not working in patient care (7 HCWs [3.6%; 95% CI, 0.9%-6.1%]; HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.79-8.62).

METHODS Neonatal piglets (1-4 days, 1.7-2.4kg) had their right common carotid artery exposed and enclosed with a real-time ultrasonic flow probe. Heart rate (HR) was continuously measured and recorded using ECG. This allowed simultaneous monitoring of HR via ECG and CBF. The piglets were asphyxiated until cardiac arrest, defined as no CBF and no audible beat upon precordial auscultation. CPR was performed until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC, defined as a HR 100 bpm). ECG traces were retrospectively assessed.

This protocol expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits, takes about 30 minutes from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA, and enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with very high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). In summary, we present a rapid, safe and sensitive method for high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2, that can be conducted in any laboratory equipped with a qPCR machine.","output":"A simple, safe and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation and RNA extraction for RT-qPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the domestic and international spread of the COVID-19, much attention has been given to estimating pandemic risk.

However, there are conflicting conclusions regarding risk of severe disease in this population. Objective: We seek to understand the impact of asthma on COVID-19 outcomes in a cohort of hospitalized patients and if there is any association between asthma severity and worse outcomes. Methods: We identified hospitalized COVID-19 patients with confirmatory PCR testing with (n=183) and without asthma (n=1319) using ICD-10 codes between March 1 C December 30, 2020. We determined asthma maintenance medications, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), highest historical absolute eosinophil count and IgE. Primary outcomes included death, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS). Analysis were adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, smoking status, and timing of illness in the pandemic. Results: In unadjusted analyses, we found no difference in our primary outcomes between asthma and non-asthma patients. However in adjusted analyses, asthma patients were more likely to require mechanical ventilation (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02 C 2.44, p =0.04), ICU admission (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.09 C 2.29, p =0.02), longer hospital LOS (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09 C 1.55, p<0.003), and have higher mortality (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.01C 2.33, p=0.04) compared to the non-asthma cohort.

However, the data comparing between these two vaccines in the same setting are limited. Objectives: To determine adverse events (AEs) and immunogenicity of CoronaVac and ChAdOx1 in health care workers (HCWs). Design: This prospective study was conducted from February to July 2021. Setting: A single center, university-based tertiary care center in Bangkok. Participants: Healthy HCWs. Exposure: Two doses of CoronaVac (4 weeks apart) or ChAdOx1 (8 weeks apart) intramuscularly. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported AEs were collected for 7 days following each vaccination using electronic diary. The immunogenicity was determined by the level of IgG antibodies against receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 subunit). The 50% plaque reduction neutralization tests against original Wuhan strain and circulating VOCs were performed in subset of samples at 2 weeks after the second dose. Results: Of the 360 HCWs, 180 received each vaccine. The median (interquartile range: IQR) age was 35 (29-44) years old and 84.2% were female. Participants who received ChAdOx1 reported higher frequency of AEs than those received CoronaVac after both the first dose (84.4% vs. 66.1%, P < 0.001) and second dose (75.6% vs. 60.6%, P = 0.002), with more AEs in those younger than 30 years of age for both vaccines. The seroconversion rate was 75.6% and 100% following the first dose of CoronaVac and ChAdOx1, respectively. All participants seroconverted at 2 weeks after the second dose. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels induced by CoronaVac was lower than ChAdOX1 with geometric means of 164.4 and 278.5 BAU/mL, respectively (P = 0.0066). Both vaccines induced similar levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan strain, geometric mean titer (GMT) of 337.4 vs 331.2; however, CoronaVac induced significantly lower GMT against Alpha (23.1 vs. 92.5), Delta (21.2 vs. 69.7), and Beta (10.2 vs. 43.6) variants, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: CoronaVac induces lower measurable antibodies but with lower frequency of AEs than ChAdOx1. The low neutralizing antibodies against the circulating VOCs induced by CoronaVac supports the need for earlier boosting to prevent breakthrough infections.

Few reports exist in Latin America, a current epicenter of transmission. Here, we aim to describe the epidemiology and outcomes associated with COVID-19 in Honduras. METHODS: Baseline clinical and epidemiological information of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases detected between March 17th-May 4th in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan area was collected, and, for hospitalized cases, clinical data was abstracted. Logistic regression models were fit to determine factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: 877 COVID-19 cases were identified of which 25% (n=220) were hospitalized. The 19-44-year age group (57.8%) and males (61.3%) were predominant in overall COVID-19 cases. 34% of the cases (n=299) had at least one pre-existing medical condition. Individuals aged 45-69 years [aOR= 4.05, 95% CI: 2.85-5.76], &#8805;70 years [aOR= 9.12, 95% CI:5.24-15.86], of male sex [aOR =1.72, CI 95%: 1.21-2.44] and those with a pre-existing condition [aOR= 2.12, 95% CI: 1.43-3.14] had a higher odd of hospitalization.

Their first IUI was performed 1 month earlier when the semen parameters were normal. A couple of weeks before the second IUI, the unvaccinated 48-year-old male partner contracted COVID-19 and was admitted to the hospital for several days. He received IV Remdesivir and continuous oxygen by nasal cannula. His hospitalization did not require intubation or intensive care unit admission. He was discharged after 12 days of hospitalization without home oxygen treatment. On the day of the second IUI, the semen analysis showed a normal sperm count with 0% motility. Three months following his COVID-19 diagnosis, a repeat semen analysis showed restored normal parameters with more than 40% motility.

SETTING: Five hospitals in the Maryland and Washington, DC, area. PATIENTS: 832 consecutive COVID-19 admissions from 4 March to 24 April 2020, with follow-up through 27 June 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Patient trajectories and outcomes, categorized by using the World Health Organization COVID-19 disease severity scale. Primary outcomes were death and a composite of severe disease or death. RESULTS: Median patient age was 64 years (range, 1 to 108 years); 47% were women, 40% were Black, 16% were Latinx, and 21% were nursing home residents. Among all patients, 131 (16%) died and 694 (83%) were discharged (523 [63%] had mild to moderate disease and 171 [20%] had severe disease). Of deaths, 66 (50%) were nursing home residents. Of 787 patients admitted with mild to moderate disease, 302 (38%) progressed to severe disease or death: 181 (60%) by day 2 and 238 (79%) by day 4. Patients had markedly different probabilities of disease progression on the basis of age, nursing home residence, comorbid conditions, obesity, respiratory symptoms, respiratory rate, fever, absolute lymphocyte count, hypoalbuminemia, troponin level, and C-reactive protein level and the interactions among these factors. Using only factors present on admission, a model to predict in-hospital disease progression had an area under the curve of 0.85, 0.79, and 0.79, at day 2, 4, and 7, respectively.

With the onset and spread of Covid-19, the attention of the health care system has pivoted to handling the disease, potentially at the cost of other health care needs. This paper explores whether this shift has come at the cost of non-Covid related health care, especially the use of MCH services. MethodsGraphs, descriptive statistics and paired t-tests of significance are used to compare levels of inpatient and outpatient health care service utilization before and after the onset and spread of the virus. The analysis is based on a survey of 59 health centers and 29 public hospitals located in urban Ethiopia - the most acutely affected region of the country. Data on the use of health care services for a period of 24 months was gathered from the health management information systems (HMIS) of these facilities. ResultsThere is a sharp reduction in the use of both inpatient (20-27%) and outpatient (27-34%) care, particularly in Addis Ababa, which has been most acutely affected by the virus. However, the decline does not come at the cost of MCH services. The use of several MCH components (skilled birth attendant deliveries, immunization, post-natal care) remains unaffected throughout the period while others (family planning services, ante-natal care) experience a decline (8-17%) in the immediate aftermath but recover soon after. ConclusionConcerns about the crowding out of MCH services due to the focus on Covid 19 are unfounded. Pro-active measures taken by the government and health care facilities to ring-fence the use of essential health care services have mitigated service disruptions.

In the present study we evaluated a surface-anchored polymeric quaternary ammonium antimicrobial to help reduce fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from contaminated surfaces. Methods: Two studies were performed on antimicrobial pre-treated metal disks in March 2020 by two independent Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) equipped laboratories in April 2020.

The designed Janus multilayered membrane (15 m) of superhydrophilic-hydrolyzed-polyacrylonitrile (HPAN)/polyurethane (PU)/Ag nanowire (AgNW) can quickly (less than 5 s) drive sweat away from the skin/electrode interface while resisting its penetration in the reverse direction. Along with the medical adhesive (MA)-reinforced junction-nodes, the adhesion strength among the heterogeneous interfaces can be greatly enhanced for robust mechanical-electrical stability. Therefore, their measured on-body electromyography (EMG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals are free of sweat artifacts with negligible degradation and baseline drift compared to commercial Ag/AgCl gel electrodes and hydrophilic textile electrodes. This work paves a way to design novel directional-sweat-permeable epidermal electronics that can be conformally attached under sweaty conditions for long-term biopotential monitoring and shows the potential to apply epidermal electronics to many challenging conditions.","output":"All-Nanofiber-Based Janus Epidermal Electrode with Directional Sweat Permeability for Artifact-Free Biopotential Monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 14 million cases and more than half million deaths. Given the absence of implemented therapies, new analysis, diagnosis, and therapeutics are of great importance. RESULTS: Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the current outbreak reveals the presence of short persistent DNA/RNA sequences that are absent from the human genome and transcriptome (PmRAWs). For the PmRAWs with length 12, only four exist at the same location in all SARS-CoV-2. At the gene level, we found one PmRAW of size 13 at the Spike glycoprotein coding sequence. This protein is fundamental for binding in human ACE2 and further use as an entry receptor to invade target cells. Applying protein structural prediction, we localized this PmRAW at the surface of the Spike protein, providing a potential targeted vector for diagnostics and therapeutics. Additionally, we show a new pattern of relative absent words (RAWs), characterized by the progressive increase of GC content (Guanine and Cytosine) according to the decrease of RAWs length, contrarily to the virus and host genome distributions. New analysis shows the same property during the Ebola virus outbreak. At a computational level, we improved the alignment-free method to identify pathogen-specific signatures in balance with GC measures and removed previous size limitations.

A reorganization of healthcare activity has been necessary, limiting surgical activity to essential cases (emergencies and oncology), and improving the distribution of health resources. Objective To analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on head and neck cancer surgery management in Spain. Methods A cross-sectional study, through an anonymous and voluntary online survey distributed to 76 Spanish otorhinolaryngology departments. Results A total of 44 centers completed the survey, 65.9% of which were high-volume. A total of 45.5% of them had to stop high-priority surgery and 54.5% of head and neck surgeons were relocated outside their scope of practice. Surgeons reported not feeling safe during their usual practice, with a decrease to a 25% of airway procedures. A total of 29.5% were forced to deviate from the standard of care due to the epidemiological situation. Conclusions Approximately half of the departments decreased their activity, not treating their patients on a regular basis, and surgeons were reassigned to other tasks. It seems necessary that the head and neck surgeons balance infection risk with patient care. The consequences of the reported delays and changes in daily practice should be evaluated in the future in order to understand the real impact of the pandemic on the survival of head and neck cancer patients.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and its Impact on the Management of Head and Neck Cancer in the Spanish Healthcare System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Azoxy compounds belong to a small yet intriguing group of natural products sharing a common functional group with the general structure RNa??N+(O-)R.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the degree to which the CCI predicts survival in patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-two (34 men, 48 women) consecutive RFA treatments for medically inoperable NSCLC were performed at our institution from 1/1/2000 to 1/30/2009. With institutional IRB approval and in full HIPAA compliance, the medical records of these patients were examined for data relating to pre-treatment comorbid conditions, and a retrospective analysis was conducted. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors for mortality were determined by single-factor comparisons of curves using Wilcoxon-weighted chi-square and multiple Cox regressions. RESULTS The patients ranged in age from 59 to 91 years (mean: 75.5). Eighty-eight percent (72 patients) were tumor stage IA or IB. Patients were followed for a total of five years; three-year overall survival was 50.6%. Hospital mortality was 0%. Gender, stage, histology and CCI score were each associated with significantly impaired survival (p<0.001 in all cases). After covarying for age, tumor stage>IB, squamous histology and gender, multiple Cox regressions showed that an increasing CCI score was significantly associated with an increased risk of death (HR 1.3, 95% CI 25.5, 58.2).

Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this parameter we recover the generalized Logistic model used in [1] for these three countries.

Nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is common and is associated with VTE events. Our objective was to determine whether nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is more common in patients with COVID-19 versus other hospitalized patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis of all adult patients discharged from the Johns hopkins hospital between Mar 1 and May 12, 2020, we compared demographic, clinical characteristics, VTE outcomes, prescription and administration of VTE prophylaxis between COVID-19 positive, negative, and not tested groups. RESULTS: Patients tested positive for COVID-19 were significantly older, and more likely to be Hispanic, have a higher median body mass index, have longer hospital length of stay, require mechanical ventilation, develop pulmonary embolism and die (all p < 0.001). COVID-19 patients were more likely to be prescribed (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.38-1.66) and receive all doses of prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.36-1.62). The number of patients who missed at least one dose of VTE prophylaxis and developed VTE was similar between the three groups (p = 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that high rates of VTE in COVID-19 are due to nonadministration of doses of pharmacologic prophylaxis.

IFITM proteins deter HIV-1 entry when expressed in target cells and also impair HIV-1 infectivity when expressed in virus producer cells. However, little is known about how viruses resist IFITM inhibition. In this study, we have investigated the susceptibilities of different primary isolates of HIV-1 to the inhibition of viral infectivity by IFITMs. Our results demonstrate that the infectivity of different HIV-1 primary isolates, including transmitted founder viruses, is diminished by IFITM3 to various levels, with strain AD8-1 exhibiting strong resistance. Further mutagenesis studies revealed that HIV-1 Env, and the V3 loop sequence in particular, determines the extent of inhibition of viral infectivity by IFITM3. IFITM3-sensitive Env proteins are also more susceptible to neutralization by soluble CD4 or the 17b antibody than are IFITM3-resistant Env proteins. Together, data from our study suggest that the propensity of HIV-1 Env to sample CD4-bound-like conformations modulates viral sensitivity to IFITM3 inhibition.IMPORTANCE Results of our study have revealed the key features of the HIV-1 envelope protein that are associated with viral resistance to the IFITM3 protein. IFITM proteins are important effectors in interferon-mediated antiviral defense. A variety of viruses are inhibited by IFITMs at the virus entry step. Although it is known that envelope proteins of several different viruses resist IFITM inhibition, the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. Taking advantage of the fact that envelope proteins of different HIV-1 strains exhibit different degrees of resistance to IFITM3 and that these HIV-1 envelope proteins share the same domain structure and similar sequences, we performed mutagenesis studies and determined the key role of the V3 loop in this viral resistance phenotype. We were also able to associate viral resistance to IFITM3 inhibition with the susceptibility of HIV-1 to inhibition by soluble CD4 and the 17b antibody that recognizes CD4-binding-induced epitopes.","output":"The V3 Loop of HIV-1 Env Determines Viral Susceptibility to IFITM3 Impairment of Viral Infectivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, nurses have experienced changes to the moral conditions of their work during coronavirus outbreaks.

The safety endpoint was any complication and/or presentation to hospital in the 48-hours and at 30 days post discharge. We performed an economic analysis to calculate potential cost saving. RESULTS Among a total population of 2628 patients, we identified 727 subjects (61.112.5 years, 69.6% male) undergoing day-case AF ablation. Cryoballoon technique was used in 79.2% of the day-cases, and 91.6% of the procedures were performed under conscious sedation. 1.8% (13) of the participants met the safety composite endpoint at 48-hour, however only 0.7% (5) required at least one day of hospitalisation.

SUMMARY The recent appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on the general population. Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable. We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology. Material and methods: The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020. It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an \\"online\\" registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact. acquainted with another patient. Results: As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of TRS is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids. Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.","output":"Situacin de la infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 en pacientes en tratamiento renal sustitutivo Informe del Registro COVID-19 de la Sociedad Espa?ola de Nefrologa (S.E.N.)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses the international quest to develop an effective vaccine to tackle this pandemic disease Topics discussed include discusses the international quest to develop an effective vaccine to tackle this pandemic disease;natural reservoir for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic viruses;and the vaccine will provide long-term immunity to this particular strain of Coronavirus or indeed future variants","output":"Can a vaccine for COVID-19 be developed?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this document, we describe the experience of teaching Agile Methods for developing projects related to the Linux Kernel, during the XP Lab course.

In addition, a telementoring program (Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) was initiated to strengthen the HIV provider workforce in Georgia. METHODS A total of 60 telemedicine solutions have been deployed in Georgia, including 8 during the COVID-19 pandemic, to expand HIV care access in 12 of 18 Georgia health districts. Community providers were also able to access Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes for remote training and consultation.

However, there is no definitive information regarding the type of clinical specimens that is the best for SARS-CoV-2 detection, the antibody levels in patients with different duration of disease, and the relationship between antibody level and viral load. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs, anal swabs, saliva, blood, and urine specimens were collected from patients with a course of disease ranging from 7 to 69 days. Viral load in different specimen types was measured using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Meanwhile, anti-nucleocapsid protein (anti-N) IgM and IgG antibodies and anti-spike protein receptor-binding domain (anti-S-RBD) IgG antibody in all serum samples were tested using ELISA. RESULTS: The positive detection rate in nasopharyngeal swab was the highest (54.05%), followed by anal swab (24.32%), and the positive detection rate in saliva, blood, and urine was 16.22%, 10.81%, and 5.41%, respectively. However, some patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs had other specimens tested positive. There was no significant correlation between antibody level and days after symptoms onset or viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Other specimens could be positive in patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs, suggesting that for patients in the recovery period, specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs should also be tested to avoid false negative results, and anal swabs are recommended. The antibody level had no correlation with days after symptoms onset or the viral load of nasopharyngeal swabs, suggesting that the antibody level may also be affected by other factors.","output":"Analysis of viral load in different specimen types and serum antibody levels of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most important tasks for decision-making systems is obvious and intuitive visualization of input data If they are displayed correctly and conveniently, this tool can become a very serious assistant for a decision-maker Such a tool influences not only on the complexity of the decision-making process, but also the correctness and objectivity of the decisions made Because of this so much attention is paid to this issue in various studies However, nowadays the issue of displaying the dynamics of changes in structured data (data in which the observed value has an internal structure and consists of a large number of components) is not sufficiently developed This paper focuses on these issues, provides a formal description of structured data, and suggests an approach to displaying the dynamics of their changes The proposed approach to visualization allows to see both the general process of changing the observed value and the nature of changes in its internal structure Separate charts give the opportunity to see the contribution of each component of a structured value and evaluate the dynamics of this contribution over time The paper also shows the area of potential application of this approach, highlights its features and main prospects Most of examples in the paper are based on the developed software package for modeling the situation with the spread of COVID-19 in Bryansk region, which used the proposed visualization option There are also examples in which the proposed approach to visualization helps to get new information that is not visible when using other approaches to displaying structured data ? 2020 National Research Nuclear University All rights reserved","output":"Visual analysis of dynamic changes in structured data on the basis of colour markers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: More evidence in understanding the heterogeneity of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in improving strategy to increase the survival from the critical patients intubated is always needed. The study aimed to comprehensively explore the features of COVID-19-associated ARDS and the features and outcomes between the early and late intubation groups. Methods: : This retrospective cohort included 65 adult COVID-19 inpatients with ARDS at two hospitals in Hubei, China. The ARDS in these patients was diagnosed according to the Berlin criteria. We defined intubation within 7 days of ARDS diagnosis as early intubation and that performed from the eighth day as late intubation based on literatures. The outcomes were invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death. The log-binomial regression models were used to explore the risk factors and the Kaplan-Meier statistic was used to estimate the risk of mortality. Results: : The median number of days from symptom onset to ARDS diagnosis was 11.0 (IQR, 8.0C13.0). Up to 84.1% COVID-19-related ARDS patients demonstrated multiple organ injuries. The mortality rates were 41.9% and 85.7% in moderate and severe ARDS. The early intubation and the late intubation had the differences in days from symptom onset/hospital admission/ARDS diagnosis to intubation (P = 0.023, P = 0.011, P < 0.001). Compared with the early-intubation group, the late-intubation group showed less severity at admission (median oxygenation index 159.0 95% CI 134.0-203.0 vs. 133.9 95% CI 98.3-183.2), but required more aggressive therapies (ICU 80% vs. 70%, CRRT 50% vs. 10%, prone-position 50% vs. 30%, and ECMO 50% vs. 10%) and had higher risk to die at hospital (RR, 3.18;95% CI 1.98-5.12). Conclusion: The ARDS caused by COVID-19 was not typical ARDS due to prolonged onset time, multiple organ injuries, and higher mortalities.

We examine the potential for using data from secondary cases, identified through transmission studies or contact tracing of index cases, to characterize disease severity.Methods: We extracted information on reported symptoms, disease severity and fatality risk among index cases and secondary cases, from previous reviews of contact tracing studies for pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared severity profiles between index cases and secondary cases and inferred the potential for ascertainment bias in confirmed cases.Findings. Overall, index cases had more severe illness on average than secondary cases, for each disease. For COVID-19 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, the proportions of index cases with fever and cough were 1.3-fold to 1.6-fold higher than for secondary cases. For COVID-19, the proportion of index cases with asymptomatic infection, severe/critical illness and death were 54% lower, 39% higher and 82% higher than for secondary cases, respectively. For MERS, the fatality risk among index cases was 73% higher than for secondary cases. For COVID-19 in China, we estimated that 68% (95% Credible interval (CrI): 43%, 85%) and 56% (95% CrI: 42%, 68%) of index cases were missed due to ascertainment bias, for Guangzhou and Wuhan, respectively.Interpretation: Information on disease severity in secondary cases should be less susceptible to ascertainment bias and could inform estimates of disease severity and the proportion of missed index cases.Funding: This project was supported by the Health and Medical Research Fund, Food andHealth Bureau, Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (grant no.

Understanding perceived trust in information sources and associated mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic is vital to ensure ongoing media coverage of the crisis does not exacerbate mental health impacts. A number of studies have been conducted in other parts of the world to determine associations between information exposure relating to COVID-19 and mental health. However, the mechanism by which trust in information sources may affect mental health is not fully explained in the developing country context. To address this issue, the present study examined associations between perceived trust in three sources of information concerning COVID-19 and anxiety/stress with the mediating effects of COVID-19 stress in Bangladesh. An online cross-sectional study was conducted with 744 Bangladeshi adults between 17 April and 1 May 2020. Perceived trust in traditional, social, and health media for COVID-19 information, demographics, frontline service status, COVID-19-related stressors, anxiety (GAD-7), and stress (PSS-4) were assessed via self-report. Linear regression tested for associations between perceived trust and mental health. Mediation analyses investigated whether COVID-19-related stressors affected perceived trust and mental health associations. In fully adjusted models, more trust in social media was associated with more anxiety (B = 0.03, CI = 0.27C0.97) and stress (B = 0.01, CI = ?0.34C0.47), while more trust in traditional media was associated with more anxiety (B = 0.09, CI = 0.17C2.26) but less stress (B = ?0.08, CI = ?0.89C0.03). Mediation analyses showed that COVID-19-related stressors partially explained associations between perceived trust and anxiety. These findings suggest that trusting social media to provide accurate COVID-19 information may exacerbate poor mental health. These findings also indicate that trusting traditional media (i.e., television, radio, and the newspaper) may have stress-buffering effects. We recommend that responsible authorities call attention to concerns about the trustworthiness of social media as well as broadcast positive and authentic news in traditional media outcomes based on these results.","output":"Association between Perceived Trusted of COVID-19 Information Sources and Mental Health during the Early Stage of the Pandemic in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this work is to analytically simulate the mutual impact for the existence of both temporal and spatial Caputo fractional derivative parameters in higher-dimensional physical models.

Areas covered: Various complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified, the most lethal being the acute respiratory distress syndrome, caused most likely by the presence of severe immune cell response and the concomitant alveolus inflammation. The authors carried out an extensive and comprehensive literature review on SARS-CoV-2 infection, the clinical, pathological and radiological presentation as well as the current treatment strategies. Expert Opinion Elevation of inflammatory biomarkers is a common trend among seriously ill patients. The information available strongly suggests that in COVID-19 patients, their altered immune response, including a massive cytokine storm, is responsible for the further damage evidenced among ARDS patients. The increasingly high number of scientific articles and evidence available can only suggest that the individualization of each case is the norm, not all patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 meet the Berlin definition and therefore ARDS should be considered as a heterogeneous disease, with a wide range in the expression of its severity and clinical manifestations.","output":"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Caused by the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Practical Comprehensive Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ABSTRACT] At the time of writing (25 May 2020), there have been nearly 4.4 million infections and 300,000 deaths worldwide related to COVID-19, an infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Automated classification of lung infections from chest X-ray (CXR) images strengthened traditional healthcare strategy to handle COVID-19. However, classifying COVID-19 from pneumonia cases using CXR image is challenging because of shared spatial characteristics, high feature variation in infections and contrast diversity between cases. Moreover, massive data collection is impractical for a newly emerged disease, which limited the performance of common deep learning models. To address this challenging topic, Multiscale Attention Guided deep network with Soft Distance regularization (MAG-SD) is proposed to automatically classify COVID-19 from pneumonia CXR images. In MAG-SD, MA-Net is used to produce prediction vector and attention map from multiscale feature maps. To relieve the shortage of training data, attention guided augmentations along with a soft distance regularization are posed, which requires a few labeled data to generate meaningful augmentations and reduce noise.

The cohort was divided into two groups, with the non-obese group having a BMI < 30 kg/m(2) and the obese group with a BMI  30 kg/m(2). Clinical predictors of mortality were assessed using multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 469 (AA) patients included in the study, 56.3% (n = 264) had a BMI < 30 kg/m(2) and 43.7% (n = 205) had a BMI  30 kg/m(2).

We investigated the causal relationship between natriuretic peptides and AF as well as HF using a Mendelian randomization approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (N = 6669), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (N = 6674), and mid-regional pro atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) (N = 6813) were measured in the FINRISK 1997 cohort. N = 30 common SNPs related to NT-proBNP, BNP, and MR-proANP were selected from studies. We performed six Mendelian randomizations for all three natriuretic peptide biomarkers and for both outcomes, AF and HF, separately. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) based on multiple SNPs were used as genetic instrumental variable in Mendelian randomizations. Polygenic risk scores were significantly associated with the three natriuretic peptides. Polygenic risk scores were not significantly associated with incident AF nor HF. Most cardiovascular risk factors showed significant confounding percentages, but no association with PRS. A causal relation except for small causal betas is unlikely. CONCLUSION: In our Mendelian randomization approach, we confirmed an association between common genetic variation at the NPPA-NPPB locus and natriuretic peptides.

Worryingly, the QAnon conspiracy theory has implications in the real world, with supporters of the theory participating in real-world violent acts like the US capitol attack in 2021. At the same time, the QAnon theory started evolving into a global phenomenon by attracting followers across the globe and, in particular, in Europe. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how the QAnon theory became a worldwide phenomenon and how this dissemination has been happening in the online space. This paper performs a large-scale data analysis of QAnon through Telegram by collecting 4.5M messages posted in 161 QAnon groups/channels. Using Google's Perspective API, we analyze the toxicity of QAnon content across languages and over time. Also, using a BERT-based topic modeling approach, we analyze the QAnon discourse across multiple languages. Among other things, we find that the German language is prevalent in QAnon groups/channels on Telegram, even overshadowing English after 2020. Also, we find that content posted in German and Portuguese tends to be more toxic compared to English. Our topic modeling indicates that QAnon supporters discuss various topics of interest within far-right movements, including world politics, conspiracy theories, COVID-19, and the anti-vaccination movement. Taken all together, we perform the first multilingual study on QAnon through Telegram and paint a nuanced overview of the globalization of the QAnon theory.","output":"On the Globalization of the QAnon Conspiracy Theory Through Telegram"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION mites allergic asthma is caused by exposure to home dust mite (HDM). Der f 3 is believed to be one of the major allergens in mites allergic asthma. The work was to identify the immune characteristics of Der f 3 epitope-based vaccine containing T cell and B cell epitopes. METHODS T cell lines were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Der f 3 allergic patients. Three T cell epitopes and five B cell epitopes of Der f 3, which we identified previously, were selected to design a polypeptide (named Der f3-peptides). DNA constructions encoding these Der f 3-peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli. The T cell lines were stimulated with the peptides and tested for proliferative capacity and cytokine production. RESULTS plasmid pET28a (+)-Der f 3-peptides was constructed and expressed in E. coli BL21, and the Der f3-peptides protein was purified and confirmed by Western blotting. The Der f 3-peptides were recognized by the T cell clones from allergic patients. SI value of Der f 3 group and Der f 3-peptides group were both higher than that of PBS group (P<0.05). The Der f 3 and Der f 3 peptides induced secretions of IL-4 and IL-5 were decreased compared with that of PBS group (P<0.05). The capacity of IgE-binding to Der f 3-peptides (41.255.67) g/ml was decreased dramatically compared with that of Der f 3 (83.60  10.92) g/ml (P < 0.05).

This study focused on two viral proteases namely main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-2) to identify which of these are essential for viral replication. We screened 102 secondary metabolites against SARS-CoV-2 isolated from 36 terrestrial plants and 36 marine organisms from Indonesian biodiversity. These organisms are typically presumed to have antiviral effects, and some of them have been used as an immunomodulatory activity in traditional medicine. For the molecular docking procedure to obtain Gibbs free energy value (AG), toxicity, ADME and Lipinski, AutoDock Vina was used. In this study, five secondary metabolites, namely co-rilagin, dieckol, phlorofucofuroeckol A, proanthocyanidins, and isovitexin, were found to inhibit ACE-2, Mpro, and PLpro receptors in SARS-CoV-2, with a high affinity to the same sites of ptilidepsin, remdesivir, and chloroquine as the control molecules. This study was delimited to molecular docking without any validation by simulations concerned with molecular dynamics.

English Abstract: The economic crisis, caused by the Pandemic of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), has a significant impact on purchasing practices and the way consumers justify their consumption patterns. Particularly in the field of fashion, consumers face a conflict between the desire to consume due to rapid changes in fashion trends and facing the decrease in purchasing power due to the installed crisis. The aim of this research is to analyze how the current economic crisis has affected consumers' fashion consumption behavior and what alternative consumption practices have emerged. To achieve the research objective, twenty semi-structured interviews were used during the months of April and May 2020. The survey also clarifies the underlying feelings involved due to changes in consumption patterns. Some of the themes that emerge;reuse, reduce and reject, which are in line with previous findings on anti-consumption, but this time the reasons for consumers are not voluntary, but caused by a general health crisis with economic consequences. The study also shows that there are positive and negative feelings associated with changes in consumer behavior due to the current economic crisis. Together with the understanding of adaptations in consumption behavior, anticipating these conflicting emotions resulting from crisis-related anti-consumption is important for marketers and retailers concerned with developing appropriate response strategies for the post-Pandemic of COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and Anti-consumption: An Analysis of the Effects of Pandemic on the Fashion Industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in the fecal matter of COVID-19 patients. However, sewage transmission has never been shown. In April 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak occurred in a densely populated community in Guangzhou, China. We investigated this outbreak to identify the mode of transmission. METHOD: A home quarantined order was issued in the community. We collected throat swab samples from the residents and environmental samples from the surfaces inside and around the houses, and conducted RT-PCR testing and genome sequencing. We defined a case as a resident in this community with a positive RT-PCR test, with or without symptoms. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all residents living in the same buildings as the cases to identify exposure risk factors. RESULT: We found eight cases (four couples) in this community of 2888 residents (attack rate=2.8/1000), with onset during April 5-21, 2020. During their incubation periods, Cases 1-2 frequented market T with an ongoing outbreak. Cases 3-8 never visited market T during incubation period, lived in separate buildings from, and never interacted with, Cases 1-2. Retrospective cohort study showed that working as cleaners or waste picker (RR=13, 95% CIexact: 2.3-180), not changing to clean shoes after returning home (RR=7.4, 95% CIexact: 1.8-34), collating and cleaning dirty shoes after returning home (RR=6.3, 95% CIexact: 1.4-30) were significant exposure risk factors. Of 63 samples collected from street-sewage puddles and sewage-pipe surfaces, 19% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of 50 environmental samples taken from cases' apartments, 24% tested positive. Viral genome sequencing showed that the viruses identified from the squat toilet and shoe-bottom dirt inside the apartment of Cases 1-2 were homologous with those from Cases 3-8 and those identified from sewage samples. The sewage pipe leading from the apartment of Cases 1-2 to the drainage had a large hole above ground. Rainfalls after the onset of Cases 1-2 flooded the streets. CONCLUSION: Our investigation has for the first time pointed to the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 might spread by sewage. This finding highlighted the importance of sewage management, especially in densely-populated places with poor hygiene and sanitation measures, such as urban slums and other low-income communities in developing countries.","output":"Sewage as a Possible Transmission Vehicle During a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak in a Densely populated Community: Guangzhou, China, April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study aimed to explore experiences of awaiting a test result for COVID-19 among individuals from the general population. METHODS: Fifteen participants were recruited from COVID-19 testing tents in the Capital Region of Denmark in March and April 2020. A phenomenological-hermeneutic approach inspired by Ricoeur's theory of interpretation was used. RESULTS: The analysis revealed five themes. (1) The participants' experiences of awaiting a COVID-19 test result illuminated concerns related to infecting others rather than their own health. Experiences of guilt for not taking all possible precautions to avoid the spread of COVID-19 were described and thoughts of potentially having exposed others bothered the participants. (2) The test result would guide their precautions and therefore regulate behaviour at home and in society. (3) Even though the participants did not take all possible precautions they made some changes in their everyday lives. (4) Leaving the individual with the responsibility for taking precautions based on their subjective experiences created feelings of insecurity and uncertainty. (5) Being met by health professionals was an experience that meant for the particpants that behaviour towards limiting the infection became very clear. The seriousness experienced around the test situation facilitated this attitude and behaviour in the participants. Conclusion: This study illuminated how testing for COVID-19 regulates behavior in the general population. The testing was both important for the individual's cautious behavior towards other people, work and in getting around in society but also a way to regulate behavior from a societal perspective to quicken suppression and avoid transmission of COVID-19.","output":"Testing for COVID-19 regulates behavior in the general population: A qualitative study of experiences of awaiting test result for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Identifying the factors influencing the preventive practices of the healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) because the HCWs are exposed to unparalleled levels of risks.

High throughput extraction of radiomic features on these images can potentially phenotype tumors non-invasively and support risk stratification based on survival outcome prediction. The prognostic value of radiomics from different imaging modalities and time points prior to and during chemoradiation therapy of NSCLC, relative to conventional imaging biomarker or delta radiomics models, remains uncharacterized. We investigated the utility of multitask learning of multi-time point radiomic features, as opposed to single-task learning, for improving survival outcome prediction relative to conventional clinical imaging feature model benchmarks. Survival outcomes were prospectively collected for 45 patients with unresectable NSCLC enrolled on the FLARE-RT phase II trial of risk-adaptive chemoradiation and optional consolidation PD-L1 checkpoint blockade (NCT02773238). FDG-PET, CT, and perfusion SPECT imaging pretreatment and week 3 mid-treatment was performed and 110 IBSI-compliant pyradiomics shape-/intensity-/texture-based features from the metabolic tumor volume were extracted. Outcome modeling consisted of a fused Laplacian sparse group LASSO with component-wise gradient boosting survival regression in a multitask learning framework. Testing performance under stratified 10-fold cross-validation was evaluated for multitask learning radiomics of different imaging modalities and time points. Multitask learning models were benchmarked against conventional clinical imaging and delta radiomics models and evaluated with the concordance index (c-index) and index of prediction accuracy (IPA). FDG-PET radiomics had higher prognostic value for overall survival in test folds (c-index 0.71 [0.67, 0.75]) than CT radiomics (c-index 0.64 [0.60, 0.71]) or perfusion SPECT radiomics (c-index 0.60 [0.57, 0.63]). Multitask learning of pre-/mid-treatment FDG-PET radiomics (c-index 0.71 [0.67, 0.75]) outperformed benchmark clinical imaging (c-index 0.65 [0.59, 0.71]) and FDG-PET delta radiomics (c-index 0.52 [0.48, 0.58]) models. Similarly, the IPA for multitask learning FDG-PET radiomics (30%) was higher than clinical imaging (26%) and delta radiomics (15%) models. Radiomics models performed consistently under different voxel resampling conditions. Multitask learning radiomics for outcome modeling provides a clinical decision support platform that leverages longitudinal imaging information. This framework can reveal the relative importance of different imaging modalities and time points when designing risk-adaptive cancer treatment strategies.","output":"Multitask Learning Radiomics on Longitudinal Imaging to Predict Survival Outcomes following Risk-Adaptive Chemoradiation for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE.

In this study, we first characterized the temporal trends of PM2.5 and O3 for Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan respectively during 2018-2020. The annual mean PM2.5 has decreased by 7.82%-33.92%, while O3 concentration showed insignificant variations by -6.77%-4.65% during 2018-2020. The generalized additive models (GAMs) were implemented to quantify the contribution of individual meteorological factors and their gas precursors on PM2.5 and O3. On a short-term perspective, GAMs modeling shows that the daily variability of PM2.5 concentration is largely related to the variation of precursor gases (R = 0.67-0.90), while meteorological conditions mainly affect the daily variability of O3 concentration (R = 0.65-0.80) during 2018-2020. The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on PM2.5 and O3 concentrations were also quantified by using GAMs. During the 2020 lockdown, PM2.5 decreased significantly for these megacities, yet the ozone concentration showed an increasing trend compared to 2019. The GAMs analysis indicated that the contribution of precursor gases to PM2.5 and O3 changes is 3-8 times higher than that of meteorological factors.

Recently, tissue sealing-cutting devices, which are easy to use and achieve simultaneous selective sealing and cutting with less production of heat, have been used. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a tissue sealing-cutting device vs monopolar electrocautery on wound healing in the early postoperative period after pilonidal sinus surgery. DESIGN This study was a prospective randomized clinical trial. SETTING This study was conducted at Military Hospital, Eskisehir, Turkey. PATIENTS In total, 128 patients with chronic pilonidal disease were randomly assigned into 2 clinically comparable groups between December 2009 and June 2010. INTERVENTION Pilonidal sinus excision was performed with monopolar electrocautery in the control group (n = 64) and with a tissue sealing-cutting device in the study group (n = 64). Data regarding wound healing, demographic variables, history, physical examination findings, defect dimensions, and scores for a visual analog scale were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcomes measured were surgical site infection, early wound failure (dehiscence), and unhealed wound rate. RESULTS : Wound infection and dehiscence rates were significantly lower (P = .01 and .02), but the duration of surgery was significantly longer (P < .01) in the tissue sealing-cutting group. The unhealed wound rate was 12.5% in the electrocautery group and 4.7% in the tissue sealing-cutting group (P = .01). When the distance from the lowest margin to the anus was 5 cm or less, wound infection and dehiscence rates were lower in the tissue sealing-cutting group (P < .01 and .03).

Using panel data from the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC) and China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) over time span 2014C2018, this paper models the block maxima and minima of variables by fitting them with generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The binary expansion testing (BET) is used to detect the nonlinear dependence between digital finance and household economic variables. The tail quotient correlation coefficient (TQCC) is used to quantify the tail dependencies. The results show that: (1) digital finance has significant fairness effects in reducing poverty, increasing consumption, and promoting financial asset holding; (2) digital finance shows effects of promoting incentives and efficiency in household income and financial asset holding, but this effect is relatively limited in household consumption; (3) digital finance generally increases efficiency without harming fairness in terms of all cases of household income and consumption, and most of the cases regarding household financial asset holding; (4) the positive spatial externality of digital finance exists for all household economic variables; and, for pairs regarding household income and consumption, the wider the scope, the greater the spatial spillover effect.

A significantly higher white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum creatine (Cr), blood urine nitrogen (BUN) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and a significantly lower blood platelet (PLT), lymphocyte count, prealbumin and albumin (ALB) were detected in the cohort with renal insufficiency (P < 0.05). Patients with early renal impairment were also associated with higher incidences of haematuria/proteinuria, higher incidences of mortality and prolonged hospitalization duration. The independent risk factors for in-hospital death included age >65 years old, complication of diabetes, renal impairment on admission (Cr > 73 mol/L and eGFR < 60 ml/min 1.73 m2 ), WBC > 9.5  109 /L and ALB < 35 g/L. CONCLUSION Early renal impairment is associated with higher risk of in-hospital death for patients with COVID-19.

Objectives of the study were to investigate the effect of quarantine on sleep quality (SQ) and body mass index (BMI), and if change in SQ was related to working modalities. MATERIALS: We enrolled 121 adults (age 44.9  13.3 years and 35.5% males). Anthropometric parameters, working modalities and physical activity were studied. Sleep quality was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. At baseline, the enrolled subjects were assessed in outpatient clinic and after 40 days of quarantine/lockdown by phone interview. RESULTS: Overall, 49.6% of the subjects were good sleepers (PSQI < 5) at the baseline and significantly decreased after quarantine (p < 0.001). In detail, sleep onset latency (p < 0.001), sleep efficiency (p = 0.03), sleep disturbances (p < 0.001), and daytime dysfunction (p < 0.001) significantly worsened. There was also a significant increase in BMI values in normal weight (p = 0.023), in subjects grade I (p = 0.027) and II obesity (p = 0.020). In all cohort, physical activity was significantly decreased (p = 0.004). However, analyzing the data according gender difference, males significantly decreased physical activity as well as females in which there was only a trend without reaching statistical significance (53.5% vs 25.6%; p = 0.015 and 50.0% vs 35.9%, p = 0.106; in males and females, respectively). In addition, smart working activity resulted in a significant worsening of SQ, particularly in males (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Quarantine was associated to a worsening of SQ, particularly in males doing smart working, and to an increase in BMI values.","output":"Does Sars-Cov-2 threaten our dreams?

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the measures taken on the care for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAOD) and acute limb ischemia (ALI). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the vascular practices of two major teaching hospitals in the Netherlands was performed. All interventions and outpatient visits for PAOD or ALI in 2020 were included. Patients treated in 2018 and 2019 were to serve as a control group. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: In 2020, a total of 1513 procedures were performed for PAOD or ALI. This did not differ significantly from previous years. Overall, Fontaine 2 and 4 were the most frequent indications for intervention. A significant increase in the number of major amputations was observed in 2020 compared to 2018 (p <0.01). This was mainly due to patients suffering from PAOD Fontaine 4. Inversely, a reduction in the number of femoro-popliteal bypasses was observed between 2020 and 2018. The number of outpatient visit due to Fontaine 2 was significantly lower in 2020 compared to 2018. CONCLUSION: The vascular practices of our hospitals were minimally influenced by the measures taken due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

Its uniqueness and approximation have thus been thoroughly studied. The challenging problem of estimating the BTD model structure, namely the number of block terms (rank) and their individual (block) ranks, is of crucial importance in practice and has only recently started to attract significant attention. In data-streaming scenarios and/or big data applications, where the tensor dimension in one of its modes grows in time or can only be processed incrementally, it is essential to be able to perform model selection and computation in a recursive (incremental/online) manner. To date there is only one such work in the literature concerning the (general rank-$(L,M,N)$) BTD model, which proposes an incremental method, however with the BTD rank and block ranks assumed to be a-priori known and time invariant. In this preprint, a novel approach to rank-$(L_r,L_r,1)$ BTD model selection and tracking is proposed, based on the idea of imposing column sparsity jointly on the factors and estimating the ranks as the numbers of factor columns of nonnegligible magnitude. An online method of the alternating iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) type is developed and shown to be computationally efficient and fast converging, also allowing the model ranks to change in time. Its time and memory efficiency are evaluated and favorably compared with those of the batch approach. Simulation results are reported that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in both selecting and tracking the correct BTD model.","output":"Online Rank-Revealing Block-Term Tensor Decomposition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare technologies have seen a surge in utilization during the COVID 19 pandemic.

Digital twin is a triune concept that involves a physical model, a virtual counterpart, and the interplay between the two constructs. This interface between computer science and medicine is a new frontier with broad potential applications. We propose that digital twin technology can exhaustively and methodologically analyze the associations between a physical cancer patient and a corresponding digital counterpart with the goal of isolating predictors of neurological sequalae of disease. This proposition stems from the premise that data science can complement clinical acumen to scientifically inform the diagnostics, treatment planning and prognostication of cancer care.

Based on the current control measures, we proposed a dynamical transmission model with contact trace and quarantine and predicted the peak time and final size for daily confirmed infected cases by employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We estimate the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is 5.78 (95%CI: 5.71-5.89). Under the current intervention before 31 January, the number of daily confirmed infected cases is expected to peak on around 11 February 2020 with the size of 4066 (95%CI: 3898-4472).

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken to compare the medical records of patients with severe COVID-19 (53 deceased patients and 50 survivors). The survivors were selected from 222 records using a random number generator. In addition, 28 individuals who considered themselves to be healthy and who had no history of serious illness were included in the study for comparison. Oxygen saturation in arterial blood, oxygen saturation in central venous blood (ScvO(2)), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)), respiratory index (PaO(2)/fraction of inspired oxygen), oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption (VO(2)) and oxygen extraction (O(2)ER) were compared in all participants. The optimal cut-off point for each oxygen metabolism marker in the prediction of mortality was determined based on the maximum value of the Youden Index in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences in all studied oxygen metabolism markers were found between survivors compared with deceased patients (p < 0.001). ScvO(2), VO(2) and O(2)ER [area under curve (AUC) 1.0] were the strongest predictors of mortality, and PaO(2) was the weakest predictor of mortality (AUC 0.81).

METHODS: Data was obtained retrospectively from 366 hemodynamically stable adult ED patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients were categorized by largest occluded artery and aggregated into: Require anti-coagulation (main, lobar, and segmental PE), Does not require anti-coagulation (sub-segmental and No PE), High risk of deterioration (main and lobar PE), and Not high risk of deterioration (segmental, sub-segmental, and No PE) groups. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for 2 sample comparisons of median D-dimer concentrations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was utilized to determine a D-dimer cut-off that could differentiate Require anti-coagulation from Does not require anti-coagulation and High risk of deterioration from Low risk of deterioration groups. RESULTS: The Require anti-coagulation group had a maximum area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 at an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off of 1540 with a specificity of 86% (95% CI, 81C91%), and sensitivity of 84% (79C90%).

Initial therapy for DVT is anticoagulation, which inhibits thrombus propagation but lacks the thrombolytic properties to facilitate active thrombus removal. The existing thrombus burden can cause increased venous hypertension from occlusion as well as damage to venous valves by initiating an inflammatory response, which can ultimately result in PTS in up to half of patients on anticoagulation. The manifestations of PTS include leg pain, swelling, lifestyle-limiting venous claudication, skin hyperpigmentation, venous varicosities, and, in rare cases, venous stasis ulcers. Furthermore, patients with iliocaval DVT and large, free-floating thrombus are at an increased risk for pulmonary embolism despite adequate anticoagulation. Early attempts at thrombus removal with surgical thrombectomy or systemic thrombolysis or both demonstrated reductions in the incidence of PTS but were of limited utility owing to their invasiveness and increased risk of bleeding complications.

After lockdown, at first sight it seems that social distancing is not enough to control the outbreak. We discuss here a possible explanation, namely that the lockdown is creating social heterogeneity: even if a large majority of the population complies with the lockdown rules, a small fraction of the population still has to maintain a normal or high level of social interactions, such as health workers, providers of essential services, etc. This results in an apparent high level of epidemic propagation as measured through re-estimations of the basic reproduction ratio. However, these measures are limited to averages, while variance inside the population plays an essential role on the peak and the size of the epidemic outbreak and tends to lower these two indicators.

microparticles (WPMs) were used to substitute fats in model mayonnaises. WPMs were prepared by grinding the heat-set whey protein gel containing 10 mM CaCl2 into small particles (10-20 m). Then, 3  4 low-fat model mayonnaises were prepared by varying FG (0.3, 0.6, 0.9 wt%) and WPM (0, 8, 16, 24 wt%) concentrations. The effect of the addition of FG and WPMs on rheology, instrumental texture and sensory texture and their correlations were investigated. The results showed that all samples exhibited shear thinning behavior and 'weak gel' properties. Although both FG and WPMs enhanced rheological (e.g., viscosity and storage modulus) and textural properties (e.g., hardness, consistency, adhesiveness, cohesiveness) and kinetic stability, this enhancement was dominated by FG. FG and WPMs affected bulk properties through different mechanisms, (i.e., active filler and entangled polysaccharide networks). Panellists evaluated sensory texture in three stages: extra-oral, intra-oral and after-feel. Likewise, FG dominated sensory texture of model mayonnaises. With increasing FG concentration, sensory scores for creaminess and mouth-coating increased, whereas those of firmness, fluidity and spreadability decreased. Creaminess had a linear negative correlation with firmness, fluidity and spreadability (R2 > 0.985), while it had a linear positive correlation with mouth-coating (R2 > 0.97). A linear positive correlation (R2 > 0.975) was established between creaminess and viscosity at different shear rates/instrumental texture parameters.

Different organizations have recommended performing polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) as part of the preoperative screening of surgical patients. We aimed to determine the performance of PCR testing to detect asymptomatic carriers. Methods Observational study carried out at a tertiary care center. We compared the results of preoperative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR test (RT-PCR) performed on a cohort of patients pending surgery with the results we would have expected assuming the epidemiological data released by government offices. Results We registered no positives in the 2,722 preoperative RT-PCR tests performed in our health care area between epidemiological Weeks 18 to 21, meaning a cumulative incidence trending to zero. Assuming public epidemiological data, the probabilistic projection of potential asymptomatic individuals ranged from 0.27*10e -4 (according to official data of new cases diagnosed by PCR) to 4.69*10e -4 if we assumed cases confirmed by IgG test in our province. Assuming a RT-PCR sensitivity of 95%, to obtain a positive result we should perform 38,461 and 2,028 tests respectively. Conclusions In scenarios of very low prevalence and despite high sensitivity scores, indiscriminate preoperative RT-PCR screening is of a questionable effectiveness for detecting asymptomatic carriers.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays an important role in restricting neuroinvasion of peripheral leukocytes and virus, thereby regulating the progression of viral encephalitis. In this study, we explored the role of CD11c(hi) dendritic cells (DCs) in regulating BBB integrity and JE progression using a conditional depletion model of CD11c(hi) DCs. Transient ablation of CD11c(hi) DCs resulted in markedly increased susceptibility to JE progression along with highly increased neuro-invasion of JEV. In addition, exacerbated JE progression in CD11c(hi) DC-ablated hosts was closely associated with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-, IL-6, and TNF-) and CC chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2) in the brain. Moreover, our results revealed that the exacerbation of JE progression in CD11c(hi) DC-ablated hosts was correlated with enhanced BBB permeability and reduced expression of tight junction and adhesion molecules (claudin-5, ZO-1, occluding, JAMs). Ultimately, our data conclude that the ablation of CD11c(hi) DCs provided a subsidiary impact on BBB integrity and the expression of tight junction/adhesion molecules, thereby leading to exacerbated JE progression. These findings provide insight into the secondary role of CD11c(hi) DCs in JE progression through regulation of BBB integrity and the expression of tight junction/adhesion molecules.","output":"Ablation of CD11c(hi) dendritic cells exacerbates Japanese encephalitis by regulating blood-brain barrier permeability and altering tight junction/adhesion molecules."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Significant dropout rates remain a serious concern in pediatric weight control program, but few studies have identified predictors of dropout. AIMS: The objective of the study is to identify factors associated with dropout from a pediatric lifestyle modification weight control program at different phases. METHODS: Data on overweight and obese participants (n = 242) aged 11-18 years in the Intervention for Childhood and Adolescent Obesity via Activity and Nutrition (ICAAN) study were collected at baseline, 6-months, and 24-months through self-report and a laboratory test. Logistic regression analysis was performed for those who dropped out during the first 6-months, and multivariate generalized estimating equation analysis identified longitudinal factors associated with those who dropped out after 24 months.

A web-based survey was conducted by an electronic questionnaire collection platform; this survey that consisted of a 29-item questionnaire with 5-point Likert scales was completed by 934 respondents. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Item evaluation and reliability, validity, path loading, goodness of fit, and multiple group analysis were used to check the moderation effects. RESULTS: The standardized factor loadings of the items were between 0.551 and 0.873. The composite reliability of 9 constructs ranged from 0.706 to 0.840. The average variance extracted ranged from 0.387 to 0.640. The fitness indices showed that the collected data fitted well with the research model. Perceived usefulness was the strongest positive factor effecting behavior intention (=.399, P<.001). Perceived ease of use had a positive effect on behavior intention but it was not statistically significant (=.117, P=.07) and it had a positive effect on perceived usefulness (=.537, P<.001). Perceived risk could be well explained by financial risk (=.972, P<.001), privacy risk (=.774, P<.001), social risk (=.871, P<.001), time risk (=.894, P<0.001), and psychological risk (=.774, P<.001). Perceived risk had negative effects on perceived usefulness (=C.375, P<.001) and behavior intention (=C.297, P<.001). Personal innovativeness had a positive influence on perceived ease of use (=.241, P<.001) and a slight effect on behavior intention (=.124, P=.001). Age ((2)(58)=133.5, P<.001) and usage experience ((2)(58)=82.5, P=.02) had a slight moderation effect on the paths. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived usefulness and perceived risk have significant effects on public intention to use e-consultation. Therefore, platform and manufacturer must improve the function of e-consultation, which will promote the public intention to use e-consultation fundamentally. In order to control the perceived risk of public, government should play an important role in enforcing management of e-consultation markets and approving corresponding medical insurance policies. Besides, personal innovativeness had an effect on behavior intention. Moreover, the paths of factors had some heterogeneity among people with different characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the strategies to fit more groups better.","output":"Perceived Factors Influencing the Public Intention to Use E-Consultation: Analysis of Web-Based Survey Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a global impact that has been unevenly distributed amongst and, even within countries. Multiple demographic and environmental factors have been associated with the risk of COVID-19 spread and fatality, including age, gender, ethnicity, poverty, and air quality among others. However, specific contributions of these factors are yet to be understood. Here, we attempted to explain the variability in infection, death, and fatality rates by understanding the contributions of a few selected factors. We compared the incidence of COVID-19 in New York State (NYS) counties during the first wave of infection and analyzed how different demographic and environmental variables associate with the variation observed across the counties. We observed that the two important COVID-19 metrics of infection rates and death rates to be well correlated, and both metrics being highest in counties located near New York City, considered one of the epicenters of the infection in the US. In contrast, disease fatality was found to be highest in a different set of counties despite registering a low infection rate. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we divided the counties into three clusters based on COVID-19 infection, death rate, or fatality, and compared the differences in the demographic and environmental variables such as ethnicity, age, population density, poverty, temperature, and air quality in each of these clusters. Furthermore, a regression model built on this data reveals PM2.5 and distance from the epicenter are significant risk factors for high infection rate, while disease fatality has a strong association with age and PM2.5. Our results demonstrate, for the NYS, distinct contributions of old age, PM2.5, ethnicity these factors to the overall COVID-19 burden and highlight the detrimental impact of poor air quality. These results could help design and direct location-specific control and mitigation strategies.","output":"COVID-19 in New York state: Effects of demographics and air quality on infection and fatality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stress-induced changes in viral receptor and susceptibility gene expression were measured in embryonic stem cells (ESC) and differentiated progeny. Rex1 promoter-Red Fluorescence Protein reporter ESC were tested by RNAseq after 72hr exposures to control hyperosmotic sorbitol under stemness culture (NS) to quantify stress forced differentiation (SFD) transcriptomic programs. Control ESC cultured with stemness factor removal produced normal differentiation (ND). Bulk RNAseq transcriptomic analysis showed significant upregulation of two genes involved in Covid-19 cell uptake, Vimentin (VIM) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2). SFD increased the hepatitis A virus receptor (Havcr1) and the transplacental Herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) virus receptor (Pvrl1) compared with ESC undergoing ND. Several other coronavirus receptors, Glutamyl Aminopep tidase (ENPEP) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) were upregulated significantly in SFD>ND. Although stressed ESC are more susceptible to infection due to increased expression of viral receptors and decreased resistance, the necessary Covid-19 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2, was not expressed in our experiments. TMPRSS2, ENPEP, and DPP4 mediate Coronavirus uptake, but are also markers of extra-embry onic endoderm (XEN), which arise from ESC undergoing ND or SFD. Mouse and human ESCs differentiated to XEN increase TMPRSS2 and other Covid-19 uptake-mediating gene expression, but only some lines express ACE2. Covid-19 susceptibility appears to be genotype-specific and not ubiquitous. Of the 30 gene ontology (GO) groups for viral susceptibility, 15 underwent significant stress-forced changes. Of these, 4 GO groups mediated negative viral regulation and most genes in these increase in ND and decrease with SFD, thus suggesting that stressed increases ESC viral susceptibility.","output":"Stress decreases host viral resistance and increases Covid susceptibility in embryonic stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the risk of severe clinical outcomes during hospitalizations of adults with asthma and/or COPD plus COVID-19 and compares those risks with those during hospitalizations of adults with asthma and/or COPD without COVID-19. METHODS: We used data from 877 U.S. hospitals from the Premier Healthcare Database during March 2020-March 2021. Hospitalizations (n = 311,215) among patients aged 18 years with an ICD-10-CM diagnosis involving asthma or COPD were classified into three groups: adults with asthma (but not COPD), adults with COPD (but not asthma), and adults with both asthma and COPD. We used multivariable Poisson regression to assess associations of severe clinical outcomes [intensive care unit (ICU) admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and death] and COVID-19 status. RESULTS: The percentage of hospitalizations among patients with asthma and COVID-19 resulting in ICU admission, IMV, and death were 46.9%, 14.0%, and 8.0%, respectively. These risks were higher than those among patients with asthma without COVID-19 (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.17 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-1.21], 1.61 [95% CI, 1.50-1.73], and 5.56 [95% CI, 4.89-6.32]), respectively. Risks of ICU admission, IMV, and death were also high among patients with COPD and COVID-19 and exceeded the corresponding risks among patients with COPD without COVID-19.

This review aimed to systematically assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to optimise dietary intake and/or nutrition-related behaviours among Indigenous infants globally, and to identify whether Indigenous populations were involved in the co-design of the intervention. DESIGN Articles published before June 2020 that reported nutrition-related interventions and outcomes for Indigenous infants were identified from a database search. Data extracted included study aims and design, target population, geographical location, the health condition of the participants, intervention characteristics, and outcomes. A narrative synthesis consisting of effects and acceptability of the interventions and involvement of participants in the study design were highlighted. SETTINGS Population-based intervention studies that focused on improving dietary intakes and/or nutrition-related behaviours of Indigenous infants in the first 1000 days of life were included in this review. RESULTS Of the 2784 studies identified, three studies met the inclusion criteria. These were conducted among two Indigenous tribes in Guatemala and the United States of America. Two studies reported the food and nutrient intake of participants with one study showing an improvement in dietary intake of the infants.

Therefore, exploring effective and emerging molecular targets for ischemic stroke is the main task of basic and clinical research. The aim of the present study was to investigate the function of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in ischemic stroke and its related mechanisms, to provide a reference for the treatment of ischemic stroke. CRF, antalarmin or astressin-2B were used to activate or block the CRF1 (CRF receptor 1) or CRF2 (CRF receptor 2) in BV2 cells and adult male mice which constructed a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) model. CRF not only accelerated microglial activity by promoting transcription and production of inflammatory factors, but also promoted the transformation of activated BV2 cells from a neuroprotective phenotype (M2) to cytotoxic phenotype (M1), and these effects were mediated by TLR4/NF-B signaling pathway. The effects above can be blocked by antalarmin, but not by astressin-2B. CRF significantly aggravate the neurological deficit, increased infarction volume, and exacerbated neuronal injuries. Additionally, CRF significantly improved the levels of TNF- and phospho-NF-B in the ischemia penumbra. Finally, CRF significantly increased the number of CD16/Iba-1 -positive cells and decreased the number of CD206/Iba-1-positive cells in the ischemia penumbra. These results provide evidence of the proinflammatory role of CRF in an ischemic stroke model and a possible underlying mechanism, which may facilitate the elucidation of potential treatment approaches for ischemic stroke.","output":"Corticotropin-releasing factor aggravates ischemic stroke injury by the inflammatory activation of microglia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To quantify the association between accelerometer-assessed physical activity and COVID-19 outcomes. Patients and Methods Data from 82,253 UK Biobank participants with accelerometer data (measured 2013-2015), complete covariate data, and linked COVID-19 data from 16th March 2020 to 16th March 2021 were included. Two outcomes were investigated: severe COVID-19 (positive test from in-hospital setting or COVID-19 as primary cause of death); non-severe COVID-19 (positive test from community setting). Logistic regressions were used to assess associations with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), total activity, and the intensity gradient. A higher intensity gradient indicates a higher proportion of vigorous activity. Results Average MVPA was 48.1 (32.7) minutes/day. Physical activity was associated with lower odds of severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR per SD increase: MVPA 0.75[95% CI, 0.67,0.85]; total 0.83[0.74,0.92]; intensity 0.77[0.70,0.86]), with stronger associations in women (MVPA 0.63[0.52,0.77]; total 0.76[0.64,0.90]; intensity 0.63[0.53,0.74]) than men (MVPA (0.84[0.73,0.97]; total 0.88[0.77,1.01]; intensity 0.88 [0.77,1.00]). In contrast, when mutually adjusted, total activity was associated with higher odds of a non-severe infection (1.10[1.04,1.16]), while the intensity gradient was associated with lower odds (0.91[0.86,0.97]). Conclusion Odds of severe-COVID-19 were 25% lower per SD (30 minutes/day) MVPA. A greater proportion of vigorous activity was associated with lower odds of severe and non-severe infections. The association between total activity and higher odds of a non-severe infection may be through greater community engagement, thus more exposure to the virus.

A better understanding of the determinants of programme adherence is required. Between March and August 2020, a convenience sample of 44 individual telephone interviews, as well as 42 online Qualtrics surveys took place. The objective was to explore perceived barriers, facilitators, and opportunities for participation, sustained participation as well as initial non-participation to better understand reasons for attrition in online delivery during the COVID-19 lockdown among vulnerable and under-served groups within an Integrated Healthy Lifestyle Service (IHLS). METHODS: A convenience sample of 44 individual telephone interviews, as well as 42 online Qualtrics surveys resulted in a total of 86 (33 male) individuals comprising intervention clients. Clients included children and young people (n = 16), manual workers (n = 7), Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic (n = 19), physical disability (n = 8), learning disability (n = 6), and those from areas of high deprivation (n = 19), as well as Integrated Healthy Lifestyle Service practitioners (n = 11). RESULTS: The study revealed that more resources and support are needed for Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic; manual worker; learning disability; and high-deprivation sub-groups in order to reduce attrition rates. Specifically, a lack of technological equipment and competence of using such equipment was identified as key barriers to initial and sustained attendance among these vulnerable and under-served sub-groups during the COVID-19 lockdown.

With higher burden of malaria in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries coupled with fragile healthcare system and delivery, these may pose a threat in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients co-infected with malaria. Free radicals have been implicated in the progression and pathogenesis of malaria and COVID-19 through Fenton's reaction and cytokine storm respectively. Methods: the current research comprises of seventy-four (74) participants; 20 apparently healthy controls and 54 COVID-19 patients (34 among which were co-infected with malaria). Serum levels of 8-iso PGF2&#945; and Alphatocopherol were determined among the study participants using ELISA technique and colorimetric assay, respectively. Results: results revealed statistically significant elevation of 8-iso PGF2&#945; in COVID-19 patients co-infected with malaria compared to COVID-19 patients only, and this may be due to increase production of free radicals. Furthermore, a significant decrease of Alphatocopherol was observed in COVID-19 co-infected with malaria compared to COVID-19 patients due to increase utilization of antioxidants in counterbalancing the negative effect of free radicals generated. Conclusion: conclusively, SARS-COV-2 patients co-infected with malaria might be predisposed to oxidative stress and low Alphatocopherol. The increase in oxidative stress is proportional to malaria parasite density and inversely related to Alphatocopherol levels. This implies that oxidative stress is notably higher and such patients may have a severer form of the COVID-19.

SETTING: Four council wards (electoral districts) in inner city London, where over 90% of residents are in the two most deprived quintiles of the English Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) (2019) and the population is ethnically diverse. PARTICIPANTS: All women booked for antenatal care under Guys and St Thomas National Health Service Foundation Trust after 11 July 2018 (when the Lambeth Early Action Partnership (LEAP*) caseload midwifery team was implemented) until data collection 18 June 2020. This included 523 pregnancies in the LEAP area, of which 230 were allocated to caseload midwifery, and 8430 pregnancies from other areas. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To explore if targeted caseload midwifery (known to reduce preterm birth) will improve important measurable outcomes (preterm birth, mode of birth and newborn outcomes). RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in preterm birth rate in women allocated to caseload midwifery, when compared with those who received traditional midwifery care (5.1% vs 11.2%; risk ratio: 0.41; p=0.02; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.86; number needed to treat: 11.9). Caesarean section births were significantly reduced in women allocated to caseload midwifery care, when compared with traditional midwifery care (24.3% vs 38.0%; risk ratio: 0.64: p=0.01; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.90; number needed to treat: 7.4) including emergency caesarean deliveries (15.2% vs 22.5%; risk ratio: 0.59; p=0.03; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94; number needed to treat: 10) without increase in neonatal unit admission or stillbirth. CONCLUSION: This study shows that a model of caseload midwifery care implemented in an inner city deprived community improves outcome by significantly reducing preterm birth and birth by caesarean section when compared with traditional care. This data trend suggests that when applied to targeted groups (women in higher IMD quintile and women of diverse ethnicity) that the impact of intervention is greater.","output":"Can birth outcome inequality be reduced using targeted caseload midwifery in a deprived diverse inner city population?

We accessed openly available data sources from the public health authorities of seven U.S. states, five U.S. counties, and the District of Columbia on RT-PCR COVID-19 tests split by the COVID-19 vaccination status of individuals tested during this period. Together, these time series enable estimation and tracking of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE*) (against RT-PCR diagnosed infection) concurrently with the growth of Delta variant prevalence in those locations. Our analyses reveal that in each locality the VE* for the combined set of all three US vaccines remained relatively stable and quite well-performing, despite the dramatic concurrent rise of Delta variant prevalence.

The data were extracted from 13 facilities in the Appalachian Regional Healthcare system that share the same electronic health record using ICD-10-CM codes. RESULTS: The number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 per facility ranged from 5 to 535 with a median of 106 patients. Total mortality was 11.4% and ranged from 0% to 22.6% by facility (median: 9.0%). Non-survivors had a greater prevalence of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and pulmonary embolism. Patients who died were also more likely to have had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory failure (ARF), liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), dementia, cancer, anemia, and opiate dependence. CONCLUSION: The aging population, multiple co-morbidities, and health-related behaviors make rural patients vulnerable to COVID-19. A better understanding of the disease in rural areas is crucial, given its heightened vulnerability to adverse outcomes.","output":"Predictors of Mortality for Patients with COVID-19 in the Rural Appalachian Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way that public health professionals work and communicate. Over a very short time span, remote working arrangements have become the norm, and meetings have shifted online. Physical distancing measures have accelerated a trend toward digital communication and social exchange. At the same time, the work of epidemiologists has been held under a magnifying glass by journalists, governments and the general public, in a way not previously seen. With social media becoming an integral part of our society over the last decade, Twitter is now a key communication tool and platform for social networking among epidemiologists (#EpiTwitter). In this article, we reflect on the use of Twitter by field epidemiologists and public health microbiologists for rapid professional exchange, public communication of science and professional development during the pandemic and the associated risks. For those field epidemiologists new to social media, we discuss how Twitter can be used in a variety of ways, both at their home institutions and during field deployment. These include information dissemination, science communication and public health advocacy, professional development, networking and experience exchange.","output":"Social media for field epidemiologists (#SoMe4epi): How to use Twitter during the #COVID19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19, also known as SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, is a coronavirus that is highly pathogenic and virulent. It spreads very quickly through close contact, and so in response to growing numbers of cases, many countries have imposed lockdown measures to slow its spread around the globe. The purpose of a lockdown is to reduce reproduction, that is, the number of people each confirmed case infects. Lockdown measures have worked to varying extents but they come with a massive price. Nearly every individual, community, business, and economy has been affected. In this paper, switching strategies that take into account the total cost borne by a community in response to COVID\\\\19 are proposed. The proposed cost function takes into account the health and well\\\\being of the population, as well as the economic impact due to the lockdown. The model allows for a comparative study to investigate the effectiveness of various COVID\\\\19 suppression strategies. It reveals that both the strategy to implement a lockdown and the strategy to maintain an open community are individually losing in terms of the total cost per day. However, switching between these two strategies in a certain manner can paradoxically lead to a winning outcomea phenomenon attributed to Parrondo's paradox.","output":"Relieving Cost of Epidemic by Parrondo's Paradox: A COVID\\\\19 Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Widely shared traumas have the potential to both improve and impair our relationships with others. During COVID-19 anxiety has been seen as a major individual vulnerability associated with relationship change, as have the wider economic, situational factors facing families and communities. In this national sample of 997 Japanese respondents we assessed perceived relationship changes in couple relations, neighbourhood relations, and wider relations with Japanese nationals, alongside anxiety, exposure to previous mass traumas, household economics, education, and vulnerability to COVID-19. Whilst most respondents reported little change in their relationships during this year there was a small overall improvement in couple relationships and a decline in relations with wider communities. Participant's economic resources were positively associated with an improvement in couple relationships, while anxiety was associated with a decline in relations with both the neighbourhood and the wider society. While neither prior experience of mass trauma, nor education or health vulnerability to COVID-19, were associated with relationship change, having time to talk, and younger age, was positively associated with improvement in couple relations. Findings suggest that anxiety can function to distance relationships during a time of stress, but perceived changes in relationships are little effected by experience of previous trauma. Relationship growth is likely to be greatest in those with better economic conditions. Practitioners need to be mindful of the impact of enhanced anxiety during the pandemic on interpersonal relations, and a potential threat to the relationships of older couples during this time of pandemic threat.","output":"Anxiety, past trauma and changes in relationships in Japan during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite improvements in systemic medical therapy (ST), liver metastases (LMs) are a poor prognostic factor in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.

Considering that the mechanism for myocardial injury is reported to result mainly from the direct viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effects of systemic inflammation, our scope is to evaluate the relation of the increased level of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and the cardiovascular complications due to COVID-19. Design and method: We conducted a systematic literature search on various databases such as PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus to identify the relevant articles. We included studies published until September 2020. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to analyze the prognostic ability of CRP in the cardio-vascular complications from COVID-19. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I2 test. The presence of publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots Results: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria with more than 10,630 participants. Subgroup analysis of the clinical classification included acute myocardial injury, CHF, CAD and thromboembolic events. The ROC curve shows that AUC (CHF)=85% (95% CI of 0.598 to 1);AUC (CAD)=81% (95% CI of 05.44 to 1);AUC (Thromboembolic events)=100% (95% CI of 1 to 1). The Kaplan-Meier curve and the log-rank test were applied to further assess the potential risk factors associated with the progression of cardiovascular complications from COVID-19. The Youden index was implemented to set cutoff values. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 23.0 software. Conclusions: This meta-analysis implies that CRP could be a valuable marker to anticipate the cardiovascular complications from COVID-19.

Evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe symptomatology might have cytokine storms, which increases mortality. The use of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors may help in controlling the pathological immune response to the virus. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, stands as an optional treatment for COVID-19 patients presenting this inflammatory hyper-response. We conducted a retrospective, observational, cohort study including 50 patients affected by COVID-19 with severe pneumonia and poor prognosis criteria, who have also undergone standard treatment; 36 of these patients additionally received tocilizumab in an early stage. The need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, recovery of respiratory function, and improvement of biochemical and hematological parameters were compared between cohorts. Most patients were men, non-smokers and the most frequently reported comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes. Recurrent symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 54.8% of patients from the tocilizumab group needed intubation, while in the control group 85.7% needed it. Treatment with tocilizumab significatively increased IL-6 levels, (554.45; CI 95% 186.69, 1032.93; P < .05) while C-reactive protein mean levels were reduced (C108.19; CI 95% C140.15, C75.33; P < .05), but no significant difference was found between cohorts. In comparison with the controls, tocilizumab reduced mortality (25.0% vs 42.9%, P = .021) and the number of ICU admissions (63.9% vs 100.0%, P = .021). 44.1% of patients treated with tocilizumab showed favorable radiological evolution, when compared with 15.4% of patients from the control group. Tocilizumab may improve clinical symptoms and mitigate deterioration observed in severe COVID-19 patients, and could be considered as an effective therapeutic option in subjects experiencing a significant inflammatory response to the disease.","output":"Early use of tocilizumab in patients with severe pneumonia secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and poor prognostic criteria: Impact on mortality rate and intensive care unit admission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early interventions to support young childrens language development through responsive parentCchild interaction have proven efficacy but are not currently delivered universally. A potential universal delivery platform is the Health Visitor (HV)Cled 2C2?-year-old review in Englands Healthy Child Programme. It is unclear if it is feasible to offer such interventions through this platform. We report an intervention development process, including extensive stakeholder consultation and co-design which aimed to develop an acceptable, feasible and equitable early language intervention for delivery in this context. METHODS: The study involved five phases including 13 stakeholder co-design workshops with 7 parents and 39 practitioners (HVs, early years practitioners and speech and language therapists): (1) Identification of existing intervention evidence, (2) qualitative review of intervention studies extracting candidate target behaviours for intervention and intervention techniques, (3) co-design workshops with parents and practitioners examining acceptability, barriers and enablers to those behaviours and techniques (particular attention was paid to diverse family circumstances and the range of barriers which might exist), (4) findings were analysed using COM-B and theoretical domains frameworks and a prototype intervention model designed, and (5) co-design workshops iteratively refined the proposed model. RESULTS: Practitioners were committed to offering language intervention at the 2C2?-year-old review but were not sure precisely how to do so. Parents/caregivers wanted to be proactive and to have agency in supporting their own children and to do this as soon as possible. For equitable intervention, it must be proportionate, with higher intensity for higher levels of disadvantage, and tailored, offering differing approaches considering the specific barriers and enablers, assets and challenges in each family. The importance and potential fragility of alliances between parent/caregiver and practitioner were identified as key, and so, strategies to engender successful collaborative partnership are also embedded in intervention design. CONCLUSION: It is possible to develop a universal intervention which parents and practitioners judge would be acceptable, feasible and equitable for use at the 2C2?-year review to promote childrens language development. The result is one of the most explicitly developed universal interventions to promote childrens language development.

Methods: Here, we use systematic review to develop a comprehensive dataset of respiratory viral loads (rVLs) of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. We then comparatively meta-analyze the data and model individual infectiousness by shedding viable virus via respiratory droplets and aerosols. Results: The analyses indicate heterogeneity in rVL as an intrinsic virological factor facilitating greater overdispersion for SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID-19 pandemic than A(H1N1)pdm09 in the 2009 influenza pandemic. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity remains broad throughout the infectious period, including for pediatric and asymptomatic infections. Hence, many COVID-19 cases inherently present minimal transmission risk, whereas highly infectious individuals shed tens to thousands of SARS-CoV-2 virions/min via droplets and aerosols while breathing, talking and singing. Coughing increases the contagiousness, especially in close contact, of symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones. Infectiousness tends to be elevated between 1 and 5 days post-symptom onset. Conclusions: Intrinsic case variation in rVL facilitates overdispersion in the transmissibility of emerging respiratory viruses.

A randomized scheduled was used to capture a representative breadth of handovers. Data collected included outcome measures such as duration of handover, structure of the handover, and information shared, process measures such as questions and interruptions from the trauma team, and perceptions of the handover from nurses, trauma team leaders and EMS according to a bidirectional Likert scale. RESULTS 79 formal verbal handovers were observed. Information was often missing regarding airway (present 22%), breathing (54%), medications (59%), and allergies (54%). Handover structure lacked consistency beyond the order of identification and mechanism of injury. Of all questions asked, 35% were questioning previously given information. The majority of handovers (61%) involved parallel conversations between team members while EMS was speaking. There was a statistically significant disparity between the self-evaluation of EMS handovers and the perceived quality determined by nurses and trauma team leaders.

With more than eight thousand reported cases infection, Cameroon stands as the seventh most affected country in Africa. Prevention remains the best way to fight against this zoonosis. However, the limited information available about this infection is a great barrier to stopping the propagation of the virus within the population, especially in rural and semi-rural areas, where the lack of financial and material resources is a reality. This study aimed to assessing Awareness and attitudes of the population of the Menoua Division on COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 9 to April 15 2020 amongst the populations of rural and semi-rural areas of the Menoua Division. Data were collected using a questionnaire administered face to face to each participant. The analysis was carried out using the Statistical Analysis System software (SAS version 9.4). The significance threshold was set at a P value of less than 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 434 participants of which male majority (sex ratio 1.07) were included in this study. The most represented age group was [21 - 40] years old representing 40.29% of the participants. Approximately all participants (98.57%) were aware of the world emergency state due to Coronavirus. 75.56%, 91% and 90.93% of the participants knew respectively that having close contacts, kissing and touching the face with the hands could favor the transmission of the virus. However, nearly 91.14% were not aware of the clinical symptoms of the disease. Moreover, 85.02% responded that they would not be able to comply with the confinement measures if they were applied at national level. The level of awareness varied significantly according to the occupation (p=0.038) and the educational level (p&lt;0.001)of the participants.

In this viewpoint we provide insights concerning how health care professionals can unintentionally shift the novel coronavirus type to more drug-resistant forms. It is worth noting that viruses usually have different sensitivities to physical and chemical damaging agents such antiviral drugs, UV and heat ranging from extremely sensitive (ES) to extremely resistant (ER) based on a bell-shaped curve. Given this consideration, the widespread infection of people with such ER viruses would be a real disaster. Here, we introduce a modified treatment method for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. In this proposed method, COVID-19 patients will receive a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation that is less than the maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv. In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays cannot exert a significant selective pressure on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and hence does not lead to directed accelerated evolution of these viruses. Moreover, Low Dose Radiation (LDR) has the capacity of modulating excessive inflammatory responses, regulating lymphocyte counts, and controling bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Covid-19 tragic pandemic: Concerns over unintentional directed accelerated evolution of novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) and introducing a modified treatment method for ards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is defined as having an etiology that is not related to surgery, trauma, or mechanical ventilation.

Although disturbance can be controlled with relative ease in nature reserves that are properly resourced and managed by employed staff, most reserves do not fall into this category, and most wildlife exists outside managed reserves entirely. Thus, developing and demonstrating the effectiveness of simple, low-cost approaches to minimising disturbance is an important objective in conservation. In this study we examine the effectiveness of regulatory signs in controlling the behaviour and impacts of visitors on a colonial island-nesting bird, the Northern gannet (Morus bassanus), on an unmanaged island. First, we found that the percentage of successful nests declined with proximity to the disturbed edge of the colony, and was much higher in an undisturbed control area. Second, the number of birds displaced by visitors correlated negatively with the minimum visitor approach distance. Third, visitor proximity to the colony was dramatically reduced in the presence of a regulatory sign in comparison to periods without signs, which resulted in fewer birds being displaced from their nests. Photographers were the only visitor group who didnt always comply with the sign. Our results show that breeding success in a species often thought to be well adapted to human presence, suffers from tourist pressure, and that simple and informative regulatory signs can be a cost-effective way of reducing the disturbance caused by visitors at unmanaged wildlife sites.","output":"The effectiveness of regulatory signs in controlling human behaviour and Northern gannet (Morus bassanus) disturbance during breeding: an experimental test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 global pandemic has not ceased to spread worldwide since December 2019.

Effective identification relies on screening in high-risk populations. Here, we report the outcomes of a risk-based, point-of-care (POC) screening strategy in a Danish emergency department (ED). METHODS During a three-month period, ED patients at Odense University Hospital were screened for risk factors and offered POC HCV-antibody (HCV-Ab) testing. Reactive results were followed up by confirmatory venepuncture testing. The main outcome measure was prevalence of HCV-antibodies. Secondary outcome measures were prevalence of risk factors and an evaluation of feasibility of ED screening. RESULTS During study times, 1831 (55.7%) of 3288 presentations to the ED were eligible for screening. Six hundred and seventy-three (36.8%) were approached, of which 514 (28.1%) participated and 159 (8.7%) declined. Of 514 participants, 339 (66%) reported one or more risk factors, and 489 (95.1%) underwent HCV-Ab testing. Four (0.8%) had a reactive HCV-Ab test. No active infections of HCV were found. The risk factor of having injected drugs was present in all HCV-Ab positive patients. Compared to participants, patients who could not be approached had a lower prevalence of previously diagnosed hepatitis C- and risk-factor-associated diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS The risk factor of injecting drug use had the highest yield for HCV-Ab positivity. Additional risk factors did not contribute to case-finding.

The microbes inhabiting the oral cavity and gut might play crucial roles in maintaining a favorable gut environment, and their relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility and severity is yet to be fully explored. This study investigates the diversity and species richness of gut and oral microbiota of patients with COVID-19, and their possible implications toward the severity of the patient's illness and clinical outcomes. Seventy-four (n = 74) clinical samples (gut and oral) were collected from 22 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with various clinical conditions and 15 apparently healthy people (served as controls). This amplicon-based metagenomic sequencing study yielded 1,866,306 paired-end reads that were mapped to 21 phyla and 231 classified genera of bacteria. Alpha and beta diversity analyses revealed a distinct dysbiosis of the gut and oral microbial communities in patients with COVID-19, compared to healthy controls. We report that SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduced richness and evenness in the gut and oral microbiomes despite showing higher unique operational taxonomic units in the gut. The gut samples of the patients with COVID-19 included 46 opportunistic bacterial genera. Escherichia, Shigella, and Bacteroides were detected as the signature genera in the gut of patients with COVID-19 with diarrhea, whereas a relatively higher abundance of Streptococcus was found in patients with COVID-19 having breathing difficulties and sore throat (BDST). The patients with COVID-19 had a significantly lower abundance of Prevotella in the oral cavity, compared to healthy controls and patients with COVID-19 without diabetes, respectively. The altered metabolic pathways, including a reduction in biosynthesis capabilities of the gut and oral microbial consortia after SARS-CoV-2 infection, were also observed. The present study may, therefore, shed light on interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with resilient oral and gut microbes which might contribute toward developing microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for this deadly pandemic disease.","output":"Dysbiosis of Oral and Gut Microbiomes in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients in Bangladesh: Elucidating the Role of Opportunistic Gut Microbes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Convalescent plasma is being used widely as a treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a therapeutic option due to its intrinsic properties to alleviate inflammatory responses, capable to promote the restoring of injured tissue. EVs contain heterogeneous cargo, including active microRNAs, small noncoding sequences involved in post-transcriptional gene repression or degradation and can attach in multiple targets. This study investigated whether the MSC-EVs miRNA cargo has the capacity to modulate the exacerbated cytokines, cell death and coagulation disturbs present in severe COVID-19. Through bioinformatics analysis, four datasets of miRNA, using different stem cell tissue sources (bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose tissue), and one dataset of mRNA (bone marrow) were analyzed. 58 miRNAs overlap in the four miRNA datasets analyzed. Sequentially, those miRNAs present in at least two datasets, were analyzed using miRWalk for the 3UTR binding target mRNA. The result predicted 258 miRNAs for exacerbated cytokines and chemokines, 266 miRNAs for cell death genes and 148 miRNAs for coagulation cascades. Some miRNAs may simultaneously attenuate inflammatory agents, inhibit cell death genes and key factors of coagulation cascade, consequently preventing tissue damage and coagulation disturbs. Therefore, the MSC-derived EVs due to their heterogeneous cargo are a potential multitarget approach able to improve the survival rates of severe COVID-19 patients.

DESIGN: A prospective, single-center observational study was carried out. SETTING: Intensive care. PATIENTS: Patients admitted due to COVID-19 and respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: None. VARIABLES: Automatic recording was made of demographic variables, severity parameters, laboratory data, assisted ventilation (HFO: high-flow oxygen therapy and IMV: invasive mechanical ventilation), oxygenation (PaO2, PaO2/FiO2) and complications. The patients were divided into three groups: survivors (G1), deceased (G2) and patients remaining under admission (G3). The chi-squared test or Fisher exact test (categorical variables) was used, along with the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon test for analyzing the differences between medians. Statistical significance was considered for p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included (G1=28 [65.1%]; G2=10 [23.3%] and G3=5 [11.6%]), with a mean age of 65 years (range: 52-72), 62% males, APACHE II 18 (15-24), SOFA 6 (4-7). Arterial hypertension (30.2%) and obesity (25.6%) were the most frequent comorbidities. High-flow oxygen therapy was used in 62.7% of the patients, with failure in 85%. In turn, 95% of the patients required IMV and 85% received ventilation in prone decubitus. In the general population, initial PaO2/FiO2 improved after 7 days (165 [125-210] vs.194 [153-285]; p=0.02), in the same way as in G1 (164 [125-197] vs. 207 [160-294]; p=0.07), but not in G2 (163 [95-197] vs. 135 [85-177]). No bacterial coinfection was observed. The incidence of IMV-associated pneumonia was high (13 episodes/1000 days of IMV). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 require early IMV, a high frequency of ventilation in prone decubitus, and have a high incidence of failed HFO.

Therefore, inhibitors of the c-MybCKIX interaction are potentially useful as antitumor drugs. Since the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD) of c-Myb binds KIX via a conformational selection mechanism where helix formation precedes binding, stabilizing the helical structure of c-Myb TAD is expected to increase the KIX-binding affinity. Here, to develop an inhibitor of the c-MybCKIX interaction, we designed mutants of the c-Myb TAD peptide fragment where the helical structure is stabilized, based on theoretical predictions using AGADIR. Three of the four initially designed peptides each had a different Lys-to-Arg substitution on the helix surface opposite the KIX-binding interface. Furthermore, the triple mutant with three Lys-to-Arg substitutions, named RRR, showed a high helical propensity and achieved three-fold higher affinity to KIX than the wild-type TAD with a dissociation constant of 80 nM. Moreover, the RRR inhibitor efficiently competed out the c-MybCKIX interaction. These results suggest that stabilizing the helical structure based on theoretical predictions, especially by conservative Lys-to-Arg substitutions, is a simple and useful strategy for designing helical peptide inhibitors of proteinCprotein interactions.","output":"Rational design of a helical peptide inhibitor targeting c-MybCKIX interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As in other universities, the Covid\\\\19 pandemic led to the cancellation of face\\\\to\\\\face (F2F) teaching between February and July at the University of South Australia (UniSA).

We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine. METHODS: We used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes, as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe or critical hospitalisation, and death) was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals (defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine) compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals (who had not received any doses of the vaccine), with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group (16C24, 25C34, 35C44, 45C54, 55C64, 65C74, 75C84, and 85 years), sex, and calendar week. The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant. FINDINGS: During the analysis period (Jan 24 to April 3, 2021), there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older. By April 3, 2021, 4 714 932 (721%) of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2. Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were 953% (95% CI 949C957; incidence rate 915 per 100 000 person-days in unvaccinated vs 31 per 100 000 person-days in fully vaccinated individuals) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 915% (907C922; 409 vs 18 per 100 000 person-days) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 970% (967C972; 325 vs 08 per 100 000 person-days) against symptomatic COVID-19, 972% (968C975; 46 vs 03 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, 975% (971C978; 27 vs 02 per 100 000 person-days) against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and 967% (960C973; 06 vs 01 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related death. In all age groups, as vaccine coverage increased, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes declined. 8006 of 8472 samples tested showed a spike gene target failure, giving an estimated prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant of 945% among SARS-CoV-2 infections. INTERPRETATION: Two doses of BNT162b2 are highly effective across all age groups (16 years, including older adults aged 85 years) in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, and death, including those caused by the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. There were marked and sustained declines in SARS-CoV-2 incidence corresponding to increasing vaccine coverage. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination can help to control the pandemic.

Examination of three canine and six feline cell lines and mitogen-stimulated canine and feline peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed that CPV replicates in both canine and feline cells, whereas FPV replicates efficiently only in feline cells. The in vivo host ranges were unexpectedly complex and distinct from the in vitro host ranges. Inoculation of dogs with FPV revealed efficient replication in the thymus and, to some degree, in the bone marrow, as shown by virus isolation, viral DNA recovery, and Southern blotting and by strand-specific in situ hybridization. FPV replication could not be demonstrated in mesenteric lymph nodes or in the small intestine, which are important target tissues in CPV infection. Although CPV replicated well in all the feline cells tested in vitro, it did not replicate in any tissue of cats after intramuscular or intravenous inoculation.

Here, I report a comparative study of these ORF proteins, mainly encoded in two gene clusters, i.e. between the Spike and the Envelope genes, and between the Membrane and the Nucleocapsid genes. For brevity and focus, a greater emphasis was placed on the first cluster, collectively designated as the orf3 region for ease of referral. Overall, an apparently diverse set of ORFs, such as ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF4 and ORF5, but not necessarily numbered in that order on all CoV genomes, were analyzed along with other ORFs. Unexpectedly, the gene order or naming of the ORFs were never fully conserved even within the members of one Genus. These studies also unraveled hitherto unrecognized orf genes in alternative translational frames, encoding potentially novel polypeptides as well as some that are highly similar to known ORFs. Finally, several options of an inclusive and systematic numbering are proposed not only for the orf3 region but also for the other orf genes in the viral genome in an effort to regularize the apparently confusing names and orders.

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of viral diseases. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, Clinical Trials Registries, CNKI, Wanfang Data, CQVIP, and Preprint Servers through April 4, 2020, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ against viral infection. We analyzed pooled data on the overall efficacy, the relative risks over the placebo, and the prevalence of adverse events. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was also performed to evaluate the random errors in the meta-analysis. Potential moderators of drug-placebo efficacy differences were analyzed by meta-regression. Results: The analysis included 11 RCTs with 2613 adult patients. Both the plasma viral load (standard mean difference: 0.29, 95% CI: -1.19 - 1.76, P = 0.70) and the improvement of clinical symptoms (odds ratio: 2.36, 95% CI: 0.81 - 6.92, P = 0.11) were not different between the intervention and placebo arm. There was significant heterogeneity for the efficacy assessment, which was primarily explained by the age of patients and the sample size. Compared to the placebo, CQ and HCQ had increased risk of mild adverse events (risk ratio: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.35 - 1.70, P < 0.05, TSA adjusted 95% CI: 1.31 - 2.19), which were statistically significant in nervous, integumentary, and gastrointestinal systems. The most common adverse events were observed in the nervous system, with the pooled prevalence of 31.4% (95% CI: 10.5% - 56.7%). Conclusions: Insufficient data were available to support the antiviral efficacy of CQ and HCQ due to the high heterogeneity caused by the age of patients. Mild side effects are expected for the current antiviral dose regimens of CQ and HCQ.

Here, we use multiplexed proteomics to quantify IFN2a-stimulated PM protein changes in primary human CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells from five donors, quantifying 606 and 482 PM proteins respectively. Comparison of cell surface proteomes revealed a remarkable invariance between donors in the overall composition of the cell surface from each cell type, but a marked donor-to-donor variability in the effects of IFN2a. Furthermore, whereas only 2.7% of quantified proteins were consistently upregulated by IFN2a at the surface of CD4+ T cells, 6.8% of proteins were consistently upregulated in primary monocytes, suggesting that the magnitude of the IFN2a response varies according to cell type. Among these differentially regulated proteins, we found the viral target Endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE1) to be an IFN2a-stimulated protein exclusively upregulated at the surface of CD4+ T cells.

This study examined how the pandemic may impact mental health and investigated the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in family carers of older people. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-six family carers of older adults participated in this cross-sectional survey study. Outcome measures included their symptoms of anxiety and depression, pandemic-related psychosocial factors, external factors, and the practice of preventive behaviours. RESULTS: Caseness prevalence of anxiety and depression among family carers was 25 and 56% respectively. Working carers were more depressed than non-working, while younger carers reported more anxiety and depression symptoms than older. Hand hygiene and getting drugs from the hospital positively predicted depression while healthy lifestyle negatively predicted depression. These variables, together with perceived risk and severity and the worry of getting infected, predicted anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of mental health symptoms was alarming. Telemedicine practice, including online pharmaceutical services and the Internet Hospital plus Drug Delivery platform, could be a solution in alleviating the burden and worry of infection of family carers.

The aim of our study is to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of this assay on previously tested SARS-CoV-2 people by conventional RT-PCR based approach in different settings, including initial diagnosis and clinical follow-up. METHODS: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Idylla SARS-CoV-2 Test, we retrieved 55 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analysed by a fully validated assay, from symptomatic patients or from people who have been in close contact with COVID-19 positive cases. Discordant or high discrepant cases were further analysed by a third technique. In addition, a second subset of 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples with uncertain results (cycle threshold between 37 and 40), by using the fully validated assay, from patients with viral infection beyond day 21, were retrieved. RESULTS: Overall, Idylla showed a sensitivity of 93.9% and a specificity of 100.0%. In addition, in the additional 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples, only five (35.7%) featured a positive result by the Idylla SARS-CoV-2 Test.

Beyond the widespread concerns surrounding illness, loss of employment and social isolation, caregivers are responsible for overseeing their children's educational and therapeutic programmes at home often without the much needed support of professionals. METHOD: The present study sought to examine the impact of COVID-19 in 77 ethnically, linguistically and socioeconomically diverse families with young children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) in California and Oregon, who were participating in larger intervention studies. Parents responded to five interview questions about the impact of the pandemic, services for their child, silver linings or positive aspects, coping and their concerns about the long-term impact of the pandemic. RESULTS: Parents reported that their biggest challenge was being at home caring for their children with the loss of many essential services. Parents reported some positive aspects of the pandemic, especially being together as a family. Although there were positive aspects of the situation, many parents expressed concern about long-term impacts of the pandemic on their children's development, given the loss of services, education and social engagement opportunities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a scoping review on PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, clinical trial register, and grey literature repository databases to identify reports on viral transmission via surgical smoke or aerosolization. A systematic review of all available national and international guidelines was also performed to report their recommendations. Additionally, a worldwide transdisciplinary survey was performed to capture the actual compliance to dedicated guidelines and their impact on minimally invasive surgical activity. RESULTS Based on a selection of 17 studies, there is no evidence to support the concerns of an intraoperative viral transmission via pneumoperitoneum aerosolization. Most national surgical and urologic societies either did address this topic or referred to international guidelines. The guidelines of the American College of Surgery, the Royal College of Surgeons and the European Association of Urology Robotic Urology Section recommended an avoidance of MIS due to an increased risk of intraoperative aerosol-enhanced transmission. The results of the survey completed by 334 respondents, from different surgical abdominal specialties, suggested a lack of compliance with the guidelines. CONCLUSION There seems to be a dissonance between contemporary guidelines and ongoing surgical activity, possibly due to the perceived lack of evidence. Recommendations regarding changes in clinical practice should be based on the best available research evidence and experience. A scoping review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms together with a survey showed that laparoscopic procedures do not seem to increase the risk of viral transmission.

Patients with severe asthma may have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and enzyme proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin are needed for the attachment and invasion of the virus into host cells. We determined whether their expression in the airways of severe asthma patients is increased. Method. We examined the microarray mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in the sputum, bronchial brush and bronchial biopsies of participants in the European U-BIOPRED cohort. Results. ACE2 and furin sputum gene expression was significantly increased in severe non-smoking asthma compared to mild-moderate asthma and healthy volunteers. By contrast, TMPRSS2 expression in bronchial biopsy and bronchial brushings was increased in severe smoking and ex-smoking asthmatics, and so was furin expression in bronchial brushings. Several clinical parameters including male gender, oral steroid use and nasal polyps were positively associated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin expression levels. There was a higher expression of ACE2 and furin in the sputum neutrophilic molecular phenotype with inflammasome activation compared to the eosinophilic Type2-high or paucigranulocytic phenotypes. The enrichment score of the IL-13-Type2 gene signature was positively correlated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin levels. Conclusion.

Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of clinical cases of treatment of new coronaviral infection COVID-19 with community-acquired pneumonia included 49 patients (28 men, 21 women) in the intensive care unit at Kuzbass Clinical Center of Miners Health Protection from July 1, 2020, to November 30, 2020. The cases were recorded according to registration date of data of positive test of COVID-19. The discharge status (survival) was considered. The survivors were 39 patients. 10 patients died. The demographic data (age, gender), comorbid status, and clinical, physiological (qSOFA, GCS) and laboratory parameters were analyzed. Etiological laboratory diagnostics of COVID-19 was performed with samples from nasal and/or nasopharyngeal smears to identify RNA of SARS-CoV-2 with PCR. General blood analysis was performed with Sysmex XN-1000. Urea, creatinine, electrolytes, glucose, AST, ALT, bilirubin, total protein, albumin, high-sensitive troponin (hs), ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured with analytic platform Cobas 6000 SWA. Acid base metabolism parameters and whole venous blood lactate were measured with critical conditions analyzer Cobas b221. The parameters of the coagulogram (activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PTT), fibrinogen, D-dimer) were measured with the automatic hemostasis system STA Compact Max. The statistical analysis was conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (Statistical Product and Service Solutions C SPSS). The quantitative signs were presented as absolute and relative (%) values. The quantitative variables were presented as mean arithmetic (M) and standard deviation (SD), as Me (LQ-UQ), where Me C median, (LQ-UQ) C interquartile range (IQR) (LQ C 25%, UQ C 75% quartiles). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for testing the pattern of distribution of quantitative values. Mann-Whitneys U-test was used for identification of intergroup differences in quantitative signs. Fishers test and 2-test were used for comparison of qualitative values. The critical level of significance () for testing statistical hypotheses was 0.05. Differences were considered as statistically significant with p &lt; 0.05. Results. The mean age of the patients with COVID-19 with community-acquired pneumonia was Me (IQR) 65 (55-72). Most patients were men (57 %). There were some age differences. Deceased patients were 1.15 time older as compared to survivors (p &lt; 0.05). In the group of deceased patients, the presence of 3 concurrent diseases was noted 2.5 times more often than in survivors (p &lt; 0.001). Glasgow Coma Scale values were almost 1,7 time lower in deceased patients as compared to survivors (p = 0.06). They also showed higher qSOFA (1.9 time, p = 0.01). The most intense generalized manifestation of systemic inflammatory response in deceased patients was shown by a significant increase in blood levels of CRP (by 2.9 times, p &lt; 0.001), hTs (by 1.2 time, p &lt; 0.05), ferritin (by 3 times, p &lt; 0.001), fibrinogen (by 2 times, p &lt; 0.001), D-dimer (by 12.2 times, p &lt; 0.001) and 1.1-fold increase in APTT as compared to survivors (p &lt; 0.05). Development of inflammatory response in patients with lethal outcome was characterized by increasing AS-LYMP (by 35 % on average, p &lt; 0.001) as compared to survivors. Conclusion. The results show that COVID-19 caused by SARS-Cov-2 can be considered as systemic inflammatory response, which is characterized by life-threatening hyperinflammation, hypercoagulation and dis-balance in oxygen delivery and consumption, resulting in multiple organ failure. These abnormal processes are especially significant for patients with concurrent diseases, which increase the risk of severe course of COVID-19 and lethal outcome. ? 2020 The Charity Fund of Clinical Center of Miners' Health Protection.

As with other RNA viruses, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 gene have been continuously evolving. Recently, four variants have been identified, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C. These variants appear to be more infectious and transmissible than the original Wuhan-Hu-1 virus. Using a combination of bioinformatics and structural analyses, we show that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged in the background of an already known Spike protein mutation D614G together with another mutation P323L in the RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the CAL.20C and B.1.351 shared one common ancestor, whereas the B.1.1.7 and P.1 shared a different ancestor. Structural comparisons did not show any significant difference between the wild-type and mutant ACE2/Spike complexes. Structural analysis indicated that the N501Y mutation may increase hydrophobic interactions at the ACE2/Spike interface. However, reported greater binding affinity of N501Y Spike with ACE2 does not seem to be entirely due to increased hydrophobic interactions, given that Spike mutation R417T in P.1 or K417N in B.1.351 results in the loss of a salt-bridge interaction between ACE2 and S-RBD. The calculated change in free energy did not provide a clear trend of S protein stability of mutations in the variants. As expected, we show that the CAL.20C generally migrated from the west coast to the east coast of the USA.

METHODS: Two groups of 15 participants (10 male; mean age 25.6  4.9 years) wore spectacles with a 3.8% horizontal magnifier over one eye. The continuous-wear group wore the spectacles for 5 hours straight. The intermittent-wear group wore them for five 1-hour intervals. To measure slant and shape distortions produced by the spectacles, participants adjusted visual stimuli until they appeared frontoparallel or equiangular, respectively. Adaptation was quantified as the difference in responses at the beginning and end of wearing the spectacles. Aftereffects were quantified as the difference before and after removing the spectacles. We hypothesized that intermittent wear may lead to visual cue reweighting, so we fit a cue combination model to the data and examined changes in weights given to perspective and binocular disparity slant cues. RESULTS: Both groups experienced significant shape adaptation and aftereffects. The continuous-wear group underwent significant slant adaptation and the intermittent group did not, but there was no significant difference between groups, suggesting that the difference in adaptation was negligible. There was no evidence for cue reweighting in the intermittent wear group, but unexpectedly, the weight given to binocular disparity cues for slant increased significantly in the continuous-wear group.

Even though these individuals require sustained rehabilitation, they face extra burdens to access care due to shortages in qualified clinicians, insurance limitations and geographic access. There is a need to research alternative means to access intervention remotely, such as in the case of this study using a digital therapeutic. Objective: To assess the feasibility and clinical efficacy of a virtual speech, language, and cognitive digital therapeutic for individuals with post-stroke aphasia relative to standard of care. Methods: Thirty two participants completed the study (experimental: average age 59.8 years, 7 female, 10 male, average education: 15.8 years, time post-stroke: 53 months, 15 right handed, 2 left handed; control: average age 64.2 years, 7 female, 8 male, average education: 15.3 years, time post-stroke: 36.1 months, 14 right handed, 1 left handed). Patients in the experimental group received 10 weeks of treatment using a digital therapeutic, Constant Therapy-Research (CT-R), for speech, language, and cognitive therapy, which provides evidence-based, targeted therapy with immediate feedback for users that adjusts therapy difficulty based on their performance. Patients in the control group completed standard of care (SOC) speech-language pathology workbook pages. Results: This study provides Class II evidence that with the starting baseline WAB-AQ score, adjusted by ?0.69 for every year of age, and by 0.122 for every month since stroke, participants in the CT-R group had WAB-AQ scores 6.43 higher than the workbook group at the end of treatment.

The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential. In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections. Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response. Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses. Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction. Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses. The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances. Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery. For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment. The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted.

The World Health Organization (WHO) named the novel coronavirus as COVID-19 on February 11, 2020, and declared it as a \\"pandemic.\\" Almost all countries have undertaken wide-scale precautions so as to prevent or limit the spread of the virus, with most having practiced some form of \\"lockdown\\" along with \\"social distancing,\\" as well as dispensed recommendations for proper hand washing, avoiding touching the face, wearing facemasks, and using disposable tissues when either coughing or sneezing. Whereas it is well known that slowing the spread of this new epidemic requires the cooperation of all citizens, some people still seem to willfully disregard the rules and guidelines, and thereby ignore the health risks posed to both themselves and to others they come into contact with. People have responded differently to lockdown rules and social distancing practices. Whilst the majority follow the rules and recommendations with great care, others are more lax or simply refuse to comply. These differences might be accounted for according to a number of factors including personal, social, cultural, mental, and economic variables. Being persuaded to comply with preventive rules, especially those concerned with health-related behaviors, also bring certain other factors into play. Fear is one of those factors, and is one of the most powerful. It is well known that fear-based appeals can be effective in inculcating health behaviors, with many theories having been developed in this area. However, both the content of the message (the level of the fear it contains) and certain personal variables can determine the persuasive power of the fear appeal. It can even have an adverse effect if not properly applied. Many theories have been developed to address the persuasive effectiveness of the fear appeal (e.g., fear-drive theory, protection-motivation theory), and this study aims to discuss these individual differences in precautionary and preventive measures for the COVID-19 pandemic within the framework of the basic assumptions of these theoretical approaches.","output":"Accepting Restrictions and Compliance With Recommended Preventive Behaviors for COVID-19: A Discussion Based on the Key Approaches and Current Research on Fear Appeals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Qualitative interviews are generally conducted in person.

However, it was heterogeneous in the existing studies. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to comprehensively summarize the VST of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, CNKI, CSTJ, and Wanfang up to October 25, 2020, for studies that reported VSTs of SARS-CoV-2. Pooled estimates and 95% CIs for the VSTs were calculated using log-transformed data. The VSTs in SARS-CoV-2 infections based on different demographic and clinical characteristics, treatments and specimens were stratified by subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 35 studies involving 3,385 participants met the inclusion criteria. The pooled mean VST was 16.8 days (95% CI: 14.8-19.4, I 2 = 99.56%) in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The VST was significantly longer in symptomatic infections (19.7 days, 95% CI: 17.2-22.7, I 2 = 99.34%) than in asymptomatic infections (10.9 days, 95% CI: 8.3-14.3, I 2 = 98.89%) (P < 0.05). The VST was 23.2 days (95% CI: 19.0-28.4, I 2 = 99.24%) in adults, which was significantly longer than that in children (9.9 days, 95% CI: 8.1-12.2, I 2 = 85.74%) (P < 0.05). The VST was significantly longer in persons with chronic diseases (24.2 days, 95% CI: 19.2-30.2, I 2 = 84.07%) than in those without chronic diseases (11.5 days, 95% CI: 5.3-25.0, I 2 = 82.11%) (P < 0.05). Persons receiving corticosteroid treatment (28.3 days, 95% CI: 25.6-31.2, I 2 = 0.00%) had a longer VST than those without corticosteroid treatment (16.2 days, 95% CI: 11.5-22.5, I 2 = 92.27%) (P = 0.06). The VST was significantly longer in stool specimens (30.3 days, 95% CI: 23.1-39.2, I 2 = 92.09%) than in respiratory tract specimens (17.5 days, 95% CI: 14.9-20.6, I 2 = 99.67%) (P < 0.05).

Recently Artificial Intelligence systems for the diagnosis of Covid-19 related pneumonia on Chest X ray (CXR) or chest CT have been tested with variable, but not negligible, accuracy. Texture analysis might be an additional tool for the evaluation of CXR in patients with clinical suspicion of Covid-19 related pneumonia. Methods: : CXR images were accessed from a publicly available repository (https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). Lung areas were manually segmented using a polygonal regions of interest (ROI) covering both lung areas, using MaZda, a freely available software for texture analysis. A total of 308 features per ROI was extracted. One hundred-ten Covid-19 CXR images were selected for the final analysis Results: : Six models, namely NB, GLM, DL, GBT, ANN and PLS-DA were selected and ensembled. According to Youdens index, the Covid-19 Ensemble Machine Learning (EML)-Score showing the highest AUCROC (0.9710.015) was 132.57. Assuming this cut-off the EML model performance was estimated evaluating both true and false positive/negative, resulting in 91.8% accuracy with 93% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Moving the cut-off value to -100, although the accuracy resulted lower (90.6%), the EML showed 100% sensitivity, with 80% specificity Conclusion: Texture analysis of CXR images and machine learning algorithms may help in differentiating patients with Covid-19 pneumonia.

Focusing on procedures required to accurately determine recent infection, and the potential for recent infection surveillance to inform prevention efforts, we present the results of three independent but linked pilots of recency testing. METHODS To distinguish recently acquired HIV infection from long-standing infection, in 2018 we applied a Recent Infection Testing Algorithm that combined a laboratory-based Limiting Antigen Avidity Enzyme Immunoassay with clinical information (viral-load; history of prior HIV diagnosis; antiretroviral therapy-exposure). We explored potential misclassification of test results and analysed the characteristics of participants with recent infection. We applied the algorithm in antenatal clinics providing prevention of mother-to-child transmission services in Siaya County, Kenya, outreach sites serving female sex workers in Zimbabwe, and routine HIV testing and counselling facilities in Nairobi, Kenya. In Nairobi, we also conducted recency testing among partners of HIV-positive participants. RESULTS In Siaya County, 2.3% (10/426) of HIV-positive pregnant women were classified as recent. A risk factor analysis comparing women testing recent with those testing HIV-negative found women in their first trimester were significantly more likely to test recent than those in their second or third trimester. In Zimbabwe, 10.5% (33/313) of female sex workers testing HIV-positive through the outreach programme were classified recent. A risk factor analysis of women testing recent versus those testing HIV-negative, found no strong evidence of an association with recent infection. In Nairobi, among 532 HIV-positive women and men, 8.6% (46) were classified recent. Among partners of participants, almost a quarter of those who tested HIV-positive were classified as recent (23.8%; 5/21). In all three settings, the inclusion of clinical information helped improve the positive predictive value of recent infection testing by removing cases that were likely misclassified. CONCLUSIONS We successfully identified recently acquired infections among persons testing HIV-positive in routine testing settings and highlight the importance of incorporating additional information to accurately classify recent infection. We identified a number of groups with a significantly higher proportion of recent infection, suggesting recent infection surveillance, when rolled-out nationally, may help in further targeting primary prevention efforts.","output":"Can HIV recent infection surveillance help us better understand where primary prevention efforts should be targeted?

Three overarching themes were identified: Effect on Recovery, Virtual Recovery Resources, and Effect on General Life. Within each overarching theme, lower order parent themes and subthemes reflected varied participant experiences. Specifically, one group of participants cited negative impacts due to COVID-19, a second group reported positive impacts, and a third group reported experiencing both positive and negative impacts. Participants reported both positive and negative experiences with virtual resources, identifying suggestions for improvement and other resources. Findings suggest that while individuals in AUD recovery experienced significant hardships, a proportion experienced positive impacts as well, and the positive and negative consequences were not mutually exclusive.

Debates about whether thromboembolic events while on aspirin represent \\"aspirin resistance\\" or \\"high on-treatment platelet reactivity\\" persist, given the poor intertest agreement between testing platforms. PROCEDURE This prospective observational study involved measuring aspirin efficacy using ex vivo testing of platelet aggregation (VerifyNow-Aspirin, VN) and urine 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (AsprinWorks, UTxB2) contemporaneously at up to three time points after major noncardiac organ transplant surgery. The collection days (CD) were the second and seventh days after stable aspirin dosing and then a convalescent time point 2-9 months later. RESULTS Fifty-five participants (age range, 0-21 years) were enrolled, having undergone total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (N = 36), orthotopic liver transplantation (N = 18), and combined liver-kidney transplantation (N = 1). Platelet reactivity measured by VN remained unchanged, whereas UTxB2, which was elevated postoperatively, decreased significantly from CD1 to CD2 and CD3. Discordance in therapeutic efficacy was noted per manufacturer cutoffs, with therapeutic VN results in 86% of tests, whereas 12% of UTxB2 were therapeutic. Age-based stratification of UTxB2 results using previously published pediatric median levels increased overall UTxB2 therapeutic rates (80%) and intertest concordance (67% vs 27% if using adult range).

METHODS: Ambispective multicenter cohort study from 5 Latin American countries. Children 18 years of age or younger with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or fulfilling MIS-C definition were included. FINDINGS: Four hundred nine children were included, with a median age of 3.0 years (interquartile range 0.6-9.0). Of these, 95 (23.2%) were diagnosed with MIS-C. One hundred ninety-one (46.7%) children were admitted to hospital and 52 (12.7%) required admission to a pediatric intensive care unit. Ninety-two (22.5%) patients required oxygen support: 8 (2%) were started on continuous positive airway pressure and 29 (7%) on mechanical ventilation. Thirty-five (8.5%) patients required inotropic support.

The goal of this study was to quantify the psychological effects of working in a high-risk unit during the SARS outbreak. METHODS: HCWs in a Toronto hospital who worked in high-risk areas completed a questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the SARS crisis along with the Impact of Event ScaleRevised, which screens for PTSS. The comparison group consisted of clinical units that had no contact with patients infected with SARS.

METHODS A descriptive, cross-sectional approach was used, and data were collected using a web-based survey. The demographic characteristics including age, years worked as critical care nurse, gender, advanced ICU training, educational level, and type of ICU, along with a delirium care knowledge quiz, were collected. The quiz consisted of 16 items measuring (a) symptoms, types, and outcomes; (b) high-risk groups; (c) predisposing and precipitating factors; and (d) assessment and detection of delirium. Data were collected between October 6 and November 16, 2020. RESULTS In total, 324 critical care nurses completed the survey. The rate of correct response on the delirium care quiz for each domain was measured: (a) symptoms, types, and outcomes: 67.1%; (b) high-risk groups: 76.2%; (c) predisposing and precipitating factors: 78.9%; and (d) assessment and detection: 41.5%. The item with the lowest correct response rate was related to the interpretation of delirium assessments.

The expression of the G-protein cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) in the brain is low, but is upregulated in glial cells during infection. Its activation down-regulates pro-inflammatory processes, driving microglia towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. CB2 agonists are therefore therapeutic candidates in inflammatory conditions like pneumococcal meningitis. We evaluated the effects of JWH-133, a specific CB2 agonist on microglial cells, inflammation, and damage driven by S. pneumoniae in vitro and in experimental pneumococcal meningitis. MATERIALS/METHODS: Primary mixed glial cultures were stimulated with live or heat-inactivated S. pneumoniae, or lipopolysaccharide and treated with JWH-133 or vehicle. Nitric oxide and cytokines levels were measured in the supernatant. In vivo, pneumococcal meningitis was induced by intracisternal injection of live S. pneumoniae in 11 days old Wistar rats. Animals were treated with antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, 100 mg/kg, s.c. bid) and JWH-133 (1 mg/kg, i.p. daily) or vehicle (10% Ethanol in saline, 100 l/25g body weight) at 18 h after infection. Brains were harvested at 24 and 42 h post infection (hpi) for histological assessment of hippocampal apoptosis and cortical damage and determination of cyto/chemokines in tissue homogenates. Microglia were characterized using Iba-1 immunostaining. Inflammation in brain homogenates was determined using membrane-based antibody arrays. RESULTS: In vitro, nitric oxide and cytokines levels were significantly lowered by JWH-133 treatment. In vivo, clinical parameters were not affected by the treatment. JWH-133 significantly lowered microglia activation assessed by quantification of cell process length and endpoints per microglia. Animals treated with JWH-133 demonstrated significantly lower parenchymal levels of chemokines (CINC-1, CINC-2/, and MIP-3), TIMP-1, and IL-6 at 24 hpi, and CINC-1, MIP-1, and IL-1 at 42 hpi. Quantitative analysis of brain damage did not reveal an effect of JWH-133. CONCLUSIONS: JWH-133 attenuates microglial activation and downregulates the concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators in pneumococcal infection in vitro and in vivo. However, we didnt observe a reduction in cortical or hippocampal injury. This data provides evidence that inhibition of microglia by adjuvant CB2 agonists therapy effectively downmodulates neuroinflammation but does not reduce brain damage in experimental pneumococcal meningitis","output":"Adjuvant Cannabinoid Receptor Type 2 Agonist Modulates the Polarization of Microglia Towards a Non-Inflammatory Phenotype in Experimental Pneumococcal Meningitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus (IAV) remains an important global public health threat with limited epidemiological information available from low-and-middle-income countries. The major objective of this study was to describe the proportions, temporal and spatial distribution, and demographic and clinical characteristics of IAV positive patients with influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Lahore, Pakistan. METHODS: Prospective surveillance was established in a sentinel hospital from October 2015 to May 2016. All eligible outpatients and inpatients with ILI or SARI were enrolled in the study. Nasal and/or throat swabs were collected along with clinico-epidemiological data. Samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) to identify IAV and subtype. The descriptive analysis of data was done in R software. RESULTS: Out of 311 enrolled patients, 284 (91.3%) were ILI and 27 (8.7%) were SARI cases. A distinct peak of ILI and SARI activity was observed in February. Fifty individuals (16%) were positive for IAV with peak positivity observed in December. Of 50 IAV, 15 were seasonal H3N2, 14 were H1N1pdm09 and 21 were unable to be typed. The majority of IAV positive cases (98%) presented with current or history of fever, 88% reported cough and 82% reported sore throat. The most common comorbidities in IAV positive cases were hepatitis C (4%), obesity (4%) and tuberculosis (6%). The highest incidence of patients reporting to the hospital was seen three days post symptoms onset (66/311) with 14 of these (14/66) positive for IAV. CONCLUSION: Distinct trends of ILI, SARI and IAV positive cases were observed which can be used to inform public health interventions (vaccinations, hand and respiratory hygiene) at appropriate times among high-risk groups. We suggest sampling from both ILI and SARI patients in routine surveillance as recommended by WHO.

N protein contains three dynamic disordered regions that house putative transiently-helical binding motifs. The two folded domains interact minimally such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA-binding protein. N protein also undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA, and polymer theory predicts that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction.

We examined a virtual reality module for practising a laparoscopic appendectomy. METHODS A prospective cohort study with the following 3 groups of surgeons (n = 45): novices (0 procedures), intermediates (10-50 procedures), and experienced (>100 procedures). After being introduced to the simulator and 1 familiarization attempt on the procedural module, the participants practiced the module 20 times. Movements, task time, and procedure-specific parameters were compared over time. RESULTS The time and movement parameters were significantly different during the first attempt, and more experienced surgeons used fewer movements and less time than novices (p < 0.01), although only 2 parameters were significantly different between novices and intermediates. All 3 groups improved significantly over 20 attempts (p < 0.0001). The intraclass correlation coefficient varied between 0.55 and 0.68 and did not differ significantly between the 3 groups (p > 0.05). When comparing novices with experienced surgeons, novices had a higher risk of burn damage to cecum (odds ratio [OR] = 3.0 [95% CI: 1.3; 7.0] p = 0.03), pressure damage to appendix (OR = 3.1 [95% CI: 2.0; 4.9] p < 0.0001), and grasping of the appendix (OR = 2.9 [95% CI: 1.8; 4.7] p < 0.0001). The risk of causing a perforation was not significantly different among the different experience levels (OR = 1.9 [95% CI: 0.9; 3.8] p = 0.14). Only 3 out of 5 error parameters differed significantly when comparing novices and experienced surgeons. Similarly, when comparing intermediates and novices, it was only 2 of the parameters that differed. DISCUSSION The simulator module for practising laparoscopic appendectomy may be useful as a training tool, but further development is required before it can be used for assessment purposes. Procedural simulation may demonstrate more variation for movement parameters, and future research should focus on developing better procedure-specific parameters.","output":"Evaluation of Procedural Simulation as a Training and Assessment Tool in General Surgery-Simulating a Laparoscopic Appendectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is persistent worldwide. A prior meta-analysis suggested the association of thrombocytopenia (TCP) with more severe COVID-19 illness and high mortality. Considering newly published studies, we updated the previous meta-analysis to confirm and explain the association of TCP with COVID-19 severity and multiple outcomes. Twenty-four studies with 5637 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. The weighted incidence of TCP in COVID-19 was 12.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9%C17.7%). Data synthesis showed that the platelet number was lower in patients with either more severe illness or poor outcomes and even lower in nonsurvivors, with weighted mean differences of ?24.56  10(9)/L, ?22.48  10(9)/L, and ?49.02  10(9)/L, respectively.

Massive increment of cases and deaths occurred in China and 209 countries in Europe, America, Australia, Asia and Pakistan. Pakistan was first hit by COVID-19 when a case was reported in Karachi on 26 February 2020. Several methods were presented to model the death rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to forecast the pinnacle of reported deaths. Still, these methods were not used in identifying the first day when Pakistan enters or exits the early exponential growth phase. OBJECTIVE: The present study intends to monitor variations in deaths and identify the growth phases such as pre-growth, growth, and post-growth phases in Pakistan due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: New approaches are needed that display the death patterns and signal an alarming situation so that corrective actions can be taken before the condition worsens. To meet this purpose, secondary data on daily reported deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered, and the $c$ and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts are used To meet this purpose, secondary data on daily reported deaths in Pakistan due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered. The $ c$ and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts have been used for monitoring variations. RESULTS: The chart shows that Pakistan switches from the pre-growth to the growth phase on 31 March 2020. The EWMA chart demonstrates that Pakistan remains in the growth phase from 31 March 2020 to 17 August 2020, with some indications signaling a decrease in deaths. It is found that Pakistan moved to a post-growth phase for a brief period from 27 July 2020 to 28 July 2020. Pakistan switches to re-growth phase with an alarm on 31/7/2020, right after the short-term post-growth phase. The number of deaths starts decreasing in August in that Pakistan may approach the post-growth phase shortly. CONCLUSION: This amalgamation of control charts illustrates a systematic implementation of the charts for government leaders and forefront medical teams to facilitate the rapid detection of daily reported deaths due to COVID-19. Besides government and public health officials, it is also the public's responsibility to follow the enforced standard operating procedures as a temporary remedy of this pandemic in ensuring public safety while awaiting a suitable vaccine to be discovered.","output":"Monitoring of three-phase variations in the mortality of COVID-19 pandemic using control charts: where does Pakistan stand?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To compare online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) to a clinically implemented plan selection strategy (PS) with respect to dose to the organs at risk (OAR) for rectal cancer. METHODS: The first 20 patients treated with PS between MayCSeptember 2016 were included. This resulted in 10 short (SCRT) and 10 long (LCRT) course radiotherapy treatment schedules with a total of 300 Conebeam CT scans (CBCT). New dual arc VMAT plans were generated using auto-planning for both the online ART and PS strategy. For each fraction bowel bag, bladder and mesorectum were delineated on daily Conebeam CTs. The dose distribution planned was used to calculate daily DVHs. Coverage of the CTV was calculated, as defined by the dose received by 99% of the CTV volume (D99%). The volume of normal tissue irradiated with 95% of the prescribed fraction dose was calculated by calculating the volume receiving 95% of the prescribed fraction or more dose minus the volume of the CTV. For each fraction the difference between the plan selection and online adaptive strategy of each DVH parameter was calculated, as well as the average difference per patient. RESULTS: Target coverage remained the same for online ART. The median volume of the normal tissue irradiated with 95% of the prescribed dose dropped from 642 cm3 (PS) to 237 cm3 (online-ART)(p < 0.001). Online ART reduced dose to the OARs for all tested dose levels for SCRT and LCRT (p < 0.001). For V15Gy of the bowel bag the median difference over all fractions of all patients was ? 126 cm(3) in LCRT, while the average difference per patient ranged from ? 206 cm(3) to ? 40 cm(3). For SCRT the median difference was ? 62 cm(3), while the range of the average difference per patient was ? 105 cm3 to ? 51 cm(3). For V15Gy of the bladder the median difference over all fractions of all patients was 26% in LCRT, while the average difference per patient ranged from ? 34 to 12%. For SCRT the median difference of V95% was ? 8%, while the range of the average difference per patient was ? 29 to 0%.

Where restarting research activities is permitted, investigators need to evaluate the risks and benefits of resuming data collection and adapt procedures to minimize risk. OBJECTIVES: In the context of the multicountry Household Air Pollution Intervention (HAPIN) trial conducted in rural, low-resource settings, we developed a framework to assess the risk of each trial activity and to guide protective measures. Our goal is to maximize the integrity of reseach aims while minimizing infection risk based on the latest scientific understanding of the virus. METHODS: We drew on a combination of expert consultations, risk assessment frameworks, institutional guidance and literature to develop our framework. We then systematically graded clinical, behavioral, laboratory and field environmental health research activities in four countries for both adult and child subjects using this framework. National and local government recommendations provided the minimum safety guidelines for our work. RESULTS: Our framework assesses risk based on staff proximity to the participant, exposure time between staff and participants, and potential viral aerosolization while performing the activity. For each activity, one of four risk levels, from minimal to unacceptable, is assigned and guidance on protective measures is provided. Those activities that can potentially aerosolize the virus are deemed the highest risk.

We examined differences over the 2 years after discharge in mortality, healthcare utilisation and frailty score between elderly survivors of ARI in the ICU and an elderly control population. METHODS We used 2009-2017 data from 39 hospital discharge databases. Patients  80 years old discharged alive from ICU hospitalisation for acute respiratory infection were propensity score-matched with controls (cataract surgery) discharged from the hospital at the same time and adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities present before hospitalisation. We reported 2-year mortality and compared healthcare utilisation and frailty scores in the 2-year periods before and after ICU hospitalisation. RESULTS One thousand two hundred and twenty elderly survivors of acute respiratory infection in the ICU were discharged, and 988 were successfully matched with controls. After discharge, patients had a 10.1-fold [95% CI, 6.1-17.3] higher risk of death at 6 months and 3.6-fold [95% CI, 2.9-4.6] higher risk of death at 2 years compared with controls. They also had a 2-fold increase in both healthcare utilisation and frailty score in the 2 years after hospital discharge, whereas healthcare utilisation and frailty scores among controls were stable before and after hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS We observed a substantially increased rate of death in the years following ICU hospitalisation for elderly patients along with elevated healthcare resource use and accelerated age-associated decline as assessed by frailty score. These findings provide data for better informed goals-of-care discussions and may help target post-ICU discharge services.","output":"Long-term survival of elderly patients after intensive care unit admission for acute respiratory infection: a population-based, propensity score-matched cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Las diarreas agudas, 1,5 mil millones de casos al a?o en el mundo, representan la primera causa de mortalidad en el ni?o.

Later, other associated clinical manifestations were described, affecting diverse target organs in the human body and showing the enormous burden carried by the virus and the associated diseases. The epidemiology of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 showed that they were largely distributed around the world, although it is possible to locate geographical areas with pockets of low and very high prevalence and incidence. Aboriginal Australians and indigenous peoples of Brazil are examples of the large spread of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively. The epidemiological link of both situations is their occurrence among isolated, epidemiologically closed or semi-closed communities. The origin of the viruses in South America shows two different branches with distinct timing of entry. HTLV-1 made its probable entrance in a more recent route through the east coast of Brazil at the beginning of the slave trade from the African continent, starting in the 16th century and lasting for more than 350 years. HTLV-2 followed the ancient route of human migration from the Asian continent, crossing the Behring Strait and then splitting in South America as the population became separated by the Andes Mountains. By that time, HTLV-2c probably arose and became isolated among the indigenous populations in the Brazilian Amazon. The study of epidemiologically closed communities of indigenous populations in Brazil allowed tracing the most likely route of entry, the generation of a new molecular subtype (HTLV-2c), the elucidation of the vertical transmission of HTLV-2, the intrafamilial aggregation of cases and the escape and spread of the virus to other areas in Brazil and abroad. Despite the burden and impact of both viruses, they are maintained as silent infections among human populations because 1, health authorities in most South American countries in which national surveillance is poor have little interest in the disease, 2, the information is commonly lost as indigenous groups do not have specific policies for HTLV and other sexually transmitted infections, and 3, health access is not feasible or properly delivered.","output":"HTLV in South America: Origins of a silent ancient human infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The capacity of hospitals and primary care centres has, rightfully, been at the centre of public and political debate on resource availability and control measures during the outbreak of COVID-19 and lockdown.

The aim is that this experience could be useful in places where this problem will continue and could help future interventions. Methods: A telephone survey was carried out as the main methodology, to collect information for the subsequent organization and repercussion on professionals and patients. This was carried out by the heads of the 18 DAACYL units. Among the interventions applied, the following stand out: implantation of telemedicine techniques, restriction of daily methadone dispensing, suspension of urine controls and initiation of care programs for the homeless. Results: As a result of these interventions, the professionals observed that patients are less demanding and mostly stable, with a low percentage of relapses. An increase in the consumption of alcohol and benzodiazepines have been reported as more common among people who relapse. Furthermore, the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the sample is minimal; therefore, different hypotheses should be considered as an explanation (infra-diagnosis, immune system used to aggression, possible anti-inflammatory effect of some psychotropic drugs and a greater perception of danger against infection than the general population). Conclusions: The rapid adaptation and successful implementation of DAACYL have had satisfactory results.

METHOD: Patients with confirmed acute COVID\\\\19 were studied prospectively. Neurological symptoms were recorded during the acute phase of the disease and at six months follow\\\\up, and blood samples were collected longitudinally. Healthy age\\\\matched individuals were included as controls. We analyzed plasma concentrations of neurofilament light\\\\chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp), and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF\\\\15). RESULT: We recruited 100 patients with mild (n = 24), moderate (n = 28), and severe (n = 48) COVID\\\\19 who were followed for a median of (IQR) 225 (187C262) days. In the acute phase, patients with severe COVID\\\\19 had higher concentrations of NfL than all other groups (all p < 0.001) and higher GFAp than controls (p < 0.001). GFAp was also significantly increased in moderate disease (p < 0.05) compared with controls. NfL (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) and GFAp (r = 0.39, p < 0.001) correlated with GDF\\\\15 during the acute phase.

Here, ED patients with incurable illness often have prolonged stays. Palliative care (PC) is a low-cost intervention that focuses on alleviating pain and suffering for patients with incurable disease, while improving satisfaction with care and optimizing healthcare utilization. This is especially important in low resource settings. A prior needs assessment in our ED revealed that 50% of patients have PC needs. The ED is an optimal location to initiate PC, yet this rarely happens. There is a great need to identify factors affecting initiation of ED PC in our resource-limited setting. METHODS: A semi-structured questionnaire and chart review was conducted from March to August 2020. Patients admitted from the ED were assessed for PC needs. Those who met criteria were approached for inclusion and flagged for initiation of PC. The follow-up period was 7 days. RESULTS: Sixty two percent of those subjects flagged for initiation of PC received it. By day seven, 36.1 of the study population had died. ED initiation of PC varied significantly by diagnosis, with cancer patients more likely to receive PC (p = 0.0097). CONCLUSION: Important barriers to PC initiation were identified in our Ugandan ED, related to diagnosis. These barriers could be overcome by improving awareness of PC amongst patients and providers alike and implementing a PC screening tool for all admissions.

Various case studies have hinted at a correlation between COVID-19 and the onset of Parkinson's disease. For this reason, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study whether amyloidogenic regions in SARS-COV-2 proteins can initiate and modulate aggregation of -synuclein. As an example, we choose the nine-residue fragment SFYVYSRVK (SK9), located on the C-terminal of the envelope protein of SARS-COV-2. We probe how the presence of SK9 affects the conformational ensemble of -synuclein monomers and the stability of two resolved fibril polymorphs. We find that the viral protein fragment SK9 may alter -synuclein amyloid formation by shifting the ensemble toward aggregation-prone and preferentially rod-like fibril seeding conformations. However, SK9 has only a small effect on the stability of pre-existing or newly formed fibrils.

Solenopsis geminata is a worldwide tramp species but a native of the southern coastal regions of the USA. It was found to only produce cis- and trans-2-methyl-6-undecyl-piperidines. These alkaloids were considered the Solenopsis ancestral alkaloid profile since they were identified from female sexuals (potential queens) of all Solenopsis species in South and North America. The dramatic modification of alkaloids in Solenopsis invicta was attributed to their response to evolutionary pressure and the lack of change in S. geminata alkaloids due to no response to evolutionary pressure. Here we report the unexpected discovery of 6-undecyl-pyridine, 2-methyl-6-undecyl-pyridine and 2-methyl-6-(1)-undecenyl-pyridine as components of S. geminata worker venom, suggesting that S. geminata like its South American relatives have responded to evolutionary pressures. Our results will stimulate future research on S. geminata populations throughout the tropical/subtropical world.","output":"Novel alkaloids from the fire ant, Solenopsis geminata"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, this fatal disease has been the leading cause of the death of more than 3.9 million people around the world. This tragedy taught us that we should be well-prepared to control the spread of such infectious diseases and prevent future hazards. As a consequence, this pandemic has drawn the attention of many researchers to the development of portable platforms with short hands-on and turnaround time suitable for batch production in urgent pandemic situations such as that of COVID-19. Two main groups of diagnostic assays have been reported for the detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) including nucleic acid-based and protein-based assays. The main focus of this paper is on the latter, which requires a shorter time duration, less skilled technicians, and faces lower contamination. Furthermore, this paper gives an overview of the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) biosensors, which are potentially useful for implementing point-of-care (PoC) platforms based on such assays. CMOS technology, as a predominant technology for the fabrication of integrated circuits, is a promising candidate for the development of PoC devices by offering the advantages of reliability, accessibility, scalability, low power consumption, and distinct cost.","output":"Towards Fully Integrated Portable Sensing Devices for COVID-19 and Future Global Hazards: Recent Advances, Challenges, and Prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE We conducted this randomized trial to compare the LigaSure Vessel Sealing System with conventional methods in gastrointestinal carcinoma surgery at five specialty cancer hospitals. METHODS Patients with resectable stomach or colorectal cancers were randomized to the LigaSure (n = 100) or conventional surgery (n = 74) groups according to sealed envelopes. The operative data were compared. RESULTS There were no significant differences in operating times, blood loss, postoperative complications, or hospital stay. However, at the hospital where most of the procedures took place, the LigaSure was associated with a shorter operating time (173  43 min for gastric carcinoma and 157  43 min for colorectal carcinoma vs 211  55 min and 202  55 min for conventional surgery; P = 0.0046 and P = 0.0200, respectively) and less blood loss (300  196 ml and 150  133 ml, respectively, vs 453  387 ml and 382  444 ml; P = 0.0482 and P = 0.0465, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the incidences of preterm birth before and after the introduction of COVID-19 mitigation measures in Scandinavian countries using robust population-based registry data. STUDY DESIGN: This was a registry-based difference-in-differences study using births from January 2014 through December 2020 in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. The changes in the preterm birth (<37 weeks) rates before and after the introduction of COVID-19 mitigation measures (set to March 12, 2020) were compared with the changes in preterm birth before and after March 12 from 2014 to 2019. The differences per 1000 births were calculated for 2-, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-week intervals before and after March 12. The secondary analyses included medically indicated preterm birth, spontaneous preterm birth, and very preterm (<32 weeks) birth. RESULTS: A total of 1,519,521 births were included in this study. During the study period, 5.6% of the births were preterm in Norway and Sweden, and 5.7% were preterm in Denmark. There was a seasonal variation in the incidence of preterm birth, with the highest incidence during winter. In all the 3 countries, there was a slight overall decline in preterm births from 2014 to 2020. There was no consistent evidence of a change in the preterm birth rates following the introduction of COVID-19 mitigation measures, with difference-in-differences estimates ranging from 3.7 per 1000 births (95% confidence interval, ?3.8 to 11.1) for the first 2 weeks after March 12, 2020, to ?1.8 per 1000 births (95% confidence interval, ?4.6 to 1.1) in the 16 weeks after March 12, 2020. Similarly, there was no evidence of an impact on medically indicated preterm birth, spontaneous preterm birth, or very preterm birth. CONCLUSION: Using high-quality national data on births in 3 Scandinavian countries, each of which implemented different approaches to address the pandemic, there was no evidence of a decline in preterm births following the introduction of COVID-19 mitigation measures.","output":"Preterm birth after the introduction of COVID-19 mitigation measures in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark: a registry-based difference-in-differences study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft has many advantages (e.g., high strength and solid fixation), there are also several complications (e.g., anterior knee pain or kneeling pain) due to harvest-site morbidity associated with the use of this graft type compared with the use of hamstring tendon. Therefore the ultimate goal of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a BPTB graft is to minimize harvest-site morbidity. We have used a technique for harvesting central-third BPTB grafts that involves only a 3-cm-long, longitudinal, curved incision in the medial tibial tuberosity for both graft harvesting and fixation. The purpose of this report is to describe the technique, which can avoid the harvest-site morbidities associated with BPTB autografts during knee arthroscopy. We believe that this less invasive reconstruction may reduce the harvest-site morbidities associated with BPTB grafts because it allows for BPTB graft harvesting without incising the synovial bursa or paratenon and mitigates scarring and adhesion formation.","output":"Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using a Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Autograft to Avoid Harvest-Site Morbidity in Knee Arthroscopy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Primary care is well positioned to identify and address loneliness and social isolation in older adults, given its gatekeeper function in many healthcare systems. We aimed to identify and characterise loneliness and social isolation interventions and detect factors influencing implementation in primary care. DESIGN: Scoping review using the five-step Arksey and OMalley Framework. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, COCHRANE databases and grey literature were searched from inception to June 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Empirical studies in English and Spanish focusing on interventions addressing social isolation and loneliness in older adults involving primary care services or professionals. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We extracted data on loneliness and social isolation identification strategies and the professionals involved, networks and characteristics of the interventions and barriers to and facilitators of implementation. We conducted a thematic content analysis to integrate the information extracted. RESULTS: 32 documents were included in the review. Only seven articles (22%) reported primary care professionals screening of older adults loneliness or social isolation, mainly through questionnaires. Several interventions showed networks between primary care, health and non-healthcare sectors, with a dominance of referral pathways (n=17). Two-thirds of reports did not provide clear theoretical frameworks, and one-third described lengths under 6 months. Workload, lack of interest and ageing-related barriers affected implementation outcomes. In contrast, well-defined pathways, collaborative designs, long-lasting and accessible interventions acted as facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: There is an apparent lack of consistency in strategies to identify lonely and socially isolated older adults. This might lead to conflicts between intervention content and participant needs. We also identified a predominance of schemes linking primary care and non-healthcare sectors. However, although professionals and participants reported the need for long-lasting interventions to create meaningful social networks, durable interventions were scarce.

However, modification of electrode surfaces to improve the anti-interference ability and sensitivity is highly desirable for direct electroanalysis of whole blood samples. Here, a reliable and miniaturized electrochemical sensor is demonstrated based on SPCE equipped with vertically-ordered mesoporous silica-nanochannel film (VMSF). To achieve stable binding of VMSF and improve the electrocatalytic performance, electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ErGO) is applied as a conductive adhesion layer, that is in situ reduced from GO nanosheets during fast growth (less than 10 s) of amino groups modified VMSF (NH(2)-VMSF) using electrochemically assisted self-assembly (EASA). In comparison with bare SPCE, NH(2)-VMSF/ErGO/SPCE exhibits decreased oxidation potential of uric acid (UA) by 147 mV owing to significant electrocatalytic ability of ErGO. The dual signal amplification based on electrocatalysis of ErGO and enrichment of nanochannels leads to enhanced peak current by 3.9 times. Thus, the developed NH(2)-VMSF/ErGO/SPCE sensor enables sensitive detection of UA in the range from 0.5 M to 180 M with a low limit of detection (LOD, 129 nM, S/N = 3). Owing to good anti-fouling ability and high selectivity of the sensor, direct and rapid detection of UA in human whole blood is realized with very low sample consumption (50 L).","output":"Electrochemical Sensor Nanoarchitectonics for Sensitive Detection of Uric Acid in Human Whole Blood Based on Screen-Printed Carbon Electrode Equipped with Vertically-Ordered Mesoporous Silica-Nanochannel Film"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In many countries, private companies provide primary care services based predominantly on offering video consultations via smartphones. One example is Babylon GP at Hand (BGPaH), which offers video consultations to National Health Service patients, 24 hours a day, and has grown rapidly in London over the last 3 years. The development of this type of service has been controversial, particularly in the United Kingdom, but there has been little formal published evaluation of these services in any country. This paper outlines the main controversies about the use of privately provided video consultation services for primary care and shows how they are informed by the limited evaluations that have been conducted, particularly the evaluation of BGPaH. This paper describes the advantages of these services in terms of convenience, speed of access, the ability to consult without traveling or face-to-face patient-doctor contact, and the possibility of recruiting doctors who cannot work in conventional settings or do not live near the patients. It also highlights the concerns and uncertainties about quality and safety, demand, fragmentation of care, impact on other health services, efficiency, and equity. There are questions about whether private primary care services based on video consultations have a sustainable business model and whether they will undermine other health care providers. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the use of video consulting has become more widespread within conventional primary care services, and this is likely to have lasting consequences for the future delivery of primary care. It is important to understand the extent to which lessons from the evaluation of BGPaH and other private services based on a video-first model are relevant to the use of video consulting within conventional general practices, and to consider the advantages and disadvantages of these developments, before video consultation-based services in primary care become more widely established.","output":"Private Video Consultation Services and the Future of Primary Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper considers the purpose, values and principles underpinning higher music education (HME) as one of the performing arts in a context of turbulent global change. Recognising complex challenges and opportunities in this field, HME is addressed from dual perspectives: educating the next generations of professional musicians, and higher music institutions (HMEIs) engagement in society. The paper has a particular focus on the sector within HME that is dedicated to intensive practical craft training for performers, composers, programmers, producers, managers, and teachers. We argue that there is an urgent need for fresh orientating frameworks through which to navigate HMEs development. We examine concepts such as artistic citizenship, social responsibility and civic mission increasingly perceived to be relevant to the sector, and we explore their connexions to concepts of artistic excellence, imagination and creativity, and musical heritage. We identify apparent dichotomies of value within contemporary HME, including between intrinsic and instrumental purpose in the arts, cultural heritage, and new work, artistic imagination and entrepreneurship, and we argue that creative tensions between what have hitherto easily been perceived as opposing concepts or competing priorities need to be embraced. To support our argument we draw on the particular ethnomusicological concept of musicking, and we look toward a partnering of artistic and social values in order to enable HME to respond dynamically to societal need, and to continue to engage with the depth and integrity of established musical traditions and their craft. Based on this discussion we propose a conceptual foundation: the musician as a maker in society, in which developing vision as a musician in society, underpinned on the one hand by immersion in musical artistry and on the other hand sustained practical experience of connecting and engaging with communities, offers invaluable preparation for and transition into professional life. We propose that this idea, connecting societal and artistic vision and practise, is equally essential for HMEIs as it is for musicians, and sits at the heart of the roles they evolve within their local communities and wider society.","output":"Musicians as Makers in Society: A Conceptual Foundation for Contemporary Professional Higher Music Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forever affected healthcare and posed an incredible challenge to our society to care for our sick.

A major limitation of DL models is their vulnerability to adversarial images, manipulated input images designed to cause misclassifications by DL models. The purpose of the study is to investigate the robustness of DL models trained on diagnostic images using adversarial images and explore the utility of an iterative adversarial training approach to improve the robustness of DL models against adversarial images. METHODS: We examined the impact of adversarial images on the classification accuracies of DL models trained to classify cancerous lesions across three common oncologic imaging modalities. The computed tomography (CT) model was trained to classify malignant lung nodules. The mammogram model was trained to classify malignant breast lesions. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) model was trained to classify brain metastases. RESULTS: Oncologic images showed instability to small pixel-level changes. A pixel-level perturbation of 0.004 (for pixels normalized to the range between 0 and 1) resulted in most oncologic images to be misclassified (CT 25.6%, mammogram 23.9%, and MRI 6.4% accuracy). Adversarial training improved the stability and robustness of DL models trained on oncologic images compared with naive models ([CT 67.7% v 26.9%], mammogram [63.4% vs 27.7%], and MRI [87.2% vs 24.3%]). CONCLUSION: DL models naively trained on oncologic images exhibited dramatic instability to small pixel-level changes resulting in substantial decreases in accuracy. Adversarial training techniques improved the stability and robustness of DL models to such pixel-level changes.

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients with locally advanced NSCLC receiving neoadjuvant nivolumab and chemotherapy (paclitaxel with carboplatin) followed by surgery at our institution from January 2019 to January 2020. Results: A total of 46 eligible patients, 26 males, and 20 females were diagnosed with NSCLC in a stage IIIA (30 cases) and IIIB (16 cases) to receive neoadjuvant treatment. The treatment was well tolerated with just 7 (15.2%) typical immune-related adverse events (hyperthyroidism, hyperglycemia, and rash) recorded. A total of 45 patients underwent surgical resection, and 43 (95.6%) of them achieved a R0 resection. No major surgical complications were observed.

Brief, accessible, and non-stigmatizing community-based interventions delivered by lay providers may help address treatment needs in SSA. One such intervention, the Shamiri Intervention, consisting of three elements (growth mindset, gratitude, and value affirmation) has been tested in randomized controlled trials with school-going Kenyan adolescents. This three-element Shamiri Intervention has been shown to significantly reduce depression and anxiety symptoms and improve social support and academic performance relative to a control group. In this trial, we aim to investigate the effects of each element of the Shamiri Intervention. METHODS: In this five-arm randomized controlled trial, we will test each of the intervention components (growth mindset, gratitude, and value affirmation) against the full Shamiri Intervention and against a study skills control intervention. Students (N(planned) = 1288) at participating secondary schools who are interested in participating in this universal intervention will be randomized in equal numbers into the five groups. The students will meet in groups of 8C15 students led by local high school graduate lay providers. These lay providers will receive a brief training, plus expert supervision once a week throughout the intervention delivery. Multi-level models will be used to compare trajectories over time of the primary outcomes (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, academic performance, and wellness) and secondary outcomes in each intervention group to the control group. Multi-level models will also be used to compare trajectories over time of the primary outcomes (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, academic performance, and wellness) and secondary outcomes of participants in the single-element interventions compared to the full Shamiri Intervention.

Further, adverse birth outcomes, such as preterm delivery and stillbirth, might be more common among pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (2,3). Information about SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is rapidly growing; however, data on reasons for hospital admission, pregnancy-specific characteristics, and birth outcomes among pregnant women hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infections are limited. During March 1-May 30, 2020, as part of Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)? surveillance of COVID-19 hospitalizations, 105 hospitalized pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified, including 62 (59%) hospitalized for obstetric reasons (i.e., labor and delivery or another pregnancy-related indication) and 43 (41%) hospitalized for COVID-19 illness without an obstetric reason. Overall, 50 (81%) of 62 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted for obstetric reasons were asymptomatic. Among 43 pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19, 13 (30%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, six (14%) required mechanical ventilation, and one died from COVID-19. Prepregnancy obesity was more common (44%) among pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19 than that among asymptomatic pregnant women hospitalized for obstetric reasons (31%). Likewise, the rate of gestational diabetes (26%) among pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19 was higher than it was among women hospitalized for obstetric reasons (8%). Preterm delivery occurred in 15% of pregnancies among 93 women who delivered, and stillbirths (fetal death at 20 weeks' gestation) occurred in 3%. Antenatal counseling emphasizing preventive measures (e.g., use of masks, frequent hand washing, and social distancing) might help prevent COVID-19 among pregnant women, especially those with prepregnancy obesity and gestational diabetes, which might reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Hospitalized Pregnant Women: Reasons for Admission and Pregnancy Characteristics  Eight U.S. Health Care Centers, March 1CMay 30, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases by definition spread and therefore have impact beyond local hospitals and institutions where they occur.

METHODS: An online questionnaire designed for medical faculty students. The questionnaire was applied to 355 volunteer medical faculty students. The questionnaire consisted of demographics, five-point Likert items, and open-ended questions. The questionnaire was applied between August and September 2020. Distance anatomy education activities were evaluated during March and July 2020. RESULTS: Results showed face-to-face theoretical anatomy education was found to be more effective than distance anatomy education conducted with recorded lecture videos. Even though the positive aspects of distance anatomy education stand out in topics, such as time management, it has been stated that cadaver and laboratory education has been disrupted. Most of the students agreed that they spent more time on supplementary resources during distance anatomy education. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an unexpected experimental environment. The demand for a blended method, which consists of distance (supported by video recordings) theoretical anatomy education and face-to-face practical anatomy education for the post-pandemic period comes to the fore. Distance anatomy education brings some problems with it due to its nature, and it is essential to seek unique solutions to them.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounts for 68% of the infection and contributed 74% of the 1.5 million deaths in 2013 despite having only 12% of the total world population residing in the region. This systematic review has attempted to determine the association between heavy metal toxicity and the occurrence of non-communicable diseases in the HIV/AIDS population. Materials and Methods: Three databases were systematically searched: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies written in English and published between 1 April 2000 and 12 April 2020. Studies were excluded if the main outcomes were not measured or did not meet the inclusion criteria. Results: All the six included studies are cross-sectional in design, and therefore were evaluated using the STROBE checklist. The data extraction was done using an extraction table; the ratio of female to male participants included in the study was 1.09:1. Qualitative analysis was used due to the heterogeneity in the heavy metal biomarkers and the outcome measured by the included studies. Two studies compared the concentration of heavy metals in HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants while one compared the levels between HAART-na?ve and HAART-treated participants, and three determined the association between heavy metal toxicity and non-communicable diseases (liver fibrosis, anaemia, and reproductive parameters, respectively) in HIV-positive patients. Conclusions: Blood lead, cadmium, and mercury levels were higher in HIV-seropositive than -seronegative subjects, whereas serum zinc level was lower in HIV-seropositive than -seronegative subjects, but the causal association between heavy metals and non-communicable diseases in HIV subjects is largely unknown.

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently used clinically because it has higher binding specificity for insoluble fibrin (IF) than urokinase (UK), but even pro-tPA has catalytic activity in places other than IF. Meanwhile, UK has the advantage that it is specifically activated on IF, but it only binds IF weakly. Unlike the anti-IF monoclonal antibody (mAb) established in the past, our anti-IF mAb recognizes a pit structure formed only in IF. Here, we developed a new mAb against the pit, 1101, that does not affect coagulation or fibrinolysis, and prepared a fusion protein of UK with humanized 1101 Fab to transport UK selectively to IF. In IF-containing lesions, UK is cleaved by plasmin at two sites, Lys158/Ile159 and Lys135/Lys136. Cleavage of the former leads to activation of UK; however, because activated UK is linked by S-S bonds before and after cleavage, it is not released from the fusion. Cleavage at the latter site causes UK to leave the fusion protein; hence, we mutated Lys135/Lys136 to Gly135/Gly136 to prevent release of UK. This engineered UK-antibody fusion, AMU1114, significantly decreased the systemic side effects of UK in vivo. In a mouse thrombus formation experiment, the vascular patency rate was 0% (0/10) in the control, 50% (5/10) in the tPA, and 90% (9/10) in the AMU1114 treatment group.

Against the backdrop of this pandemic, it becomes imperative to study the effects of this infection on pregnancy and its outcome. Hence, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 infection on the maternal morbidity and mortality, the course of labour as well as the neonatal outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 977 pregnant women were included in the study, from 1st April to 15th May 2020 at a tertiary care hospital. There were 141 women who tested COVID positive and remaining 836 patients were included in the COVID negative group. Findings were compared in both the groups. RESULTS: The incidence of COVID positive pregnant women was found to be 14.43%. More patients delivered by LSCS in the COVID positive and the COVID negative group (50%) as compared to COVID negative group (47%), (p > 0.05). Low APGAR score (0-3) was observed in 2(1.52%) neonates of COVID positive mothers and in 15 (1.91%) neonates of COVID negative mothers. Overall most of the babies were healthy. Out of all babies tested, 3 were detected positive initially which were retested on day 5 and were found to be negative. CONCLUSION: There is no significant effect of COVID infection on maternal and foetal outcome in pregnancy and there is no evidence of vertical transmission of the COVID-19 infection but long-term follow-up of these babies is recommended.","output":"Impact of the Coronavirus Infection in Pregnancy: A Preliminary Study of 141 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a proper risk assessment of respiratory pathogens in indoor settings. This paper documents the COVID Airborne Risk Assessment methodology, to assess the potential exposure of airborne SARS-CoV-2 viruses, with an emphasis on virological and immunological factors in the quantification of the risk. The model results from a multidisciplinary approach linking physical, mechanical and biological domains, enabling decision makers or facility managers to assess their indoor setting. The model was benchmarked against clinical data, as well as two real-life outbreaks, showing good agreement. A probability of infection is computed in several everyday-life settings and with various mitigation measures. The importance of super-emitters in airborne transmission is confirmed: 20% of infected hosts can emit approximately two orders of magnitude more viral-containing particles. The use of masks provides a fivefold reduction in viral emissions. Natural ventilation strategies are very effective to decrease the concentration of virions, although periodic venting strategies are not ideal in certain settings. Although vaccination is an effective measure against hospitalization, their effectiveness against transmission is not optimal, hence non-pharmaceutical interventions (ventilation, masks) should be actively supported. We also propose a critical threshold to define an acceptable risk level.","output":"Modelling airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 using CARA: risk assessment for enclosed spaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND If 70% of cutaneous melanomas develop de novo, small-diameter or tiny lesions are expected to represent the earliest manifestation of most melanomas. OBJECTIVES To describe the clinical, histopathological and dermoscopic features of tiny melanomas; and to investigate the impact of imaging tools, including total body photography (TBP) and sequential digital dermoscopy imaging (SDDI) in their detection. METHODS Consecutive melanomas diagnosed over 2 years in a referral centre were retrospectively included. Diameter 5mm on dermoscopy defined tiny melanomas. Dermoscopic features and performance of four methods were evaluated. RESULTS 86/312 (27.6%) of the included melanomas measured 5mm. They were invasive in 44.2%. Tiny melanomas were more frequently excised for being new and/or changing compared to non-tiny melanomas (77.9% vs. 50.9%; P<.0001). Half of the tiny melanomas would have been missed by the dermoscopic 7-point checklist (48.2%) or the 3-point checklist (49.4%). Menzies' method and the revised pattern analysis correctly identified respectively 65.9% and 63.5% of the tiny melanomas. The most frequent positive features for tiny melanomas were asymmetry in structure or colour (77.6%), brown dots (65.9%), irregular dots and globules (76.5%) and atypical pigment network (44.7%). Dermoscopic features predictive of invasion in tiny melanomas were (OR, 95%CI) atypical vascular pattern (26.5, 1.5-475.5, P=.002), shiny white lines (12.4, 0.7-237.8, P=0.04) and grey/blue structures (3.7, 1.3-10.5, P=0.01).

RESULTS The mean patient age was 44 years and 52.9% were men; 186/189 had 1 co-existing medical condition. Fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, diarrhoea, and headache were common symptoms at onset; hypertension was the most common co-morbidity. Common clinical signs included dyspnoea, hypoxia, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and neutropenia; most lesions exhibited subpleural distribution. The most common radiological manifestation was mixed ground-glass opacity with consolidation (mGGO-C); most patients had grid-like shadows and some showed paving stones. Patients with hypertension, dyspnoea, or hypoxia exhibited more severe lobe involvement and diffusely distributed lesions. Patients in severely affected areas exhibited higher body temperature; more fatigue and dyspnoea; and more manifestations of multiple lesions, lobe involvement, and mGGO-C. During the Wuhan lockdown period, cough, nausea, and dyspnoea were alleviated in patients with newly confirmed COVID-19; lobe involvement was also improved. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with COVID-19 hospitalised at the peak of the epidemic in China, fever, cough, and dyspnoea were the main symptoms at initial diagnosis, accompanied by lymphocytopenia and hypoxaemia.

To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The modified scaffolds show enhanced expression of alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, vinculin, and a larger cell spreading area. Meanwhile, the caging of ZnO nanoparticles can allow the slow release of Zn2+ ions, which not only activate various signaling pathways to guide osteogenic differentiation but also prevent the potential bacterial infection of implantable scaffolds. Overall, this study may provide new insight for designing stem cell-based nanostructured fibrous scaffolds with simultaneously enhanced osteogenic and anti-infective capabilities.","output":"ZnO/Nanocarbons-Modified Fibrous Scaffolds for Stem Cell-Based Osteogenic Differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused deaths and shortages in medical resources worldwide, making the prediction of patient prognosis and the identification of risk factors very important. Increasing age is already known as one of the main risk factors for poor outcomes, but the effect of body mass index (BMI) on COVID-19 outcomes in older patients has not yet been investigated. Aim: We aimed to determine the effect of BMI on the severity and mortality of COVID-19 among older patients in South Korea. Methods: Data from 1272 COVID-19 patients (60 years old) were collected by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The odds ratios (ORs) of severe infection and death in the BMI groups were analyzed by logistic regression adjusted for covariates. Results: The underweight group (BMI<18.5 kg/m(2)) had a higher OR for death (adjusted OR = 2.23, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.06C4.52) than the normal weight group (BMI, 18.5C22.9 kg/m(2)). Overweight (BMI, 23.0C24.9 kg/m(2)) was associated with lower risks of both severe infection (adjusted OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.31C0.94) and death (adjusted OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.27C0.91). Conclusions: Underweight was associated with an increased risk of death, and overweight was related to lower risks of severe infection and death in older COVID-19 patients in Korea. However, this study was limited by the lack of availability of some information, including smoking status. KEY MESSAGES: Underweight is an independent risk factor of death in older COVID-19 patients. Overweight patients have a lower risk of death and severe infection than normal-weight patients.","output":"The effect of BMI on COVID-19 outcomes among older patients in South Korea: a nationwide retrospective cohort study*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an investigation of six anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody kits with different target antigen and methodology, each kit showed comparable performance.

Understanding how the virus engages the immune system will facilitate the development of needed therapeutic strategies. In this study, we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that the SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins spike (S) and envelope (E) activate the key immune signaling IFN pathway in both human and mouse immune and epithelial cells independent of viral infection and replication. These proteins induce reactive oxidative species generation and increases in human- and murine-specific, IFN-responsive cytokines and chemokines, similar to their upregulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Induction of IFN signaling is dependent on canonical but discrepant inflammatory signaling mediators, as the activation induced by S is dependent on IRF3, TBK1, and MyD88, whereas that of E is largely MyD88 independent. Furthermore, these viral surface proteins, specifically E, induced peribronchial inflammation and pulmonary vasculitis in a mouse model. Finally, we show that the organized inflammatory infiltrates are dependent on type I IFN signaling, specifically in lung epithelial cells.

The objective of this scoping review was to identify healthcare practices that increase the quality of care in cancer trajectories from a general practice perspective. DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS A scoping review of the literature published in Danish or English from 2010 to 2020 was conducted. Data was collected using identified keywords and indexed terms in several databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO CINAHL, Scopus, and ProQuest), contacting key experts, searching through reference lists, and reports from selected health political, research- and interest organizations' websites. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We identified healthcare practices in cancer trajectories that increase quality care. Identified healthcare practices were grouped into four contextual domains and allocated to defined phases in the cancer trajectory. The results are presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). RESULTS A total of 45 peer-reviewed and six non-peer-reviewed articles and reports were included. Quality of care increases in all phases of the cancer trajectory when GPs listen carefully to the full story and use action plans. After diagnosis, quality of care increases when GPs and practice staff have a proactive care approach, act as interpreters of diagnosis, treatment options, and its consequences, and engage in care coordination with specialists in secondary care involving the patient. CONCLUSION This scoping review identified healthcare practices that increase the quality of care in cancer trajectories from a general practice perspective. The results support general practice in investigating own healthcare practices and identifying possibilities for quality improvement.KEY POINTSIdentified healthcare practices in general practice that increase the quality of care in cancer trajectories:Listen carefully to the full storyUse action plans and time-out-consultationsPlan and provide proactive careAct as an interpreter of diagnosis, treatment options, and its consequences for the patientCoordinate care with specialists, patients, and caregivers with mutual respectIdentified barriers for quality of care in cancer trajectories are:Time constraints in consultationsLimited accessibility for patients and caregiversHealth practices to increase the quality of care should be effective, safe, people-centered, timely, equitable, integrated, and efficient.

One of the most striking phenomena has been a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated coagulopathy. Given these findings, questions naturally emerged about the prothrombotic impact of COVID-19 on cerebrovascular disease and whether ischemic stroke is a clinical feature specific to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Early reports from China and several sites in the northeastern United States seemed to confirm these suspicions. Since these initial reports, many cohort studies worldwide observed decreased rates of stroke since the start of the pandemic, raising concerns for a broader impact of the pandemic on stroke treatment. In this review, we provide a comprehensive assessment of how the pandemic has affected stroke presentation, epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on cerebrovascular disease. Much evidence suggests that this decline in stroke admissions stems from the global response to the virus, which has made it more difficult for patients to get to the hospital once symptoms start. However, there does not appear to be a demonstrable impact on quality metrics once patients arrive at the hospital. Despite initial concerns, there is insufficient evidence to ascribe a causal relationship specific to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 on the cerebral vasculature. Nevertheless, when patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 present with stroke, their presentation is likely to be more severe, and they have a markedly higher rate of in-hospital mortality than patients with either acute ischemic stroke or COVID-19 alone.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cerebrovascular disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two-dimensional (2D) tungsten diselenide (WSe(2)) has attracted considerable attention in the field of photovoltaic devices owing to its excellent structure and photoelectric properties, such as ordered 2D network structure, high electrical conductivity, and high mobility.

However, data are lacking on the impact of COVID-19 on hip fractures, seen mainly in older patients. Using national claims data, we aimed to describe the epidemiology during the first COVID-19 wave in the USA. METHODS: We compared patients admitted for hip fractures during March and April of 2020 with those admitted in 2019 in terms of patient and healthcare characteristics, COVID-19 diagnosis, and outcomes. An additional comparison was made between COVID-19-positive and -negative patients. Outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOS), admission to an ICU, ICU LOS, use of mechanical ventilation, 30-day readmission, discharge disposition, and a composite variable of postoperative complications. RESULTS: Overall, 16 068 hip fractures were observed in 2019 compared with 7498 in 2020. Patients with hip fractures in 2020 (compared with 2019) experienced earlier hospital discharge and were less likely to be admitted to ICU, but more likely to be admitted to home. Amongst 83 patients with hip fractures with concomitant COVID-19 diagnosis, we specifically observed more non-surgical treatments, almost doubled LOS, a more than 10-fold increased mortality rate, and higher complication rates compared with COVID-19-negative patients.

Given the reciprocal relationship between habit and behavior, changing lifestyle behaviors (e.g., toothbrushing) is largely a task of breaking old habits and creating new and healthy ones. Thus, representing users' habit strengths can be very useful for behavior change support systems (BCSS), for example, to predict behavior or to decide when an intervention reaches its intended effect. However, habit strength is not directly observable and existing self-report measures are taxing for users. In this paper, built on recent computational models of habit formation, we propose a method to enable intelligent systems to compute habit strength based on observable behavior. The hypothesized advantage of using computed habit strength for behavior prediction was tested using data from two intervention studies, where we trained participants to brush their teeth twice a day for three weeks and monitored their behaviors using accelerometers. Through hierarchical cross-validation, we found that for the task of predicting future brushing behavior, computed habit strength clearly outperformed self-reported habit strength (in both studies) and was also superior to models based on past behavior frequency (in the larger second study). Our findings provide initial support for our theory-based approach of modeling user habits and encourages the use of habit computation to deliver personalized and adaptive interventions.","output":"Theory-based Habit Modeling for Enhancing Behavior Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a widely accepted and utilised method of investigating neural activation within the brain. There has been increasing awareness and understanding in the field of neuropsychology over the last 10-15 years that the amygdala plays an important role in many mental health conditions. Functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala with other parts of the brain is well-documented in the literature; however the role of the amygdala and its reported connections is still not well understood and this can be attributed, in part, to its very small size. It is challenging to achieve adequate spatial resolution to visualise amygdala activation using 3T MRI systems that are in widespread use for this type of clinical research. Optimisation of protocols for improved data accuracy and reproducibility may potentially lead to standardisation and subsequent advancements in overall image quality in this field. Methods The protocol for this scoping review was developed in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) and registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF). A literature search of five databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Scopus) will be undertaken using a refined search strategy; peer-reviewed publications identified as being relevant will then be imported into Covidence software for abstract screening and data extraction by two reviewers working independently. The quantitative findings will be tabulated to provide an overview of the current methodologies for comparison. This will be accompanied by a narrative report summarising the extracted data in relation to the stated research questions. Discussion The objective of this scoping review is to identify and map the range of existing protocols used in fMRI for imaging the activation and FC patterns of the amygdala at 3 Tesla.

The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine how health systems prioritise necessary care that provides clear benefits to patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on care of low back pain in the ED. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data on care for low back pain from three public hospitals in Sydney. We included patients diagnosed with spinal conditions who presented between March and May in 2019 and in 2020. Outcomes were the total number of patients presenting with spinal conditions to ED, the proportion diagnosed with non-specific low back pain, and the proportion receiving potentially unnecessary aspects of care (ambulance use, imaging, opioids, hospital admissions). We calculated relative risk with 95% CIs and examined plots with locally weighted smoothed curves. RESULTS: Presentations for spinal conditions over a three-month period to three EDs reduced from 694 in 2019 to 475 in 2020 (31% reduction, 95% CI = 26%C37%). The proportion of patients diagnosed with non-specific low back pain (83% in 2019 vs 86% in 2020), or receiving potentially unnecessary care were similar in 2019 and 2020 (Imaging = 25% vs 25%; Opioids = 54% vs 56%; Admitted = 18% vs 20%; pathology test = 24% vs 23%).

Understanding the droplets behavior can be critical information to avoid disease transmission, especially while designing a device deals with human air respiratory. Although various studies have provided enormous computational fluid simulations, most cases are too specific and quite challenging to combine with other similar studies directly. Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic approach to predict the droplet behavior for coughing cases using machine learning. The approach consists of three models, which are droplet generator, mask model, and free droplet model modeled using feedforward neural network (FFNN). The evaluation has shown that the three FFNNs models accuracies are relatively high, with R-values of more than 0.990. The model has successfully predicted the evaporation effect on the diameter reduction and the completely evaporated state, which can be considered unlearned cases for machine learning models. The predicted horizontal distance pattern also agrees with the data in the literature. In summary, the proposed approach has demonstrated the capability to predict the diameter pattern according to the experimental or previous work data at various mask face types. ? 2021 by the authors.

Here we describe Corona Detective, a sensitive and rapid molecular test to detect the virus, based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification, which could be applied anywhere at low cost. Critically, the method uses freeze-dried reagents, readily shipped without cold-chain dependence. The reaction detects the viral nucleocapsid gene through a sequence-specific quenched-fluorescence readout, which avoids false positives and also allows multiplex detection with an internal control cellular RNA. Corona Detective can be used in 8-tube strips to be read with a simple open-design fluorescence detector.

METHODS: Prepare and identify AGEs. BMSCs were isolated from 16 SD rats and cultured with different concentration of AGEs. Cell viability was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). BMSCs were cultured with AGEs (0.25 mg/ml) for 30 min, 12 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h. In addition, BMSCs were cultured with AGEs, AGEs + JNK inhibitor and AGEs + P38 inhibitor for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively. RESULTS: Cell viability of BMSCs was significantly correlated with concentration and effect time of AGEs (P < 0.05), and the most appropriate concentration was 0.25 mg/ml. AGEs stimulation significantly increased the protein expression levels of NF-&#954;B p65, JNK, p38 (P < 0.05), decreased I&#954;B (P < 0.05), but had no effect on the protein expression of Akt in BMSCs (P > 0.05). At the mRNA level, JNK and p38 inhibitors significantly reduced the levels of NF-&#954;B p65, p38 and JNK, increased I&#954;B (P > 0.05), but had no effect on Akt in BMSCs (P > 0.05). At the protein level, JNK and p38 inhibitors notably decreased the expression of NF-&#954;B p65, p38, p-JNK, P-I&#954;B and JNK (P < 0.001), and increased I&#954;B (P < 0.05).

Objective To evaluate the association of tracheostomy with COVID-19 patient outcomes and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health care professionals (HCPs). Data Sources EMBASE (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and Web of Science from January 1, 2020, to March 4, 2021. Study Selection English-language studies investigating patients with COVID-19 who were receiving IMV and undergoing tracheostomy. Observational and randomized clinical trials were eligible (no randomized clinical trials were found in the search). All screening was performed by 2 reviewers (P.S. and M.L.). Overall, 156 studies underwent full-text review. Data Extraction and Synthesis We performed data extraction in accordance with Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We used a random-effects model, and ROBINS-I was used for the risk-of-bias analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 transmission between HCPs and levels of personal protective equipment, in addition to complications, time to decannulation, ventilation weaning, and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge in patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy. Results Of the 156 studies that underwent full-text review, only 69 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 14 of these 69 studies (20.3%) were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 4669 patients were included in the 69 studies, and the mean (range) patient age across studies was 60.7 (49.1-68.8) years (43 studies [62.3%] with 1856 patients). We found that in all studies, 1854 patients (73.8%) were men and 658 (26.2%) were women. We found that 28 studies (40.6%) investigated either surgical tracheostomy or percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Overall, 3 of 58 studies (5.17%) identified a small subset of HCPs who developed COVID-19 that was associated with tracheostomy. Studies did not consistently report the number of HCPs involved in tracheostomy. Among the patients, early tracheostomy was associated with faster ICU discharge (mean difference, 6.17 days; 95% CI, -11.30 to -1.30), but no change in IMV weaning (mean difference, -2.99 days; 95% CI, -8.32 to 2.33) or decannulation (mean difference, -3.12 days; 95% CI, -7.35 to 1.12). There was no association between mortality or perioperative complications and type of tracheostomy. A risk-of-bias evaluation that used ROBINS-I demonstrated notable bias in the confounder and patient selection domains because of a lack of randomization and cohort matching. There was notable heterogeneity in study reporting. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that enhanced personal protective equipment is associated with low rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during tracheostomy. Early tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 may reduce ICU stay, but this finding is limited by the observational nature of the included studies.","output":"Association of Tracheostomy With Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Among Health Care Professionals: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an inflammatory process with complex pathophysiology and by affecting the cardiovascular system directly or indirectly that causes life threatening cardiac injuries.

Although a reliable technique, Miles assay is time-consuming, and the technique does not consider the compounding factors that may increase VP independently of endothelial-barrier regulation, such as blood pressure or blood flow. As an alternative, we describe fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran lung permeability assay, a method that can also be adapted to measure VP and edema in other organs such as the brain and kidney.","output":"Vascular Permeability Assays In Vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We demonstrate the relationships between occupational demands in German vocational education and training (VET) teacher training, stress symptoms, and different behavioral resilience competencies. Taking into account interindividual differences in resilience competencies, we use a typological approach to identify different types of (trainee) teachers classified by their degrees and configurations of resilience competencies. Our empirical analysis is based on questionnaire data from 131 German vocational trainees and qualified teachers. The results reveal, among other things, that all three resilience competenciesresistance, flexibility, and dynamismare significantly negatively correlated with the demands of working conditions and workload. Via a latent class analysis, we were able to identify three groups of (trainee) teachers who differed in their resilience competencies to adapt appropriately to different situations and their requirements (behavioral flexibility), to recover rapidly from setbacks and to defy the expectations of others (behavioral resistance), and to initiate changes as soon as they are necessary or desirable (behavioral dynamics). More resilient (trainee) teachers show, among other things, lower values for anxiety as an emotional stress symptom and higher values for job engagement. The findings are discussed with regard to implications for VET teacher training and we stress the need for equilibration on a systemic perspective.","output":"Between Adaptation and Resistance: A Study on Resilience Competencies, Stress, and Well-Being in German VET Teachers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heatwaves are a serious threat to human life. Public health agencies that are responsible for delivering heat-health action plans need to assess and reduce the mortality impacts of heat. Statistical models developed in epidemiology have previously been used to attribute past observed deaths to high temperatures and project future heat-related deaths. Here, we investigate the novel use of summer temperature-mortality associations established by these models for monitoring heat-related deaths in regions in England in near real time. For four summers in the period 2011C2020, we find that coupling these associations with observed daily mean temperatures results in England-wide heatwave mortality estimates that are consistent with the excess deaths estimated by UK Health Security Agency. However, our results for 2013, 2018 and 2020 highlight that the lagged effects of heat and characteristics of individual summers contribute to disagreement between the two methods. We suggest that our method can be used for heatwave mortality monitoring in England because it has the advantages of including lagged effects and controlling for other risk factors. It could also be employed by health agencies elsewhere for reliably estimating the health burden of heat in near real time and near-term forecasts.","output":"Estimating heat-related mortality in near real time for national heatwave plans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual reality systems today cannot yet stream immersive, retina-quality virtual reality video over a network.

During the first spread, most governments have implemented quarantine and strict social distancing procedures. Similar measures during recent pandemics resulted in an increase in post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression symptoms. The development of novel interventions to mitigate the mental health burden are of utmost importance. OBJECTIVE: In this rapid review, we aimed to provide a systematic overview of the literature with regard to associations between physical activity (PA) and depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA SOURCE: We searched major databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) and preprint servers (MedRxiv, SportRxiv, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar), for relevant papers up to 25/07/2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included observational studies with cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. To qualify for inclusion in the review, studies must have tested the association of PA with depression or anxiety, using linear or logistic regressions. Depression and anxiety must have been assessed using validated rating scales. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Effect sizes were represented by fully adjusted standardized betas and odds ratios (OR) alongside 95% confidence intervals (CI). In case standardized effects could not be obtained, unstandardized effects were presented and indicated. RESULTS: We identified a total of 21 observational studies (4 longitudinal, 1 cross-sectional with retrospective analysis, and 16 cross-sectional), including information of 42,293 (age 6-70 years, median female = 68%) participants from five continents. The early evidence suggests that people who performed PA on a regular basis with higher volume and frequency and kept the PA routines stable, showed less symptoms of depression and anxiety. For instance, those reporting a higher total time spent in moderate to vigorous PA had 12-32% lower chances of presenting depressive symptoms and 15-34% of presenting anxiety. CONCLUSION: Performing PA during Covid-19 is associated with less depression and anxiety. To maintain PA routines during Covid-19, specific volitional and motivational skills might be paramount to overcome Covid-19 specific barriers. Particularly, web-based technologies could be an accessible way to increase motivation and volition for PA and maintain daily PA routines.","output":"Is Physical Activity Associated with Less Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

Operative intervention is indicated for symptomatic hernias. There is a lack of consensus as to the best operative technique. Here we present a novel method for repairing perineal herniation using saline-filled tissue expanders. METHODS Perineal hernia repair may be affected either via an abdominal or via a perineal approach. After adhesiolysis to remove small bowel from the pelvis, a Natrelle? 150SH tissue expander (Allergan Inc., California, USA) or Siltex? Round Becker (Mentor Medical Systems, Holland) of appropriate size is inserted in the pelvis and the button placed in a subcutaneous pocket in the perineal skin. The tissue expander is then filled with saline until it fills the true anatomical pelvis without bladder compression. The volume may be increased or decreased postoperatively by accessing the subcutaneous button. RESULTS We have performed this procedure in three patients with some success, all of whom have experienced symptomatic relief. The tissue expander may subsequently be removed without recurrence of symptoms, due to the fibrous capsule which forms. One patient required re-operation to elevate a herniating tissue expander. The tissue expander was removed earlier than anticipated to avoid deep pelvic infection in another. CONCLUSION Our early experience suggests that using saline-filled tissue expanders to fill dead space in the pelvis after radical surgery may prove to be a valuable approach to perineal herniation, particularly if adjuvant radiotherapy is planned.","output":"Tissue expanders: early experience of a novel treatment option for perineal herniation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How to understand the role and impact of information technology and artificial intelligence has triggered a big debate.

DESIGN A descriptive qualitative design was used. The COREQ checklist was used for study reporting. METHODS Individual semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from patients with MCCs and caregivers selected from the dataset of an ongoing longitudinal study. Data analysis was performed through deductive thematic analysis. The middle-range theory of self-care of chronic illness, which entails the three dimensions of self-care maintenance, monitoring and management, was used as a theoretical framework to guide data collection and analysis. RESULTS A total of 16 patients and 25 caregivers were interviewed from May to June 2020. The participants were mainly women, with a mean age for patients of 76.25 years and caregivers of 45.76 years; the caregivers were mainly the patients' children (72%). During the pandemic, some patients reported remaining unchanged in their self-care maintenance, monitoring and management behaviours, others intensified their behaviours, and others decreased them. Caregivers played an important role in protecting patients from the risk of contagion COVID-19 and in ensuring patients' self-care of chronic diseases through direct and indirect interventions. CONCLUSIONS Critical events can modify the self-care experiences of chronically ill patients and caregivers' contributions, leading to maintenance, increase or decrease of self-care and contributions to self-care behaviours. IMPACT Patients with MCCs and their caregivers can react in different ways in their performances of self-care and contribution to patients' self-care behaviours when ordinary daily life is disrupted; therefore, nurses should assess such performances during critical events to identify the individuals at risk of reduced self-care and promote the most suitable healthcare services (e.g. eHealth) to implement individualised interventions.","output":"Self-care of patients with multiple chronic conditions and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative descriptive study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is one of the most frequent haematologic malignancies of the elderly population and characterised by progenitor cell dysplasia with ineffective haematopoiesis and a high rate of transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Thrombocytopenia represents a common problem for patients with MDS. ranging from mild to serious bleeding events and death. To manage thrombocytopenia, the current standard treatment includes platelet transfusion, unfortunately leading to a range of side effects. Thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics represent an alternative treatment option for MDS patients with thrombocytopenia. However, it remains unclear, whether TPO mimetics influence the increase of blast cells and therefore to premature progression to AML. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics for patients with MDS. SEARCH METHODS We searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (January 2000 to August 2017), trials registries (ISRCTN, EU clinical trials register and clinicaltrials.gov) and conference proceedings. We did not apply any language restrictions. Two review authors independently screened search results, disagreements were solved by discussion. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials comparing TPO mimetics with placebo, no further treatment or another TPO mimetic in patients with MDS of all risk groups, without gender, age or ethnicity restrictions. Additional chemotherapeutic treatment had to be equal in both arms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials, disagreements were resolved by discussion. Risk ratio (RR) was used to analyse mortality during study, transformation to AML, incidence of bleeding events, transfusion requirement, all adverse events, adverse events >= grade 3, serious adverse events and platelet response. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) have been extracted as hazard ratios, but could not be pooled as results were reported in heterogenous ways. Health-related quality of life and duration of thrombocytopenia would have been analysed as standardised mean differences, but no trial reported these outcomes. MAIN RESULTS We did not identify any trial comparing one TPO mimetic versus another. We analysed six eligible trials involving 746 adult patients. All trials were reported as randomised and double-blind trials including male and female patients. Two trials compared TPO mimetics (romiplostim or eltrombopag) with placebo, one trial evaluated eltrombopag in addition to the hypomethylating agent azacitidine, two trials analysed romiplostim additionally to a hypomethylating agent (azacitidine or decitabine) and one trial evaluated romiplostim in addition to the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide. There are more data on romiplostim (four included, completed, full-text trials) than on eltrombopag (two trials included: one full-text publication, one abstract publication). Due to small sample sizes and imbalances in baseline characteristics in three trials and premature termination of two studies, we judged the potential risk of bias of all included trials as high.Due to heterogenous reporting, we were not able to pool data for OS. Instead of that, we analysed mortality during study. There is little or no evidence for a difference in mortality during study for thrombopoietin mimetics compared to placebo (RR 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.27, N = 6 trials, 746 patients, low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether the use of TPO mimetics induces an acceleration of transformation to AML (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77, N = 5 trials, 372 patients, very low-quality evidence).Thrombopoietin mimetics probably improve the incidence of all bleeding events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99, N = 5 trials, 390 patients, moderate-quality evidence). This means that in the study population, 713 out of 1000 in the placebo arm will have a bleeding event, compared to 656 of 1000 (95% CI 613 to 699) in the TPO mimetics arm. There is little or no evidence for a difference that TPO mimetics significantly diminish the rate of transfusion requirement (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05, N = 4 trials, 358 patients, low-quality evidence). No studies were found that looked at quality of life or duration of thrombocytopenia.There is no evidence that patients given TPO mimetics suffer more all adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.07, N = 5 trials, 390 patients, moderate-quality evidence). There is uncertainty whether the number of serious adverse events decrease under therapy with TPO mimetics (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.46, N = 4 trials, 356 patients, very low-quality evidence).We identified one ongoing study and one study marked as completed (March 2015), but without publication of results for MDS patients (only results reported for AML and MDS patients together). Both studies evaluate MDS patients receiving eltrombopag in comparison to placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS No trial evaluated one TPO mimetic versus another.Six trials including adult patients analysed one TPO mimetic versus placebo, sometimes combined with standard therapy in both arms. Given the uncertainty of the quality of evidence, meta-analyses show that there is little or no evidence for a difference in mortality during study and premature progress to AML. However, these assumptions have to be further explored. Treatment with TPO mimetics resulted in a lower number of MDS patients suffering from bleeding events.There is no evidence for a difference between study groups regarding transfusion requirement. Enlarged sample sizes and a longer follow-up of future trials should improve the estimate of safety and efficacy of TPO mimetics, moreover health-related quality of life should be evaluated. As two ongoing studies currently investigate eltrombopag (one already completed, but without published results), we are awaiting results for this drug.","output":"Thrombopoietin mimetics for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic liver disease management is a comprehensive approach requiring multi-professional expertise and well-orchestrated healthcare measures thoroughly organized by responsible medical units. Contextually, the corresponding multi-faceted chain of healthcare events is likely to be severely disturbed or even temporarily broken under the force majeure conditions such as global pandemics. Consequently, the chronic liver disease is highly representative for the management of any severe chronic disorder under lasting pandemics with unprecedented numbers of acutely diseased persons who, together with the chronically sick patient cohorts, have to be treated using the given capacity of healthcare systems with their limited resources. Current study aimed at exploring potentially negative impacts of the SARS CoV-2 outbreak on the quality of the advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) management considering two well-classified parameters, namely, (1) the continuity of the patient registrations and (2) the level of mortality rates, comparing pre-COVID-19 statistics with these under the current pandemic in Slovak Republic. Altogether 1091 registrations to cirrhosis registry (with 60.8% versus 39.2% males to females ratio) were included with a median age of 57 years for patients under consideration. Already within the very first 3 months of the pandemic outbreak in Slovakia (lockdown declared from March 16, 2020, until May 20, 2020), the continuity of the patient registrations has been broken followed by significantly increased ACLD-related death rates. During this period of time, the total number of new registrations decreased by about 60% (15 registrations in 2020 versus 38 in 2018 and 38 in 2019). Corresponding mortality increased by about 52% (23 deaths in 2020 versus 10 in 2018 and 12 in 2019). Based on these results and in line with the framework of 3PM guidelines, the pandemic priority pathways The Green PPP Line is reserved for prioritized (urgent and comprehensive) treatment of patients at highest risk to die from ACLD (tertiary care) as compared to the risk from possible COVID-19 infection. The Orange PPP Line considers patients at middle risk of adverse outcomes from ACLD with re-addressing them to the secondary care. As further deterioration of ACLD is still probable, pro-active management is ascertained with tertiary center serving as the 24/7 telemedicine consultation hub for a secondary facility (on a physician-physician level). The Red PPP Line is related to the patients at low risk to die from ACLD, re-addressing them to the primary care. Since patients with stable chronic liver diseases without advanced fibrosis are at trivial inherent risk, they should be kept out of the healthcare setting as far as possible by the telemedical (patient-nurse or patient- physician) measurements. The assigned priority has to be monitored and re-evaluated individuallyin intervals based on the baseline prognostic score such as MELD. The approach is conform with principles of predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM / 3PM) and demonstrates a potential of great clinical utility for an optimal management of any severe chronic disorder (cardiovascular, neurological and cancer) under lasting pandemics.","output":"Challenging management of severe chronic disorders in acute pandemic situation: Chronic liver disease under COVID-19 pandemic as the proof-of-principle model to orchestrate the measures in 3PM context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has shown that a highly specific and rapid diagnostic system is a necessity.

Those families face challenges that exceed those of typical families such as higher objective and subjective burden, more frequent psychological distress and lower social support. The aim of this study was to explore the collaboration process between parents and employees and identify factors that improve the transition with less burden. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study was undertaken with 18 persons (9 parents and 9 employees) interviewed individually and in groups. In accordance with the municipalitys guidelines, families with a child with PID should apply for housing, when the child turns 16. The purpose is to ensure interdisciplinary collaboration, information flow and coordinated services according to familys needs. The main question in the interviews was What was your experience with cooperation in the transition process, and what would you do to improve this process? The interviews were analysed with a thematic approach using systematic text condensation. RESULTS: The parents experienced a lack of general information about the housing waiting list, level of services, and the plan for time of moving from the family home, and how to choose where and whom to live with. Parents described an unsustainable burden of care during the waiting period, and a family crisis caused the allocation of an apartment in a group house. Employees shared challenges to meet families wishes, as there were too few group homes. They experienced good collaboration with families and said they offered respite care, due to reduce parents burden of care. Employees experienced that PID adolescents developed skills, mastery and degrees of independence after completing a residency at the Folk High School. CONCLUSIONS: To improve the transition process from family home to independent living for young adults with PID, the informants highlighted some factors to reduce the burden of care on families: 1) Systematic follow-up program for families to observe their needs at an early stage; 2) More available group houses; 3) Information about the housing priorities of the services and; 4) Educational preparation programs for families.","output":"Improving the transition process to independent living for adolescents with profound intellectual disabilities.

Non-COVID patients displayed a diverse pattern of autoantibodies; in contrast, the COVID-19 groups had a more restricted panel of autoantibodies including skin, skeletal muscle and cardiac antibodies.

Murine monoclonal and sheep polyclonal antibodies (mAbs and pAbs) to feline IFN- (fIFN-) were generated firstly to facilitate further research into the role of cellular immune responses in the control of feline infectious disease, and secondly to enable evaluation of the efficacy of novel immunotherapeutic approaches. A hybridoma clone, D9, secreting IgG1 antibodies was selected for expansion and the mAbs affinity purified in vitro. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in a sheep against recombinant fIFN- and affinity purified. The sensitivity of the D9 mAb and the sheep anti-fIFN- pAb was determined using an indirect fIFN- enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblots. These antibodies were assessed for their ability to detect the production of fIFN- by specific feline T cell populations ex vivo following coculture with mitogen or feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigens for 4 h in the presence of the protein secretion inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). Production of fIFN- was evaluated using flow cytometry to simultaneously detect PE-labelled surface molecules and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled intracellular fIFN-. Using this approach, our initial studies revealed an upregulation in virus-specific fIFN--secreting CD4(+)T cells in the lymph nodes of FeLV latently infected cats.","output":"Development of antibodies to feline IFN- as tools to elucidate the cellular immune responses to FeLV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the data of Department of Health in United Kingdom (UK) showed an increase mortality and morbidity among the Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) population. This high mortality can be due to social factors, genetic and immunological factors.

In addition, a large number of BAME population are working in jobs that involve regular and daily contact with public, and this may increase risk of encountering COVID-19 infection. Therefore, future research should address all these factors and generate the correct health policy that will allow us to combat the danger of COVID-19.

LDCT images inevitably suffer from the degradation problem caused by complex noises. It was reported that, compared with commercial iterative reconstruction methods, deep learning (DL)-based LDCT denoising methods using convolutional neural network (CNN) achieved competitive performance. Most existing DL-based methods focus on the local information extracted by CNN, while ignoring both explicit non-local and context information (which are leveraged by radiologists). To address this issue, we propose a novel deep learning model named radiologist-inspired deep denoising network (RIDnet) to imitate the workflow of a radiologist reading LDCT images. Concretely, the proposed model explicitly integrates all the local, non-local and context information rather than local information only. Our radiologist-inspired model is potentially favoured by radiologists as a familiar workflow. A double-blind reader study on a public clinical dataset shows that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed model achieves the most impressive performance in terms of the structural fidelity, the noise suppression and the overall score. As a physicians-inspired model, RIDnet gives a new research roadmap that takes into account the behavior of physicians when designing decision support tools for assisting clinical diagnosis.

This study aimed to assess the effects of liver injuries on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1520 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 from Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, were enrolled. Chronic liver disease (CLD) was confirmed by consensus diagnostic criteria. Laboratory test results were compared between different groups. scRNA-seq data and bulk gene expression profiles were used to identify cell types associated with liver injury. RESULTS: A total of 10.98% of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 developed liver injury after admission that was associated with significantly higher rates of mortality (21.74%, p < 0.001) and intensive care unit admission (26.71%, p < 0.001). Pre-existing CLDs were not associated with a higher risk. However, fatty liver disease and cirrhosis were associated with higher risks, supported by evidences from single cell and bulk transcriptome analysis that showed more TMPRSS2+ cells in these tissues. By generating a model, we were able to predict the risk and severity of liver injury during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that liver injury occurring during therapy as well as pre-existing CLDs like fatty liver disease and cirrhosis in patients with COVID-19 is significantly associated with the severity of disease and mortality, but the presence of other CLD is not associated. We provide a risk-score model that can predict whether patients with COVID-19 will develop liver injury or proceed to higher-risk stages during subsequent hospitalizations.","output":"Implications of liver injury in risk-stratification and management of patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has severely disrupted health professions training globally. This pandemic has been preceded by several other interferences on a smaller scale, setting the scene for crises in perpetuity. With a reactive stance adopted, these crises may result in rapid shifts to curricula, minimizing the opportunity for thorough planning and critical analyses. GUIDANCE FROM THE LITERATURE: Recognizing the limited frameworks available to provide structure to such curricular crises responses, we drew on the literature to develop a crisis-curriculum analysis framework. The work of the SPICES model by Harden et al., the four-dimensional framework by Steketee et al., and Deverell's crisis-induced learning, was used to develop the framework. CRISIS-CURRICULUM ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK: The framework provides a structured approach to curriculum analysis in the face of disruption. It is designed to meet the needs of the global health professions education community, currently in the midst of a crisis. Accompanied by a step-wise guideline, this framework is suitable for educators requiring a practically-orientated approach to curriculum analysis. CONCLUSION: Recognizing that curriculum analysis is but one part of crisis-management, we argue that this crisis-curriculum analysis framework may align well with strengthening institutional readiness as educators seek to refine and entrench curricular practices adopted during COVID-19.","output":"When disruption strikes the curriculum: Towards a crisis-curriculum analysis framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Op de afdeling spoedeisende hulp wordt s nachts een 53-jarige vrouw binnengebracht met pijn in de bovenbuik, die acuut is ontstaan na de maaltijd.

A common postoperative complication associated with this procedure is screw loosening. It has been shown that patient-specific screw fixation can be automated to match standard clinical practice and that failure can be estimated preoperatively using computed tomography images. Hence, we set out to optimize three-dimensional preoperative planning to achieve more mechanically robust screw purchase allowing deviation from intuitive, standard screw parameters. Toward this purpose, we employed a genetic algorithm optimization to find optimal screw sizes and trajectories by maximizing the CT derived bone mechanical properties. The method was tested on cadaveric lumbar vertebrae (L1 to L5) of four human spines (2 female/2 male; age range 60-78 years). The main boundary conditions were the predefined, level-dependent areas of possible screw entry points, as well as the automatically located pedicle structures. Finite element analysis was used to compare the genetic algorithm output to standard clinical planning of screw positioning in terms of the simulated pull-out strength. The genetic algorithm optimization successfully found screw sizes and trajectories that maximize the sum of the Young's modulus within the screw's volume for all 40 pedicle screws included in this study. Overall, there was a 26% increase in simulated pull-out strength for optimized compared to traditional screw trajectories and sizes.

We assessed the number of tests for SARS-CoV-2 administered by the VHA (n = 822 934) and the number of positive test results (n = 82 094) from February 8 through December 28, 2020. We evaluated associations of COVID-19 testing and test positivity with demographic characteristics of veterans, adjusting for facility characteristics, comorbidities, and county-level area-based socioeconomic measures using nested generalized linear models. RESULTS In fully adjusted models, veterans who were female, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, urban, and low income and had a disability had an increased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test, and veterans who were Asian had a decreased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test.

This belief was reflected in CAP guidelines until 2005 when the designation healthcare-associated pneumonia or HCAP was introduced and nursing home residents were included in the HCAP category. Patients in the HCAP group were thought to be at high risk for pneumonia because of multidrug resistant organisms and required empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy much like people with hospital-acquired infection. Subsequent studies of the etiology of NHAP using sophisticated diagnostic testing found limited evidence of resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or resistant gram-negative organisms or atypical organisms. In terms of management of NHAP in the nursing home there are several considerations that are discussed: hospitalization decision, initial oral or parenteral therapy, timing of switch to an oral regimen if parenteral therapy is initially prescribed, duration of therapy with an emphasis on shorter courses, and follow-up during therapy including the use of the antibiotic time out protocol.

The models for AFT and overall survival also suggested a higher hazard for BG, but the differences were not significant (AFT: HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.53, p=0.188; OS: HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.47, p=0.348). The absence of runoff vessels (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.60, p=0.008) was associated with a decreased AFS. The likelihood of amputation was higher in male patients (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.45, p=0.027) and was associated with a lack of runoff vessels (HR 1.95, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.95, p=0.065) and myocardial infarction (HR 3.74, 95% CI 1.23 to 11.35, p=0.020). Death was more likely in patients without runoff vessels (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.80, p=0.016) and those with a higher risk score (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.91, p=0.038). Conclusion: This analysis suggested that BG was associated with poorer AFS than EVT in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and CLTI. Male sex, previous myocardial infarction, and the absence of runoff vessels were additionally identified as predictors of poorer outcomes.","output":"Bypass Grafting vs Endovascular Therapy in Patients With Non-Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease and Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia (CRITISCH Registry)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This research investigated whether certain population segments might be more psychologically vulnerable in different phases of a pandemic. Specifically, the research examined how disparities in wealth might be associated with differences in emotional well-being before, during, versus after the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak in China. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: In this large-scale cross-sectional study, three rounds of nationally representative data collection (N=27 760) were conducted immediately before (December 2019), in the midst of (February 2020), versus immediately after (April 2020) the countrywide COVID-19 outbreak in China. Participants emotional well-being, wealth (income, property ownership) and demographic information were measured using established instruments. Statistical analyses examined relationships between disparities in different types of wealth and emotional well-being across the pandemic phases. RESULTS: Although the onset of the coronavirus outbreak substantially degraded emotional well-being, having a higher income was associated with better emotional well-being during the outbreak. Property owners experienced a larger drop in emotional well-being during the outbreak than non-owners; however, the former was not emotionally worse off than the latter during the outbreak. After the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak had been contained and the economy reopened, those with more wealth of either type again became better off in emotional well-being than those with less. The highest income segment even experienced better emotional well-being after the end of the nationwide outbreak than prior to the outbreak. In contrast, the lowest income segment became worse off in emotional well-being after the nationwide outbreak ended than before the outbreak began. CONCLUSION: People with less wealth tend to be emotionally worse off throughout the different phases of a disease outbreak. In particular, even after an outbreak has been contained, the poor are less able to restore their psychological well-being. Policies and interventions are needed to address disparities in mental health in the age of pandemics.","output":"Relationship between wealth and emotional well-being before, during, versus after a nationwide disease outbreak: a large-scale investigation of disparities in psychological vulnerability across COVID-19 pandemic phases in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modifications of (RS)-2-[4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl] propanoic acid with amino acid isopropyl esters were synthesised using different methods via a common intermediate.

Most published Egyptian economic evaluation studies have used utility values from other published studies and systematic reviews. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop an Egyptian EQ-5D-5L value set using the international EuroQol standardized protocol (EQ-VT-2.1). METHODS: Adult Egyptian participants were recruited from public places using multi-stratified quota sampling based on age, sex, and geographical distribution. Two elicitation techniques were applied: the composite time trade-off (cTTO) and discrete-choice experiments (DCEs). Before actual data collection, interviewers performance was assessed in a pilot phase. Data were modelled using generalized least square, Tobit, heteroskedastic, logit, and hybrid models, and the best fitting model was selected based on the value range between observed and predicted values, logical consistency of the parameters, significance level, and prediction accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 1378 interviews were conducted, of which 188 were excluded because they were incomplete or did not comply with protocol, 216 were pilot interviews, and 974 were included in the final analysis. The heteroskedastic model (model 4) based on the cTTO data was selected as the preferred model to generate the value set. Values ranged from ? 0.93 for the worst health state (55555) to 1 for full health (11111), with 1136 (36.3%) of all predicted health states being worse than dead. Mobility had the largest impact on health state preference values. CONCLUSION: This is the first value set for the EQ-5D-5L based on social preferences obtained from a nationally representative sample in Egypt or any Arabic-speaking country. The value set can be used as a scoring system for economic evaluations and to improve the quality of health technology assessment in the Egyptian healthcare system.","output":"The EQ-5D-5L Valuation Study in Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease caused by the disturbance of genetic and environmental factors. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play a vital role in the genetic dissection of complex diseases. In-depth analysis of SNP-related information could recognize disease-associated biomarkers and further uncover the genetic mechanism of complex diseases. Risk-related variants might act on the disease by affecting gene expression and gene function. Through integrating SNP disease association study and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, as well as functional enrichment of containing known causal genes, four risk SNPs and four corresponding susceptibility genes were identified utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of COPD. Of the four risk SNPs, one could be found in the SNPedia database that stored disease-related SNPs and has been linked to a disease in the literature. Four genes showed significant differences from the perspective of normal/disease or variant/nonvariant samples, as well as the high performance of sample classification. It is speculated that the four susceptibility genes could be used as biomarkers of COPD. Furthermore, three of our susceptibility genes have been confirmed in the literature to be associated with COPD. Among them, two genes had an impact on the significance of expression correlation of known causal genes they interact with, respectively.

However, there has been considerable controversy surrounding treatments such as hydroxychloroquine with misinformation fuelling prices hikes and suicides. Shortages have also appreciably increased costs of PPE, potentially catastrophic among lower- and middle-income countries such as Nigeria with high copayment levels. Consequently, a need to investigate changes in availability, utilization, and prices of relevant medicines and PPE during the pandemic in Nigeria. Methods: Exploratory study among community pharmacists with a survey tool comprising four sections including questions on changes in consumption, prices, and shortages of medicines and PPE from the beginning of March 2020 to the end of June 2020. In addition, suggestions from community pharmacists and co-authors on ways to reduce misinformation. Findings: 30 out of 34 pharmacists participated giving a response rate of 88.2%. Significant increases were seen (3-fold or more increase) in the consumption of hydroxychloroquine (100%), vitamins/immune boosters (96.7%) and antibiotics (46.7%) as well as PPE (100%). Considerable price increases (50% increase or greater) also seen for antimalarials (96.7%), antibiotics (93.3%), vitamins/immune boosters (66.7%), and PPE (100%). Shortages are also seen for hydroxychloroquine and vitamins/immune boosters but most severe for PPE (80% of pharmacies). Conclusion: Encouraging to see increases in the utilization of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE.

Research has focused on physical outcomes, with less attention to the psychological effects of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to examine the interplay between perceptions of the COVID-19 outbreak as a threat to one's day-to-day life, race, and psychological distress among middle-aged and older men and women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Analyses were conducted on a subsample of self-identified non-Latino Whites and Black individuals aged 50+ (N=3,834) from the American Trends Panel. Psychological distress was assessed with five items adapted from the CES-D and GAD. Perceived COVID-19 day-to-day threat was assessed with a single question. Negative binomial regressions tested the study aim. RESULTS Perceptions of COVID-19 day-to-day threat were positively associated with psychological distress. Black individuals reported lower distress than Whites. Regardless of gender, greater perceptions of COVID-19 day-to-day threat were associated with greater distress among both White respondents and Black respondents. However, this association was weaker among Black respondents than White respondents. Among men only, the association between COVID-19 day-to-day threat and distress varied by race, patterned similarly to the race differences identified in the total sample. This association did not vary by race among women.

To assess the ecological risk of azoxystrobin in real soil environments, we performed a study on the toxic effects of azoxystrobin on earthworms (Eisenia fetida) in three different natural soils (fluvo-aquic soil, black soil and red clay soil) and an artificial soil. Acute toxicity of azoxystrobin was determined by filter paper test and soil test. Accordingly, exposure concentrations of chronic toxicity were set at 0, 0.1, 1.0 and 2.5 mg kg-1. For chronic toxicity test, reactive oxygen species, activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase), detoxifying enzyme (glutathione transferase), level of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and level of oxygen damage of DNA (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine) in earthworms were determined on the 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 42nd and 56th days after treatment. Both acute and chronic toxic results showed azoxystrobin exhibit higher toxicity in natural soil than in artificial soil, indicating that traditional artificial soil testing method underestimate ecotoxicity of azoxystrobin in a real agricultural environment on the earthworm population.

To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, China has imposed national lockdown policies to practise social distancing. This has led to reduced human activities and hence primary air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement of air quality as a side-product. To investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality. Results show that human activities were lowered significantly during the period: industrial operations, VKT, constructions in operation, etc. were significantly reduced, leading to lowered SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and VOCs emissions by approximately 16-26%, 29-47%, 27-46% and 37-57% during the Level I and Level II response periods respectively. These emission reduction has played a significant role in the improvement of air quality. Concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 decreased by 31.8%, 45.1% and 20.4% during the Level I period; and 33.2%, 27.2% and 7.6% during the Level II period compared with 2019. However, ozone did not show any reduction and increased greatly. Our results also show that even during the lockdown, with primary emissions reduction of 15%-61%, the daily average PM2.5 concentrations range between 15 and 79 g m-3, which shows that background and residual pollutions are still high. Source apportionment results indicate that the residual pollution of PM2.5 comes from industry (32.2-61.1%), mobile (3.9-8.1%), dust (2.6-7.7%), residential sources (2.1-28.5%) in YRD and 14.0-28.6% contribution from long-range transport coming from northern China. This indicates that in spite of the extreme reductions in primary emissions, it cannot fully tackle the current air pollution. Re-organisation of the energy and industrial strategy together with trans-regional joint-control for a full long-term air pollution plan need to be further taken into account.","output":"Air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the Yangtze River Delta Region: An insight into the impact of human activity pattern changes on air pollution variation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effects of Reduning Injection (ȶעҺ, RDN), a patent Chinese medicine, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in rats and its underlying mechanisms of action. METHODS: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, including normal control, model, dexamethasone (DEX, 5 mg/kg), RDN-H (720 mg/kg), RDN-M (360 mg/kg) and RDN-L (180 mg/kg) groups, with 10 rats in each group. Rats were challenged with intravenous injection of LPS 1 h after intraperitoneal treatment with RDN or DEX. At 6 h after LPS challenge, lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected, and the number of inflammatory cells was determined. The right lungs were collected for histopathologic examination, measurement of gene and protein expressions, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities. RESULTS: In vivo pretreatment of RDN (360, 720 mg/kg) significantly reduced the weight of wet to dry (W/D) ratio of lung, protein content in BALF, and led to remarkable attenuation of LPS-induced histopathological changes in the lungs. Meanwhile, RDN enormously decreased BALF total inflammatory cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage cell numbers. Moreover, RDN increased SOD activity, inhibited MPO activity, alleviated LPS-induced tumor neurosis factor- (TNF-) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in lung tissues. Furthermore, RDN (720 mg/kg) efficiently weakened nuclear factorkappa B (NF-B) gene and protein expression.

Hilar lymphadenopathy is a rarely reported finding in the setting of COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our hospital with fever and fatigue. She had a maximum body temperature of 102.3 F with lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. She was diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection on the basis of a positive result from a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography revealed multifocal, subpleural ground-glass opacities with nodular consolidations bilaterally. Computed tomography also demonstrated atypical bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, a rarely reported imaging feature of COVID-19. Chest computed tomography 1 month before the presentation did not show focal consolidations or lymphadenopathy. This indicated that the findings were due to the patient's severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. She received 5 days of oral hydroxychloroquine and experienced resolution of her symptoms. CONCLUSION: Chest computed tomography has been used extensively to diagnose and characterize the distinguishing radiological findings associated with viral pneumonia. It has emerged as an integral part of the diagnosis of COVID-19 alongside reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays. Clinicians must be aware of uncommon clinical and radiological findings in order to diagnose this entity.

BACKGROUND: Acute care providers may be exposed to an increased risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection since many patients present to the emergency department without complete screening measures. However, it is not known which patients present with the highest incidence. METHODS: All acute care surgery (ACS) patients who presented to our level I trauma center between March 19, 2020, and September 20, 2020 and were tested for COVID-19 were included in the study. The patients were divided into two cohorts: COVID positive (+) and COVID negative (-). Patient demographics, type of consultation (emergency general surgery consults [EGS], interpersonal violence trauma consults [IPV], and non-interpersonal violence trauma consults [NIPV]), clinical data and outcomes were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare differences between the groups. RESULTS: In total, 2177 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 116 were COVID+ (5.3%) and 2061 were COVID- (94.7%). COVID+ patients were more frequently Latinos (64.7% vs 61.7%, p=0.043) and African Americans (18.1% vs 11.2%, p<0.001) and less frequently Caucasian (6.0% vs 14.1%, p<0.001).

OBJECTIVE To describe factors influencing physician practices' implementation of behavioral health integration. DESIGN Semistructured interviews with leaders and clinicians from physician practices that adopted behavioral health integration, supplemented by contextual interviews with experts and vendors in behavioral health integration. SETTING 30 physician practices, sampled for diversity on specialty, size, affiliation with parent organizations, geographic location, and behavioral health integration model (collaborative or co-located). PARTICIPANTS 47 physician practice leaders and clinicians, 20 experts, and 5 vendors. MEASUREMENTS Qualitative analysis (cyclical coding) of interview transcripts. RESULTS Four overarching factors affecting physician practices' implementation of behavioral health integration were identified. First, practices' motivations for integrating behavioral health care included expanding access to behavioral health services, improving other clinicians' abilities to respond to patients' behavioral health needs, and enhancing practice reputation. Second, practices tailored their implementation of behavioral health integration to local resources, financial incentives, and patient populations. Third, barriers to behavioral health integration included cultural differences and incomplete information flow between behavioral and nonbehavioral health clinicians and billing difficulties. Fourth, practices described the advantages and disadvantages of both fee-for-service and alternative payment models, and few reported positive financial returns. LIMITATION The practice sample was not nationally representative and excluded practices that did not implement or sustain behavioral health integration, potentially limiting generalizability. CONCLUSION Practices currently using behavioral health integration face cultural, informational, and financial barriers to implementing and sustaining behavioral health integration.

Here, we evaluated whether individualization of TAC dosages based on CYP3A5 SNPs would improve its therapeutic efficacy in ulcerative colitis. METHODS Twenty-one patients were prospectively treated, with their initial dosage adjusted according to their CYP3A5 status (0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mg/kg/day for CYP3A5*3/*3, CYP3A5*1/*3, and CYP3A5*1/*1, respectively). Their clinical outcomes were compared with those of patients treated with a fixed dose (0.1 mg/kg/day).

This study intends (1) to examine whether emotional eating (EE) occurred during the pandemic triggered by disease concerns and (2) to explore the associations among EE, dietary changes, and gestational weight gain (GWG). Based on an online survey, 640 new mothers who experienced the lockdown in their third trimester were recruited from seven provinces in China. EE was evaluated with the Chinese version of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, EE domain. A self-designed e-questionnaire was used to collect the data of participants on the sociodemographic characteristics, concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, maternity information, physical activities, and dietary changes during lockdown. The results show that the average EE score was 26.5  8.3, and women living in a severely affected area, who are very worried about the pandemic and who had less physical activity had a higher tendency of EE. Although there is a dietary pattern changed during pandemic, the average GWG in the studied group was in the normal range. However, a higher EE score was associated with a significant excess of GWG in women not from Wuhan (EE score 33C65 vs. 13C22: adjusted Odd Ratio (OR), 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.90, 1.08C3.32). The sensitivity analysis that additionally adjusted for the pregestational body mass index and gestational metabolic disease was consistent with this result. The mediation model was also examined and showed that, after adjusting for living area and exercise, EE was associated with significantly increased consumption of cereals (EE score 33C65 vs. 13C22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 2.22, 1.29C3.82) and oil (EE score 33C65 vs. 13C22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 3.03, 1.06C8.69) but decreased consumption of fish and seafood (EE score 33C65 vs. 13C22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 1.88, 1.14C3.11; 23C32 vs. 13C22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 1.79, 1.20C2.66). In conclusion, this study indicated that EE occurred in a proportional number of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic and is associated with excess GWG mediated by increased intake of certain foods. The findings suggest the need for psychosocial and nutritional education and interventions during pregnancy checkups.

SUMMARY: MIS-C PIMS is a new syndrome that is associated with a variety of virus infections, and also with SARS-CoV-2. The main characteristics are fever, multiple organ dysfunction due to a hyper-inflammatory state. In particular, cardiac dysfunction and severe shock. A high proportion of patients require intensive medical care, but the absolute number of children with SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C is low. Medical therapy is based on pathophysiologic considerations and is not evidence-based. Immunoglobulins, steroids and biologics are used and lead to effective treatment. Therefore, the mortality rate is very low.

In this review, we highlight the immunology of vaccination, provide a review of literature and discuss the clinical consideration of MS, vaccination and immunosuppression. In conclusion, there is consensus that MS cannot be caused by vaccines, neither by inactivated nor by live vaccines. However, particular attention should be paid to two aspects: First, in immunocompromised patients, live vaccines may lead to a stronger immune reaction with signs of the disease against which the patients have been vaccinated, albeit in weakened form. Second, protection provided by vaccination should be controlled in patients who have been vaccinated while receiving immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. In conclusion, there is evidence that systemic infections can worsen MS, thus vaccination will lower the risk of relapses by reducing the risk of infections.

In the daily diet of the main group of children, adequate adequate energy value was noted (94.6% of the physiological requirements), in contrast to schoolchildren in the comparison group (76.7%). Diets in children of the main group are deficient in the content of total protein (90.1%) and carbohydrates (86.4%), and excess in fats (112.2%).

The goal of this article is to demonstrate a method for placing bilateral venous interposition grafts in a rabbit, then transducing the grafts with a gene transfer vector that achieves durable transgene expression. The method allows the investigation of the biological roles of genes and their protein products in normal vein graft homeostasis. It also allows the testing of transgenes for the activities that could prevent vein graft failure, e.g., whether the expression of a transgene prevents the neointimal growth, reduces the vascular inflammation, or reduces atherosclerosis in rabbits fed with a high-fat diet. During an initial survival surgery, the segments of right and left external jugular vein are excised and placed bilaterally as reversed end-to-side common carotid artery interposition grafts. During a second survival surgery, performed 28 days later, each of the grafts is isolated from the circulation with vascular clips and the lumens are filled (via an arteriotomy) with a solution containing a helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vector. After a 20-min incubation, the vector solution is aspirated, the arteriotomy is repaired, and flow is restored. The veins are harvested at time points dictated by individual experimental protocols. The 28-day delay between the graft placement and the transduction is necessary to ensure the adaptation of the vein graft to the arterial circulation. This adaptation avoids rapid loss of transgene expression that occurs in vein grafts transduced before or immediately after grafting. The method is unique in its ability to achieve durable, stable transgene expression in grafted veins. Compared to other large animal vein graft models, rabbits have advantages of low cost and easy handling. Compared to rodent vein graft models, rabbits have larger and easier-to-manipulate blood vessels that provide abundant tissue for analysis.","output":"A Rabbit Model of Durable Transgene Expression in Jugular Vein to Common Carotid Artery Interposition Grafts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus termed as COVID-19 by WHO has been the causative agent of an unprecedented pandemic in the history of humanity.

An attempt to understand the pathophysiology of various hematological abnormalities including cytokine storm, hypercoagulable state and some rare presentations of this disease hence becomes imperative. Through this review, we aim to provide an up-to-date summary of current evidence-based literature of hematological manifestations, their consequences and management including role of anticoagulation and drugs targeting cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"The looming storm: Blood and cytokines in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the pandemic since March 2020, has affected among others, health professionals who work in covid-19 units by facing social discrimination. The aim of this study was to record the experiences of health professionals working in the first line of treatment of the pandemic, to analyse the effects of the pandemic on the interpersonal relationships of health professionals, and to ask about the stigma they faced during their work with people with covid-19. This is a qualitative study with an ethnographic approach based on 160 semi-structured interviews with health professionals living and working in the Epirus Region, Greece. For the data collection we used semi-structured interviews, discussions and participatory observation. Specifically, the interviews were conducted on health professionals and more specifically doctors, nurses, rescuers, physiotherapists and administrative staff, working in covid-19 units at the University General Hospital of Ioannina (Reference hospital for Ioannina, in Epirus), which assists in the treatment of patients with covid-19, and in the branch of the rescue department of Ioannina. The data were analysed in four thematic units based on their common characteristics: a) emotions and experiences of health professionals, b) interpersonal relations of health professionals, c) social exclusion and discrimination, and d) health professionals as patients. The results showed that the main emotions that health professionals experienced when they were moved to covid-19 clinics were fear, anxiety, distress, anger and insecurity. These feelings worsened when their family environment treated them with fear and hesitancy. Their social environment tended to avoid them, leading to a state of self-isolation. To conclude, health professionals faced discriminating behaviors and stigma both from their families and social environment, and from other health professionals. The government struggled to handle the situation in keeping a balance between both the security and well-being of health professionals as it was not prepared for a pandemic like this.","output":"Social discrimination and stigma on the community of health professionals during the Covid-19 pandemic.

In recent decades the prevalence of this disease has increased alarmingly in lower to middle income countries, where their resource-limited health care systems have struggled to meet this increased burden. Improving patient self-care by improving diabetes knowledge and diabetes management self-efficacy represents a feasible way of ameliorating the impact of T2D on the patient, and the health care system. Unfortunately, the relationships between self-efficacy, diabetes self-management, and thereafter, patient outcomes, are still far from well understood. Although a domain-specific measure of diabetes management self-efficacy, the Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale (DMSES), has been validated in the Thai T2D population, more general measures of self-efficacy, such as the General Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) have not been validated in this population. In this paper we translate and examine the psychometric properties of the GSE in Thais living with T2D. METHODS: In this nation-wide study we examined the psychometric properties of the GSE in 749 Thais diagnosed with T2D within the last five years, and evaluated its relationship with the DMSES along with other patient characteristics. Reliability of GSE was assessed using Cronbachs alpha, and the construct validity was examined using confirmatory factor analysis, along with GSEs convergence and discrimination from DMSES. RESULTS: The Thai version of the GSE was shown to have good psychometric properties in Thais living with T2D. Cronbachs alpha was shown to be 0.87 (95% CI [0.86, 0.88]). We also demonstrated the structural validity of the GSE (Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.994, Cumulative Fit Index = 0.995, Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index = 0.998, Root Mean Square Error of Approximations = 0.025, 95% CI [0.06C0.039]), and that this instrument has a similar structure in Thais as in other populations. GSE was also shown to have some overlap with the DMSES with correlations among GSE and the DMSES domains ranging from 0.18 to 0.26, but also the GSE has substantial discrimination from DMSES (Disattenuated correlation coefficient = 0.283, 95% CI [0.214C0.352], p < 0.001). This suggests that while general and diabetes management self-efficacy are somewhat associated, there are aspects of diabetes management self-efficacy not captured by the more stable general self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the Thai GSE is a reliable and valid measure. We believe the GSE may represent a useful tool to examine the efficacy of proposed and existing diabetes self-management, and management self-efficacy interventions.","output":"Psychometric properties of the general self-efficacy scale among Thais with type 2 diabetes: a multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is of great interest for a biomedical analyst or an investigator to correctly model the CD4 cell count or disease biomarkers of a patient in the presence of covariates or factors determining the disease progression over time. The Poisson mixed-effects models (PMM) can be an appropriate choice for repeated count data. However, this model is not realistic because of the restriction that the mean and variance are equal. Therefore, the PMM is replaced by the negative binomial mixed-effects model (NBMM). The later model effectively manages the over-dispersion of the longitudinal data. We evaluate and compare the proposed models and their application to the number of CD4 cells of HIV-Infected patients recruited in the CAPRISA 002 Acute Infection Study. The results display that the NBMM has appropriate properties and outperforms the PMM in terms of handling over-dispersion of the data. Multiple imputation techniques are also used to handle missing values in the dataset to get valid inferences for parameter estimates. In addition, the results imply that the effect of baseline BMI, HAART initiation, baseline viral load, and the number of sexual partners were significantly associated with the patients CD4 count in both fitted models.

TFH1 cell help was delivered in two phases: IFN-?3 signals were provided early in infection, whereas CD40/CD40L help was provided late in infection. In contrast to T-bet+ T cells, T-bet+ B cells did not develop in the absence of B cell-intrinsic Bcl-6 but were generated in the absence of T-bet. T-bet-deficient memory B cells were largely indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts, although they no longer underwent switching to IgG2c. These data suggest that a primary function of T-bet in B cells during ehrlichial infection is to promote appropriate class switching, not lineage specification.

As part of the second Sprint National Anaesthesia Project, epidemiology of critical care after surgery study, we distributed a paper survey to anaesthetists, surgeons and intensivists providing peri\\\\operative care during a single week in March 2017. We collected data on respondent characteristics, and their opinions of postoperative critical care provision, potential benefits and real\\\\world challenges. We undertook both quantitative and qualitative analyses to interpret the responses. We received 10,383 survey responses from 237 hospitals across the UK. Consultants used a lower threshold for critical care admission than other career grades, indicating potentially more risk\\\\averse behaviour. The majority of respondents reported that critical care provision was inadequate, and cited the value of critical care as being predominantly due to higher nurse: patient ratios. Use of objective risk assessment tools was poor, and patients were commonly selected for critical care based on procedure\\\\specific pathways rather than individualised risk assessment. Challenges were highlighted in the delivery of peri\\\\operative critical care services, such as an overall lack of capacity, competition for beds with non\\\\surgical cases and poor flow through the hospital leading to bed blockages. Critical care is perceived to provide benefit to high\\\\risk surgical patients, but there is variation in practice about the definition and determination of risk, how patients are referred and how to deal with the lack of critical care resources.

It is unclear how the current COVID-19 pandemic and the changes in study conditions due to federal regulations affected mental well-being in the German student population. We examined university students' perceptions of study conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated associations between study conditions and depressive symptoms. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Germany in May 2020 at four universities (N = 5,021, 69% female, mean age: 24 years, SD: 5.1). Perceived study conditions, as well as sociodemographic information, were assessed with self-generated items and the CES-D 8 scale was used to determine depressive symptoms. Associations between perceived study conditions (academic stress and academic satisfaction), in general, and confidence to complete the semester, in particular, and depressive symptoms were analyzed using generalized linear regressions. Results: Fifty-four percent of survey participants felt that the university workload had significantly increased since the COVID-19 pandemic; 48% were worried that they would not be able to successfully complete the academic year; 47% agreed that the change in teaching methods caused significant stress. Regarding depressive symptoms, the mean score of the CES-D 8 scale was 9.25. Further, a positive association between perceived study conditions and depressive symptoms was found (p < 0.001), indicating that better study conditions were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Results of the generalized linear regression suggest that better student mental well-being was related to higher confidence in completing the semester. Conclusions: This study provides first insights into perceived study conditions and associations with depressive symptoms among students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Findings underline the need for universities to provide intervention strategies targeting students' mental well-being during the course of the pandemic.","output":"Perceptions of Study Conditions and Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among University Students in Germany: Results of the International COVID-19 Student Well-Being Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of novel coronavirus puts China at risk of economic downturn.

To this end, acquiring respiratory data solely from breathing sounds fed to the smartphone's microphone strikes as a very appealing resolution. The acquired breathing sounds can be analyzed using advanced signal processing and analysis in tandem with new deep/machine learning and pattern recognition techniques to separate the breathing phases, estimate the lung volume, oxygenation, and to further classify the breathing data input into healthy or unhealthy cases.

Rapidly evolving gridded agronomic models can facilitate these efforts throughout Europe. However, their performance in modelling soil carbon dynamics at regional scale is yet unexplored. Importantly, as such models are often driven by large-scale inputs, they need to be benchmarked against field experiments. We elucidate the level of detail that needs to be incorporated in gridded models to robustly estimate regional soil carbon dynamics in managed cropland, testing the approach for regions in the Czech Republic. We first calibrated the biogeochemical Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model against long-term experiments. Subsequently, we examined the EPIC model within a top-down gridded modelling framework constructed for European agricultural soils from Europe-wide datasets and regional land-use statistics. We explored the top-down, as opposed to a bottom-up, modelling approach for reporting agronomically relevant and verifiable soil carbon dynamics. In comparison with a no-input baseline, the regional EPIC model suggested soil carbon changes (~0.1-0.5 Mg C ha-1 y-1) consistent with empirical-based studies for all studied agricultural practices. However, inaccurate soil information, crop management inputs, or inappropriate model calibration may undermine regional modelling of cropland management effect on carbon since each of the three components carry uncertainty (~0.5-1.5 Mg C ha-1 y-1) that is substantially larger than the actual effect of agricultural practices relative to the no-input baseline. Besides, inaccurate soil data obtained from the background datasets biased the simulated carbon trends compared to observations, thus hampering the model's verifiability at the locations of field experiments. Encouragingly, the top-down agricultural management derived from regional land-use statistics proved suitable for the estimation of soil carbon dynamics consistently with actual field practices. Despite sensitivity to biophysical parameters, we found a robust scalability of the soil organic carbon routine for various climatic regions and soil types represented in the Czech experiments.

We examine how two critical self-regulatory orientations, locomotion and assessment, relate to psychological distress and obeying public health guidelines using secondary data analysis. In the initial pandemic stages (April and May, 2020), North American participants (N = 924) completed measures of chronic locomotion and assessment, pandemic behaviors and feelings, and various individual-differences. Analyses revealed that assessment, but not locomotion, was indirectly associated with greater pandemic rule-breaking and psychological distress through the fear of missing out, difficulty engaging in activities, and engagement in negative activities. We discuss why the vulnerabilities of assessment, and not locomotion, may be particularly sensitive to pandemic-related constraints.

METHOD: an ecological study using neighborhoods as units of analysis. The cumulative incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants and the median of potential confounding variables (sex, race, and age) were calculated. Multiple analysis included quantile regression, estimating the regression coefficients of the variable income for every five percentiles from the 10(th) to 90(th) percentiles to verify the relationship between income and incidence. RESULTS: the citys rate was 36.58 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In general, the highest rates were observed in the wealthiest regions. Multiple analysis was consistent with this observation since the per capita income affected all percentiles analyzed, with a median regression coefficient of 0.02 (p-value <0.001; R(2) 32.93). That is, there is an increase of R$ 0.02 in the neighborhoods per capita income for every unit of incidence.

METHODS AND RESULTS : From February to April 2020, we prospectively studied a cohort of 96 participants comprising 47 consecutive patients with CAD and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (CAD + SARS-CoV-2), 19 CAD patients without infections, and 30 healthy controls. Clinical assessment included blood sampling, echocardiography, and electrocardiography within 12 h of admission. Respiratory failure was stratified by the Horovitz Index (HI) as moderately/severely impaired when HI &#8804;200 mmHg. The clinical endpoint (EP) was defined as HI &#8804;200 mmHg with subsequent mechanical ventilation within a follow-up of 30 days. The numbers of CD14dimCD16+ non-classical monocytes in peripheral blood were remarkably low in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 compared with CAD patients without infection and healthy controls (P < 0.0001). Moreover, these CD14dimCD16 monocytes showed decreased expression of established markers of adhesion, migration, and T-cell activation (CD54, CD62L, CX3CR1, CD80, and HLA-DR). Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes were associated with the occurrence of EP. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate that CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients with numbers below the median of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes (median 1443 cells/mL) reached EP significantly more often compared to patients with numbers above the median (log-rank 5.03, P = 0.025). CONCLUSION : Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes are associated with rapidly progressive respiratory failure in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Methods: Data were collected as part of a mixed-methods study that included an online survey completed by 263 hospital staff members, as well as 10 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with doctors, nurses and medical technicians working on coronavirus wards. Results: The survey findings revealed that respondents expressed extremely high rates of concern for family members and at a national level, but that they were less apprehensive about their own health and safety. At the same time, burnout was lower than the rates of concern. Nurses displayed more apprehension and burnout compared to medical staff in other professional roles. The in-depth interviews reinforced and supplemented the survey findings and deepened our understanding of the feelings of medical staff directly involved in coronavirus patient care. Conclusions: The studys findings revealed the main concerns of hospital staff during the coronavirus crisis and deepened our understanding of the issues that require systemic attention in order to strengthen the mental resilience of hospital staff, in particular those working on coronavirus wards.

Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is characterized by thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in association with anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies. Herein, we propose five potential anionic substances of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine that can combine with PF4 and trigger VITT, including (1) the proteins on the surface of adenovirus, e.g., negative charged glycoprotein, (2) the adjuvant components of the vaccine, e.g., Tween 80, (3) the DNA of adenovirus, (4) the S protein antigen expressed by the vaccine, and (5) the negatively charged impurity proteins expressed by the vaccine, e.g., adenovirus skeleton proteins. After analysis of each case, we consider the most possible trigger to be the negatively charged impurity proteins expressed by the vaccine. Then, we display the possible extravascular route and intravascular route of the formation of PF4 autoantibodies triggered by the negatively charged impurity proteins, which is accordant with the clinical situation. Accordingly, the susceptible individuals of VITT after ChAdOx1-S vaccination may be people who express negatively charged impurity proteins and reach a certain high titer.","output":"Potential Anionic Substances Binding to Platelet Factor 4 in Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia of ChAdOx1-S Vaccine for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Introduction: The WHO has suggested the solution to leakage in health systems caused by waste, corruption and fraud is policing and prosecution. However, a growing body of evidence suggests leakage may not always be fraudulent or corrupt, with researchers suggesting medical practitioners may sometimes struggle to understand increasingly complex legal requirements around health financing and billing transactions, which may be improved through education. To explore this phenomenon further, we undertook a systematic review of the literature to identify the medical billing education needs of medical practitioners and whether those needs are being met. Methods: Eligible records included English language materials published between 1 January 2000 and 4 May 2020, including empirical research, commentary, opinions and grey literature. Results: We identified 74 records as directly relevant to the search criteria. Despite a comprehensive international search, studies were limited to three countries (Australia, Canada, U.S), indicating a need for further work internationally. The literature suggests the education needs of medical practitioners in relation to medical billing compliance are not being met and medical practitioners desire more education on this topic. Evidence suggests education may be effective in improving medical billing compliance and reducing waste in health systems and there is broad agreement amongst medical education stakeholders in multiple jurisdictions that medical billing should be viewed as a core competency of medical education, though there is an apparent inertia to act. Penalties for non-compliant medical billing are serious and medical practitioners are at risk of random audits and investigations for breaches of sometimes incomprehensible, and highly interpretive regulations they may never have been taught. Conclusion: Despite acknowledged significance of leakage in health systems due to poor practitioner knowledge of billing practices, there has been very little research to date on education interventions to improve health system efficiency at a practitioner level.","output":"EDUCATING MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS ABOUT MEDICAL BILLING: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the impact of sleep and training load of Division - 1 women's basketball players on their game performance and injury prediction using machine learning algorithms.

More importantly, our F1 and F2 scores of 0.94 and 0.83 for game performance and injuries, respectively, show that we can use the prediction for informative analysis in the future for coaches to make insightful decisions. Our data analysis also showed that collegiate athletes sleep less than the recommended hours (6-7 instead of 8 hours).

There is a dearth of research on how compassion is experienced in a non-hospital setting such as a care home, not just by residents but by staff and other key stakeholders. This scoping review aims to determine the body of existing, published research that explicitly refers to compassion or empathy in the context of care homes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review will follow the methodology described by Arksey and O'Malley and the PRISMAextension for scoping reviews guideline to adhere to an established methodological framework. Relevant publications will be searched on the EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, EBM Reviews and PsycInfo databases. Peer-reviewed literature focusing on experiences of compassion or empathy in care home settings from the perspective of either staff, residents (or clients), family members or their combined perspectives will be included. We will focus on literature published from 2000 up to 1 November 2021, in English, Spanish, Portuguese Finnish and Estonian. The review process will consist of three stages: a title review to identify articles of interest, this will be followed by an abstract review and finally, a full-text review.

In one case, the adoptive mother was already a mother of two dependent offspring. In the other case, the adoptive mother was an old parous female whose own offspring had already emigrated into a different social group. The adoptive mothers provided various maternal care to the adoptees, such as carrying, grooming, nursing, and sharing food. No aggression was observed by group members towards the out-group adoptees. In both cases, adoptees had no maternal kin-relationship with their adoptive mothers. Both adoptive mothers already had experience of rearing their own offspring.

Digital PCR (dPCR) is capable of the absolute quantification of nucleic acids. METHOD: By using the droplet dPCR (QX200) and the digital real-time PCR (LOAA), the copy numbers were compared via multiple assays for three distinct targerts; EGFR DNA, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 RNA. RESULTS: The droplet dPCR and digital real-time PCR showed similar copy numbers for both DNA and RNA quantification. When the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of each method were estimated for DNA and RNA targets, the digital real-time PCR showed a higher sensitivity and precision especially with low copy number targets. CONCLUSION: The breath of nucleic acid testing in diagnostic applications continues to expand. In this study we applied common diagnostic targets to a novel digital real-time PCR methodology. It performed comparably to the established dPCR method with distinctive advantages and disadvantages for implementing in laboratories.

Current evidence shows that 40%-60% of patients relapse while in TFR;and nearly all regain response once tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment are reinitiated. However a robust predictor of prolonged TFR has not been reported yet. Considering real-life setting, 2 key factors may affect TFR outcome if not properly done: Access to serial molecular monitoring at optimal timepoints and quality laboratory terms as accuracy, sensitivity and rapid results. This motivated the creation of the AST study in our region to guarantee adequate molecular monitoring for TFR in Argentina and characterize new prognostic biomarkers helpful to identify more accurately patients who will be able to sustain TFR. We aimed to assess the proportion of patients with sustained major molecular response (MMR) after TKIs discontinuation and define precise conditions for stopping treatment. Methods: This prospective, multicentre Argentina Stop Trial (AST) trial is recruiting chronic phase CML patients under TKI treatment for at least  4 years, in DMR (MR4.0) sustained for  2 years in standardized laboratory, confirmed typical BCR-ABL1 transcripts b3a2 and/or b2a2 and aged > 18 years. Molecular tests are centralized in 2 harmonized laboratories and performed monthly for the first 6 months, every 2 months until the first year, and every 3 months during the second year. If patients lost MMR, TKI was restarted immediately. Molecular relapse Free Survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Difference between survival variables was evaluated through log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed through Cox proportional hazards model. The cutoffs of the numerical variables were considered according to the log-rank test. Results: Between February 2019 and July 2020, we evaluated 50 CML patients of whom 46 were enrolled from 7 centers in Argentina and 4 were screening failures. Recruitment was interrupted due to COVID-19 pandemic. Patient median age was 57.5 years (range 24-85). Before discontinuation, TKI treatment was as follows: Imatinib 37/46 (80%), Nilotinib 5/46 (11%) and Dasatinib 4/46 (9%), 2G-TKI as 1st line, 11% of the patients received non-branded treatment. Sokal risk score showed to be low in 22 patients (48%), intermediate in 14 (30%) and high in 10 (22%). Median follow-up was 10 months (range 4-17) and the estimated molecular relapse-free survival was 80.2% (95%CI 69-93) at 6 months Fig 1. Longer DMR durations before discontinuation were associated with increased probability of maintaining response at 6 and 12 months: 83.2% for patients who had >54 months in DMR vs 70% with <54 months and 72% vs 23.3% respectively (p=0.0453) Fig 2. Cox multivariate analysis was performed including different variables as age at diagnosis, time in DMR, time in TKI previous to discontinuation and Sokal risk. The only significant variable associated to improved prognosis was time in DMR (HR 2.8 95%CI 1.002-8.07 p=0.0495). Our cohort had a long time on TKI treatment previous to discontinuation, median 10.5 years (4.16-17.5) probably considering it a favorable factor for the high TFR rates described at 6 months. Among the 46 patients included, 15 (33%) lost MMR, all restarted treatment with the same TKI used before discontinuation, 12/15 (80%) regained MMR with a median time of 3 months (range1-8) and 9/15(60%) obtained MR 4.0 with a median time of 3 months (range1-5). Conclusion: This is the first multicenter study of TKI discontinuation in CML patients in Argentina showing that TKI can be safely discontinued in those who achieve and maintain a DMR before discontinuation. We observed high rates of molecular relapse free survival, although longer follow-up is needed. We must continue with this approach for patients participating in TFR trials or TFR programs in order to decrease the risk of relapse and make this goal a fact in our region. This discontinuation study will allow in a near futu e significant saving of economic resources and might improve patients quality of life specially in those who are currently experiencing treatment adverse events.

Participants (N = 672) dehumanized such immigrants more if their ratings were made on a slider versus clicking images of hominids, an effect most pronounced for Republicans. Dehumanization was negatively associated with warmth toward illegal immigrants and the perceived unhappiness felt by illegal immigrants from U.S. immigration policies. Finally, most dehumanization is not entirely blatant but instead, captured by virtuous violence and affect as well, suggesting the many ways that dehumanization can manifest as predicted by theory. This work offers a mechanistic account for why people dehumanize immigrants and addresses how survey measurement artifacts (e.g., clicking on images of hominids vs. using a slider) affect dehumanization rates. We discuss how these data extend dehumanization theory and inform empirical research.","output":"Why we dehumanize illegal immigrants: A US mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to a popular Dutch theory, water has shaped the Dutch national identity. The Dutch fight against the water would have stimulated perseverance, ingenuity, cooperation and an egalitarian and democratic society. Despite the long water management history of the Netherlands, water became an important part of the self-images of the nation only in the eighteenth Century. In the 1780s the idea that the Dutch had wrung their country from the sea became popular. Initially, this idea was especially popular among the (proto-)liberal opposition, who emphasised the importance of the nation and its achievements. By the end of the nineteenth Century, water had become a national symbol for orthodox Calvinists, Roman Catholics and Socialists too, despite their different views on the nation. Whenever there was fast social change, political turmoil or external threats, as in the late eighteenth Century, the 1930s and 1940s and since the 1990s, the link between water and the Netherlands was used to promote national pride and unity and stimulate action. This link has also been used to promote specific hydraulic works, but it is a topic for further research how widespread and effective this practice was.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: : This retrospective study included 62 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Clinical data was obtained from electronic medical records. 270 chest radiographs were reviewed and qualitatively scored (CXR score) using a severity scale of 0-30. Radiographic findings were correlated with clinical severity and outcome. RESULTS: : The CXR score increases from a median initial score of 10 at hospital presentation to the median peak CXR score of 18 within a median time of 4 days after hospitalization, and then slowly decreases to a median last CXR score of 15 in a median time of 12 days after hospitalization. The initial and peak CXR score was independently associated with invasive MV after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, smoking, and comorbidities (Initial, OR: 2.11 per 5-point increase, CI 1.35-3.32, p=0.001; Peak, OR: 2.50 per 5-point increase, CI 1.48-4.22, p=0.001). Peak CXR scores were also independently associated with vasopressor usage (OR: 2.28 per 5-point increase, CI 1.30-3.98, p=0.004). Peak CXR scores strongly correlated with the duration of invasive MV (Rho=0.62, p<0.001), while the initial CXR score (Rho=0.26) and the peak CXR score (Rho=0.27) correlated weakly with the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. No statistically significant associations were found between radiographic findings and mortality. CONCLUSION: : Evolution of radiographic features indicate rapid disease progression and correlate with requirement for invasive MV or vasopressors but not mortality, which suggests potential non-pulmonary pathways to death in COVID-19.","output":"Radiographic findings and association with clinical severity and outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Research investigating treatments and interventions for cognitive decline fail due to difficulties in accurately recognizing behavioral signatures in the presymptomatic stages of the disease.

Controlling the spread of this disease has proven difficult despite several resources employed. Millions of hospitalization and deaths have been observed, and thousands of cases daily with many measures in place. Due to the complex nature of COVID-19, we proposed a system of time-fractional equations to understand the transmission of the disease better. Nonlocality involved in the model has made fractional differential equations appropriate for modeling the behavior. However, solving these types of models is computationally demanding. Our proposed generalized compartmental COVID-19 model incorporates effective contact rate, transition rate (from exposed quarantine and recovered to susceptible and infected quarantined individuals), quarantine rate, disease-induced death rate, natural death rate, natural recovery rate, recovery rate of quarantine infected for a holistic study of the coronavirus disease. A detailed analysis of the proposed model is carried out, including the existence and uniqueness of solutions, local and global stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, numerical solutions of the proposed model are obtained with the generalized Adam-Bashforth-Moulton method developed for the fractional order model. Our analysis and solutions profile show that each of these incorporated parameters is very important in controlling the spread of COVID-19, especially quarantining exposed and infected individuals and the effective contact rate.

However, its ability to conduct has hindered its engineering application. This study prepares a novel microencapsulated phase change material (MEPCM) by suspension polymerization. To improve the adhesion between the shell and the inorganic additive, triethoxyvinylsilane was incorporated copolymerizing with methyl methacrylate. Thermally conductive nanographite particle was added. This MEPCM was then incorporated into high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to form a series of thermally conductive PCM microcapsules that approached sphere shapes with diameters less than 2 m. Thermal analysis showed that the thermal stability and heat resistance of the microcapsule were improved. The thermal conductivity of HDPE was increased by 39% to 0.6358 W/m ?K, and the surface resistivity was lowered to 2.78  105 /sq after the addition of MEPCM. The temperature on the top of the composite tested was lower than pristine HDPE. This was close to the onset melting temperature of the MEPCM (38.5C), 5C lower than pure HDPE. The reduction is a significant improvement in temperature regulation. This enables MEPCMs to store and release heat much more effectively, and can thus be applied to medical construction materials to meet the temperature requirements of COVID-19 patients.

Subsequently, persons with suspected cases of infection and contacts of those with suspected infection were tested. Persons in whom infection was confirmed were hospitalized and quarantined, and some of them were closely observed for the purpose of investigating the nature and duration of the disease. METHODS During May and June 2009, we observed 426 persons infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus who were quarantined in 61 hospitals in 20 provinces. Real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing was used to confirm infection, the clinical features of the disease were closely monitored, and 254 patients were treated with oseltamivir within 48 hours after the onset of disease. RESULTS The mean age of the 426 patients was 23.4 years, and 53.8% were male. The diagnosis was made at ports of entry (in 32.9% of the patients), during quarantine (20.2%), and in the hospital (46.9%). The median incubation period of the virus was 2 days (range, 1 to 7). The most common symptoms were fever (in 67.4% of the patients) and cough (69.5%). The incidence of diarrhea was 2.8%, and the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 1.9%. Lymphopenia, which was common in both adults (68.1%) and children (92.3%), typically occurred on day 2 (range, 1 to 3) and resolved by day 7 (range, 6 to 9). Hypokalemia was observed in 25.4% of the patients. Duration of fever was typically 3 days (range, 1 to 11). The median length of time during which patients had positive real-time RT-PCR test results was 6 days (range, 1 to 17). Independent risk factors for prolonged real-time RT-PCR positivity included an age of less than 14 years, male sex, and a delay from the onset of symptoms to treatment with oseltamivir of more than 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS Surveillance of the 2009 H1N1 virus in China shows that the majority of those infected have a mild illness. The typical period during which the virus can be detected with the use of real-time RT-PCR is 6 days (whether or not fever is present). The duration of infection may be shortened if oseltamivir is administered.","output":"Clinical features of the initial cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human-in-the-loop cyber-physical system provides numerous solutions for the challenges faced by the doctors or medical practitioners. There is a linear trend of advancement and automation in the medical field for the early diagnosis of several diseases. One of the critical and challenging diseases in the medical field is coma. In the medical research field, currently, the prediction of these diseases is performed only using the data gathered from the devices only; however, the human's input is much essential to accurately understand their health condition to take appropriate decision on time. Therefore, we have proposed a healthcare framework involving the concept of artificial intelligence in the human-in- the-loop cyber-physical system. This model works via a response loop in which the human's intention is concluded by gathering biological signals and context data, and then, the decision is interpreted to a system action that is recognizable to the human in the physical environment, thereby completing the loop. In this paper, we have designed a model for early prognosis of coma using the electroencephalogram dataset. In the proposed approach, we have achieved the best results using a statistical learning algorithm called autoregressive integrated moving average in comparison to artificial neural networks and long short-term memory models. In order to measure the efficiency of our model, we have used the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) value to evaluate the linear models as it gives the difference between the measured value and true or correct value.

With prompt and drastic measures, Vietnam is one of the few countries that has largely succeeded in controlling the outbreak. This result is derived from a harmonious combination of many factors, with the policy system playing a key role. This study assessed the policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam from the early days of the outbreak in January 2020 to 24 July 2020 (with a total of 413 cases confirmed and 99 days of no new cases infected from the local community) by synthesizing and evaluating 959 relevant policy documents in different classifications. The findings show that the Vietnamese policy system responded promptly, proactively, and effectively at multiple authority levels (33 different agencies from the national to provincial governments), using a range of policy tools and measures. Parallel to the daily occurrence of 2.24 new cases, 5.13 new policy documents were issued on average per day over the study period. The pandemic policy response over the first six months in Vietnam were divided into four periods, I (23 JanuaryC5 March), II (6C19 March), III (20 MarchC21 April), and IV (22 AprilC24 July). This paper synthesizes eight solution groups for these four anti-pandemic phases, including outbreak announcements and steering documents, medical measures, blockade of the schools, emergency responses, border and entry control measures, social isolation and nationwide social isolation measures, financial supports, and other measures.

This k-means compression model and the conventional virtual observation point (VOP) model were tested in a pTx MRI framework. The pTx pulse design with different SAR controlling schemes was simulated using a numerical human head model and an eight-channel 7T coil array. Multiple criteria (including RF power, global and peak local SARs, and excitation accuracy) were compared for the performance testing. RESULTS: The k-means compression model generated a narrower overestimation bound, leading to a more accurate local SAR estimation. Among different pTx pulse design approaches, the k-means compression model showed the best trade-off between the SAR and excitation accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The developed SAR compression model is advantageous for pTx framework given the narrower overestimation bound and control over the compression ratio.

A/H1N1 viruses had circulated in 1918C1957 and 1977C2009 and were in the annual vaccine during 1977C2009. Methods. Serum antibody to the pH1N1 and seasonal A/H1N1 viruses was measured in 579 healthy adults at enrollment (fall 2009) and after surveillance for illness (spring 2010). Subjects reporting with moderate to severe acute respiratory illness had illness and virus quantitation for 1 week; evaluations for missed illnesses were conducted over holiday periods and at the spring 2010 visit. Results. After excluding 66 subjects who received pH1N1 vaccine, 513 remained. Seventy-seven had reported with moderate to severe illnesses; 31 were infected with pH1N1 virus, and 30 with a rhinovirus. Determining etiology from clinical findings was not possible, but fever and prominent myalgias favored influenza and prominent rhinorrhea favored rhinovirus. Tests of fall and spring antibody indicated pH1N1 infection of 23% had occurred, with the rate decreasing with increasing anti-pH1N1 antibody; a similar pattern was seen for influenza-associated illness. A reducing frequency of pH1N1 infections was also seen with increasing antibody to the recent seasonal A/H1N1 virus (A/Brisbane/59/07). Preexisting antibody to pH1N1 virus, responses to a single vaccine dose, a low infection-to-illness ratio, and a short duration of illness and virus shedding among those with influenza indicated presence of considerable preexisting immunity to pH1N1 in the population. Conclusions. The 2009 A/H1N1 epidemic among healthy adults was relatively mild, most likely because of immunity from prior infections with A/H1N1 viruses.","output":"Prior Infections With Seasonal Influenza A/H1N1 Virus Reduced the Illness Severity and Epidemic Intensity of Pandemic H1N1 Influenza in Healthy Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Soft tissue trauma of the head and neck is encountered frequently by the battlefield head and neck surgeon.

The relationship between the center of mass and base of support is often quantified using the margin of stability. Although people post-stroke increase the margin of stability following perturbations, control deficits may lead to asymmetries in regulation of margins of stability, which may also cause maladaptive coupling between the sagittal and frontal planes during balance-correcting responses. METHODS: We assessed how paretic and non-paretic margins of stability are controlled during recovery from forward perturbations and determined how stroke-related impairments influence the coupling between the anteroposterior and mediolateral margins of stability. Twenty-one participants with post-stroke hemiparesis walked on a treadmill while receiving slip-like perturbations on both limbs at foot-strike. We assessed anteroposterior and mediolateral margins of stability before perturbations and during perturbation recovery. FINDINGS: Participants walked with smaller anteroposterior and larger mediolateral margins of stability on the paretic versus non-paretic sides. When responding to perturbations, participants increased the anteroposterior margin of stability bilaterally by extending the base of support and reducing the excursion of the extrapolated center of mass. The anteroposterior and mediolateral margins of stability in the paretic limb negatively covaried during reactive steps such that increases in anteroposterior were associated with reductions in mediolateral margins of stability. INTERPRETATION: Balance training interventions to reduce fall risk post-stroke may benefit from incorporating strategies to reduce maladaptive coupling of frontal and sagittal plane stability.","output":"Maintaining sagittal plane balance compromises frontal plane balance during reactive stepping in people post-stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Consumption Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are probabilistic decision-making models of resource-constrained systems.

This has resulted in the disruption of routine care to children with chronic rheumatological diseases. We studied the treatment adherence and disease status of these children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We did a cross-sectional observational study of children (&lt;16 years) with rheumatological diseases. Parents of seventy consecutive children with rheumatological diseases were interviewed through the telephone to assess the treatment adherence and disease status from April 2020 to July 2020. Results: In our study cohort, 44.3' (n = 31) had juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 52.9' (n = 37) had childhood lupus childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE), 1.4' (n = 1) had juvenile scleroderma, and 1.4' (n = 1) had childhood vasculitis. About 38.6' (n = 27) had poor compliance due to reasons like difficulty in transportation (88.6') (n = 24), financial constraints (88.6') (n = 24), fear of acquiring COVID-19 by attending the study center (55.5') (n = 15), and fear of taking immunosuppressive drugs (18.5') (n = 5). Thirty percent (n = 21) respondents reported flare of symptoms. Common flare symptoms reported were joint pain (25.7') (n = 18), skin rashes (1.4') (n = 1), and oral ulcers (1.4') (n = 1). One patient with cSLE required admission for acute pancreatitis. Nearly 4.3' (n = 3) experienced influenza like illness. One patient with cSLE developed swab-positive mild COVID-19 illness. cSLE patients experienced significantly less flare symptoms compared to patients with other rheumatological illness (P = 0.03, odds ratio = 0.32, confidence interval = 0.1-0.9). Almost 98.6' (n = 68) of parents were not aware of electronic consultation portals. Conclusion: Although COVID-19 causes less symptomatic disease in children, this study highlights the indirect effects of pandemic like financial constraints and parental misconceptions on children with rheumatological diseases. Furthermore, the awareness about electronic portals in consultation needs to be increased. ? 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

One such antigen, the hemoglobin-digesting intestinal aspartic protease known as Na-APR-1 from the human hookworm Necator americanus, is currently a lead candidate antigen in clinical trials, as is Na-GST-1 a heme-detoxifying glutathione S-transferase. METHODS: In order to discover additional hookworm vaccine antigens, messenger RNA was obtained from the intestine of male hookworms, Ancylostoma ceylanicum, maintained in hamsters. RNA-seq was performed using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. The genes expressed in the hookworm intestine were compared with those expressed in the whole worm and those genes overexpressed in the parasite intestine transcriptome were further analyzed. RESULTS: Among the lead transcripts identified were genes encoding for proteolytic enzymes including an A. ceylanicum APR-1, but the most common proteases were cysteine-, serine-, and metallo-proteases. Also in abundance were specific transporters of key breakdown metabolites, including amino acids, glucose, lipids, ions and water; detoxifying and heme-binding glutathione S-transferases; a family of cysteine-rich/antigen 5/pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) previously found in high abundance in parasitic nematodes; C-type lectins; and heat shock proteins. These candidates will be ranked for downstream antigen target selection based on key criteria including abundance, uniqueness in the parasite versus the vertebrate host, as well as solubility and yield of expression. CONCLUSION: The intestinal transcriptome of A. ceylanicum provides useful information for the identification of proteins involved in the blood-feeding process, representing a first step towards a reverse vaccinology approach to a human hookworm vaccine.

METHODS: a secondary descriptive analysis of routinely available COVID-19 vaccination data extracted from the daily situation reports published by the Ministry of Health and Child Care. RESULTS: in the first three months of the programme, 1 020 078 doses were administered, with 675 678 being first doses and 344 400 were second doses. Using population estimates, at three months, 5.2% of the population had received at least one dose and 2.6% had received the full two doses. Uptake was initially slow, followed by a gradual, and subsequently an exponential increase. CONCLUSION: by the end of May 2021, Zimbabwe had rolled out one of the largest COVID-19 vaccination programme in sub-Saharan Africa. The uptake followed a pattern and trend that is consistent with vaccine hesitancy reported in the literature, driven by a combination of confidence, complacency and convenience factors. The gradual increase in uptake followed a series of national and local community engagement programmes. The roll-out of similar programmes must recognise likely patterns of uptake across the population and ensure plans are in place to address vaccine hesitancy. The available data did not allow granular analysis to understand the demographics of people who participated in the programme, which is important for surveillance, targeted action, preventing inequalities and ensuring adequate and proportionate protection of residents prioritising the most vulnerable.

It is caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is known to spread via respiratory droplets. We aimed to determine the rate and likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from COVID-19 patients through non-respiratory routes. METHODS: Serum, urine, and stool samples were collected from 74 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome was extracted from each specimen and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed. CaCo-2 cells were inoculated with the specimens containing the SARS-COV-2 genome, and subcultured for virus isolation. After culturing, viral replication in the cell supernatant was assessed. RESULTS: Of the samples collected from 74 COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 15 serum, urine, or stool samples. The virus detection rate in the serum, urine, and stool samples were 2.8% (9/323), 0.8% (2/247), and 10.1% (13/129), and the mean viral load was 1,210  1,861, 79  30, and 3,176  7,208 copy/L, respectively. However, the SARS-CoV-2 was not isolated by the culture method from the samples that tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 gene. CONCLUSION: While the virus remained detectable in the respiratory samples of COVID-19 patients for several days after hospitalization, its detection in the serum, urine, and stool samples was intermittent. Since the virus could not be isolated from the SARS-COV-2-positive samples, the risk of viral transmission via stool and urine is expected to be low.","output":"Detection and Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in Serum, Urine, and Stool Specimens of COVID-19 Patients from the Republic of Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread worldwide and efficacious therapeutics are urgently needed. 3-Chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL(pro)) is an indispensable protein in viral replication and represents an attractive drug target for fighting COVID-19.

First, they involve real-world infrastructures that, while unlikely to accomplish the task at hand, will nevertheless last a long time and be repurposed. They therefore constitute governance by data infrastructure, diverting action and control away from elected legislators to for-profit contractors. Second, vaccine certification effectively legitimises inequalities between countries and people by formalising ways to distinguish between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated and to exclude the latter, thus reinforcing both mobility and connectivity divides.

We developed a mechanistic model to describe viral load dynamics and host response and contrast this with simpler mixed-effects regression analysis of peak viral load and its subsequent decline. We observed wide variation in URT viral load between individuals, over 5 orders of magnitude, at any given point in time since symptom onset. This variation was not explained by age, sex, or severity of illness, and these variables were not associated with the modelled early or late phases of immune-mediated control of viral load. We explored the application of the mechanistic model to identify measured immune responses associated with the control of the viral load. Neutralising antibodies correlated strongly with modelled immune-mediated control of viral load amongst subjects who produced neutralising antibodies. Our models can be used to identify host and viral factors which control URT viral load dynamics, informing future treatment and transmission blocking interventions.

Understanding the impact of physical distancing on family members of ICU patients is needed to inform future policies. OBJECTIVES: To understand the experiences of family members of critically ill patients with COVID-19 when physically distanced from their loved ones and to explore ways clinicians may support them. METHODS: This qualitative study of an observational cohort study reports data from 74 family members of ICU patients with COVID-19 at 10 United States hospitals in four states, chosen based on geographic and demographic diversity. Adult family members of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic (FebruaryCJune 2020) were invited to participate in a phone interview. Interviews followed a semistructured guide to assess four constructs: illness narrative, stress experiences, communication experiences, and satisfaction with care. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Among 74 interviewees, the mean age was 53.0 years, 55% were white, and 76% were female. Physical distancing contributed to substantial stress and harms (nine themes). Participants described profound suffering and psychological illness, unfavorable perceptions of care, and weakened therapeutic relationship between family members and clinicians. Three communication principles emerged as those most valued by family members: contact, consistency, and compassion (the 3Cs). Family members offered suggestions to guide clinicians faced with communicating with physically distanced families. CONCLUSIONS: Visitation restrictions impose substantial psychological harms upon family members of critically ill patients. Derived from the voics of family members, our findings warrant strong consideration when implementing visitation restrictions in the ICU and advocate for investment in infrastructure (including staffing and videoconferencing) to support communication. This study offers family-derived recommendations to operationalize the 3Cs to guide and improve communication in times of physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","output":"Voices from the Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Family Experiences and Suggestions regarding the Care of Critically Ill Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The following passage is an unofficial transcript from an early 1970s post-lecture exchange between a freshman college student and a Roman Catholic nun teaching an undergraduate biology course at a small liberal arts college in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States..","output":"Biographical Feature: Karen C.

METHODS: The authors conducted one multi-source and time-lagged survey (with 44 managers and 212 team members) and two scenario-based experiments (with 120 participants in Study 2 and 121 participants in Study 3) to test the research model. RESULTS: Team managers differentiated empowering leadership decreases team members helping behaviors. In particular, for team members who receive less empowerment, differentiated empowering leadership may decrease their helping behaviors by eliciting their envy. For team members who receive more empowerment, differentiated empowering leadership may decrease their helping behaviors by inducing their contempt. CONCLUSION: This research introduces the concept of differentiated empowering leadership in response to calls to investigate the dark side of empowering leadership. It reveals that unequal distribution of authority among team members by managers can undermine employee relations and elicit negative emotions of envy and contempt, thereby decreasing employees helping behaviors.","output":"Negative Influences of Differentiated Empowering Leadership on Team Members Helping Behaviors: The Mediating Effects of Envy and Contempt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To validate the EPIC food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in Lebanon. DESIGN Validation of the EPIC FFQ was done against three 24-hour recalls. Unadjusted and energy adjusted correlations, Bland Altman plots, and weighed kappa statistics were used to assess the agreement between the two methods. SETTING Lebanon. PARTICIPANTS 119 adults (staff and students) at a Lebanese University. RESULTS Good unadjusted and energy-adjusted correlation coefficients were found between data from the two methods which ranged from -0.002 (vitamin A) to 0.337 (carbohydrates) and were all statistically significant except for vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin A, selenium, and niacin. Slight/fair agreement was reported through weighed kappa estimates for unadjusted data ranging from -0.05 (vitamin C) to 0.248 (magnesium) and for energy-adjusted data ranging from -0.034 (vitamin A) to 0.203 (phosphorus). Individuals were categorised into exact and adjacent quartiles with an average of 78% for unadjusted data and 70% for energy-adjusted data, indicating a very good agreement between the EPIC FFQ and the average of the 24-HRs data. The visual inspection of the Bland-Altman plots revealed an over-estimation of energy, carbohydrates, protein, and fat intakes by the FFQ method. CONCLUSION Overall, when all tests were taken into consideration, this study demonstrated an acceptable agreement of the EPIC FFQ with the 24-hour dietary recall method and significantly good correlations between dietary intakes.

Therefore, aiming at strong B cell somatic hypermutation to increase antibody affinity to the ancestral strain - not only at high antibody titers - is a priority when utilizing vaccines that are not targeted at individual variants since high affinity may offer some flexibility to compensate for strain-individual mutations. Here, we developed a next-generation sequencing based SARS-CoV-2 B cell tracking protocol to rapidly determine the level of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation at distinct points during the immunization period. The percentage of somatically hypermutated B cells in the SARS-CoV-2 specific repertoire was low after the primary vaccination series, evolved further over months and increased steeply after boosting. The third vaccination mobilized not only na?ve, but also antigen-experienced B cell clones into further rapid somatic hypermutation trajectories indicating increased affinity. Together, the strongly mutated post-booster repertoires and antibodies deriving from this may explain why the third, but not the primary vaccination series, offers some protection against immune-escape variants such as Omicron B.1.1.529.","output":"Rapid Hypermutation B Cell Trajectory Recruits Previously Primed B Cells Upon Third SARS-Cov-2 mRNA Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A system for sorbent-assisted peritoneal dialysis (SAPD) has been developed that continuously recirculates dialysate via a tidal mode using a single-lumen peritoneal catheter with the regeneration of spent dialysate by means of sorbents.

The system is designed for daily 8-hr treatment (12 kg, nighttime system). A wearable system (2.3 kg, daytime system) may further enhance the clearance of phosphate and organic waste solutes during the day.

Plasma clearance (Cl), MTAC, and total mass transport (MT) of urea, creatinine, phosphate, and potassium were compared with a static dwell (n = 28). Cl, MTAC, and MT of urea, creatinine, phosphate, and potassium were low in the pig as compared to humans due to the pig's low peritoneal transport status and could be enhanced only to a limited extent by SAPD treatment compared with a static dwell (nighttime system: Cl urea: 1.5 (p = .029), Cl creatinine: 1.7 (p = .054), Cl phosphate: 1.5 (p = .158), Cl potassium: 1.6 (p = .011); daytime system: Cl creatinine: 2.7 (p = .040), Cl phosphate: 2.2 (p = .039)).

The questionnaire was to be answered by key respondents representing the three major OH components: (i). Animal Health; (ii). Human Health/Public Health; (iii). Environmental Health. A target respondent rate of nine respondents/country was aimed for, representing the following categories: (i). ministries; (ii). academia-research; (iii). private sector and NGOs, associations and scientific societies. The questionnaire, composed of 27 questions organized in six sections, was circulated to target respondents by Committee Members of the two COST actions. A total of 171 respondents from 34 countries completed the questionnaire, mainly belonging to academic and research institutions (55.5%), and to Animal Health/Animal Science fields (53.8%). Although the majority (57.9%) declared they had heard about OH, few respondents (10.7%) provided a complete definition. The human and animal elements prevailed over other key elements of OH definition (ecosystem, intersectoral, transdisciplinary, holistic, collaboration). Overall, 62.6% respondents declared to take part in OH initiatives. Antimicrobial resistance, avian influenza and environmental pollution were cited as the top three OH issues over the past 5 years. Limitations and gaps in intersectoral collaboration included communication and organizational problems resulting in poor networking, differing priorities and a lack of understanding between sectors. Regarding control and monitoring of zoonotic diseases, respondents from different sectors preferentially selected their own directorates/ministries while actually in most countries both Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture are engaged. According to respondents, the level of awareness of OH amongst the general public is limited. Similarly, a dearth of opportunities of collaborations at different institutional and/or professional levels was described. Our survey provided an overview of how respondents in COST countries perceived and experienced OH and current limits to OH implementation. Identifying how initiatives are currently working and knowing the promoting and hindering factors allowed suggesting strategies to promote efficiency and effectiveness of OH implementation in the future.","output":"A Survey on One Health Perception and Experiences in Europe and Neighboring Areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present WiC-TSV (\\\\textit{Target Sense Verification for Words in Context}), a new multi-domain evaluation benchmark for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Entity Linking (EL).

Although the clinical profile and risk factors for CAM have been studied, cumulative mortality and its risk factors have not. Objective: To report the cumulative mortality rates at different times in cases with CAM and identify risk factors for CAM-associated mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case-control study was conducted from March 1 to May 30, 2021, in a tertiary care multispecialty hospital in western India. All patients diagnosed with CAM and with a minimum follow-up of 30 days or those who died before 30 days due to CAM were included. Main Outcomes and Measure: Cumulative mortality in CAM using survival analysis. Results: A total of 73 consecutive patients with CAM with a mean (SD) age of 53.5 (12.5) years were included in the analysis, of whom 48 (66%) were men. CAM developed at a median of 28 (IQR, 15-45; range, 4-90) days after recovery from COVID-19. Of the 73 patients with CAM, 26 (36%) died; the cumulative probability of death was 26% (95% CI, 16%-41%) at day 7 and doubled to 53% (95% CI, 39%-69%) at day 21. Sinus debridement was performed in 18 of 51 patients (35%), and 5 of 52 (10%) underwent exenteration, whereas intravenous lyophilized amphotericin B was administered to 48 patients (66%). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that receiving mechanical ventilation in the past was associated with a nearly 9-fold increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 8.98; 95% CI, 2.13-38.65; P = .003), and patients who had visual acuity of light perception or better had a 46% lower risk of death (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.98; P = .04).

To begin collecting necessary epidemiology and cost information about the illnesses caused by these viruses, we conducted a prospective cohort study in 118 Melbourne children between 12 and 71 months of age during winter and spring 2001. We were interested in calculating an average cost per episode of community-managed acute respiratory disease, in identifying the key cost drivers of such illness, and to identify the proportion of costs borne by the patient and family. There were 202 community-managed influenza-like illnesses identified between July and December 2001, generating 89 general practitioner visits, and 42 antibiotic prescriptions. The average cost of community-managed episodes (without hospitalisation) was dollar 241 (95% CI dollar 191 to dollar 291), with the key cost drivers being carer time away from usual activities caring for the ill child (70% of costs), use of non-prescription medications (5.4%), and general practice visits (5.0%). The patient and family met 87 per cent of total costs. The lowest average cost occurred in households from the highest income bracket. Acute respiratory illness managed in the community is common, with the responsibility for meeting the cost of episodes predominantly borne by the patient and family in the form of lost productivity.

According to the results of pathogenic analysis, children were further subdivided into a bacterial infection group (n = 67) and a viral infection group (n = 63). Additionally, 65 children who underwent physical examinations in our hospital during the same period were collected and included into the control group (n = 65). All patients selected were treated with cefixime granules orally for 5 days. Serum HBP level, serum PCT level, and serum CRP level were measured by double antibody Sandwich Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), fluorescence method, and immunoturbidimetric assay, respectively. The expression levels of the three indicators in the serum of all subjects were compared, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze their diagnostic value in children with ABURTI. Furthermore, according to clinical efficacy of children with bacterial infections, they were divided into a good efficacy group (markedly effective) and a poor efficacy group (effective + ineffective) to compare serum HBP, PCT, and CRP levels between the two groups. The ROC curve was drawn to analyze the value of the three indicators in predicting the curative effect in children with ABURTI. Pearson test was used to analyze the correlation among the expression of HBP, PCT, and CRP. Results showed that the expression levels of HBP, PCT, and CRP in the serum of children in the bacterial infection group were significantly higher than those in the other two groups. The positive rates of HBP, PCT, and CRP in children in the bacterial infection group were also significantly higher than those of the other two groups.

Age alone demonstrated greater discriminant accuracy for inhospital mortality than SOFA score (AUC, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.69-0.72). Discriminant accuracy for mortality improved upon addition of age to the continuous SOFA score (AUC, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.73-0.76) and categorized SOFA score (AUC, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.71-0.73) models, respectively. The addition of comorbidities did not substantially increase model discrimination. Of 36 U.S. states with crisis standards of care guidelines containing ventilator triage algorithms, 31 (86%) feature the SOFA score. Of these, 25 (81%) rely heavily on the SOFA score (12 exclusively propose SOFA; 13 place highest weight on SOFA or propose SOFA with one other variable). CONCLUSIONS: In a U.S. cohort of over 15,000 ventilated patients with COVID-19, the SOFA score displayed poor predictive accuracy for short-term mortality. Our findings warrant reappraisal of the SOFA score's implementation and weightage in existing ventilator triage pathways in current U.S. crisis standards of care guidelines.","output":"Preintubation Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score for Predicting COVID-19 Mortality: External Validation Using Electronic Health Record From 86 U.S. Healthcare Systems to Appraise Current Ventilator Triage Algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundPoint-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been an essential component of The Royal College of Emergency Medicines higher speciality curriculum since 2010. However, it has only been part of the Paediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) syllabus since 2018, with its use less well-embraced by the specialty. In comparison, POCUS has become increasingly established in PEM departments across North America, with widespread evidence supporting its diagnostic and procedural application in PEM. These successful practices highlight the potential for POCUS to be further implemented within PEM departments in the UK.ObjectivesThe absence of a standardised PEM-specific POCUS training program in the UK led us to suspect a possible wide disparity in the training and delivery of POCUS among PEM clinicians. Following on from the 2019 PERUKI study, which aimed to determine the current implementation and practices of POCUS in various PEM departments, we decided to focus in on and survey a cohort of trainees to evaluate their current opinions, experiences and attitudes towards POCUS in PEM.MethodsWe created an online survey and distributed it in October 2020 to a sample of trainees from our tertiary paediatric site. The survey questions not only ascertained variation in POCUS experience and formal training, but had a novel focus in targeting the barriers to its more frequent implementation as well as the attitudes of the trainees towards the future of POCUS in PEM education.ResultsWe received a 56% response rate from the trainees invited to participate in the survey. Our results confirmed a deficiency in the standardised POCUS training amongst the PEM clinicians, with 89% having no PEM-specific POCUS training. We observed an underuse of POCUS at our site, with 76.9% stating they have never used POCUS for diagnostic purposes. Despite this, >60% agreed with the statement that POCUS is a necessary addition to PEM, with zero disagreement. 100% of trainees voted that they would like further teaching, recognising the need for the development of a PEM-specific training curriculum before they can confidently utilise it in their day to day practice. 100% of the trainees believe that POCUS should be taught to postgraduates, 67% to undergraduates.ConclusionsThe results of our survey have emphasised the need for a PEM-specific POCUS training pathway in the UK. We confirmed that the severe underuse in POCUS application was not due to a lack of enthusiasm, but rather a lack of training. The large majority of our respondents believe POCUS to be an essential adjunct to paediatric emergency medicine, however its user-dependency in the absence of well-established training severely restricts its potential as a diagnostic and procedural tool. Given current circumstances, an endeavour into implementing standardised teaching in postgraduate training would be worthwhile. The role of POCUS could prove useful in this COVID era, such as the potential to reduce clinicians exposure to the virus in the examination of COVID lung pathologies.","output":"The unfulfilled potential of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in paediatric emergency medicine (PEM) training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomic instability affects the reproducibility of experiments that rely on cancer cell lines.

The capsid protein open reading frame 2 (ORF2) is known to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress in ORF2 expressing cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we found that HEV ORF2 activates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). ORF2 stimulates the CHOP promoter mainly through AARE (amino acid response elements) and to a minor extent the ERSE (endoplasmic reticulum stress response elements). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) protein binds and activates the AARE regulatory sites of the CHOP promoter. ORF2 expression also leads to increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2) that in turn initiates the translation of ATF4 mRNA. The pro-apoptotic gene CHOP is an important trigger to initiate endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis. However, the activation of CHOP by ORF2 in this study did not induce apoptosis, nor did BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) translocate to mitochondria. Microarray analysis revealed an ORF2 specific increased expression of chaperones Hsp72, Hsp70B', and co-chaperone Hsp40. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and in silico molecular docking analysis suggests that HEV ORF2 interacts with Hsp72. In addition, Hsp72 shows nuclear accumulation in ORF2 expressing cells.

Each month, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) monitors the prevalence of health-related workplace absenteeism among currently employed full-time workers in the United States, overall and by demographic and occupational subgroups, using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS).* This report describes trends in absenteeism during October 2019-April 2020, including March and April 2020, the period of rapidly accelerating transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Overall, the prevalence of health-related workplace absenteeism in March and April 2020 were similar to their 5-year baselines. However, compared with occupation-specific baselines, absenteeism among workers in several occupational groups that define or contain essential critical infrastructure workforce? categories was significantly higher than expected in April. Significant increases in absenteeism were observed in personal care and service (includes child care workers and personal care aides); healthcare support?; and production** (includes meat, poultry, and fish processing workers). Although health-related workplace absenteeism remained relatively unchanged or decreased in other groups, the increase in absenteeism among workers in occupational groups less able to avoid exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (3) highlights the potential impact of COVID-19 on the essential critical infrastructure workforce because of the risks and concerns of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Recent studies suggest a decreased risk of severe COVID-19 in RMD-patients treated with biologics. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess courses of RMD patients treated with TNF-inhibitors (TNF-I) included in the German COVID-19 registry. Methods: In the German physician-reported COVID-19-RMD registry, patients with an RMD and confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection were documented (data entered between March 30, 2020 and January 30, 2021). We analysed TNF-I treated patients, their course and outcome of the infection. Data were compared to RMD-patients treated with other immunomodulatory drugs (OID) than TNF-I. Results: A total of 269 patients were treated with a TNF-I (57% female) compared to 874 patients who were treated with OID (68% female). Median age was 52 years (range: 19-87) in the TNF-I-group versus 58 years (range: 18-91) in the OID-group. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most common diagnosis (38% in TNF-I-group vs. 52% in the OID-group), followed by ankylosing spondylitis (32% vs. 6%), psoriatic arthritis (22% vs. 11%) and other RMD (9% vs. 31%). Adalimumab (35%) and etanercept (35%) were the most frequently used TNF-I (tab. 1). Glucocorticoids (GC) were used in 22% of TNF-I-treated patients and in 42% of the OID-group. Under TNF-I, stable disease was reported prior to the SARS-CoV-2-infection in 53% of the patients (OID-group: 47%), followed by low disease activity in 35% (OID: 34%), moderate disease activity in 6% (OID: 12%) and high disease activity in 4% (OID: 3%). Most frequent comorbidities were arterial hypertension (29% under TNF-I vs. 35% under OID), diabetes (8% vs. 11%) and cardiovascular diseases (7% vs. 12%). The most common reported COVID-19 symptoms were dry cough (57% vs. 55%), fever (53% vs. 61%) and fatigue (50% vs. 49%). Hospitalization due to SARSCoV infection was required in only 12% of the TNF-I-treated cases vs. in 29% in the OID-group. Oxygen treatment was necessary in 5% of the patients under TNF-I compared to 22% under OID and invasive ventilation in 2% in the TNF-Igroup compared to 6% under OID. Most notably, no fatal courses of COVID-19 were reported among the 269 RMD-patients treated with TNF-I versus 49 deaths in the 874 cases (5.6%) treated with OID. Focussing on the hospitalizated TNF-I patients, the rate of concomitant GC use (p<0.001) and higher disease activity (p=0.005) was significant higher (tab.1). Conclusion: High or moderate RMD-disease activity is an important factor associated with severity of COVID-19 including mortality. In this large cohort RMD patients treated with TNF-I show a low hospitalisation rate and no fatal course. This is reassuring for patients and treating rheumatologists to use TNF-I to control RMD disease activity. The use of glucocorticoids and high disease activity seem to counteract possible protective effects of TNF-I.","output":"Does tnf-inhibition decrease the risk of severe COVID-19 in rmd-patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a systematic literature review to summarize the available evidence regarding the incidence, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation because of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection (C-ARDS). RECENT FINDINGS: Sixteen studies (6484 patients) were identified. Bacterial coinfection was uncommon at baseline (<15%) but a high proportion of patients developed positive bacterial cultures thereafter leading to a VAP diagnosis (range 21C64%, weighted average 50%). Diagnostic criteria varied between studies but most signs of VAP have substantial overlap with the signs of C-ARDS making it difficult to differentiate between bacterial colonization versus superinfection. Most episodes of VAP were associated with Gram-negative bacteria. Occasional cases were also attributed to herpes virus reactivations and pulmonary aspergillosis. Potential factors driving high VAP incidence rates include immunoparalysis, prolonged ventilation, exposure to immunosuppressants, understaffing, lapses in prevention processes, and overdiagnosis. SUMMARY: Covid-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation for ARDS have a high risk (>50%) of developing VAP, most commonly because of Gram-negative bacteria. Further work is needed to elucidate the disease-specific risk factors for VAP, strategies for prevention, and how best to differentiate between bacterial colonization versus superinfection.","output":"Ventilator-associated pneumonia among SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exposure to childhood trauma is extremely common (>60%) and is a leading risk factor for fear-based disorders, including anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder. These disorders are characterized by deficits in fear extinction and dysfunction in underlying neural circuitry. Given the strong and pervasive link between childhood trauma and the development of psychopathology, fear extinction may be a key mechanism. The present study tests the impact of childhood trauma exposure on fear extinction and underlying neural circuitry. Children (N = 44, 45% trauma-exposed; 6-11 yrs) completed a novel two-day virtual reality fear extinction experiment. On day one, participants underwent fear conditioning and extinction. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed a test of extinction recall during fMRI. Conditioned fear was measured throughout the experiment using skin conductance and fear-related behavior, and activation in fear-related brain regions was estimated during recall. There were no group differences in conditioned fear during fear conditioning or extinction learning. During extinction recall, however, trauma-exposed children kept more distance from both the previously extinguished and the safety cue, suggesting poor differentiation between threat and safety cues. Trauma-exposed youth also failed to approach the previously extinguished cue over the course of extinction recall. The effects on fear-related behavior during extinction recall were accompanied by higher activation to the previously extinguished cue in fear-relevant brain regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, in trauma-exposed relative to control children. Alterations in fear-related brain regions and fear-related behavior may be a core mechanism through which childhood trauma confers heightened vulnerability to psychopathology.","output":"Alterations in Fear Extinction Neural Circuitry and Fear-Related Behavior Linked to Trauma Exposure in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Naphthoquinones harboring 1,4-naphthoquinone pharmacophore are considered as privileged structures in medicinal chemistry.

Nevertheless, these cell factories still remain, to a great degree, black boxes that often exceed engineers expectations. In this work, the biotransformation of juglone or 1,4-naphthoquinone was conducted to generate novel derivatives and it was revealed that these two naphthoquinones can indeed be modified by the chassis cells. Seventeen derivatives, including 6 novel compounds, were isolated and their structural characterizations indicated the attachment of certain metabolites of chassis cells to naphthoquinones. Some of these biosynthesized derivatives were reported as potent antimicrobial agents with reduced cytotoxic activities. Additionally, molecular docking as simple and quick in silico approach was performed to screen the biosynthesized compounds for their potential antiviral activity.

This scoping review maps the studies conducted to date that address questions about pediatric safety and effectiveness of vaccines administered during pregnancy and provides a knowledge base for evaluating the use of RWD to study this issue. METHODS: The scoping review was conducted following a published protocol. Methods included an electronic search of PubMed and Embase, screening of titles and abstracts by two reviewers, and double extraction of data for summary and synthesis. Studies that reported on pregnant women and the effectiveness or safety outcomes in their infants were included. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria of the scoping review protocol using RWD to assess safety or effectiveness of influenza or pertussis vaccinations administered to pregnant women with respect to pregnancy, infant or child outcomes. Detailed information about data sources, linkage of maternal and infant data, and operational definitions for gestational age were largely absent from the majority of studies raising concerns about reproducibility and validity of study findings.

METHOD The latest version of the EndoMaster EASE System consisted of an independently designed flexible platform with build-in endoscopic imaging system and 3 working channels, 2 for passage of robotic arms and one for accessories. In this animal study, the outcome measures included operating time (from starting incision to finishing dissection), completeness of resection, procedure-related adverse events as well as limitation of arms manipulation in narrow working space as assessed by counting the frequency of blind cutting. RESULTS A total of 5 ESD procedures were performed in a 66.7kg porcine model under general anesthesia. The mean operative time was 73.8 minutes, and the mean size of specimen resected was 1340 mm2.

Sepsis is a common cause of systemic hypotension and cerebral dysfunction. Guidelines for BP management in sepsis are based on historical concepts of CBF autoregulation that have now evolved with the availability of more precise technology for its measurement. In this article, we provide a narrative review of methods of monitoring CBF autoregulation, the cerebral effects of sepsis, and the current knowledge of CBF autoregulation in sepsis. Current guidelines for BP management in sepsis are based on a goal of maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above the lower limit of CBF autoregulation. Bedside tools are now available to monitor CBF autoregulation continuously. These data reveal that individual BP goals determined from CBF autoregulation monitoring are more variable than previously expected. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, for example, the lower limit of autoregulation varied between a MAP of 40 to 90 mm Hg. Studies of CBF autoregulation in sepsis suggest patients frequently manifest impaired CBF autoregulation, possibly a result of BP below the lower limit of autoregulation, particularly in early sepsis or with sepsis-associated encephalopathy.

DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wiley Cochrane Library databases, and the 2018 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco and Society for Behavioural Medicine conference abstracts. STUDY SELECTION All studies of young people (up to age 30 years) with a measure of e-cigarette use prior to smoking and an outcome measure of smoking where an OR could be calculated were included (excluding reviews and animal studies). DATA EXTRACTION Independent extraction was completed by multiple authors using a preprepared extraction form. DATA SYNTHESIS Of 9199 results, 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was strong evidence for an association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking (OR: 4.59, 95% CI: 3.60 to 5.85) when the results were meta-analysed in a random-effects model. However, there was high heterogeneity (I2 =88%). CONCLUSIONS Although the association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and subsequent smoking appears strong, the available evidence is limited by the reliance on self-report measures of smoking history without biochemical verification. None of the studies included negative controls which would provide stronger evidence for whether the association may be causal. Much of the evidence also failed to consider the nicotine content of e-liquids used by non-smokers meaning it is difficult to make conclusions about whether nicotine is the mechanism driving this association.","output":"Is e-cigarette use in non-smoking young adults associated with later smoking?

PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: This quality improvement (QI) initiative was conducted in a core group of 8 cardiovascular operating room (OR) suites and 1 cardiovascular surgical critical intensive care unit (ICU) in a large Indiana-based academic hospital. The sample comprised adult patients who underwent complex cardiovascular surgical procedures and those in the cardiovascular surgical ICU with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), ventricular assistive device (VAD), and undergoing heart and/or lung transplant, or open chest procedures. APPROACH: The AP overlay was placed on OR cardiovascular foam surfaces and on selected ICU support surfaces for patients who met inclusion criteria. We used a pre/postcomparative QI design to assess outcomes including OR-related HAPI rates, ICU aggregate unit HAPI data, related costs, and staff satisfaction during the 3-month project period. OUTCOMES: Operating room-related HAPIs were reduced from 8/71 (11%) preintervention to 0/147 (0%) postintervention (P = .008), resulting in a cost avoidance of $323,048 and positive staff satisfaction (mean = 3.85; 1- to 4-point Likert scale). No adverse outcomes occurred. Although not significant, ICU HAPI rates decreased from 10 to 7 pre/postintervention (P = .29), demonstrating a 14% HAPI reduction with a cost avoidance of $121,143. The ICU incidence density decreased from 3.57 to 3.24; however, there was no decrease in ICU monthly unit prevalence. Critical care staff satisfaction was positive (mean = 2.95; 1- to 4-point Likert scale) with most staff members preferring the AP overlay to a fluid immersion surface. A cost savings of 48% (AP overlay vs fluid immersion rental) was identified in the ICU. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: We achieved fewer HAPIs and reduced costs and observed positive staff satisfaction, along with no adverse events with the use of the AP overlay. Further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of this device for this pressure injury prevention option for immobile patients in both the OR and the ICU.","output":"Pressure Injury Prevention for Complex Cardiovascular Patients in the Operating Room and Intensive Care Unit: A Quality Improvement Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology, approaches for assessing biological ingredients in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) preparations have also advanced.

Emerging reports suggest that people living in rural areas in some countries are more susceptible to COVID-19. However, there is a lack of quantitative evidence that can shed light on whether residents of rural areas are more concerned about COVID-19 than residents of urban areas. OBJECTIVE: This infodemiology study investigated attitudes toward COVID-19 in different Japanese prefectures by aggregating and analyzing Yahoo! JAPAN search queries. METHODS: We measured COVID-19 concerns in each Japanese prefecture by aggregating search counts of COVID-19-related queries of Yahoo! JAPAN users and data related to COVID-19 cases. We then defined two indices-the localized concern index (LCI) and localized concern index by patient percentage (LCIPP)-to quantitatively represent the degree of concern. To investigate the impact of emergency declarations on people's concerns, we divided our study period into three phases according to the timing of the state of emergency in Japan: before, during, and after. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between the LCI and LCIPP in different prefectures by correlating them with prefecture-level indicators of urbanization. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the concerns about COVID-19 in the prefectures changed in accordance with the declaration of the state of emergency. The correlation analyses also indicated that the differentiated types of public concern measured by the LCI and LCIPP reflect the prefectures' level of urbanization to a certain extent (ie, the LCI appears to be more suitable for quantifying COVID-19 concern in urban areas, while the LCIPP seems to be more appropriate for rural areas). CONCLUSIONS: We quantitatively defined Japanese Yahoo users' concerns about COVID-19 by using the search counts of COVID-19-related search queries.

This is a binary decision: yes or no. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an appropriate decision parameter, is simple to obtain in field operations, and is recognized in clinical medicine as an independent marker of systemic inflammation. NLR is evaluated for usefulness in triage using data from the Radiation Accident Registry at the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site (REAC/TS). A criticality accident data set has been prepared using historic complete blood counts from 12 criticality events with 33 patients. In addition, a cohort of 125 normal controls has been assembled for comparison with the radiation accident data. In the control set, NLR is found to be 2.1  0.06 (mean  SEM) and distributed consistent with a Gaussian distribution. A patient from the 1958 Y-12 criticality accident is presented as an example of the time dependence of NLR after an event. In this case, NLR is statistically elevated above controls from <4 h until ~20 d post-event, and for times >20 d post-event, NLR is less than the control value, returning to baseline > ~40 d. The latter result has been confirmed using late hematological data taken from patients at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and this appears to be a general finding. Since triage is a binary decision, analyzing NLR with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistics is appropriate. Maximizing the Youden J statistic (sensitivity + specificity -1) determines an appropriate decision point. For this data set, the decision point for NLR is found to be 3.33, with area under the curve (AUC) 0.865, sensitivity 0.67, specificity 0.97, positive predictive value (PPV) 0.85, and negative predictive value (NPV) 0.92. Therefore, when a known criticality accident or nuclear weapon event has occurred and if the patient's NLR is greater than 3.33 early post-event, then that person should be referred for further health physics and medical evaluation.","output":"The Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio as a Triage Tool in Criticality Accidents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Alveolates are a major group of free living and parasitic organisms; some of which are serious pathogens of animals and humans. Apicomplexans and chromerids are two phyla belonging to the alveolates. Apicomplexans are obligate intracellular parasites; that cannot complete their life cycle without exploiting a suitable host. Chromerids are mostly photoautotrophs as they can obtain energy from sunlight; and are considered ancestors of the apicomplexans. The pathogenicity and life cycle strategies differ significantly between parasitic alveolates; with some causing major losses in host populations while others seem harmless to the host. As the life cycles of some are still poorly understood, a better understanding of the factors which can affect the parasitic alveolates life cycles and survival is of great importance and may aid in new biomarker discovery. This study assessed new mechanisms relating to changes in protein structure and function (so-called deimination or citrullination) in two key parasitesan apicomplexan and a chromeridto assess the pathways affected by this protein modification. Our findings point to novel regulatory mechanisms in these parasites lifecycles via protein deimination and may provide novel insights into their adaptability to different environments and hosts as well as hostCpathogen coevolution. ABSTRACT: The alveolates (Superphylum Alveolata) comprise a group of primarily single-celled eukaryotes that have adopted extremely diverse modes of nutrition, such as predation, photoautotrophy and parasitism. The alveolates consists of several major phyla including the apicomplexans, a large group of unicellular, spore forming obligate intracellular parasites, and chromerids, which are believed to be the phototrophic ancestors of the parasitic apicomplexans. Molecular pathways involved in Alveolata hostCpathogen interactions, epigenetic regulation and metabolism in parasite development remain to be fully understood. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a phylogenetically conserved enzyme family which causes post-translational protein deimination, affecting protein function through the conversion of arginine to citrulline in a wide range of target proteins, contributing to protein moonlighting in physiological and pathological processes. The identification of deiminated protein targets in alveolate parasites may therefore provide novel insight into pathogen survival and host-pathogen interactions. The current study assessed PAD homologues and deiminated protein profiles of two alveolate parasites, Piridium sociabile (Chromerida) and Merocystis kathae (Apicomplexa). Histological analysis verified strong cytoplasmic PAD expression in both Alveolates, detected deiminated proteins in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the alveolate parasites and verified the presence of citrullinated histone H3 in Alveolata nucleus, indicating roles in epigenetic regulation. Histone H3 citrullination was also found significantly elevated in the host tissue, indicative of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, a host-defence mechanism against a range of pathogens, particularly those that are too large for phagocytosis. Proteomic analysis of deiminated proteins from both Alveolata identified GO and KEGG pathways strongly relating to metabolic and genetic regulation, with some species-specific differences between the apicomplexan and the chromerid. Our findings provide novel insights into roles for the conserved PAD/ADI enzyme family in the regulation of metabolic and epigenetic pathways in alveolate parasites, possibly also relating to their life cycle and hostCpathogen interactions.","output":"Peptidylarginine Deiminase (PAD) and Post-Translational Protein DeiminationNovel Insights into Alveolata Metabolism, Epigenetic Regulation and HostCPathogen Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic situation has pushed many higher education institutions into a fast-paced, and mostly unstructured, emergency remote education process. In such an unprecedented context, it is important to understand how technology is mediating the educational process and how teachers and students are experiencing the change brought by the pandemic. This research aims to understand how the learning was mediated by technology during the early stages of the pandemic and how students and teachers experienced this sudden change. Data were collected following a qualitative research design. Thirty in-depth and semi-structured interviews (20 students and 10 teachers) were obtained and analysed following a thematic analysis approach. Results provide evidence on the adoption of remote education technologies due to the pandemic with impacts on the education process, ICT platforms usage and personal adaptation. The emergency remote education context led to mixed outcomes regarding the education process. Simultaneously, ICT platforms usage was mostly a positive experience and personal adaptation was mostly a negative experience. These results bring new insights for higher education organizations on actions they could take, such as curating the learning experience with standard, institutional-wide platforms, appropriate training for students and teachers, and suitable remote evaluation practices.","output":"An exploratory study on the emergency remote education experience of higher education students and teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tenaga kesehatan dalam melaksanakan tugas sebagai garda terdepan penanganan, pencegahan, dan perawatan pasien COVID-19 mengalami kecemasan karena disebabkan oleh beberapa faktor, salah satunya adalah ketersediaan alat pelindung diri.

We aimed to assess the prevalence, spectrum, severity, and significance of digestive manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. FINDINGS: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death.

The role of the climate and environment are essential factors to consider in transmission. We explored the association between global meteorological conditions (including mean temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and diurnal temperature range) and new cases of COVID-19 in the whole past year. We assessed the relative risk of meteorological factors to the onset of COVID-19 by using generalized additive models (GAM) and further analyzed the hysteresis effects of meteorological factors using the Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model (DLNM). Our findings revealed that the mean temperature, wind speed and relative humidity were negatively correlated with daily new cases of COVID-19, and the diurnal temperature range was positively correlated with daily new cases of COVID-19. These relationships were more apparent when the temperature and relative humidity were lower than their average value (21.07Cand 66.83%). The wind speed and diurnal temperature range were higher than the average value(3.07 m/s and 9.53 C). The maximum RR of mean temperature was 1.30 under -23C at lag ten days, the minimum RR of wind speed was 0.29 under 12m/s at lag 24 days, the maximum RR of range of temperature was 2.21 under 28 C at lag 24 days, the maximum RR of relative humidity was 1.35 under 4% at lag 0 days. After a subgroup analysis of the countries included in the study, the results were still robust. As the Northern Hemisphere enters winter, the risk of global covid-19 remains high.

It can affect soils ecosystem services directly through land management and indirectly through changes in the socioeconomic environment, which eventually leads to an increase in emissions of greenhouse gases. Soil carbon (C) sequestration plays an important role in offsetting the anthropogenic C emissions. However, there is limited knowledge of how urbanization affects the soil C especially that in suburban. In this study, we studied changes in easily oxidizable organic C (EOC) and total organic C (TOC) of suburban soils (0-100 cm) in the rapid urbanising megacity Chengdu, China. The EOC stock and TOC stock decreased from the outer-suburb to the inner-suburb by 17.8-28.2% and 5.4-13.5%, respectively; particularly, the inner-suburb EOC decreased by 31.4-38.6% during the past 10 years. The quotient of EOC/TOC in the soil profile, reflecting the stability of soil C, declined from the outer-suburb (0.78) to the inner-suburb (0.20). Factors that influenced the EOC and TOC included the changes in economics (economic density, industrialization), farmland (cultivated area, farmland structure), urbanization (city size, population growth) and traffic flow. Among which, economic density growth was the primarily driver of the loss in TOC, explaining 31.6% of the variation in soil surface TOC and 16.0% of the variation in subsoil TOC; changes in farmland and urban expansion were the main factors contributing to the loss of subsoil EOC, with 40.4% explanatory ability. In addition, traffic flow also has contribution to the subsoil EOC loss. We concluded that the increasing soil C loss with decreasing distance from the city centre has a continuous contribution to C emission, and the C loss will persist until the suburbs are fully urbanized. The large losses of EOC and TOC caused by urbanization, and their contribution to global warming, necessitate their consideration in future appraisals of climate change and urban planning projects.","output":"Loss of organic carbon in suburban soil upon urbanization of Chengdu megacity, China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Combinatorial binding of transcription factors to regulatory DNA underpins gene regulation in all organisms. Genetic variation in regulatory regions has been connected with diseases and diverse phenotypic traits(1), but it remains challenging to distinguish variants that affect regulatory function(2). Genomic DNase I footprinting enables the quantitative, nucleotide-resolution delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within native chromatin(3C6). However, only a small fraction of such sites have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence(6). Here, to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from 243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that encode transcription factor occupancy at nucleotide resolution. We map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase I-hypersensitive sites and show that the overwhelming majority are populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription factorCDNA interaction. Cell-context-dependent cis-regulation is chiefly executed by wholesale modulation of accessibility at regulatory DNA rather than by differential transcription factor occupancy within accessible elements. We also show that the enrichment of genetic variants associated with diseases or phenotypic traits in regulatory regions(1,7) is almost entirely attributable to variants within footprints, and that functional variants that affect transcription factor occupancy are nearly evenly partitioned between loss- and gain-of-function alleles. Unexpectedly, we find increased density of human genetic variation within transcription factor footprints, revealing an unappreciated driver of cis-regulatory evolution.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based testing is hampered by its low specificity that often leads to negative biopsy results or detection of clinically insignificant cancers, especially in the 2-10 ng/mL range. The objective was to evaluate a novel diagnostic test called Proclarix incorporating thrombospondin-1 and cathepsin D alongside total and free PSA as well as age for predicting clinically significant PCa. Patients and methods The test was developed following a retrospective study design using biobanked samples of 955 men from two reference centres. A multivariate approach was used for model development followed by validation to discriminate significant (grade group 2) from insignificant or no cancer at biopsy. The test specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) at a fixed sensitivity of 90% were compared to percent free PSA (%fPSA) alone. The number of avoidable prostate biopsies deemed to be representative of clinical utility was also assessed. Results In the targeted patient population, the test displayed increased diagnostic accuracy compared to %fPSA alone. Application of the established model on 955 patients at a fixed sensitivity of 90% for significant disease resulted in a specificity of 43%, NPV of 95% and a PPV of 25%. This is in comparison to a specificity of 17%, NPV of 89% and PPV of 19% for %fPSA alone and had the potential to reduce the total number of biopsies needed to identify clinically significant cancer. Further, the test score correlated with significance of cancer assessed on prostate biopsy.

Many have speculated that, like SARS, the activity of SARS-CoV-2 will subside when the climate becomes warmer. We sought to determine the relationship between ambient temperature and COVID-19 incidence in Canada. We analyzed over 77,700 COVID-19 cases from four Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec) from January to May 2020. After adjusting for precipitation, wind gust speed, and province in multiple linear regression models, we found a positive, but not statistically significant, association between cumulative incidence and ambient temperature (14.2 per 100,000 people; 95%CI: ?0.60C29.0). We also did not find a statistically significant association between total cases or effective reproductive number of COVID-19 and ambient temperature. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that higher temperatures will reduce transmission of COVID-19 and warns the public not to lose vigilance, and to continue practicing safety measures such as hand washing, social distancing, and use of facial masks despite the warming climates.","output":"Correlation of ambient temperature and COVID-19 incidence in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to investigate the optimal number of oocytes retrieved in normal responders with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist (GnRHant) protocol in comparison with the GnRH agonist (GnRHa) long protocol. This retrospective study is based on a single-center cohort including 657 fresh cycles with day 3 embryo transfer using the GnRHa long protocol and the GnRHant flexible protocol at the fertility clinic of a university hospital between 2005 and 2019. The rate ratios (RR) of clinical pregnancy were evaluated using log-binomial regression depending on the categories by the number of retrieved oocytes and pituitary suppression methods. After controlling for age, body mass index, and basal follicle-stimulating hormone, women with 10-11 oocytes retrieved demonstrated a significantly higher chance of clinical pregnancy compared to the reference group (4-5 oocytes) (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.12-2.53). However, retrieval of more than 11 oocytes did not show a significant difference in pregnancy rates (PR) from the reference group. In women treated with GnRHant, a significantly higher clinical PR was also observed in women with 10-11 oocytes retrieved compared to the reference group (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.05-3.42). In women treated with GnRHa long protocol, a higher probability of clinical pregnancy was observed (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.98-1.73) in the group with 8-11 oocytes retrieved and it demonstrated borderline statistical significance (P = 0.07). In summary, the optimal number of oocytes for maximizing the rate of a clinical pregnancy is different according to the method of pituitary suppression.

Identifying highly developable mAb sequences in silico could greatly reduce the time and cost required for therapeutic mAb development. Here, we present position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for antibody framework mutations developed using baseline human antibody repertoire sequences. Our analysis shows that human antibody repertoire-based PSSMs are consistent across individuals and demonstrate high correlations between related germlines. We show that mutations in existing therapeutic antibodies can be accurately predicted solely from baseline human antibody sequence data. We find that mAbs developed using humanized mice had more human-like FR mutations than mAbs originally developed by hybridoma technology. A quantitative assessment of entire framework regions of therapeutic antibodies revealed that there may be potential for improving the properties of existing therapeutic antibodies by incorporating additional mutations of high frequency in baseline human antibody repertoires. In addition, high frequency mutations in baseline human antibody repertoires were predicted in silico to reduce immunogenicity in therapeutic mAbs due to the removal of T cell epitopes. Several therapeutic mAbs were identified to have common, universally high-scoring framework mutations, and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanistic basis for the evolutionary selection of these mutations.

B cell, CTL and HTL were determined based on antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity that were non-allergenic, non-toxic, and antigenic and were selected for the design of a multi-epitope vaccine structure. Then, in order to increase the safety of Hbd-3 and Hbd-2 as adjuvants, they were connected to the N and C terminals of the vaccine construct, respectively, with a linker. The three-dimensional structure of the structure was predicted and optimized, and its quality was evaluated. The vaccine construct was ligated to MHCI. Finally, after optimizing the codon to increase expression in E. coli K12, the vaccine construct was cloned into pET28a (+) vector. RESULTS: Epitopes which were used in our survey were based on non-allergenic, non-toxic and antigenic. Therefore, 543-amino-acid-long multi-epitope vaccine formation was invented through linking 9 cytotoxic CTL, 5 HTL and 14 B cell epitopes with appropriate adjuvants and connectors that can control the SARS coronavirus 2 infection and could be more assessed in medical scientific researches.

By centering athletes human rights and underlining the rights-based philosophical underpinnings of the Paralympic Movement, we outline how sport can be safer to all players, coaches, and other participants. METHODS: We address global Human Rights conventions and their application to Para and non-disabled sport. Safe Sport is positioned as a matter of human rights. The nature of interpersonal violence that human beings experience within and outside sport is discussed. The intersectionality of vulnerable identities (related to gender, sexuality, disability, ethnicity, etc.) is reviewed in some detail. RESULTS: Rights violations in Para and non-disabled sport illustrate both individual and organizational vulnerabilities. Individual- and organizational-level drivers of abuse, as well as various modes and types of abuse observed in Para sport, are relevant in all sport settings and should be centered in global sport safeguarding work. The rights-based core of Para and similar sports movements, exemplifies this. CONCLUSION: From a Para-informed vantage point, we issue a call to action, where interpersonal violence in sport is reduced by leveraging relevant elements of the Paralympic Movement. This call asks all sport participants to reject a purely capitalist approach to sport and follow a Para sport paradigm; which embodies human achievement (including sporting success), reflects human rights and inherent human dignity, and requires a higher standard of behaviour.","output":"Safeguarding Reimagined: Centering Athletes Rights and Repositioning Para Sport to Chart a New Path"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Agent-based models (ABMs) are one of the main sources of evidence for decisions regarding mitigation and suppression measures against the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Gastroenterology higher specialty training is soon to be reduced from 5 years to 4. The British Society of Gastroenterology Trainees Section biennial survey aims to delineate the impact of COVID-19 on training and the opinions on changes to training. METHODS: An electronic survey allowing for anonymised responses at the point of completion was distributed to all gastroenterology trainees from September to November 2020. RESULTS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 71.0% of the respondents stated that more than 50% of their clinical time was mostly within general internal medicine. Trainees reported a significant impact on all aspects of their gastroenterology training due to lost training opportunities and increasing service commitments. During the first wave, 88.5% of the respondents reported no access to endoscopy training lists. Since this time, 66.2% of the respondents stated that their endoscopy training lists had restarted. This has resulted in fewer respondents achieving endoscopy accreditation. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused 42.2% of the respondents to consider extending their training to obtain the skills required to complete training. Furthermore, 10.0% of the respondents reported concerns of a delay to completion of training. The majority of respondents (84.2%) reported that they would not feel ready to be a consultant after 4 years of training. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in all aspects of gastroenterology training were reported. This is mirrored in anticipated concerns about completion of training in a shorter training programme as proposed in the new curriculum.

The aptasensor design was based on rolling circle amplification (RCA) technology and the use of self-assembled copper nanoparticles (CuNPs). A dual-function (DF) probe, capable of binding to circular DNA and an aptamer, was designed and immobilized on a COC-bottom 96-well plate. An aptamer was used for selective recognition of DZN, and the specific site of the aptamer that strongly reacted with DZN was successfully identified using circular dichroism (CD) analysis. In presence of DZN, the aptamer and DZN formed a strong complex, thus providing an opportunity for hybridization of the DF probe and circular DNA, thereby initiating an RCA reaction. Repetitive poly thymine (T) sequence with a length of 30-mer, generated in the RCA reaction, served as a template for the synthesis of fluorescent copper nanoparticles, emitting an orange fluorescence signal (at approximately 620 nm) proportional to the amount of RCA product, within 10 min under UV irradiation. The CuNP fluorescence was imaged and quantified using an image analysis software. A linear correlation of the fluorescence signal was confirmed in the DZN concentration range of 0.1C3 ppm, with a detection limit of 0.15 ppm. Adoption of a label-free detection method, utilizing RCA and fluorescent CuNPs on COC substrates, reduced the need for complex equipment and requirements for DZN analysis, thereby representing a simple and rapid sensing method circumventing the limitations of current complex and labor-intensive methods.

Increased tissue damage coincided with sustained brain stem infection, foci of microglia infection in grey matter, and increased apoptotic cells. These data demonstrate a novel protective role for RNase L in viral induced CNS encephalomyelitis, which is not reflected in overall viral control or propagation of IFN-/ mediated signals.

Data collected included PLIS on admission, demographics, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, and patient outcomes. The primary outcome was the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients and 293 PLIS studies were included in our analysis. The mean age was 60.9, and overall mortality was 18.3%. Median PLIS score was 5.0 (3.0C6.0) vs. 2.0 (1.0C3.0) in ICU and non-ICU patients respectively (p<0.001). Total PLIS scores were directly associated with SOFA scores (inter-class correlation 0.63, p<0.001), and multivariate analysis showed that every increase in one PLIS point was associated with a higher risk for ICU admission (O.R 2.09, 95% C.I 1.59C2.75) and in-hospital mortality (O.R 1.54, 95% C.I 1.10C2.16). CONCLUSIONS: The PLIS for COVID-19 patients is simple and associated with SOFA score, ICU admission, and in-hospital mortality. Further studies are needed to demonstrate whether the PLIS can improve outcomes and become an integral part of the management of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Point of Care Lung Ultrasound Injury ScoreA simple and reliable assessment tool in COVID-19 patients (PLIS I): A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ISSUE: The 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) underscored the importance of rapid recognition and isolation of patients with highly communicable diseases to prevent nosocominal spread to other patients, staff, and visitors. The SARS issue and a recent outbreak of measles in New York City (NYC) highlighted the need for EDs to have effective measures to rapidly triage and isolate patients with potentially communicable illnesses. PROJECT: A multidisciplinary team at a NYC hospital developed a screening and isolation protocol in collaboration with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Education and training was provided through classroom instruction using a train the trainer format. This training included a power point presentation along with interactive case scenarios. Pre and post tests, and a series of unannounced drills were used to evaluate the process. RESULTS: Ninety percent of registered nurses, 67% of emergency medical physicians, 82% of emergency service assistants, 63% of patient access workers and 73% of social workers in the ED were in-serviced. Patient access workers failed to follow the quick registration process for patients presenting with a cough. The triage nurse was able to isolate the patient based on symptoms and travel history, and knew the appropriate mask to be worn by the patient versus the medical staff. However, basic infection control including hand hygiene was not consistently practiced. Personal Protective Equipment was not readily available in the triage area. LESSONS LEARNED: Although a large proportion of the ED staff received training, breaches in basic infection control were observed. Consistency of educational in-service was difficult to assure using the train the trainer format. Increased involvement of Infection Control Professionals is needed to help translate education into practice, and to improve compliance with procedures.","output":"Development of a Screening and Isolation Protocol for Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with Communicable Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The way the pandemic changed cyberbullying tells us how to reduce it in the future, say Alexandra Martiniuk and Joseph Freeman","output":"Digital tyranny"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the bulk and shear elastic properties of barely-compressed, \\"athermal\\" emulsions and find that the rigidity of the jammed solid fails at remarkably large critical osmotic pressures.

Eating disorders represent a complex pathology defined by an imbalance between hunger and satiety, installed in an emotional, traumatic, or conflictive context. Recently, the emphasis regarding ED is focused on the link between genetics, mental pathology, and the somatic and metabolic phenotype and early detection. Early detection and intervention can assure a better recovery and can improve a lot the quality of life of these patients. Methods: We selected ten articles of central importance on the topic in a systematic search on eight databases, articles selected on the type of scales, and size of the study. Results: We identified eight questionnaire scales used in large trials in ED disorders in the scanned literature, choose because we consider it the most accurate and the ones that evaluate best the pathology and the elements that are important as specific traits in ED. There are interview-type scales and self-administered scales. Interview scales are characterized by assessments of symptoms and diagnosis, while self-administered assess particular traits and the possibility of further development of eating disorders. The majority of the scales evaluated were described and used in adult populations. From all the scales assessed and analyzed, only three are described at the child population Cit is EAT-26 (>16 years), EDI-3 (>13 years), and ANSOCQ (>13 years). Conclusions: It is essential to develop specific scales for people under 18 years of age, given the increasing incidence of ED among children and the need for early detection and appropriate intervention. Early detection of ED in children implies a simple and accurate evaluation at the primary care level or in schools, as the course of the disease can be subclinical for several years.

The study of loneliness among young adults has become increasingly important considering the current state of isolation and stay-at-home orders issued to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Preliminary reports suggest an increase in loneliness as a result of the current health pandemic, especially among young adults, who have reported feeling lonelier than any other age group. Such findings warrant the study of ways to help reduce loneliness among young adults. The current study examined the efficacy of strategies that might be used to help young adults manage feelings of loneliness. Two hundred and seventy-eight young adults completed the study. Participants read one of four messages: mindfulness, social cognitions, coping behaviors, or a control. Participants in the mindfulness condition felt better equipped to manage future instances of loneliness and held better attitudes toward this intervention.

Hospital systems across the world have been over-extended, including in Northern Italy, Ecuador, and New York City, and many other systems face similar challenges. As a result, decisions on how to best allocate very limited medical resources have come to the forefront. Specifically, under consideration are decisions on who to test, who to admit into hospitals, who to treat in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who to support with a ventilator. Given todays ability to gather, share, analyze and process data, personalized predictive models based on demographics and information regarding prior conditions can be used to (1) help decision-makers allocate limited resources, when needed, (2) advise individuals how to better protect themselves given their risk profile, (3) differentiate social distancing guidelines based on risk, and (4) prioritize vaccinations once a vaccine becomes available. OBJECTIVE: To develop personalized models that predict the following events: (1) hospitalization, (2) mortality, (3) need for ICU, and (4) need for a ventilator. To predict hospitalization, it is assumed that one has access to a patients basic preconditions, which can be easily gathered without the need to be at a hospital. For the remaining models, different versions developed include different sets of a patients features, with some including information on how the disease is progressing (e.g., diagnosis of pneumonia). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a publicly available repository, updated daily, containing information from approximately 91,000 patients in Mexico were used. The data for each patient include demographics, prior medical conditions, SARS-CoV-2 test results, hospitalization, mortality and whether a patient has developed pneumonia or not. Several classification methods were applied, including robust versions of logistic regression, and support vector machines, as well as random forests and gradient boosted decision trees. RESULTS: Interpretable methods (logistic regression and support vector machines) perform just as well as more complex models in terms of accuracy and detection rates, with the additional benefit of elucidating variables on which the predictions are based. Classification accuracies reached 61%, 76%, 83%, and 84% for predicting hospitalization, mortality, need for ICU and need for a ventilator, respectively. The analysis reveals the most important preconditions for making the predictions. For the four models derived, these are: (1) for hospitalization: age, gender, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes, immunosuppression; (2) for mortality: age, SARS-CoV-2 test status, immunosuppression and pregnancy; (3) for ICU need: development of pneumonia (if available), cardiovascular disease, asthma, and SARS-CoV-2 test status; and (4) for ventilator need: ICU and pneumonia (if available), age, gender, cardiovascular disease, obesity, pregnancy, and SARS-CoV-2 test result.","output":"Personalized Predictive Models for Symptomatic COVID-19 Patients Using Basic Preconditions: Hospitalizations, Mortality, and the Need for an ICU or Ventilator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology forecasting is a preliminary step in understanding social change.

During follow\\\\up (median 26.1 months), 15 episodes led to death (30.6%). An aetiologic diagnosis was made by non\\\\invasive tests in 24 episodes (49.0%) and by adding bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lung biopsy in 7 episodes with diagnostic yield (77.8%, P = .001). Thus, a specific diagnosis was obtained in 63.3% of the episodes. Aetiology identification and treatment modification after diagnosis did not decrease mortality (P = .057, P = .481). However, the number of organ dysfunctions at the beginning of PI was higher in the mortality group, compared to the survivor group (1.7  1.2 vs 0.32  0.59; P = .001).

Based on the clinical observation of low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we examined and identified a toxin-like amino acid (aa) sequence in the Receptor Binding Domain of the Spike Glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (aa 375C390), which is homologous to a sequence of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1, one of the many snake venom toxins that are known to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We present the 3D structural location of this toxin-like sequence on the Spike Glycoprotein and the superposition of the modelled structure of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1 and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. We also performed computational molecular modelling and docking experiments using 3D structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the extracellular domain of the nAChR 9 subunit. We identified a main interaction between the aa 381C386 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the aa 189C192 of the extracellular domain of the nAChR 9 subunit, a region which forms the core of the toxin-binding site of the nAChRs. The mode of interaction is very similar to the interaction between the 9 nAChR and -bungarotoxin. A similar interaction was observed between the pentameric 7 AChR chimera and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. The findings raise the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with nAChRs, supporting the hypothesis of dysregulation of the nicotinic cholinergic system being implicated in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Nicotine and other nicotinic cholinergic agonists may protect nAChRs and thus have therapeutic value in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Nicotinic Cholinergic System and COVID-19: In Silico Identification of an Interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and Nicotinic Receptors with Potential Therapeutic Targeting Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US government should end the shortage of the antiviral drug remdesivir by eliminating Gileads monopoly, says a report from Public Citizen, a national non-profit organisation that represents consumers interests 1 Remdesivir, an unapproved investigational drug that is used in patients with severe covid-19, is in short supply and rationed Doctors and politicians at a press conference on 8 September called on the Trump administration to use existing laws to increase supplies of the drug by ending Gileads monopoly This would allow other companies to make generic versions of the drug and permit imports of generic versions from foreign manufacturers Gilead would earn licensing fees from generic manufacturers Gilead has licensed some generic manufacturers to sell remdesivir in low and middle income countries, but the agreements are narrow and limited, says ","output":"Covid-19: US should end Gileads monopoly on producing remdesivir, report says"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CCR5 (R5)-tropic, but not CXCR4 (X4)-tropic, HIV-1 is associated with primary HIV-1 infection and transmission. Recent studies have shown that IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, including IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, restrict a broad range of viruses. Here, we demonstrate that an IFITM2 isoform (20 IFITM2) lacking 20 amino acids at the N terminus differentially restricts X4 and R5 HIV-1. 20 IFITM2 suppresses replication of X4 HIV-1 strains by inhibiting their entry. High levels of 20 IFITM2 expression could be detected in CD4+ T cells and in monocytes. Infection of X4 viruses in monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells is enhanced upon depletion of IFITM2 isoforms. Furthermore, we also show that coreceptor use is the determining factor for differential HIV-1 restriction of 20 IFITM2. When we replace the C terminus of CCR5 with the C terminus of CXCR4, R5 viruses become more susceptible to 20 IFITM2-mediated restriction. In contrast to previous studies, our research reveals that neither X4 nor R5 HIV-1 is suppressed by IFITM2 and IFITM3.

First, Calvin's manifold personal crises in the 16th-century context were explored historically. Subsequently, modern missiologists and historians' views were critically engaged to ascertain how we could properly interpret the Reformers' missionary vision without drawing oversimplified and anachronistic conclusions. The widespread misrepresentations that often downplay the Reformers' resilient missionary vision were invalidated by explicating their lucid mission-mindedness during their time. It is indicated that much can be learned from their identity and practices as missionary pastors expanding the mission through pastoral care. The current COVID-19 pandemic and its deep impact present the global church with an opportunity to recommit itself to its essential missionary calling. Although Calvin or his colleagues did not create a complete theology of mission, the conclusion was made (through a thorough literature study and primary sources investigation) that their whole theology and Christian life had a missionary core. This challenges churches from a Reformed background today to critically reclaim their tradition and to mould their future missional identity from the roots up, crises and all. Contribution: The lack of attention to John Calvin and his company of pastors' mission minded theology and practice presents a contemporary challenge to the field of mission studies. This article expounded the often overlooked significance of the Reformers' essentially missionary theology and practice.

From all forms of violence, ~ 1.3 million people worldwide die each year, accounting for 2.5% of global mortality. During the COVID-19 crisis, control and prevention measures have brought women and potential perpetrators together which increase the risk of IPV. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the magnitude and associated factors of IPV against women during COVID-19 in Ethiopia. METHODS: Community based cross-section study was employed among 462 reproductive-age women to assess IPV and associated factors during COVID-19 pandemic. To select study participants one-stage cluster sampling technique was used. The data were entered into Epi data version 4.2 and exported to SPSS for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was used to check the association of dependent and independent variables and statistical significance was declared at P < 0.05. RESULT: A total of 448 study subjects were responded making a response rate of 96.97%. Two- third (67.6%) of the respondent's age range was between 20 and 29 years. All of the participants heard about the pandemic of COVID-19 at the time of onset. The lifetime and the last twelve months prevalence of women with IPV was 42.19% and 24.11%, respectively. About 58 (12.9%) had experienced all three types of violence.

Yet, concerns remain about durability of TLD with high circulating resistance to 3TC and TDF and metabolic abnormalities observed in clinical trials. Limited programmatic data are available to describe the success of the TLD transition in the region. Methods: We established the DISCO cohort to quantify viral suppression and regimen tolerability during the TLD transition. We prospectively enrolled adults from public clinics in Uganda and South Africa who had been on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART for 6 months and were programmatically switched to TLD. We obtained demographics, medical history data, and plasma specimens at enrollment and week 24. We conducted retrospective HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) testing using the Cepheid GeneXpert platform. Though both sites were interrupted by COVID-19, here we report complete week 24 results for the Uganda cohort. Results: We enrolled 500 participants (41% female) in Uganda. Median age was 47 years (IQR 40-53). Median ART duration was 8.8 years (IQR 5.7-12.2). The most common regimens prior to TLD switch were 3TC/TDF/efavirenz (44%) and 3TC/zidovudine/nevirapine (39%). Retrospective VL testing demonstrated that 95% (475/499) had VL &lt;50 copies/mL, 4% (19/499) had VL 50-1,000 copies/ mL, and 1% (5/499) had VL &gt;1,000 copies/mL at enrollment. 90% (448/500) completed week 24 visits, with 50 additional visits delayed during COVID-19, 1 disenrollment, and 1 death. By week 24, 1% (6/448) discontinued TLD due to side effects or clinician discretion. At week 24, 96% (432/448) had VL &lt;50 copies/mL, 3% (12/448) had VL 50-1,000 copies/mL, and 1% (4/448) had VL &gt;1,000 copies/mL. Of those with week 24 VL &gt;50 copies/mL, 31% (5/16) had detectable VL &gt;50 copies/mL at enrollment, versus 3% (15/431) in those with suppressed VL at week 24 (2 p-value&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The great majority of participants transitioned to TLD with an undetectable VL. Overall, we documented 86% suppression at week 24 after TLD switch in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and 96% suppression in those completing a week 24 visit. These data support early tolerability and efficacy of TLD transition in the public sector. However, detectable VL at switch predicted detectable VL at 24 weeks.

These patients were compared with consecutive STEMI patients admitted during the corresponding period in 2018 who had been prospectively documented in the Israeli bi-annual National Acute Coronary Syndrome Survey. The primary end-point was defined as a composite of malignant arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and/or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included individual components of primary outcome, cardiogenic shock, mechanical complications, electrical complications, re-infarction, stroke, and pericarditis. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 1466 consecutive acute MI patients, of whom 774 (53%) were hospitalized during the Covid-19 outbreak. Overall, 841 patients were diagnosed with STEMI: 424 (50.4%) during the Covid-19 era and 417 (49.6%) during the parallel period in 2018. Although STEMI patients admitted during the Covid-19 period had fewer co-morbidities, they presented with a higher Killip class (p value = .03).

During the first emergency phase of the epidemic, RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, which is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, exhibited limitations due to availability of reagents and budget constraints. This stressed the need to develop screening procedures that require fewer resources and are suitable to be extended to larger portions of the population. RT-qPCR on pooled samples from individual NP swabs seems to be a promising technique to improve surveillance. We performed preliminary experimental analyses aimed to investigate the performance of pool testing on samples with low viral load and we evaluated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations alternative screening protocols based on sample pooling, tailored to contexts characterized by different infection prevalence. We focused on the role of pool size and the opportunity to develop strategies that take advantage of natural clustering structures in the population, e.g. families, school classes, hospital rooms. Despite the use of a limited number of specimens, our results suggest that, while high viral load samples seem to be detectable even in a pool with 29 negative samples, positive specimens with low viral load may be masked by the negative samples, unless smaller pools are used. The results of MC simulations confirm that pool testing is useful in contexts where the infection prevalence is low. The gain of pool testing in saving resources can be very high, and can be optimized by selecting appropriate group sizes. Exploiting natural groups makes the definition of larger pools convenient and potentially overcomes the issue of low viral load samples by increasing the probability of identifying more than one positive in the same pool.","output":"Pool testing on random and natural clusters of individuals: Optimisation of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in the presence of low viral load samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a rare inherited disease causing sudden cardiac death (SCD) Copy number variants (CNVs) can contribute to disease susceptibility, but their role in Brugada syndrome (BrS) is unknown We aimed to identify a CNV associated with BrS and elucidated its clinical implications METHODS: We enrolled 335 unrelated BrS patients from 2000 to 2018 in the Taiwanese population Microarray and exome sequencing were used for discovery phase whereas Sanger sequencing was used for the validation phase HEK cells and zebrafish were used to characterize the function of the CNV variant FINDINGS: A copy number deletion of GSTM3 (chr1:109737011-109737301, hg38) containing the eighth exon and the transcription stop codon was observed in 23 9% of BrS patients versus 0 8% of 15,829 controls in Taiwan Biobank (P &lt;0 001), and 0% in gnomAD Co-segregation analysis showed that the co-segregation rate was 20% Patch clamp experiments showed that in an oxidative stress environment, GSTM3 down-regulation leads to a significant decrease of cardiac sodium channel current amplitude Ventricular arrhythmia incidence was significantly greater in gstm3 knockout zebrafish at baseline and after flecainide, but was reduced after quinidine, consistent with clinical observations BrS patients carrying the GSTM3 deletion had higher rates of sudden cardiac arrest and syncope compared to those without (OR: 3 18 (1 77-5 74), P&lt;0 001;OR: 1 76 (1 02-3 05), P = 0 04, respectively) INTERPRETATION: This GSTM3 deletion is frequently observed in BrS patients and is associated with reduced INa, pointing to this as a novel potential genetic modifier/risk predictor for the development of the electrocardiographic and arrhythmic manifestations of BrS FUNDING: This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (107-2314-B-002-261-MY3 to J M J Juang), and by grants HL47678, HL138103 and HL152201 from the National Institutes of Health to CA","output":"GSTM3 variant is a novel genetic modifier in Brugada syndrome, a disease with risk of sudden cardiac death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Manaus, Brazil, resurged in late 2020 despite previously high levels of infection.

The information presented includes the actions carried out, the incidence of COVID-19 in HD patients and in health personnel, clinical characteristics and the result of a screening of all patients from the HD unit. At the beginning, we had 90 HD patients: 37 (41.1%) had COVID-19, of which 17 (45.9%) were diagnosed by symptoms detected in the triage or during the HD session, and 15 (40.5%) were diagnosed in a subsequent screening of patients in whom the diagnostic test by PCR-SARS-CoV-2 had not been done previously. The most frequent symptom was fever, 50% presented lymphopenia and in 18.4% the O2 saturation was <95%. Hospital admission was required in 16 patients (43.2%) and 6 died (16.2%). We found that contagion was clustered in turns of HD sessions and also in patients using collective transportation. Out of the 44 staff personnel, 15 (34%) presented compatible symptoms and 4 (9%) had SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by PCR performed by the personnel health service, 9 (20%) required some transitory sick leave (TSL) and 5 were considered probable cases of Covid-19. Conclusions We detected a high prevalence of COVID-19 with a high percentage being diagnosed by screening and therefore it is necessary to be proactive in the diagnosis to stop the pandemic.

Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. METHODS: We analysed the speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States and Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19. We used an inductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language and content. FINDINGS: Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19, made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women spoke more frequently about the impact on the individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including: mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their populations. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe COVID-19 and the response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. CONCLUSION: While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This analysis provides additional evidence on the differences in political leaders' messages and priorities to inspire citizens' adhesion to the social contract in the adoption of response and recovery measures. However, it does not consider the influence of contexts, such as the public audience, on leaders' strategic communication approaches.","output":"Words matter: political and gender analysis of speeches made by heads of government during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 outbreak, health workers, especially nurses, are vulnerable to potential psychological symptoms such as anxiety, which can prevent nurses from carrying out their role as caregivers in health services (Lai et al., 2020;Shanafelt et al., 2020).

The partial immunity already offered by the first dose and the high levels of uncertainty in the vaccine supplies have been characteristic of most of the vaccines used worldwide and made the planning of such a vaccination campaign extremely complex. Motivated by this compelling challenge, we propose a stochastic optimization framework for optimally scheduling a two-dose vaccination campaign in the presence of uncertain supplies, taking into account constraints on the time that should elapse between the two doses and on the capacity of the healthcare system. The proposed framework seeks to maximize the vaccination coverage, considering the different levels of immunization obtained with partial (one dose only) and complete vaccination (two doses). We cast the optimization problem as a convex second-order cone program, which can be efficiently solved through numerical techniques. We demonstrate the potential of our framework on a case study calibrated on the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy.

Significant challenges lie in identifying the selective inhibitor for the ATP binding site as this region is highly conserved in all protein kinases. Molecular docking coupled with molecular dynamics simulation and free energy of binding calculations (MMPBSA/MMGBSA) were used to identify the potent competitive ATP binding site inhibitors. All the four proteins were docked against the library of drug-like compounds and the outcomes of the docking study were further analyzed by Molecular dynamics (total of 6s) and MMPB/GBSA techniques. Five different inhibitors for structurally distant protein kinases, i.e. CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK5 are identified with the binding energy (Gbind-PB) in the range -18.24 to -28.43Kcal/mol. Mechanistic complexities associated with the binding of the inhibitor are unraveled by carefully analyzing the MD trajectories.

This study aims to investigate nurses, doctors, and families perceptions on the project. Methods: Using the pilot project database and perception survey data, this study provides a description of the satisfaction, re-participation motivation, and experiences of nurses, doctors, and families. Results: Tele-consultation for home-visit nursing was used to monitor health conditions and problems, such as pain and blood pressure, or health counseling for home-care beneficiaries. The beneficiaries' families showed higher levels of satisfaction than the service providers. Nurses and doctors had relatively positive perceptions about the usefulness of sharing information about beneficiaries, timeliness of providing nursing care, and convenience of communication. Meanwhile, nurses and doctors had negative perceptions of the sufficiency and accuracy of information obtained from tele-consultation, implying the necessity of adopting more advanced ICTs. Conclusion: This study suggests what must be considered when designing a tele-consultation service model in long-term care settings, especially in the home-visit nursing care setting. Innovative approaches using ICTs should be taken to improve home-visit nursing care quality in the era of super-aging and COVID-19. ? 2021 Korean Gerontological Nursing Society.","output":"An empirical study on tele-consultation in home-visit nursing care setting under korean long-term care insurance system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In recent times, myriads of public have been infected with a novel SARS-CoV-2, and the fatality toll has reached thousands and been mounting step by step, which is a major crisis in the world. The challenge for this burning issue pertinent to repurposed medicines which prevent novel coronavirus is of immense concern for all scientists around the globe until the arrival of the vaccine. METHODS: Because of the global high priority rating on the search for the repurposed drugs which outfits clinical suitability to SARS-CoV-2, a unique theoretical methodology is proposed. The approach is based on explorations of biothermodynamics computed via molecular dynamics, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg) and interactions. This unique methodology is tested for umifenovir/dexamethasone drugs on (SARS-CoV-2) main protease. RESULTS: This theoretical exploration not only suggested the presence of strong interactions between (SARS-CoV-2 + umifenovir/dexamethasone) but also emphasized the clinical suitability of dexamethasone over umifenovir to treat SARS-CoV-2. This supremacy of dexamethasone is well supported by the results of global clinical trials and COVID-19 therapeutic approved management guidelines of countries. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this work will pave a way for incremental advancement towards future design and development of more specific inhibitors for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.","output":"Target SARS-CoV-2: computation of binding energies with drugs of dexamethasone/umifenovir by molecular dynamics using OPLS-AA force field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The substantial economic burden of work-related injury and illness, borne by workers, employers and social security programmes, is primarily attributed to the durations of work disability among workers whose recovery requires a period of absence from work, with the majority of costs arising from the minority of workers with the longest duration absences. The objective of the Ontario Life After Workplace Injury Study is to describe the long-term health and labour market outcomes of workers disabled by work injury or illness after they are no longer receiving benefits or services from the work disability insurance authority. PARTICIPANTS: Workers disabled by a work-related injury or illness were recruited from a sample frame of disability benefit claimants with oversampling of claimants with longer benefit durations. Characteristics of workers, their employers and claimant benefits were obtained from baseline administrative data. Interviews completed at 18 months post injury (T1) and to be completed at 36 months (T2) measure return-to-work and work status; income; physical and mental health; case manager and healthcare provider interactions and employer accommodations supporting return-to-work and sociodemographic characteristics. Of eligible claimants, 40% (1132) participated in the T1 interview, with 96% consenting to participate in the T2 interview. FINDINGS TO DATE: Preliminary descriptive analyses of T1 data have been completed. The median age was 50 years and 56% were male. At 18 months following injury, 61% were employed by their at-injury employer, 16% had changed employment and 23% were not working. Past-year prescription opioid use was prevalent (34%), as was past-year cannabis use (31%). Longer duration claimants had poorer function, recovery and health and more adverse labour market outcomes.

To date, online learning has been considered a useful additional didactic tool. This study aimed to compare veterinary students' performance in radiographic anatomy (radio-anatomy) after online or classroom-based teaching to assess the extent to which the two methods were interchangeable. Three strategies were compared in a cohort of 83 learners. Students were committed to online learning only, online learning with the use of specimen equine bones, or learning on conventional radiographs with specimen equine bones. At baseline (pre-test), scores from a mental rotation test and radio-anatomy knowledge test were similar between groups. After training (post-test), scores in mental rotation and radio-anatomy significantly increased by 6.7/40 units (95% CI: 5.2-8.2; p < .001) and 5.1/20 units (95% CI: 4.3-5.9; p < .001), respectively. There was no difference in scores for mental rotation and radio-anatomy knowledge between groups at post-test. Gender influenced the mental rotation, with men scoring significantly higher than women at pre-test (M = 23.0, SD = 8.8 vs. M = 16.5, SD = 6.9; p = .001) and post-test (M = 32.1, SD = 5.5 vs. M = 22.7, SD = 8.6; p < .001). However, radio-anatomy knowledge was not influenced by gender. These results suggest radio-anatomy teaching can be safely achieved with either conventional radiographs or online resources.

Inflammation plays a prominent role in the development of tendon pathologies, and advances in understanding the underlying mechanisms during the inflammatory state have provided additional insights into its potential role in tendon disorders. Different cell compartments, in combination with secreted immune modulators, have shown to control and modulate the inflammatory response during tendinopathies. Stromal compartment represented by tenocytes has shown to display an important role in orchestrating the inflammatory response during tendon injuries due to the interplay they exhibit with the immune-sensing and infiltrating compartments, which belong to resident and recruited immune cells. The use of stem cells or their derived secretomes within the regenerative medicine field might represent synergic new therapeutical approaches that can be used to tune the reaction of immune cells within the damaged tissues. To this end, promising opportunities are headed to the stimulation of macrophages polarization towards anti-inflammatory phenotype together with the recruitment of stem cells, that possess immunomodulatory properties, able to infiltrate within the damaged tissues and improve tendinopathies resolution. Indeed, the comprehension of the interactions between tenocytes or stem cells with the immune cells might considerably modulate the immune reaction solving hence the inflammatory response and preventing fibrotic tissue formation.

This led early workers to question the extent to which the CNS is privy to non-visual sensory input from the periphery and to suggest that it has limited capacity to finely control arm movement [3-5]. This conclusion seemed reasonable considering the size of the PNS and the results of early behavioral tests [3, 6-8].

Viruses are exhaled by infected people into respiratory particles with sizes less than 50 microns (microdroplets) that are suspended in the air (aerosols) and can be transported to distances greater than 2 meters within a closed room, such as classrooms. Therefore, in closed school environments, the conditions of occupation and ventilation are essential to determine and minimize the risk of transmission of the virus.

Lack of high-quality evidence on the respiratory management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure (C-ARF) has resulted in wide variation in clinical practice. METHODS: Using a Delphi process, an international panel of 39 experts developed clinical practice statements on the respiratory management of C-ARF in areas where evidence is absent or limited. Agreement was defined as achieved when > 70% experts voted for a given option on the Likert scale statement or > 80% voted for a particular option in multiple-choice questions. Stability was assessed between the two concluding rounds for each statement, using the non-parametric Chi-square ((2)) test (p < 005 was considered as unstable). RESULTS: Agreement was achieved for 27 (73%) management strategies which were then used to develop expert clinical practice statements. Experts agreed that COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is clinically similar to other forms of ARDS. The Delphi process yielded strong suggestions for use of systemic corticosteroids for critical COVID-19; awake self-proning to improve oxygenation and high flow nasal oxygen to potentially reduce tracheal intubation; non-invasive ventilation for patients with mixed hypoxemic-hypercapnic respiratory failure; tracheal intubation for poor mentation, hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia; closed suction systems; lung protective ventilation; prone ventilation (for 16C24 h per day) to improve oxygenation; neuromuscular blocking agents for patient-ventilator dyssynchrony; avoiding delay in extubation for the risk of reintubation; and similar timing of tracheostomy as in non-COVID-19 patients.

In addition, it has been shown in some individuals that viral genome can be detected up to 3 months after symptom resolution. We investigated both seroconversion and PCR positivity in a large cohort of convalescent serum donors in the New York City (NY, USA) region. Methods: In this observational study, we ran an outreach programme in the New York City area. We recruited participants via the REDCap (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA) online survey response. Individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened via PCR for presence of viral genome and via ELISA for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies. One-way ANOVA and Fisher's exact test were used to measure the association of age, gender, symptom duration, and days from symptom onset and resolution with positive antibody results. Findings: Between March 26 and April 10, 2020, we measured SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres in 1343 people.

Successful transplantations require immense training of healthcare professionals, fast retrieval services, pre- and postoperative care of patients, intensive care management, life-long follow-up and management of patients. Organ transplant surgery is a life-changing moment for a patient. Ultimately, commissioning groups, clinicians and managers need to work together, evaluate the changes required and enact thorough business plans to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed. Together with increasing the awareness of organ donation within the public, the government needs to support the NHS to fund, train and manage transplant centres to welcome this much-awaited 'opt-out' organ donation law in England successfully.","output":"The new 'opt-out' organ donation English law: Is the NHS ready for this?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The clinical features of COVID-19 were mentioned in previous studies. However, risk factors for COVID-19 are not fully recognized. The aim of this study is to characterize risk factors and clinical features of COVID-19 disease in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A retrospective, chart-review, case-control study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data on patients diagnosed between March 18 and May 18, 2020 were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: We reviewed medical records on 297 suspected cases of COVID-19. Of these, 175 (59%) tested positive for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and considered as cases, while 122 (41%) tested negative and considered as control. COVID-19 positive cases were more likely to be males, and non-health care providers. Hypertension (15%), diabetes (10%) and two or more concurrent comorbidities (54.4%) were more prevalent among COVID-19 patients. Patients presented with fever, cough, and loss of taste/smell were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (P = 0.001, 0.008, 0.008; respectively). Radiological evidence of pneumonia was associated with confirmed COVID-19 disease (P = 0.001). Shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with the risk of COVID-19 at presentation. On admission, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets were significantly lower among COVID-19 patients compared with controls. Surprisingly, D-Dimer levels were lower among COVID-19 positive patients when compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Male gender, hypertension, and diabetes are the most commonly observed risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

AIM: The study was performed to describe the changes in hospital admissions during the first phase of the pandemic. METHODS: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health established a national preparedness register with daily updates on COVID-19 cases and the use of health services. We used individual-level information on inpatients from the electronic journal systems for all hospitals in Norway to estimate daily hospital admissions. RESULTS: Before the onset of the pandemic in March, there was an average of 2400 inpatient admissions per day in Norway, which decreased to approximately 1500 in the first few days after lockdown measures were implemented. The relative magnitudes of the decreases were similar in men and women and across all age groups. The decreases were substantial for both elective (54%) and emergency (29%) inpatient care. The admission rate gradually increased and reached pre-pandemic levels in June. However, the reductions in admissions for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease seemed to persist. CONCLUSIONS: The elective and emergency inpatient admission rates were substantially reduced a few days after the pandemic response measures were implemented. The ways in which the lack or postponement of care may have affected the health and well-being of patients is an important issue to be addressed in future research.","output":"Admissions to Norwegian Hospitals during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of August 06, 2020, 18.9 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 and more than 711,000 deaths have been reported. As per available data, 80% of the patients experience mild disease, 20% need hospital admission, and about 5% require intensive care. To date, several modes of transmission such as droplet, contact, airborne, blood borne, and fomite have been described as plausible. Several studies have demonstrated shedding of the virus from patients after being free from symptoms, i.e. prolonged virus shedding. While few studies demonstrated virus shedding in convalescent patients, i.e. those testing negative for presence of virus on nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, yet virus shedding was reported from other sources. Maximum duration of conversion time reported among the included studies was 60 days, while the least duration was 3 days. Viral shedding from sources other than nasopharynx and oropharynx, like stools, urine, saliva, semen, and tears, was reported. More number of studies described virus shedding from gastrointestinal tract (mainly in stools), while least a number of cases tested positive for the virus in tears. Prolonged viral shedding is important to consider while discontinuing isolation procedures and/or discharging SARS-CoV-2 patients. The risk of transmission varies in magnitude and depends on the infectivity of the shed virus in biological samples and the patient population involved. Clinical decision-making should be governed by clinical scenario, guidelines, detectable viral load, source of detectable virus, infectivity, and patient-related factors.","output":"A Review of Viral Shedding in Resolved and Convalescent COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Vaccination against the COVID\\\\19 virus began in December 2020 in the UK and into Spring 2021 has been running at 5% population/week. High levels of social restrictions were implemented for the third time in January 2021 to control the second wave and resulting increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Easing those restrictions must balance multiple challenging priorities, weighing the risk of more deaths and hospitalisations against damage done to mental health, incomes and standards of living, education and provision of non\\\\Covid\\\\19 healthcare. METHODS: Weekly and monthly officially published data for 2020/21 were used to estimate the influence of seasonality and social restrictions on the spread of COVID\\\\19 by age group, on the economy and on healthcare services. These factors were combined with the estimated impact of vaccinations and immunity from past infections into a model that retrospectively reflected the actual numbers of reported deaths closely both in 2020 and early 2021. The model was applied prospectively to the next 6 months to evaluate the impact of different speeds of easing social restrictions. RESULTS: The results show vaccinations as significantly reducing the number of hospitalisations and deaths. The central estimate is that relative to rapid easing, the avoided loss of 57 000 life\\\\years from a strategy of relatively slow easing over the next several months comes at a cost in terms of GDP reduction of around 0.4 million/life\\\\year loss avoided. This is over 10 times higher than the usual limit the NHS uses for spending against Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved. Alternative assumptions for key factors affecting the spread of the virus give significantly different trade\\\\offs between costs and benefits of different speeds of easing. Disruption of non\\\\Covid\\\\19 Healthcare provision also increases in times of higher levels of social restrictions.

Identifying and quantifying the importance of these settings is critical for designing interventions.

Using these data, and a network model of people and places represented as a stochastic graph rewriting system, we estimated the relative contribution of transmission in households, schools and religious institutions to the epidemic, and the relative risk of infection in each of these settings. All congregate settings were important for transmission, with some such as primary schools and places of worship having a higher share of transmission than others. We found that the model needed a higher general-community transmission rate for women (3.3-fold), and lower susceptibility to infection in children to recreate the observed serological data. The precise share of transmission in each place was related to assumptions about the internal structure of those places.

Then the pandemic experienced an explosive growth and quickly peaked. In order to respond to the challenge, the Chinese government quickly built hospitals, adjusted the diagnosis and treatment systems, deployed medical staff to support areas affected by the epidemic, isolated and treated infected patients as much as possible, reminded citizens to use good protection, and controlled the epidemic step-by-step.

Abstract Background and objectives: Spain is in a situation of indefinite lockdown due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. One of the consequences of this lockdown is delays in medical and surgical procedures for common diseases. The aim of this study was to model the impact on survival of tumor growth caused by such delays in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma. Material and methods: Multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study. We constructed an exponential growth model for both SCC and melanoma to estimate tumor growth between patient-reported onset and surgical excision at different time points. Results: Data from 200 patients with SCC of the head and neck and 1000 patients with cutaneous melanoma were included. An exponential growth curve was calculated for each tumor type and we estimated tumor size after 1, 2, and 3 months of potential surgical delay. The proportion of patients with T3 SCC (diameter > 4 cm or thickness > 6 mm) increased from 41.5% (83 patients) in the initial study group to an estimated 58.5%, 70.5%, and 72% after 1, 2, and 3 months of delay. Disease-specific survival at 2, 5, and 10 years in patients whose surgery was delayed by 3 months decreased by 6.2%, 8.2%, and 5.2%, respectively. The proportion of patients with ultrathick melanoma (> 6 mm) increased from 6.9% in the initial study group to 21.9%, 30.2%, and 30.2% at 1, 2, and 3 months. Five- and 10-year disease-specific survival both decreased by 14.4% in patients treated after a potential delay of 3 months. Conclusions: In the absence of adequate diagnosis and treatment of SCC and melanoma in the current lockdown situation in Spain, we can expect to see to a considerable increase in large and thick SCCs and melanomas. Efforts must be taken to encourage self-examination and facilitate access to dermatologists in order to prevent further delays.","output":"Estimacin del efecto en el tama?o y la supervivencia de los tumores cutneos debido al confinamiento por COVID-19: Modelo basado en un crecimiento exponencial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A potential siRNA carrier for pulmonary gene delivery was assessed by encapsulating siRNA into biodegradable polyester nanoparticles consisting of tertiary-amine-modified polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) backbones grafted to poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA).

In vitro knockdown of firefly luciferase reporter gene was used to assess the potential of the nanoparticles as siRNA carriers in a human lung epithelial cell line, H1299 luc. The amine-modified-PVACPLGA/siRNA nanoparticles form 150C200 nm particles with zeta-potentials of + 15C+ 20 mV in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).

METHODS: A total of 3902 ESCC patients treated at 10 Chinese institutions between 2003 and 2013 were included, along with 2465 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The prognostic ability of the aforementioned algorithms was evaluated using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (tdROC) curves, R(2), Harrells concordance index (C-index), and the likelihood ratio chi-square score. The primary outcomes included cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), and CSS with a competing risk of death by non-ESCC causes. RESULTS: LODDS had better prognostic performance than pN or LNR in both continuous and stratified patterns. In the multicenter cohort, the multivariate analysis showed that the model based on LODDS classification was superior to the others in predictive accuracy and discriminatory capacity.

Three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (3D-STE) and cardiac imaging with (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) are two sophisticated techniques for the assessment of left ventricular (LV) deformation and sympathetic innervation, respectively, which offer important prognostic information in patients with heart failure (HF). The purpose of this investigation was to explore, in patients with systolic HF, the relationship between LV deformation assessed by 3D-STE and cardiac sympathetic derangement evaluated by (123)I-MIBG imaging. METHODS We prospectively studied 75 patients with systolic HF. All patients underwent a 3D-STE study (longitudinal, circumferential, area and radial) and (123)I-MIBG planar and SPECT cardiac imaging. RESULTS 3D-STE longitudinal, circumferential and area strain values were correlated with (123)I-MIBG late heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio and late SPECT total defect score. After stratification of the patients according to ischaemic or nonischaemic HF aetiology, we observed a good correlation of all 3D-STE measurements with late H/M ratio and SPECT data in the ischaemic group, but in patients with HF of nonischaemic aetiology, no correlation was found between LV deformation and cardiac sympathetic activity. At the regional level, the strongest correlation between LV deformation and adrenergic innervation was found for the left anterior descending coronary artery distribution territory for all four 3D-STE values. In multivariate linear regression analyses, including age, gender, LV ejection fraction, NYHA class, body mass index, heart rate and HF aetiology, only 3D-STE area and radial strain values significantly predicted cardiac sympathetic derangement on (123)I-MIBG late SPECT. CONCLUSION This study indicated that 3D-STE measurements are correlated with (123)I-MIBG planar and SPECT data. Furthermore, 3D-STE area and radial strain values, but not LVEF, predict cardiac sympathetic derangement in human postischaemic HF.","output":"Alterations of left ventricular deformation and cardiac sympathetic derangement in patients with systolic heart failure: a 3D speckle tracking echocardiography and cardiac 123I-MIBG study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral bronchiolitis is a relative contraindication to elective pediatric cardiac surgery.

COVID-19 vaccines may substantially reduce these risks, but evidence is needed of their effectiveness for incarcerated people, who are confined in large, risky congregate settings. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people in California prisons from December 22, 2020 through March 1, 2021. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provided daily data for all prison residents including demographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics, as well as COVID-19 testing, vaccination status, and outcomes. We estimated vaccine effectiveness using multivariable Cox models with time-varying covariates that adjusted for resident characteristics and infection rates across prisons. Findings Among 60,707 residents in the cohort, 49% received at least one BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 dose during the study period. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-82%) from day 14 after first dose until receipt of second dose and 97% (95% CI, 88-99%) from day 14 after second dose. Effectiveness was similar among the subset of residents who were medically vulnerable (74% [95% CI, 62-82%] and 92% [95% CI, 74-98%] from 14 days after first and second doses, respectively), as well as among the subset of residents who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (71% [95% CI, 58-80%] and 96% [95% CI, 67-99%]). Conclusions Consistent with results from randomized trials and observational studies in other populations, mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people. Prioritizing incarcerated people for vaccination, redoubling efforts to boost vaccination and continuing other ongoing mitigation practices are essential in preventing COVID-19 in this disproportionately affected population.","output":"Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines among Incarcerated People in California State Prisons: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is in the midst of worldwide panic. Sudden onset of an immediate life-threatening illness, quarantine and unemployment caused by epidemic are all contributors to depression. Ginseng has been reported to be an effective and safe clinical treatment on both immune-regulation and anti-depression. However, the mechanism of its anti-depression effect has not been fully characterized. In order to provide theoretical guidance for further clinical application in post-pandemic, we investigated active compounds and pharmacological mechanisms of ginseng to exert anti-depressant activity using network pharmacology, and discussed the active ingredients with immune-regulation and anti-depression. Methods: : Information on compounds in ginseng was obtained from public databases, and genes related to depression were gathered using the GeneCards database. Networks of ginseng-associated targets and depression-related genes were constructed through STRING database. Potential targets and pathway enrichment analysis related to the therapeutic efficacy of ginseng for depression were identified using Cytoscape and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Results: : Network pharmacological analysis of ginseng in treatment of depression identified 16 active ingredients, 47 potential targets, 32 GO terms, and 8 target gene-regulated major pathways. Among them, kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, fumarine and frutinone A are bioactive compounds and key chemicals. Core genes in PPI network were AKT1, CASP3, NOS3, TNF, and PPARG. Enrichment results revealed that ginseng could regulate multiple aspects of depression through neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and Serotonergic synapse. More importantly, we found that frutinone A and kaempferol are key ingredients in ginseng with dual activities of immune-regulation and anti-depression. Conclusions: : We discovered that the therapeutic activities of ginseng for depression mainly involve neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, neurogenesis, HPA axis and inflammatory response. Pharmacological network analysis can help to explain the potential effects of ginseng for treating depression, indicating that ginseng is a preferable herb clinically for immune-regulation and anti-depression in post-pandemic.","output":"Network pharmacology-based active compounds and pharmacological mechanisms of ginseng for depression in post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A better understanding of the immune response to live and formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is important for developing nonlive vaccines. In this study, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I- and II-restricted, RSV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor (CTLp) frequencies were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples and spleen lymphocytes of BALB/c mice intranasally infected with live RSV or intramuscularly inoculated with formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV). After RSV infection, both class I- and class II-restricted CTLps were detected by day 4 or 5 postinfection (p.i.). Peak CTLp frequencies were detected by day 7 p.i. The class II-restricted CTLp frequencies in the BAL following RSV infection were less than class I-restricted CTLp frequencies through day 14 p.i., during which class I-restricted CTLp frequencies remained elevated, but then declined by 48 days p.i. The frequencies of class II-restricted CTLps in the BAL were 2- to 10-fold less than those of class I-restricted CTLps. For spleen cells, frequencies of both MHC class I- and II-restricted CTLps to live RSV were similar. In contrast, class II-restricted CTLps predominated in FI-RSV-vaccinated mice. RSV challenge of vaccinated mice resulted in an increase in the frequency of class I-restricted CTLps at day 3 p.i. but did not enhance class II-restricted CTLp frequencies. These studies demonstrate differences in the CTLp response to live RSV infection compared with FI-RSV immunization and help define possible mechanisms of enhanced disease after FI-RSV immunization. In addition, these studies provide a quantitative means to address potential vaccine candidates by examining both MHC class I- and II-restricted CTLp frequencies.","output":"Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor frequencies in BALB/c mice after acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection or immunization with a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome with high incidence rates, a substantial symptom and treatment burden, and a significant risk of readmission within 30 days after hospitalization. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the significance of using eHealth interventions to follow up on the care needs of patients with HF to support self-care, increase quality of life (QoL), and reduce readmission rates during the transition between hospital and home. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this review are to summarize research on the content and delivery modes of HF posthospitalization eHealth interventions, explore patient adherence to the interventions, and examine the effects on the patient outcomes of self-care, QoL, and readmissions. METHODS: A restricted systematic review study design was used. Literature searches and reviews followed the (PRISMA-S) Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension checklist, and the CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies published between 2015 and 2020. The review process involved 3 groups of researchers working in pairs. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the included studies methodological quality. A thematic analysis method was used to analyze data extracted from the studies. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were examined in this review. The studies were published between 2015 and 2019, with 56% (10/18) of them published in the United States. Of the 18 studies, 16 (89%) were randomized controlled trials, and 14 (78%) recruited patients upon hospital discharge to eHealth interventions lasting from 14 days to 12 months. The studies involved structured telephone calls, interactive voice response, and telemonitoring and included elements of patient education, counseling, social and emotional support, and self-monitoring of symptoms and vital signs. Of the 18 studies, 11 (61%) provided information on patient adherence, and the adherence levels were 72%-99%. When used for posthospitalization follow-up of patients with HF, eHealth interventions can positively affect QoL, whereas its impact is less evident for self-care and readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that patients with HF should receive prompt follow-up after hospitalization and eHealth interventions have the potential to improve these patients QoL. Patient adherence in eHealth follow-up trials shows promise for successful future interventions and adherence research. Further studies are warranted to examine the effects of eHealth interventions on self-care and readmissions among patients with HF.","output":"Posthospitalization Follow-Up of Patients With Heart Failure Using eHealth Solutions: Restricted Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recognizing the host cellular receptor and mediating fusion of virus and cell membranes, the spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses is the most critical viral protein for cross-species transmission and infection.

Specifically, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has the third highest estimated burden of foodborne diseases per population, after the African and South-East Asia regions. However, it is difficult to determine what the burden is since little is published in peer-reviewed journals or government reports for public access. This chapter reviews 16 autonomous nations, namely, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia (KSA), Syrian Arab Republic (Syria), United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen. Countries range in size from Bahrain with 1.8 million inhabitants to Pakistan with a population of 184 million. Agriculture and local food production is much influenced by water availability for irrigation. Water shortages are most severe in the Gulf countries which rely on aquifers, desalination, and recycled waste water for most of their water supplies. This means that most food is imported which is expensive if not subsidized through petrodollars. This impacts food security which is a particular concern in countries under conflict, particularly, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Gastrointestinal infections are frequent in this region from Salmonella Typhi and other Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, rotavirus, hepatitis A virus, parasites, and more rarely from Aeromonas, Yersinia enterocolitica, Brucella spp., and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Reports indicate that children are the most susceptible and that many isolates are multidrug resistant. Chemical contamination of water supplies and crops are probably more of a concern than published reports indicate, because of widespread indiscriminate use of fertilizers, antibiotics, and pesticides, coupled with increased industrial pollution affecting the water supplies. Like many other parts of the developing world, foodborne disease surveillance is limited and outbreaks are most often reported through the Press but with insufficient detail to determine the etiological agents and the factors contributing to the outbreaks, leading to speculation to the cause by those interested or responsible for food prevention and control. However, there are some well investigated outbreaks in the region that have those details, and reveal where the shortcomings of both the establishments and the inspection systems have been. Where the causative agents are known, the kinds of pathogens are generally similar to those found in the West, e.g., Salmonella, but many outbreaks seem to have short incubation periods that point to a toxin of some kind of chemical or biological origin, but these are almost never identified. Because of sectarian warfare, residents and refugees have been given food that has made them sick and solders? have been deliberately poisoned. Research has been focused on microbial contamination of locally-sold foodstuffs and manager and employee knowledge of food safety and hygienic conditions in food preparation establishments. An innovative pilot project in Qatar is to use seawater and sunlight for raising crops through the Sahara Forest Project. All countries have some kind of food establishment inspection system, but they tend to be punitive if faults are found in management or employees on the premises rather than being used for their education for improving food safety. Restaurants may be closed down and owners and employees fined for often unspecified infringements. However, some food control agents are moving towards employee training through seminars and courses before problems occur, which is a good disease prevention strategy. Unfortunately, many of the food handlers are from Asian countries with languages other than Arabic and English, which makes effective food safety communication and training difficult. Tourists visiting popular resorts in Turkey and Egypt have suffered from foodborne illnesses, usually of unknown origin but poor hygienic conditions are blamed with law suits following, and the adverse publicity affects the long-term viability of some of these resorts. Food exports, important for local economies, have occasionally been contaminated resulting in recalls and sometimes illnesses and deaths, notably fenugreek seeds from Egypt (E. coli O104:H4), pomegranate arils from Turkey (hepatitis A virus), and tahini from Lebanon (Salmonella). Overall, in recent decades, the Middle East has made strides towards improving food safety for both residents and foreign visitors or ex-pat workers. However, within the countries there are large discrepancies in the extent of effective public health oversight including food safety and food security. Currently, almost all of the countries are involved to a greater or lesser extent in the civil wars in Syria and Yemen, or are affected through political tensions and strife in Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Turkey. In addition, the current overproduction of oil on a world-wide scale has led to a rapid decrease in revenues to most Gulf states. All this points to a severe setback, and an uncertain foreseeable future for improvements in obtaining both sufficient and safe food for residents in this region.","output":"Foodborne Disease in the Middle East"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We investigate the effects of melatonin, compared to the usual therapeutic regimen on clinical symptoms and laboratory signs in severely ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 who are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

In this study, we labeled de novo-synthesized viral RNA in situ with bromouridine triphosphate (BrUTP) in Huh7 cells expressing an HCV subgenomic replicon. By immunofluorescence staining using an anti-BrUTP antibody and confocal microscopy, we showed that the newly synthesized HCV RNA was localized to distinct speckle-like structures, which also contain all of the HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins. These speckles are distinct from lipid droplets and are separated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where some HCV NS proteins also reside. Membrane flotation analysis demonstrated that almost all of the NS5A and part of the NS5B proteins and all of the viral RNA were present in membrane fractions which are resistant to treatment with 1% NP-40 at 4 degrees C. They were cofractionated with caveolin-2, a lipid-raft-associated intracellular membrane protein, in the presence or absence of the detergent. In contrast, the ER-resident proteins were detergent soluble. These properties suggest that the membranes on which HCV RNA replication occurs are lipid rafts recruited from the intracellular membranes. The protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin did not inhibit viral RNA synthesis, indicating that HCV RNA replication does not require continuous protein synthesis. We suggest that HCV RNA synthesis occurs on a lipid raft membrane structure.","output":"Hepatitis C virus RNA replication occurs on a detergent-resistant membrane that cofractionates with caveolin-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic uncertainty shock on the macroeconomic stability in Ethiopia in the short run period The World Pandemic Uncertainty Index (WPUI) was used a proxy variable to measure COVID-19 Uncertainty shock effect The pandemic effect on core macroeconomic variables like investment, employment, prices (both food & nonfood prices), import, export and fiscal policy indicators was estimated and forecasted using Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) Model The role of fiscal policy in mitigating the shock effect of coronavirus pandemic on macroeconomic stability is also investigated The finding of the study reveals that the COVID-19 impact lasts at least three years to shake the economy of Ethiopia Given that the Ethiopian economy heavily relies on import to supply the bulk of its consumption and investment goods, COVID-19 uncertainty effect starts as supply chain shock, whose effect transmitted into the domestic economy via international trade channel The pandemic uncertainty shock effect is also expected to quickly transcend to destabilize the economy via aggregate demand, food & non-food prices, investment, employment and export shocks The overall impact of COVID-19 pandemic uncertainty shock is interpreted into the economy by resulting under consumption at least in the next three years since 2020 Therefore, the government is expected to enact incentives/policy directions which can boost business confidence A managed expansionary fiscal policy is found key to promote investment, employment and to stabilize food & non-food prices A particular role of fiscal policy was identified to stabilizing food, transport and communication prices The potency of fiscal policies in stabilizing food, transport and communication prices go in line with the prevailing reality in Ethiopia where government has strong hands to control those markets directly and/or indirectly This suggests market failure featuring COVID-19 time, calling for managed interventions of governments to promote market stabilities More importantly, price stabilization policies of the government can have spillover effects in boosting aggregate demand by spurring investments (and widening employment opportunities) in transport/logistics, hotel & restaurant, culture & tourism and export sectors in particular","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Uncertainty Shock Impact on Macroeconomic Stability in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Survival following liver transplantation has changed dramatically owing to improvement in surgical techniques, peri-operative care and optimal immunosuppressive therapy. Post-Liver transplant (LT) de novo or recurrent viral infection continues to cause major allograft dysfunction, leading to poor graft and patient survival in untreated patients. Availability of highly effective antiviral drugs has significantly improved post-LT survival. Patients transplanted for chronic hepatitis B infection should receive life-long nucleos(t)ide analogues, with or without HBIg for effective viral control. Patients with chronic hepatitis C should be commenced on directly acting antiviral (DAA) drugs prior to transplantation. DAA therapy for post-LT recurrent hepatitis C infection is associated with close to 100% sustained virological response (SVR), irrespective of genotype. De novo chronic Hepatitis E infection is an increasingly recognised cause of allograft dysfunction in LT recipients. Untreated chronic HEV infection of the graft may lead to liver fibrosis and allograft failure. CMV and EBV can reactivate leading to systemic illness following liver transplantation. With COVID-19 pandemic, post-transplant patients are at risk of SARS-Co-V2 infection. Majority of the LT recipients require hospitalization, and the mortality in this population is around 20%. Early recognition of allograft dysfunction and identification of viral aetiology is essential in the management of post-LT de novo or recurrent infections.

However, the association of these abnormalities with the severity of COVID-19 and clinical outcomes is poorly understood AIM We aimed to assess the prevalence of elevated liver chemistries in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and compare the serum liver chemistries to predict the severity and in-hospital mortality. METHODS This retrospective, observational study included 3380 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in the Johns Hopkins Health System (Baltimore, MD, United States). Demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment measures, and outcome data were collected. Cox regression modeling was used to explore variables associated with abnormal liver chemistries on admission with disease severity and prognosis RESULTS A total of 2698 (70.4%) had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at the time of admission. Other more prevalent abnormal liver chemistries were aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (44.4%), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (16.1%), and total bilirubin (T-Bil) (5.9%). Factors associated with liver injury were older age, Asian ethnicity, other race, being overweight, and obesity. Higher ALT, AST, T-Bil, and ALP levels were more commonly associated with disease severity. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that abnormal AST and T-Bil were associated with the highest mortality risk than other liver injury indicators during hospitalization. Abnormal AST, T-Bil, and ALP were associated with a need for vasopressor drugs, whereas higher levels of AST, T-Bil, and a decreased albumin levels were associated with mechanical ventilation CONCLUSION Abnormal liver chemistries are common at the time of hospital admission in COVID-19 patients and can be closely related to the patients severity and prognosis. Elevated liver chemistries, specifically ALT, AST, ALP, and T-Bil levels, can be used to stratify risk and predict the need for advanced therapies in these patients.","output":"Abnormal liver chemistries as a predictor of COVID-19 severity and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bioshell calcium oxide (BiSCaO) is derived from scallop shells and after heat treatment exhibits broad microbicidal activity.

The stability analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is both locally and globally stable when R 0 < 1 , and the endemic equilibrium is locally and globally stable when R 0 > 1 under some conditions. A control strategy including vaccination and treatment has been studied on this pandemic model with an objective functional to minimize.

In this context, we have explored ethical judgments as part of a larger project on market ethics. We found that marketing practices judged as highly unethical before the pandemic, were judged to be much less unethical one year later. Of the questionable practices examined during the lockdown, those related to the pandemic (e.g., price gouging on hand sanitizer) were generally evaluated the most unethical, equal to or more unethical than the most egregious practices previously tested. Experience of lockdown affected ethical judgments, with number of people in the household, lockdown duration, and time spent on social media associated with less unethical judgments. Broader effects of the pandemic, including negative affect, diminished well-being, and financial difficulties, were also associated with less ethical concern.

OBJECTIVE: Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) develop systemic physiological changes that could increase the risk of severe evolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and result in atypical clinical features of COVID-19 with possible delay in both diagnosis and treatment. We evaluated differences in clinical features and evolution of COVID-19 between people with SCI and able-bodied individuals. SETTING: The study was conducted in an Italian inpatient rehabilitation referral center for individuals with SCI during the lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We compared clinical information between patients with SCI and able-bodied healthcare workers of the same center who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Overall, 15 out of the 25 SCI patients admitted to the center and 17 out of the 69 healthcare workers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with SCI exhibited a significantly more advanced age and a higher prevalence of comorbidities. Nevertheless, no significant differences in clinical expression of COVID-19 and treatment strategies were observed between the two groups. All hospitalized subjects were treated in nonintensive care units and no deaths occurred in either group.

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study including consecutive kidney transplant recipients in a single referral transplant centre. Participants were tested for anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies 2-4 weeks after a second vaccine dose. Primary outcome was rate of seropositivity. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Of 308 kidney transplant recipients included, only 112 (36.4%) tested positive for anti-S antibodies 2-4 weeks after receiving the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Median antibody titre was 15.5 AU/mL (interquartile range (IQR) 3.5-163.6). Factors associated with antibody response were higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio (OR) 1.025 per mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.014-1.037, p < 0.001), lower mycophenolic acid dose (OR 2.347 per 360 mg decrease, 95%CI 1.782-3.089, p < 0.001), younger age (OR 1.032 per year decrease, 95%CI 1.015-1.05, p < 0.001) and lower calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) blood level (OR 1.987, 95%CI 1.146-3.443, p 0.014).

Specifically, this study discusses sustainable livelihoods with the knowledge of migration, adaptation, and entrepreneurship in Timor-Leste. To fulfill these aims, a qualitative methodology with a phenomenological approach was adopted by interviewing eight Chinese migrants who run businesses in Timor-Leste. Furthermore, the framework for the concept of sustainable livelihoods of the Department for International Development (DFID) was adapted to explain, in depth, the phenomena. The finding reveals that economic reasons encourage and attract Chinese migrant workers and entrepreneurs to Timor-Leste. The adaptation process of migrants in Timor-Leste relies on social capital to synergize with local communities in terms of culture, further affecting the comfort and security of entrepreneurship. From the perspective of sustainable livelihoods, migrant workers take advantage of human capital in the process of accumulation of financial capital to enhance their business activities. Meanwhile, migrant entrepreneurship expands their financial capital and human capital into social capital, physical capital, and natural capital. The findings also explain that the mobility and access to financial capital of Chinese migrants are supported through institutional structures, entrepreneurship activities, and policies. Furthermore, to ensure livelihood sustainability and business, Chinese migrants in Timor-Leste can carry out business intensification, extensification, diversification, and transformation strategies.","output":"The Livelihood of Chinese Migrants in Timor-Leste"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To determine if ultrasonography is necessary to detect progression of choroidal melanocytic tumors undergoing sequential multi-modal imaging with color photography, autofluorescence (AF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods: All patients with choroidal melanoma undergoing treatment at Moorfields Eye Hospital between January 2016 and March 2020 were reviewed to identify those with treatment deferred by 2 months. Tumors that showed progression prior to treatment, defined as an increase in (a) basal dimensions (b) thickness (c) orange pigment and/or (d) sub-retinal fluid, were included. Mushroom shape, Orange pigment, Large size, Enlargement and Sub-retinal fluid (MOLES) scores were assigned to all tumors at earliest date and date of treatment. Results: A total of 99 patients with a mean age of 66 years (range: 26C90) were included. The initial MOLES score was 1 in 2 cases, 2 in 23 cases, and 3 in 74 cases. Progression was detected with sequential color photography alone in 100% of MOLES 1/2 and 97% of lesions with a MOLES score of 3. When findings on AF and OCT were included, sensitivity for detecting subtle change without ultrasonography improved to 100% for MOLES 3 and 97% for MOLES 4/5. Only one patient included in this study had an isolated increase in thickness that may have been missed had sequential ultrasonography not been performed. Overall, the sensitivity for detecting progression with color photographs alone was 97% (95% CI 93C100%) and increased to 99% (95% CI 97C100%) by including autofluorescence and OCT. Conclusions: Monitoring of choroidal nevi, particularly those classified as MOLES 1 or 2 (i.e., low-risk or high-risk naevi), can be accomplished safely without the need for ultrasonography.

The aim of this individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis was to compare the effect of nasal and oronasal masks on treatment efficacy and adherence in patients with COPD and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). METHODS We searched Medline and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 1 month's duration, published between January 1994 and April 2019, that assessed NIV efficacy in patients with OHS and COPD. The main outcomes were diurnal PaCO2, PaO2 and NIV adherence (PROSPERO CRD42019132398). FINDINGS Of 1576 articles identified, 34 RCTs met the inclusion criteria and IPD were obtained for 18. Ten RCTs were excluded because only one type of mask was used, or mask data were missing. Data from 8 RCTs, including 290 IPD, underwent meta-analysis. Oronasal masks were used in 86% of cases. There were no differences between oronasal and nasal masks for PaCO2 (0.61 mm Hg (95% CI -2.15 to 3.38); p=0.68), PaO2 (-0.00 mm Hg (95% CI -4.59 to 4.58); p=1) or NIV adherence (029 hour/day (95% CI -0.74 to 1.32); p=0.58). There was no interaction between the underlying pathology and the effect of mask type on any outcome.

Hyponatremia has been associated with a worse outcome in several pathologic conditions The main objective of this study was to determine whether serum sodium alterations may be independent predictors of the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design and methods: In this observational study, data from 441 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a University Hospital were collected. After excluding 61 patients (no serum sodium at admission available, saline solution infusion before sodium assessment, transfer from another hospital), data from 380 patients were analyzed. Results: 274 (72.1%) patients had normonatremia at admission, 87 (22.9%) patients had hyponatremia and 19 (5%) patients had hypernatremia. We found an inverse correlation between serum sodium and IL-6, whereas a direct correlation between serum sodium and PaO2/FiO2 ratio was observed. Patients with hyponatremia had a higher prevalence of non-invasive ventilation and ICU transfer than those with normonatremia or hypernatremia. Hyponatremia was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (2.7-fold increase vs normonatremia) and each mEq/L of serum sodium reduction was associated with a 14.4% increased risk of death.

DESIGN Prospective randomized clinical trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING University medical center. PATIENTS A total of 101 subjects who underwent LH between June 2010 and August 2012. INTERVENTIONS Subjects were randomized to colpotomy by V mode electrothermal energy or cut/coag electrothermal energy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary end point was the median depth of thermal injury measured in millimeters. The secondary end points included the proportion of subjects who developed granulation tissue, induration, infection, or dehiscence at the vaginal cuff at 4 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months postoperatively. There was no significant difference in the median depth of thermal injury in the cut/coag and V mode arms (anterior margin: 0.68 mm vs 0.63 mm [p = .94], posterior margin: 0.66 mm vs 0.70 mm [p = .87], respectively). Twenty-seven percent of subjects in each arm developed at least 1 of the clinical end points at 4 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months postoperatively (granulation tissue: 6%-18% vs 8%-21%, induration: 0%-2% vs 4%-5%, infection: 0%-4% vs 0%-10%, dehiscence: 2% vs 0% in the cut/coag and V mode arms, respectively), with no difference between arms (p = 1.0).

Even in high income countries, health systems have been found wanting in dealing with the new infectious agent. However, the even greater long-term danger of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria and fungi is still under-appreciated, especially among the general public. Although antimicrobial drug development faces significant scientific challenges, the gravest challenge at the moment appears to be economic, where the lack of a viable market has led to a collapse in drug development pipelines. There is therefore a critical need for governments across the world to further incentivize the development of antimicrobials. Most incentive strategies over the past decade have focused on so-called push incentives that bridge the costs of antimicrobial research and development, but these have been insufficient for reviving the pipeline. In this Perspective, we analyze the current incentive strategies in place for antimicrobial drug development, and focus on pull incentives, which instead aim to improve revenue generation and thereby resolve the antimicrobial market failure challenge. We further analyze these incentives in a broader One Health context and stress the importance of developing and enforcing strict protocols to ensure appropriate manufacturing practices and responsible use. Our analysis reiterates the importance of international cooperation, coordination across antimicrobial research, and sustained funding in tackling this significant global challenge. A failure to invest wisely and continuously to incentivize antimicrobial pipelines will have catastrophic consequences for global health and wellbeing in the years to come.","output":"To Push or To Pull?

However, the molecular mechanism of sheep ?-defensin 2 (SBD-2) against E. coli F17 remains unclear. This study aims to reveal the antibacterial ability of SBD-2 against E. coli F17 infection in sheep. Firstly, we established the culture system of ovine intestinal epithelial cells (OIECs) in vitro, treated with different concentrations of E. coli F17 for an indicated time. Secondly, we performed RNA interference and overexpression to investigate the effect of SBD-2 expression on E. coli F17 adhesion to OIECs. Finally, inhibitors of NF-B and MAPK pathways were pre-treated to explore the possible relationship involving in E. coli F17 infection regulating SBD-2 expression. The results showed that E. coli F17 markedly (p < 0.01) upregulated the expression levels of SBD-2 mRNA and protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Overexpression of SBD-2 contributed to enhancing E. coli F17 resistance in OIECs, while silencing SBD-2 dramatically improved the adhesion of E. coli F17 to OIECs (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Furthermore, E. coli F17 stimulated SBD-2 expression was obviously decreased by pre-treatment with NF-B inhibitor PDTC, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 and ERK1/2 MAPK inhibitor PD98095 (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Interestingly, adhesion of E. coli F17 to OIECs were highly enhanced by pre-treated with PDTC, SB202190 and PD98095. Our data suggested that SBD-2 could inhibit E. coli F17 infection in OIECs, possibly through NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways.

Morbidity among children was much lower, with milder or absent signs and symptoms; chest CT scans showed milder symptoms, if at all, compared to adults. Objective: Report the epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory, radiological characteristics, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Compare additional signs and symptoms, investigate familial clustering, compare laboratory results, and find out relevance between age and typical chest CT scans in patients. Methods: We studied 33 young patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Anhui Province of China by 16th February 2020. Their signs, symptoms, and familial clustering were analyzed. We compared the laboratory test results, age, and gender among three parts based on their chest CT scans. Results: Familial clustering was seen in 30 (30/33; 90.91%) patients; three families had seven confirmed members infected with the disease. Eight (8/33; 24.24%) patients had no symptoms, 12 (12/33; 36.36%) patients had only fever, nine (9/33; 27.27%) patients had fever and additional symptoms, and 12 (12/33; 36.36%) patients had no fever. Dry cough was the most common additional symptom. In 25 (25/33; 75.76%) patients, the percent of lymphocytes decreased; 26 (26/33; 78.79%) patients were older than 7 years. More male than female patients and patients older than 8 years showed typical abnormalities in the chest CT scans (P = 0.038). Only two 18 years old patients had hepatic injury. Conclusion: Children's infection is mild and familial clustering was the most common channel. The older patients had more typical ground glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation in chest CT scans. Cases without fever strongly suggested that non-symptomatic children should not be assumed to be free of infection when their family members have confirmed infection.

The concept of precariousness involves a complex understanding of the insecurity of continuous employment on both institutional and individual level. While the post-Fordist society marked radical changes in the labour market, recent neoliberal policies created new vulnerable groups that experience insecurity, the blocking of professional opportunities and insufficient income over time. This article builds on the idea that the 'stable' and 'flexible' labour market normalized the work insecurity in the context of the economic crises and led to precariousness. Work-related insecurity occurs in a gender-segregated labour market. For the exploration of ongoing processes of the precarization phenomenon, this article focuses on the connection between multidimensional concepts covering the economic, social and psychological consequences of labour insecurity. First, the paper aims to discuss a theory-based conceptualisation of precariousness understood as a multidimensional phenomenon in research literature.

While several previous epidemiological studies have discussed controlling the course of the epidemic with regard to social distancing, vaccination, care capacities, and future scenarios, we adopt an alternative approach to provide insights into the time scale of epidemic propagation in human populations. We show that the reproduction number modified by preventive countermeasures R m implies a threshold R~ m to reach the herd immunity level at time T h . While T h varies moderately for large R m , it increases sharply around R m =R~ m , and T h is infinite below R m =R~ m . The transition region for this increase is minute, demonstrating that prevention of infectious diseases must consider the relatively asymptotic nature of their propagation, which varies unpredictably between steady transmission and explosive outbreaks. These results suggest the continuation of preventive countermeasures to suppress the transmission of COVID-19 for many years;if they were discontinued or reduced such that R m exceeded R~ m , the disease would be transmitted throughout the considered community, and the required herd immunity level would be reached within 250 days if R m > 1.6.

METHODS: Cross-sectional postal survey with eligible participants identified through a population-based cancer registry. QoL outcomes were assessed by EQ-5D-5L, social difficulties index (SDI) and, for those employed at diagnosis, current employment. Regression analyses explored associations between outcome variables and cancer type, age, time since diagnosis, residential location, socio-economic disadvantage, comorbidities and unmet information needs. Mediation analyses examined whether comorbidities and information needs explained relationships between outcome variables and socio-economic disadvantage. RESULTS: 2115 survivors participated. Mean EQ-5D-5L scores (mean = 0.84) were similar to population averages and SDI scores were low for the entire sample (mean = 3.80). In multivariate analyses, being aged over 80, greater socio-economic disadvantage, comorbidities and unmet information needs decreased EQ-5D-5L scores. Higher SDI scores were associated with socio-economic disadvantage, comorbidities and unmet information needs. Not being employed was associated with being aged over 50, more comorbidities and socio-economic disadvantage. Comorbidities but not information needs partially mediated the impact of socio-economic disadvantage on EQ-5D-5L and SDI accounting for 17% and 14% of the total effect of socio-economic disadvantage respectively. Neither comorbidities nor information needs mediated the association between socio-economic disadvantage and employment outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence and prevalence of primary malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumours and trends in these rates in Canada from 1992 to 2017. METHODS: We conducted an epidemiologic study using publicly available data from the Canadian Cancer Registry from 1992 to 2017 (1994 to 2015 for prevalence) for all of Canada except Quebec (1992 to 2011). We calculated the incidence and prevalence per 100 000 person-years and the age-standardized incidence and prevalence per 100 000 person-years of primary malignant CNS tumours and stratified them by sex and age (pediatric [ 19 yr], adult [20C64 yr] and older adult [> 64 yr]). Our analyses assessed average disease duration, survival differences between males and females, and trends over time. RESULTS: During the study period, the average age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates of all primary malignant CNS tumours were 7.9 and 7.6 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. The incidence and prevalence increased by 37.5% and 40.5%, respectively, over the study period. Males accounted for more than half (26 085 [56.4%]) of all diagnoses and experienced decreased survival compared to females 1 year after diagnosis (p = 0.048). Children accounted for 4605 new diagnoses (10.0%), adults for 23 950 (51.7%), and older adults for 17 735 (38.3%). Age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates were highest among older adults. INTERPRETATION: Overall, the incidence of primary malignant CNS tumours increased from 1992 to 2017, and males and older adults were disproportionately affected. Increased health care resources and awareness are needed to improve identification of these tumours and deliver evidence-based care that balances safety, efficacy and preservation of quality of life for affected patients.","output":"Incidence and prevalence of primary malignant brain tumours in Canada from 1992 to 2017: an epidemiologic study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper deals with the investigation on spread of COVID-19 and its stability analysis (both local and global stability) in Odisha, India. Being the second most populous country in the world, It is urgent need to investigate the spread and control of disease in India .However, due to diversity of vast population, uncertainty of infection, varying rate of recovery, state wise different COVID-19 induced death rate and non uniform quarantine policy of the states, it is strenuous to predict the spread and control of disease accurately in the country. So, it is crucial to study the aspects of disease in each state for the better prediction. We have considered the state Odisha (India) having population nearly equal to the population of Spain because the entry of huge migrants to the state suddenly enhanced the number of COVID-19 patients from below two hundred to more than eight hundred within one week even after forty days of lockdown period. We have developed SIAQR epidemic model fabricated with influx of out-migrants diagnosed at compartment (A) , then sent to the compartment (I) for treatment those have confirmed the disease and the remaining healthy individuals are sent to quarantine compartment (Q) for a period of twenty one days under surveillance and observation. The set of ordinary (nonlinear) differential equations are formulated and they are solved using Runge -Kutta fourth order method. The simulation of numerical data is performed using computer software MATLAB. As there is no specific treatment, vaccine or medicine available for the disease till the date, so the only intervention procedure called quarantine process is devised in this model to check the stability behaviour of the disease. The numerical and analytical results of the study show that the disease free equilibrium is locally stable when basic reproduction number is less than unity and unstable when it is more than unity. Further the study shows that it persists to endemic equilibrium for global stability when basic reproduction number greater than unity. As per the current trends ,this study shows that the prevalence of COVID -19 would remain nearly 250 to 300 days in Odisha as for as the infected migrants would have been entering to the state.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study from June 13 to 20, 2020 by distributing a 16-item online Google forms questionnaire among adults (18-65 years old) living in Saudi Arabia. We utilized the convenience sampling. Data analysis was performed using Chi-square and multiple regression analysis on Jamovi. RESULTS: A total of 1436 responses were analyzed with 43.5% males and 56.5% females. Most respondents (89.1%) thought that only the elderly above 60 years old are considered at high risk of contracting COVID-19. Most respondents (86.5%) agreed that people with other health conditions could be more affected by COVID-19. Approximately 97.2% agreed that wearing a mask and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands was the leading preventive action. Most participants (99.4%) chose fever as an associated symptom. Respondents from the healthcare sector presented statistically higher scores than those in non-healthcare sectors (p<0.001). Higher education and higher salary were important predictors of better COVID-19 knowledge.

The hypothesis was that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) may up-regulate ACE2 expression that is used as receptor for viral entry into cells. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this review is to discuss the existing evidence on the interaction between COVID-19 infection, ACE2 and ACEIs or ARBs and to examine the main implications for clinical practice. In addition, novel therapeutic strategies for blocking ACE2-mediated COVID-19 infection will be displayed. METHODS We performed a comprehensive review of the literature to identify data from clinical and experimental studies for the association between COVID-19 infection, ACE2 and RAS inhibition. RESULTS The current clinical and experimental evidence for ACEIs or ARBs to facilitate severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is insufficient to suggest discontinuing these drugs. Several observational studies arrive at the conclusion that the continued use of RAS inhibitors is unlike to be harmful in COVID-19-positive patients.

As one of the most populous countries in the world, China has the largest number of households in the world but quite a low home game penetration rate due to the 13 year game industry winter for international enterprises. Whether Chinese customers have the intention of using motion-sensing games to improve their health status in the home environment will directly determine the commercial potential of the relevant industry in the Chinese market. In order to understand the motives of users and explore the market possibility and prospects of the game industry, this study adopts empirical research and structural equation modeling to construct a motivation model of Chinese consumers toward motion-sensing gameplay behavior in the household environment. We distributed 515 questionnaires to conduct a survey; 427 valid responses have been received, and 203 data, which meet the inclusion criteria of the required game experience, have been analyzed by SPSS25.0 and AMOS25.0. A structural equation model for the gameplay motivation has been constructed. The result shows that the three functional motivators, exercise (Path efficient = 0.40, p < 0.01), entertainment (Path efficient = 0.27, p < 0.01), and social interaction (Path efficient = 0.36, p < 0.01) of home motion-sensing games have a significantly positive impact on the user's intention to play. Furthermore, the diversity and the time-and-place flexibility variables exert an important positive influence on the users' gameplay behavior through their effects on the three main functional motive variables. To sum up, (1) exercise, (2) entertainment, and (3) social interaction are the main functional motivations of the Chinese consumers' gameplay behaviors; (4) diversity and (5) time-and-place flexibility are the two main attribute motivators. The acceptance of Chinese users for home motion-sensing games remains positive and high.

AIM: To understand barriers and facilitators of palliative care integration for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Internists, Intensivists and palliative care physicians completed semi-structured interviews about their experiences providing care to patients with COVID-19. Results were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-three physicians (13 specialist palliative care, five intensivists, five general internists) were interviewed; mean  SD age was 42  11 years and 61% were female. Six thematic categories were described including: patient and family factors, palliative care knowledge, primary provider factors, COVID-19 specific factors, palliative care service factors, and leadership and culture factors. Patient and family factors included patient prognosis, characteristics that implied prognosis (i.e., age, etc.), and goals of care. Palliative care knowledge included confidence in primary palliative care skills, misperception that COVID-19 is not a 'palliative diagnosis', and the need to choose quantity or quality of life in COVID-19 management. Primary provider factors included available time, attitude, and reimbursement. COVID-19 specific factors were COVID-19 as an impetus to act, uncertain illness trajectory, treatments and outcomes, and infection control measures. Palliative care service factors were accessibility, adaptability, and previous successful relationships. Leadership and culture factors included government-mandated support, presence at COVID planning tables, and institutional and unit culture. CONCLUSION: The study findings highlight the need for leadership support for formal integrated models of palliative care for patients with COVID-19, a palliative care role in pandemic planning, and educational initiatives with primary palliative care providers.","output":"Identifying barriers and facilitators to palliative care integration in the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a severe international shortage of the nasopharyngeal swabs that are required for collection of optimal specimens, creating a critical bottleneck blocking clinical laboratories' ability to perform high-sensitivity virological testing for SARS-CoV-2. To address this crisis, we designed and executed an innovative, cooperative, rapid-response translational-research program that brought together health care workers, manufacturers, and scientists to emergently develop and clinically validate new swabs for immediate mass production by 3D printing.

We aimed to compare the laboratory and chest CT imaging features in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia between non-severe cases and severe cases, and to analyze the correlation of CT score and laboratory testing. Methods: This study consecutively included 54 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (26 males and 28 females, 26 to 92 years of age, 43 cases with non-severe and 11 cases with severe group). Clinical, laboratory and image data were collected between two subgroups. A CT score system was used to evaluate the extent of disease. Correlation between the CT score and laboratory data were estimated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CT score and laboratory tests. Results: Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients had showed increased white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and decreased lymphocyte percentage (all p < 0.05). Architectural distortion, pleural effusion, air bronchogram and consolidation-dominant pattern were more common in the severe group (all p < 0.05). CT score of the severe group was higher than the non-severe group (p < 0.001). For distribution characters of the lesions, diffuse pattern in the transverse distribution was more often seen in the severe group (p < 0.001). CT score was positively correlated with the white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, the percent of neutrophil, NLR, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein, and was inversely related to the lymphocyte, the percent of lymphocyte. ROC analysis showed that when the optimal threshold of CT score was 13, the area under the curve was the largest, which was 0.855, and the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 60% respectively for the diagnosis of the severe patients.

A crucial point for any government is to understand, on the basis of the epidemic curve, the right temporal instant to set up a lockdown and then to remove it. Different strategies are being adopted with distinct shades of intensity. USA and Europe tend to introduce restrictions of considerable temporal length. They vary in time: a severe lockdown may be reached and then gradually relaxed. An interesting alternative is the Australian model where short and sharp responses have repeatedly tackled the virus and allowed people a return to near normalcy. After a few positive cases are detected, a lockdown is immediately set. In this paper we show that the Australian model can be generalized and given a rigorous mathematical analysis, casting strategies of the type short-term pain for collective gain in the context of sliding-mode control, an important branch of nonlinear control theory. This allows us to gain important insights regarding how to implement short-term lockdowns, obtaining a better understanding of their merits and possible limitations. Effects of vaccines administration in improving the control laws effectiveness are also illustrated. Our model predicts the duration of the severe lockdown to be set to maintain e.g. the number of people in intensive care under a certain threshold. After tuning our strategy exploiting data collected in Italy, it turns out that COVID-19 epidemic could be e.g. controlled by alternating one or two weeks of complete lockdown with one or two months of freedom, respectively.

The level of uncertainty regarding the virus is still significantly high. The virus behaves differently in children and young adults. Most children and adolescents are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. They generally have a very good prognosis. However, it is not well-known whether children and young adults with type 2 diabetes are at risk of getting a severe infection of COVID-19. Many Muslim children with type 2 diabetes have been performing dawn to dusk fasting during the month of Ramadan, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of this on their health has not been well investigated. Previous studies in adults have suggested that intermittent fasting may be beneficial in different ways including reversal of type 2 diabetes and prevention of COVID-19 infection. Objective: The primary aim of this narrative review is to summarise the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and young adults with type 2 diabetes, and to identify the knowledge gaps in the literature. It also explores the potential of intermittent fasting in reversing the pathogenesis of diabetes and highlighting how this approach could prevent these patients from developing chronic complications. Methods: This narrative review has been produced by examining several databases, including Google Scholar, Research Gate, PubMed, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (EBSCO), and Web of Science. The most common search terms used were COVID-19 AND Children, SARS-CoV-2 AND/OR Children, COVID-19 AND Diabetes COVID-19 Epidemiology, COVID-19 AND Ramadan fasting, COVID-19 and Intermittent fasting. All the resources used are either peer-reviewed articles/reports and/or official websites of various media, governmental and educational organisations. Results: Having reviewed the currently limited evidence, it has been found that the incidence of COVID-19 among children with type 2 diabetes seems to be not much different from children without diabetes. However, these patients are still vulnerable to any infection. Several studies have reported that prevention programmes such as intermittent fasting are effective to protect these groups of patients from developing any complications. Moreover, observing Ramadan fasting as a type of intermittent fasting could be beneficial for some children with established diabetes, prediabetes and people at risk. Conclusion: Children and young adults with type 2 diabetes are not at risk of severe COVID-19 infection as the case in adults with diabetes. More research is needed to identify the impact of COVID-19 and to investigate the efficacy and safety of intermittent fasting, including Ramadan fasting, among these age groups. Implementing these cost-effective programmes may have a great impact in minimising the incidence of diabetes. Moreover, this could be effective particularly at prediabetes stage by preventing these people from going onto develop type 2 diabetes and taking medications for the rest of their life and protecting people from complications linked to disease and infection.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Children and Young Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: A Narrative Review With Emphasis on the Potential of Intermittent Fasting as a Preventive Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the existence of subsets of patients with (quasi)identical, stereotyped B cell receptor immunoglobulins (BcR IG). Patients in certain major stereotyped subsets often display remarkably consistent clinicobiological profiles, suggesting that the study of BcR IG stereotypy in CLL has important implications for understanding disease pathophysiology and refining clinical decision-making. Nevertheless, several issues remain open, especially pertaining to the actual frequency of BcR IG stereotypy and major subsets, as well as the existence of higher-order connections between individual subsets. In order to address these issues, we investigated clonotypic IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements in a series of 29,856 patients with CLL, by far the largest series worldwide. We report that the stereotyped fraction of CLL peaks at 41% of the entire cohort and that all 19 previously identified major subsets retained their relative size and ranking, while 10 new ones emerged; overall, major stereotyped subsets had a cumulative frequency of 13.5%. Higher-level relationships were evident between subsets, particularly for major stereotyped subsets with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL), for which close relations with other subsets, termed 'satellites', were identified. Satellite subsets accounted for 3% of the entire cohort. These results confirm our previous notion that major subsets can be robustly identified and are consistent in relative size, hence representing distinct disease variants amenable to compartmentalized research with the potential of overcoming the pronounced heterogeneity of CLL. Furthermore, the existence of satellite subsets reveals a novel aspect of repertoire restriction with implications for refined molecular classification of CLL.","output":"Higher-order connections between stereotyped subsets: implications for improved patient classification in CLL"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work proposes a numerical scheme for a class of time-fractional convectionCreactionCdiffusion problems with a time lag.

CD30 expression is universal in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and is frequently expressed in other PTCL subtypes. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is a CD30-directed antibody drug conjugate that prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) when combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP) as compared to CHOP chemotherapy (Horwitz, 2020). Although a majority of pts treated with BV-CHP remained in durable remission (5y PFS 51%), there is room for improvement. Based on retrospective studies that demonstrated improved outcomes in younger pts, the addition of etoposide to CHOP (CHOEP) is commonly used as initial therapy for PTCL. We performed a multicenter phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding etoposide to BV-CHP (CHEP-BV) followed by BV consolidation in pts with newly diagnosed CD30-expressing PTCL. Methods: Adults with newly diagnosed CD30+ ( 1% of tumor cells by local pathology) PTCL were eligible, including pts with ALK+ ALCL and IPI score  2, ALK-negative ALCL, PTCL not otherwise specified (NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), among others. After accrual of 28 pts, the protocol was amended to allow enrollment of 20 additional pts with CD30+ non-ALCL PTCL (with ALCL allowed in Canada). Pts could receive prephase steroids and/or 1 cycle of CHOPequivalent chemotherapy prior to study entry. 6 pts were treated in a safety lead-in cohort and all pts received CHEP-BV at the recommended phase 2 dose: 6 x 21-day cycles of CHP+BV (1.8mg/kg) on d1 and etoposide 100mg/m2 on d1-3. G-CSF prophylaxis was mandatory. Pts in response after CHEP-BV could receive BV consolidation (1.8mg/kg q3w) for up to 10 additional cycles (16 total BV cycles) either after ASCT or CHEP-BV if no ASCT was performed. The co-primary endpoints were safety and the CR rate (Deauville score 1-3) by PET-CT after CHEP-BV assessed by investigators according to the 2014 Lugano classification. Secondary endpoints were PFS and OS. Results: Accrual has completed and 48 pts were enrolled;all were evaluable for toxicity, 46 were evaluable for efficacy. 16 pts had ALCL (13 ALK+, 3 ALK-) and 32 had non-ALCL PTCL subtypes, including 18 with AITL, 11 with PTCL NOS, 2 with T-follicular helper PTCL, and 1 with ATLL. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table. 43 pts completed CHEP-BV, 2 had progressive disease (PD) prior to completion, 1 pt discontinued CHEP-BV early (MD discretion), 1 pt died due to COVID-19, and 1 remains on CHEP-BV. Of 43 pts who completed CHEP-BV, 24 proceeded to ASCT and 19 did not. 33 (74%) pts received BV consolidation (20 after ASCT, 13 directly after CHEP-BV) and completed a median 8 of the planned 10 cycles (range, 1-10). 13 pts completed all cycles of consolidation;19 pts discontinued early-12 due to adverse events (AE), 5 due to PD, and 2 due to patient/physician choice.

This study sought to characterize the risk factors for and outcomes following COVID-19 infection in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Maintenance dialysis patients in clinics with at least one patient with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 from February to June 2020, treated by a mid-size national dialysis provider. PREDICTORS: Demographics, dialysis characteristics, residence in a congregate setting, comorbid conditions, measures of frailty, and use of selected medications. OUTCOMES: COVID-19 defined as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and all-cause mortality among those with COVID-19. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic regression analyses to identify clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19and risk factors associated with mortality among patients following COVID-19. RESULTS: 438/7948 (5.5%) maintenance dialysis patients developed COVID-19. Male sex, Black race, in-center dialysis (vs. home dialysis), treatment at an urban clinic, residence in a congregate setting, and greater comorbidity were associated with contracting COVID-19. Odds of COVID-19 was 17-fold higher for those residing in a congregate setting [OR = 17.10 (95% CI 13.51, 21.54)]. Of the 438 maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, 109 (24.9%) died. Older age, heart disease, and markers of frailty were associated with mortality. LIMITATIONS: No distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with asymptomatic screening limited by testing capacity during this initial COVID-19 surge period. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is common among patients receiving maintenance dialysis, particularly those residing in congregate settings.

The global debate regarding religious education in government schools has stimulated discussion in Australia around the merit of SRE and its place in contemporary Australian society. Providing SRE classes and their diverse religious backgrounds allows for a more intentional teaching and learning approach to fostering spirituality, religious belief and religious values. Values education is perceived as a pivotal means of ensuring the continuity of a societys values (Dror National Education through mutually supportive educational devices: a case study of Zionist education. Peter Lang, New York, 2007). From the perspective of many educators, values education is at the heart of educational effort, going beyond technically transferring skills. Yet, on the other hand, some argue that values education is liable to result in political, religious or ideological indoctrination. This chapter will define the meaning of values education and discuss the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic values. It will outline the national framework for values education developed by the Australian government. This chapter will then analyse how SRE contributes to the Australian values framework. Research has shown that belief in a higher being, a key element in SRE, can contribute significantly to values education. This research will be examined, as well as responses from SRE educators across the states and territories, who have been interviewed through a qualitative research project.","output":"Values Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The health profile of older adults places them at risk of infirmity and death from COVID-19 which may induce anxiety or exacerbate pre-existing anxiety. We examined COVID-19 related anxiety in men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer (CaP). METHOD: This study was conducted between July and September 2020. Sixty participants from a larger prospective, longitudinal study assessing depression, anxiety and health related quality of life in men with localized prostate cancer (DAHCaP) were included. COVID-19 related anxiety was measured at a single time point using, the Corona Virus Anxiety Scale (CAS). In addition, the following, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), the Connor-Davidson Resilience (CD-RISC) scale and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) that form part of the DAHCaP study were used in the analysis. We extracted pre-pandemic data for the STAI-S. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent had diabetes, 62.3% had hypertension and 24.6% had cardiac diseases, all known risk factors for severe COVID-19. Only 3% scored &#8805;9 on the CAS, indicating COVID 19 anxiety dysfunction. Half knew of family or friends that had contracted COVID-19 especially those scoring higher on the CAS (P = 0.042). There was a significant decrease in STAI-S scores pre-pandemic to the pandemic phase (34.7 to 29.8, P = 0.003). No correlation was observed between CAS and STAI-S (rho = 0.08), CD-RISC (rho = -0.06) or MSPSS (rho = -0.15). There was a weak positive correlation between the CAS and monthly income (rho = 0.33; P = 0.010).

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Plus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and SocINDEX (January 2000CDecember 2020). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Empirical studies in English or French with a qualitative design including an explicit methodological description of the development and/or use of vignettes to collect qualitative data from healthcare professionals. Titles and abstracts were screened, and full text was reviewed by pairs of researchers according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction included study characteristics, definition, development and utilisation of a vignette, as well as strengths, limitations and recommendations from authors of the included articles. Systematic qualitative thematic analysis was performed, followed by data matrices to display the findings according to the scoping review questions. RESULTS: Ten articles were included. An explicit definition of vignettes was provided in only half the studies. Variations of the development process (steps, expert consultation and pretesting), data collection and analysis demonstrate opportunities for improvement in rigour and transparency of the whole research process. Most studies failed to address quality criteria of the wider qualitative design and to discuss study limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Vignette-based studies in qualitative research appear promising to deepen our understanding of sensitive and challenging situations lived by healthcare professionals. However, vignettes require conceptual clarification and robust methodological guidance so that researchers can systematically plan their study.

These models are usually equipped with tightly parametrized prior distributions which favor a small and gradual change in parameters. Do such prior distributions suppress some degree of time variation in the VAR coefficients? We address this question by proposing a flexible global-local prior, namely the horseshoe prior. It turns out that conventional priors may suppress economically relevant patterns of time variation. Using the global-local prior, we observe that parameter change and changes in systematic monetary policy can be abrupt rather than smooth. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of the horseshoe prior with a range of plausible alternatives. Finally, we find that a VAR with a stochastic volatility specification using the horseshoe prior is well suited to modelling the extreme observations due to Covid-19. In contrast the conventional prior (spuriously) picks up an increase of volatilities even before the Covid crisis.","output":"The horseshoe prior for time-varying parameter VARs and Monetary Policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, controversial data were reported concerning angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) that induced a number of physicians to stop using them in patients with COVID-19. Although large-scale studies have ruled out this concern, it is common experience that patients with COVID-19 taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs are at increased risk of death. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons for this apparently high mortality rate. METHODS: During the first wave of the pandemic, we conducted a field study of 427 consecutive patients with COVID-19 upon their admission to the emergency department of a hospital in one of the most severely hit cities in northern Italy, and 30 days later. The disease was defined as being mild, moderate or severe on the basis of clinical, laboratory and imaging data, and a multivariate model was used to analyse the determinants of mortality. RESULTS: Within 30 days of admission, 31.6% of the patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and 15.2% of those not treated with these drugs had died. Multivariate analysis showed that the determinants of mortality were age (p = 0.0001), hypertension (p = 0.0120) and diabetes (p = 0.0129), whereas ACE inhibitors or ARBs had no effect on mortality. There was no significant difference between the patients treated with ACE inhibitors and those treated with ARBs. CONCLUSION: The apparently increased mortality of patients with COVID-19 receiving long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is not due to the drugs themselves, but to the conditions associated with their use.","output":"Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 on Renin Angiotensin System Inhibitor Long-Term Treatment: An Observational Study Showing that Things Are Not Always as They Seem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to verify the quality of life and eating habits of patients with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this work, we evaluate whether disruptions related to Covid-19 have affected new and existing patients' access to pharmacological therapies without interruption. We do so by performing a retrospective analysis on a dataset of 9.4 billion US prescription drug claims from 252 million patients from May, 2019 through August, 2020 (about 93% of prescriptions dispensed within those months). Using fixed effect (conditional likelihood) linear models, we evaluate continuity of care, how many days of supply patients received, and the likelihood of discontinuing therapy for drugs from classes with significant population health impacts. Findings indicate that more prescriptions were filled in March 2020 than in any prior month, followed by a significant drop in monthly dispensing. Compared to the pre-Covid era, a patient's likelihood of discontinuing some medications increased after the spread of Covid: norgestrel-ethinyl estradiol (hormonal contraceptive) discontinuation increased 0.62% (95% CI: 0.59% to 0.65%, p<0.001); dexmethylphenidate HCL (ADHD stimulant treatment) discontinuation increased 2.84% (95% CI: 2.79% to 2.89%, p<0.001); escitalopram oxalate (SSRI antidepressant) discontinuation increased 0.57% (95% CI: 0.561% to 0.578%, p<0.001); and haloperidol (antipsychotic) discontinuation increased 1.49% (95% CI: 1.41% to 1.57%, p<0.001). In contrast, the likelihood of discontinuing tacrolimus (immunosuppressant) decreased 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12% to 0.19%, p<0.001). The likelihood of discontinuing buprenorphine/naloxone (opioid addiction therapy) decreased 0.59% (95% CI: 0.55% to 0.62% decrease, p<0.001). We also observe a notable decline in new patients accessing these latter two therapies. Most US patients were able to access chronic medications during the early months of Covid-19, but still were more likely to discontinue their therapies than in previous months. Further, fewer than normal new patients started taking medications that may be vital to their care. Providers would do well to inquire about adherence and provide prompt, nonjudgmental, re-initiation of medications.

Index cases were notified from the referral hospital. Contacts were traced and followed-up for 14 days. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed at day 0 and day 14 for contacts. Results In total, 368 contacts were identified from 81 index cases (median of 7 contacts per index case), from which 308 were traced successfully.

However, no country has measured the market-wide extent of the problem, and no standardized methods exist to estimate the prevalence of either substandard or falsified medicines. This is, in part, because the task seems overwhelming; medicine markets are huge and diverse, and testing medicines is expensive. Many countries do operate some form of postmarket surveillance of medicine, but their methods and goals differ. There is currently no clear guidance on which surveillance method is most appropriate to meet specific public health goals. In this viewpoint, we aimed to discuss the utility of both case finding and risk-based sentinel surveillance for substandard and falsified medicines, linking each to specific public health goals. We posit that choosing the system most appropriate to the goal, as well as implementing it with a clear understanding of the factors driving the production and sale of substandard and falsified medicines, will allow for surveillance resources to be concentrated most efficiently. We adapted principles used for disease outbreak responses to suggest a case-finding system that uses secondary data to flag poor-quality medicines, proposing risk-based indicators that differ for substandard and falsified medicines. This system potentially offers a cost-effective way of identifying cases for market withdrawal, enhanced oversight, or another immediate response. We further proposed a risk-based sentinel surveillance system that concentrates resources on measuring the prevalence of substandard and falsified medicines in the risk clusters where they are most likely to be found. The sentinel surveillance system provides base data for a transparent, spreadsheet-based model for estimating the national prevalence of substandard and falsified medicines. The methods we proposed are based on ongoing work in Indonesia, a large and diverse middle-income country currently aiming to achieve universal health coverage.

We defined positive patients as cases (n. 710) and negatives as controls (n. 619), for a total number of patients of 1.329. The study was approved by the local ethics committee Area 3 Milan. Data were automatically extracted from the hospital laboratory SQL-based repository in anonymized form. We considered as outcomes potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chlorine (Cl-) and calcium (Ca++) as continuous and as categorical variables, in their relation with age, sex and SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Results We observed a higher prevalence of hypokalemia among patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 (13.7% vs 6% of negative subjects). Positive patients had a higher probability to be admitted to the ED with hypokalemia (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.8-4.1 p<0.0001) and women were twice as likely to be affected than men (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.67-3.54 p<0.001).

RESULTS Of 179 patients admitted with ischemic stroke during the study periods, 80 had emergent large-vessel occlusion, of whom 36 were in the pandemic group. Patients in the pandemic group were younger (66 versus 72 years, P < .061) and had lower ASPECTS (7 versus 9, P < .001) and took longer to arrive at the hospital (361 versus 152 minutes, P < .004) with no other major differences. There was a decreased rate of thrombolysis administration (22% versus 43%, P < .049) and a decreased number of patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (33% versus 61%, P < .013). CONCLUSIONS The pandemic led to delays in patients arriving at hospitals, leading to decreased patients eligible for treatment, while in-hospital evaluation and treatment times remain unchanged.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Emergent Large-Vessel Occlusion: Delayed Presentation Confirmed by ASPECTS."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coagulopathy in Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has been demonstrated by an increase in D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen and factor VIII.

We evaluate the results of intensive care unit (ICU) thrombosis prophylaxis of 5700 international unit (IU) nadroparin low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) twice daily. METHODS: After introduction of this high-dose pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis twice weekly anti-factor Xa (anti Xa) concentrations and results from routine laboratory and viscoelastic hemostatic tests in 16 ICU covid-19 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: During one week, median peak anti Xa activities were 0.38 [0.16-0.45] and 0.38 [0.20-0.58] at time point 1 and 2 respectively. Laboratory coagulation tests showed PT, AT and platelet count (PltC) values within normal range and markedly increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. Viscoelastic tests showed a maximum clot strength just above normal reference value, while fibrin clot strength was strongly increased. The overall contribution of fibrin to clot strength was high with 71 [56-85]%.

Methods: This was an ambispective observational cohort study, and 133 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and all symptoms over the course were analyzed qualitatively. The symptoms, their changes over the course in the cohort and in the different clinical types, etc. were illustrated. Differences in different periods and severities were analyzed through Chi square test, association with severity was analyzed through LASSO binomial logistic regression analysis. Inter-correlation and classification of symptoms were completed. Major symptoms were screened and their changes were illustrated. Results: A total of 43 symptoms with frequencies as 6067 in this cohort. Differences of symptoms in different stages and clinical types were significant. Expectoration, shortness of breath, dyspnea, diarrhea, poor appetite were positively but vomiting, waist discomfort, pharyngeal discomfort, acid reflux were negatively correlated with the combined-severe and critical type; dyspnea was correlated with the critical type. The 17 major symptoms were identified. The average daily frequency of symptoms per case was decreased continuously before the transition into the severe type and increased immediately one day before the transition and then decreased. It was decreased continuously before the transition date of the critical type and increased from the transition into the critical type to the next day and decreased thereafter. Dyspnea (P<0.001), shortness of breath (P<0.01) and chest distress (P<0.05) were correlated with death and their corresponding coefficient was 0.393, 0.258, 0.214, respectively.

Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak. Methods: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. Results: From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled.

Neutralizing antibody geometric mean ID(50) titers (GMT) were measured using a lentivirus-based pseudovirus neutralizing assay at day 1 and 4 weeks (day 57) following the second mRNA-1273 dose, compared with wild-type (D614G). RESULTS: At 4 weeks following a second dose of mRNA-1273 (100 g), the GMT was reduced 28.8-fold compared with D614G in adults (18 years). In adolescents (12C17 years), the GMT was 11.8-fold lower than D614G, 4 weeks after a second dose of mRNA-1273 (100 g), and compared with adults, were 1.5- and 3.8-fold higher for D614G and the Omicron variant, respectively. In children (6-<12 years), 4 weeks post-second dose of 50 g mRNA-1273, Omicron GMTs were reduced 22.1-fold versus D614G and were 2.0-fold higher for D614G and 2.5-fold higher for Omicron compared with adults.

RESULTS: We found 85 patients (66 liver, 16 kidney, 2 kidney-pancreas and 1 liver-kidney recipient) who acquired COVID-19. Most common symptoms included fever (48.2%), cough (41.2%), myalgia (41.2%), and fatigue (40%). Dyspnea developed in 33% of patients. Overall, one-third of patients had an oxygen saturation of bellow 90% on admission. Patients were hospitalized for a median (IQR) of 9 (5, 13.7) days and had a 33.9% ICU admission rate.

After immunization, sera were collected for antigen-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody titer analyses. We found that both pSARS-S and pSARS2-S immunization induced similar levels of antibodies against S2 of SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, only pSARS2-S immunization induced antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. We further found that pSARS2-S immunization, but not pSARS-S immunization, could induce very high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We further analyzed SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific T cell responses and found that the immune responses were biased toward Th1.

Early evidence has suggested that IL-6R blockers may confer benefit, particularly in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). We leveraged large-scale human genetic data to investigate whether IL6-R blockade may confer therapeutic benefit in Covid-19. A genetic instrument consisting of seven genetic variants in or close to IL6R was recently shown to be linked to altered levels of c-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, circulating IL-6 and soluble IL-6R, concordant to known effects of pharmacological IL-6R blockade. We investigated the effect of these IL6R variants on risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 and other SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes using data from The Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative. The IL6R variants were strongly associated with serum CRP levels in UK Biobank. Meta-analysis of scaled estimates revealed a lower risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR 0.93 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.90-0.96, P = 9.5 x 10-7), recapitulating this established indication for IL-6R blockers (e.g. tocilizumab and sarilumab). The IL-6R instrument was associated with lower risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 (OR 0.88 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.78-0.99, P = 0.03). We found a consistent association when using a population-based control group (i.e. all non-cases; OR 0.91 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.87-0.96, P = 4.9 x 10-4). Evaluation of further SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes suggested association with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no evidence of association with Covid-19 complicated by death or requiring respiratory support. We performed several sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our findings. Our results serve as genetic evidence for the potential efficacy of IL-6R blockade in Covid-19. Ongoing large-scale RCTs of IL-6R blockers will be instrumental in identifying the settings, including stage of disease, in which these agents may be effective.","output":"Genetic inhibition of interleukin-6 receptor signaling and Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Background and Objectives Chronic diseases, such as inherited bleeding disorders (IBD) are often associated with high costs of medical care. COVID-19 containment measures, including isolation and triage, led to restrictions in the health care of chronically ill patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health care of IBD patients. Methods In this multicentre cross-sectional study to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health and quality of care of patients with inherited bleeding disorder, an ad hoc questionnaire was sent to 586 patients/parents of children with haemophilia A, B or von Willebrand syndrome type 3. In addition to demographic and clinical data, patients/parents of patients with inherited bleeding disorders were asked about their thoughts, concerns and experiences regarding their medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences between clinical subgroups were calculated. Results Significant differences were found between subgroups (severity, type of therapy, product class, comorbidities) with regard to the transmission of COVID-19 through plasma products, the effects of COVID-19 positive test results, fear of getting COVID-19, delayed drug supply and physiotherapy treatment. Discussion The medical care of patients with inherited bleeding disorders, who need a continuous supply of essential drugs, is a particular challenge in times of pandemics. Therefore, worries and fears of IBD patients should be taken seriously and innovative communication channels established to maintain therapy standards and quality of care.","output":"Auswirkungen der COVID-19 Pandemie auf die medizinische Versorgung von Patienten mit angeborenen Blutungsneigungen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic pain face several challenges in using clinical tools to help them monitor, understand, and make meaningful decisions about their pain conditions. Our group previously presented data on Painimation, a novel electronic tool for communicating and assessing pain. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the human-centered design and development approach (inspiration, ideation, and implementation) that led to the creation of Painimation. METHODS: We planned an iterative and cyclical development process that included stakeholder engagement and feedback from users. Stakeholders included patients with acute and chronic pain, health care providers, and design students. Target users were adults with acute or chronic pain who needed clinical assessment and tracking of the course of their pain over time. Phase I (inspiration) consisted of empathizing with users, understanding how patients experience pain, and identifying the barriers to accurately expressing and assessing pain. This phase involved understanding how patients communicate pain symptoms to providers, as well as defining limitations of current models of clinical pain assessment tools. In Phase II (ideate) we conceptualized and evaluated different approaches to expressing and assessing pain. The most promising concept was developed through an iterative process that involved end users and stakeholders. In Phase III (implementation), based on stakeholder feedback from initial designs and prototypes of abstract pain animations (painimations), we incorporated all concepts to test a minimally viable product, a fully functioning pain assessment app. We then gathered feedback through an agile development process and applied this feedback to finalizing a testable version of the app that could ultimately be used in a pain clinic. RESULTS: Engaging intended users and stakeholders in an iterative, human-centered design process identified 5 criteria that a pain assessment tool would need to meet to be effective in the medical setting. These criteria were used as guiding design principles to generate a series of pain assessment concept ideas. This human-centered approach generated 8 highly visual painimations that were found to be acceptable and useable for communicating pain with medical providers, by both patients with general pain and patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). While these initial steps continued refinement of the tool, further data are needed. Agile development will allow us to continue to incorporate precision medicine tools that are validated in the clinical research arena. CONCLUSIONS: A multiphase, human-centered design approach successfully resulted in the development of an innovation that has potential to improve the quality of medical care, particularly for underserved populations. The use of Painimation may especially benefit the medical care of minority populations with chronic and difficult-to-treat pain, such as adults with SCD. The insights generated from this study can be applied to the development of patient-reported outcomes tools that are more patient-centered, engaging, and effective.","output":"A Novel Method for Digital Pain Assessment Using Abstract Animations: Human-Centered Design Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A trend of stage-by-stage increase in tumorsphere (TS) formation from glioma samples has been reported. Despite this trend, not all surgical specimens give rise to TSs, even World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV gliomas. Furthermore, it has been reported that differences in overall survival of primary glioblastoma patients depends on the propensity of their tumors to form TSs. However, the weights of fresh specimens vary from one surgical isolate to the next. METHODS: Accordingly, we evaluated the relationship between the weights of surgical specimens in WHO grade IV gliomas with the capacity to isolate TSs. Thirty-five fresh WHO grade IV glioma specimens were separated into two groups, based on whether they were positive or negative for TS isolation, and the relationship between TS isolation and weight of surgical specimens was assessed. RESULTS: We observed no significant difference in the weights of surgical samples in the two groups, and found that the optimal weight of specimens for TSs isolation was 500 mg. CONCLUSION: Thus, contrary to our expectations, the ability to isolate TSs from WHO grade IV glioma specimens was not related to the weight of fresh specimens.","output":"Success of tumorsphere isolation from WHO grade IV gliomas does not correlate with the weight of fresh tumor specimens: an immunohistochemical characterization of tumorsphere differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of a prosthetic material is the best treatment option for ventral hernia repair; one of the most frequently performed abdominal surgery procedures. This preclinical study compares the behavior of a new mesh (Parietex composite ventral patch [Ptx]) with that of two existing meshes used for ventral hernia repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-four New Zealand White rabbits (3000 g) were used in an experimental model of umbilical hernia repair (diameter 1.5 cm). The materials tested were: Ventralex ST hernia patch (Vent) (Bard Davol Inc, Warwick, RI) (n = 18); Proceed ventral patch (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) (PVP) (n = 18) and Ptx (Covidien, Sofradim, Trevoux, France) (n = 18). At 3, 7, 14 d, and 6 wk after implant, peritoneal behavior and adhesion formation were assessed by sequential laparoscopy. Mesh mesothelial cover was determined by scanning electron microscopy. Host tissue ingrowth (collagens I and III) and the macrophage response were assessed by immunohistochemical labeling. Animals were euthanized at 2, 6 wk, and 6 mo after surgery. Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Adhesion formation from 3 d-6 wk was significantly greater (P < 0.05) for PVP compared with Vent or Ptx. Three encapsulated PVP implants showed \\"tissue-integrated\\" adhesions affecting the intestinal loops. All three implant types showed similar patterns of collagen l and III deposition. The PVP mesh elicited the greater macrophage response both at 2 wk and 6 mo. CONCLUSIONS Ptx and Vent showed excellent mesothelialization, which led to minimum adhesion formation. The appropriate tissue integration of Ptx in the parietal neoperitoneum is likely attributable to its deployment system.","output":"Comparing the host tissue response and peritoneal behavior of composite meshes used for ventral hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Over the past three decades, there has been a 900% increase in the number of women experiencing incarceration in Minnesota. We wished to test whether handwriting, as creative visual art expression for women in jail, would be a positive experience for them as well as for individuals viewing the artwork during expositions. Methods: Over a 2-year period, the principal artist invited women residents from four separate county jails in Minnesota, to handwrite their thoughts on a sheet of paper. Two hundred twenty-three women residents participated in the artist-led handwriting/visual art sessions and gave permission to use their authentic script, anonymously, for presentation in a 3-D visual art form. At the conclusion of the sessions, a survey was offered at each venue, which asked three questions relative to the participation in the handwriting art project: (1) Did it have a positive impact on me? (2) Would you recommend it to other women who are incarcerated? (3) Do you want to participate in more projects such as this during your incarceration? The resulting artwork of more than 1,000 sculptures, each exhibiting a portion of the women's original script, was displayed at several public showings and a survey was offered at each venue, which asked: (1) Did the exhibition increase awareness of mass incarceration of women? (2) Did it help the viewer see women who are incarcerated? (3) Did it make the viewer realize that action is needed to reduce incarceration of women? Survey questions were graded from 1 to 5, with a sliding scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Results: The impact of this project of art activism has been very positive on both participants and the larger audience. The vast majority of women residents responding to the survey either agreed or strongly agreed that their participation in the project (1) had a positive effect on them (94%), (2) would recommend it to other incarcerated women (94%), and (3) would want to participate in more projects such as this (93%). A total of 425 surveys were collected among the audience at several sites: the law school (N = 87), open studios (N = 268), and a public library (N = 62). The vast majority of individuals responding to the survey either agreed or strongly agreed that the exhibited work (1) increased awareness of the problem (93%), (2) showed the humanity behind the script (88%), and (3) suggested that interventions were needed to address the problem (86%). Conclusions: Women under incarceration in county jails, who participated in a visual art handwriting program, as part of a collaborative visual art project led by principal artist, found great value in the sessions and agreed that such programs should be available to other women in detention. The overwhelming majority of the audience of the resulting exhibitions in public venues strongly agreed that interventions are needed to address the mass incarceration of women in Minnesota, suggesting the importance of art as a vehicle for increasing awareness about social problems and perhaps social change.","output":"Inside Out: Change Through Art"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost every country causing devastating economic and social disruption and stretching healthcare systems to the limit. Furthermore, while being the current gold standard, existing test methods including NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests), clinical analysis of chest CT (Computer Tomography) scan images, and blood test results, require in-person visits to a hospital which is not an adequate way to control such a highly contagious pandemic. Therefore, top priority must be given, among other things, to enlisting recent and adequate technologies to reduce the adverse impact of this pandemic.

Motivated from these facts, this paper presents a new framework that leverages advanced machine learning and data analytics techniques for the early detection of coronavirus disease using smartphone embedded sensors. The proposal provides a simple to use and quickly deployable screening tool that can be easily configured with a smartphone. Experimental results indicate that the model can detect positive cases with an overall accuracy of 79% using only the data from the smartphone sensors. This means that the patient can either be isolated or treated immediately to prevent further spread, thereby saving more lives.

COVAX pools and channels funds from state and non-state actors to promising vaccine candidates, and has started to distribute successful candidates to participating states. The WHO, one of the leaders of COVAX, recognised vaccine doses would initially be scarce, and therefore, prepared a two-staged allocation mechanism they considered fair. In the first stage, vaccine doses are distributed equally among participating countries, while in the second stage vaccine doses will be allocated according to a countrys need. Ethicists have questioned whether this is the fairest distributionthey argue a countrys need should be taken into account from the start and correspondingly, have proposed a framework that treats individuals with equal moral concern, aims to minimise harm and gives priority to the worst-off. In this paper, we seek to explore these concerns by comparing COVAXs allocation mechanism to a targeted allocation based on need. We consider which distribution would more likely maximise well-being and align with principles of equity. We conclude that although in theory, a targeted distribution in proportion to a countrys need would be more morally justifiable, when political realities are taken into account, an equal distribution seems more likely to avert a greater number of deaths and reduce disparities.","output":"WHOs allocation framework for COVAX: is it fair?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we aim to report the outcomes for COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancy in Turkey.

For the first time, the impact of different dissociation species (cationic, zwitterionic and anionic forms) of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on its photocatalytic transformation fate was systematically studied in a UVA/LED/TiO2 system. The dissociation forms of CIP at different pH affected the photocatalytic degradation kinetics, transformation products (TPs) formation as well as degradation pathways. Zwitterionic form of CIP exhibited the highest degradation rate constant (0.2217  0.0179 min-1), removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) and release of fluoride ion (F-). Time-dependent evolution profiles on TPs revealed that the cationic and anionic forms of CIP mainly underwent piperazine ring dealkylation, while zwitterionic CIP primarily proceeded through defluorination and piperazine ring oxidation. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculation based on Fukui index well interpreted the active sites of different CIP species.

Here, we present a comprehensive set of immunological data from a cohort of individuals (n=43), 12 months after mild COVID-19 disease and in the absence of virus re-exposure.Methods: Serum and PBMC were collected from mild-COVID-19 convalescents 12 months after the COVID-19 positive PCR (n=43) and from healthy SARS-CoV-2-seronegative controls (n=15). Serum titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins were quantified by ELISA and virus neutralisation activity was assessed using SARS-CoV-2-Spike pseudovirus particles. Frequencies of Spike and RBD-specific memory B cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Magnitude of memory T cell responses was quantified and phenotyped with an activation-induced marker assay.Findings: In the absence of re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike- and RBD-specific antibodies were present in 90% of COVID-19 convalescents 12 months post-infection. RBD-specific IgG + memory B cells were maintained in 88.9% of patients, while 62% of patients had serum neutralising activity.

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort design using Symphony Health (JanuaryCNovember 2020). Sample population included about 13.3 million patients with at least one prescription claim 6 months from date of diagnosis of COVID-19 or COVID-19 like symptom. Cohorts were categorized based on diagnosis codes; COVID-19 positive cohorts 1 to 3 with severe, mild, and no symptoms, respectively and non-COVID-19 cohorts 4 and 5 with severe and mild symptoms, respectively. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic characteristics and acute antibiotic utilization (7 days) including total number of antibiotics, weekly rate of prescribing, and proportion of fills in three appropriateness categories (always appropriate, potentially appropriate, never appropriate). RESULTS: Three cohorts with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis code constituted a total of about 1.8 million patients (13.53%). About 22.79% of COVID-19 positive groups had severe symptoms, 24.43% had moderate symptoms and the majority, 52.78%, had no symptoms. In the analytical sample of 13 million, about 4.2 million antibiotic prescriptions were prescribed to 2.5 million patients (19%) within 7 days of the first diagnosis of either COVID-19 or COVID-19-like symptoms. Within the COVID-19 positive cohorts, about 11% received an antibiotic prescription, while the non-COVID-19 cohorts, about 19.70% received an antibiotic. Among patients with antibiotic prescriptions, about 37.01% were prescribed an antibiotic appropriately, 39.46% were prescribed a potentially appropriate antibiotic and about 22.64% received an inappropriate antibiotic. Among patients prescribed antibiotics, azithromycin was the most common, ranging from 21.80 to 44.80% for each cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall proportion of COVID-19 patients receiving antibiotics was much lower than non-COVID-19 patients, the findings suggest use of antibiotics persisted despite guidelines against widespread use, particularly for patients with moderate and mild COVID-19 symptoms.","output":"Antibiotic prescribing trends in the US during the first 11 months of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In wake of COVID-19, the world has adapted to a new order. People have started wearing mask on their faces to prevent getting infected. The present face recognition models are no longer proving to be efficient in the current circumstances. This is because, most of the informative part of the face is covered by mask. The periocular recognition therefore holds the key to future of face recognition. However, the periocular region proves to be insufficiently enough to generate highly discriminative features. Also, most of the pre-COVID-19 algorithms fail to work in cases, where the number of training images available is very less. We propose a lightweight periocular recognition framework that uses thermo-visible features and ensemble subspace network classifier to improve upon the existing periocular recognition systems named as Masked Mobile Lightweight Thermo-visible Face Recognition (MmLwThV). The framework successfully improves the accuracy over a single visible modality by mitigating the effect of noise present in the thermo-visible features. The experiments on WHU-IIP dataset and an in-house collected dataset named, CVBL masked dataset, successfully validate the efficacy of our proposed framework. The MmLwFR framework is lightweight and can be easily deployed on mobile phones with a visible and an infrared camera.","output":"MmLwThV framework: A masked face periocular recognition system using thermo-visible fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Large-scale outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have re-emerged in China in recent years. However, little is known about the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of field strains of PED virus (PEDV) in China in 2016C2017. To address this issue, in this study, 116 diarrhea samples were collected from pig farms in 6 Chinese provinces in 2016C2017 and were detected using PCR for main porcine enteric pathogens, including PEDV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine kobuvirus (PKV). In addition, the complete S genes from 11 representative PEDV strains were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: PCR detection showed that 52.6% (61/116) of these samples were positive for PEDV. Furthermore, sequencing results for the spike (S) genes from 11 of the epidemic PEDV strains showed 93C94% nucleotide identity and 92C93% amino acid identity with the classical CV777 strain. Compared with the CV777 vaccine strain, these strains had an insertion (A(133)), a deletion (G(155)), and a continuous 4-amino-acid insertion ((56)NNTN(59)) in the S1 region. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene indicated that the 11 assessed PEDV strains were genetically diverse and clustered into the G2 group. These results demonstrate that the epidemic strains of PEDV in China in 2016C2017 are mainly virulent strains that belong to the G2 group and genetically differ from the vaccine strain. Importantly, this is the first report that the samples collected in Hainan Province were positive for PEDV (59.2%, 25/42). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this article presents the first report of a virulent PEDV strain isolated from Hainan Island, China. The results of this study will contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of PEDV in China.","output":"Detection and phylogenetic analyses of spike genes in porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains circulating in China in 2016C2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for ongoing efforts to combat antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacterial infections.

Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and toxins have been shown to bind to the immobilized heparin in a similar way to the interaction with heparan sulfate on the cell surface. This binding is nonreversible and as such, the pathogens are removed from the bloodstream. In this review, we describe the pathophysiological basis and rationale for using heparin for pathogen removal from the blood as well as exploring the technology behind the adaptation of heparin to deprive it of its systemic anticoagulant activity. In addition, we summarize the in vitro data as well as the available preclinical testing and published clinical reports. Finally, we discuss the enormous potential of this technology in an era of increasing antibiotic resistance and high mortality associated with sepsis and consider the application of this as a possible treatment option for COVID-19.","output":"Heparin 2.0: A New Approach to the Infection Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent pandemic of COVID\\\\19 revealed that a highly transmissible virus threatens all humanity because extensive mobility, migration, and millions of passengers who travel worldwide shape our globalized environment and make containment of a virus more difficult In a war between humans and viruses, we should have the necessary weapons, such as masks, gloves, ventilators, and so forth However, during the COVID\\\\19 outbreak, there was a shortage of this basic medical and personal protective equipment (MAPPE), even for the health workers This note focuses on this issue and suggests that a global organization, which stores and renews basic MAPPE would be beneficial in the fight against the next pandemic and that such an organization can be established without significantly increasing the public expenses of the countries [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of World Medical & Health Policy is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Fighting a war without weapons?

METHODS Pulsatility index of middle (MCA), anterior (ACA), posterior cerebral (PCA), umbilical (UA), uterine (UtA) and branch of the pulmonary arteries (PA) were obtained, by ultrasound, before (baseline), during (hyperoxia) and after 15 minutes of maternal administration of 8 L/min of 100% oxygen, through a non-rebreathing face mask, in normal singleton pregnancies within 20 to 38 weeks' gestation. CVRO2 was defined as changes greater than zero in z-score of PI of the cerebral arteries from baseline to hyperoxia. Logistic modeling was applied to identify CVRO2 predictors. RESULTS 97 pregnancies were eligible. In the overall population, median z-scores of PI of MCA, ACA and PCA did not differ between study phases. Based on the logistic model, baseline z-scores for cerebral PI and GA were the best predictors of CVRO2 . CONCLUSIONS In low-risk pregnancies, fetal CVRO2 to hyperoxia does not occur uniformly but depends on cerebral PI and GA at baseline.

Areas covered: This review comprehensively details the available small animal models of filovirus infection and discusses the benefits and shortcomings of each model with respect to the development of MCM. An up-to-date evaluation of mouse, hamster, guinea pig, and ferret models is provided. Expert opinion: The recent development of the domestic ferret model for ebolavirus offers a small animal model that faithfully reproduces most features of human disease without the need for viral adaptation or an immunocompromised host. That being said, choosing a small animal model to evaluate a particular MCM must consider potential confounders associated with each model.

Several studies focusing on the patient's perspective have illustrated that telemedicine is comparable to traditional office visits in terms of cost, communication, and overall satisfaction. However, there is sparse data on the provider's experience. METHODS: With IRB approval, we assessed provider satisfaction with telemedicine at Urology programs in the U.S. through an electronic survey. The 25-question survey was based on the Patient Assessment of Communication of Telehealth which is a validated 33 question instrument that has been utilized to assess the quality of patient-provider communication in telemedicine. Experience with telemedicine was assessed in 2 categories: technical aspects and communication with patients. Variables were rated using a 5-point Likert Scale. RESULTS: There were 144 responses to the survey. 50% of providers reported not receiving any formal training in using telemedicine. This differed significantly by training level with 55% of attendings having had received training vs 20% of residents. Providers felt they would most benefit from training in billing (52%) rather than equipment use (33%) or communication (28%). 87% of providers felt comfortable discussing sensitive topics while only 55% felt comfortable using telehealth to schedule surgery (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Urology providers are generally satisfied with their experience communicating with patients via telemedicine and the majority would opt to continue utilizing telemedicine.

Virtual platforms have potential advantages such as accessibility and availability but simply transferring educational material to the online environment may not ensure high quality learning. Clinical examination is a fundamental principle of medical assessment, and this study aimed to assess the role of technology in teaching these skills. AIMS/OBJECTIVES: To determine whether three teaching modalities were of equal efficacy in teaching examination of the shoulder joint to na?ve medical students. METHODS: Sixty-seven pre-clinical medical students na?ve to large joint examination were recruited. Participants completed a learning style questionnaire and were then block randomised to three study: textbook study, face-to-face seminar, or video tutorial via online platform. The same examination technique was taught in all groups, with the intervention being the method of delivery All second year students were eligible for inclusion. The single exclusion criteria was previous exposure to clinical examination teaching. Students were assessed using a standardised scoring system at baseline (pre-intervention), and days 5 and 19 post-intervention (maximum score 30). Assessors were blinded to group allocation. The primary outcome was assessment score at day 5 post intervention. RESULTS: There was no difference between the three groups at baseline assessment (mean scores 2.4 for textbook, 2.8 for face-to-face, and 3.1 for video; p = 0.267). Mean post-intervention scores were 16.5 textbook, 25.5 face-to-face, and 22.4 video (p < 0.001, (2) = .449). There was no change between day 5 and day 19 post-intervention assessment scores in any group (p = 0.373), Preferred learning style did not affect scores (p = 0.543). CONCLUSION: Face-to-face teaching was the most effective method for teaching clinical examination of the shoulder. Technology can potentially increase accessibility and remove geographic barriers, but is not as effective if teaching techniques are simply mirrored in an online format. Online platforms allow in depth data analysis of how learners interact with educational material and this may have value in improving the design of online educational materials, and is a potential area for further research.

Infection results in dysregulated systemic inflammation, multi-organ dysfunction, and critical illness. Cells of the central nervous system are also affected, triggering an uncontrolled neuroinflammatory response. Low doses of glucocorticoids, administered orally or intravenously, reduce mortality among moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. However, low doses administered by these routes do not reach therapeutic levels in the CNS. In contrast, intranasally administered dexamethasone can result in therapeutic doses in the CNS even at low doses. METHODS: This is an approved open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of intranasal versus intravenous dexamethasone administered in low doses to moderate and severe COVID-19 adult patients. The protocol is conducted in five health institutions in Mexico City. A total of 120 patients will be randomized into two groups (intravenous vs. intranasal) at a 1:1 ratio. Both groups will be treated with the corresponding dexamethasone scheme for 10 days. The primary outcome of the study will be clinical improvement, defined as a statistically significant reduction in the NEWS-2 score of patients with intranasal versus intravenous dexamethasone administration. The secondary outcome will be the reduction in mortality during hospitalization.

All baseline evaluations were performed before the COVID-19 pandemic and 69.7% of the one-year assessments were completed after the first lockdown. Cognitive decline was defined as the decrease in MoCA from baseline to the one-year evaluation below 1.5 standard deviations of the distribution of changes in the whole cohort. Participants scoring below age- and education-specific normative reference values in the MoCA were considered to have cognitive impairment. Age- and education-adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were computed for the association between ADT and cognitive outcomes.

METHODS In a prospective, randomized controlled trial, infants 3 to 16 weeks of age with PTT undergoing frenotomy were examined using a bottle-feeding system capable of objectively measuring tongue function. Validated patient-reported outcome measures were also obtained simultaneously. RESULTS Forty-seven infants with PTT were enrolled into an observational/control arm (n = 23) or interventional/surgical treatment arm (n = 24).

Therefore, its detection can improve patient outcomes and minimize the risk of adverse consequences. Even though multiple self-reported medication adherence assessment scales are available, very few of them exist in Arabic language. Therefore, the aim of this study was to validate a newly translated Arabic version of the Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale (ARMS) among patients with chronic health conditions. Methods: This is a single-center cross-sectional study that was conducted between October 10th 2018 and March 23rd 2021. ARMS was first translated to Arabic using the forward-backward translation method. The translated scale was then piloted among 21 patients with chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, etc.) to examine its reliability and comprehensibility using the test-retest method. Thereafter, the Arabic-translated ARMS was self-administered to adult patients aged 18 years with chronic health conditions visiting the primary care clinics of a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Construct validity was examined using factor analysis with varimax rotation. Results: Of the 264 patients who were invited to participate, 202 (76.5%) consented and completed the questionnaire. Most of the participants were males (69.9%), married (75.2%), having a college degree or higher (50.9%), retired or unemployed (65.2%), aged  50 years (65.2%), and are diabetic (95.9%). The 12-item Arabic-translated ARMS mean score was 17.93  4.90, and the scale yielded good internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha = 0.802) and test-retest reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.97).

To achieve the purpose of this study data from three family medicine practices from the period November 2018 to May 2019 were corroborated. Anonymous questionnaires were applyed to the subjects. For this study, questions related to the habit of smoking and consuming alcohol were selected. The study aimed to analyze the associative relationships between acute coronary events and two of the most common behavioral risk factors, smoking and alcohol consumption. The highest prevalence of acute coronary events was observed in current smokers and in former smokers. The period of exposure to smoking showed that this is one of the variables most strongly associated with an increased risk of acute coronary events.

DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional multi-country online survey between May and July 2020. We used a study-specific questionnaire mainly based on the adaptation of questions to assess food security and coping strategies from the World Food Programme's 'Emergency Food Security Assessment' and 'The Coping Strategy Index'. SETTING: The questionnaire was hosted online using Google Forms and shared using social media platforms. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1075 adult participants from eighty-two countries completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: As a prelude to COVID-19 lockdowns, 627 % of the participants reported to have stockpiled food, mainly cereals (595 % of the respondents) and legumes (488 %). An increase in the prices of staples, such as cereals and legumes, was widely reported. Price increases have been identified as an obstacle to food acquisition by 327 % of participants. Participants reported having lesser variety (504 %), quality (302 %) and quantity (392 %) of foods, with disparities across regions. Vulnerable groups were reported to be facing some struggle to acquire adequate food, especially people with chronic diseases (202 %), the elderly (173 %) and children (145 %). To cope with the situation, participants mostly relied on less preferred foods (49 %), reduced portion sizes (30 %) and/or reduced the number of meals (257 %).

Four hundred seventy-eight COVID-19 patients with positive real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or highly suggestive symptoms with computed tomography(CT) imaging results with typical findings of COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. The clinical features, initial laboratory, CT findings, and short-term outcomes (ICU admission, mortality, length of hospitalization, and recovery time) were recorded. In addition, the severity of pulmonary involvement was assessed using a semi-quantitative scoring system (0-25).

Smoke-free policy measures have been shown to be useful in protecting non-smokers from secondhand smoke, and can additionally increase cessation and reduce smoking initiation. Policies tend to be aimed primarily at enclosed public or workplace settings with very few countries attempting to control exposure in private or semiprivate spaces such as homes and cars, and, as a result, children may be benefiting less from smoke-free measures than adults. Compliance with legislation also varies by country and there is a need for education and empowerment together with guidance and changing social norms to help deliver the full benefits that smoke-free spaces can bring.

Peripheral and neural correlates of self-harm could lead to biomarkers to guide precision care. We therefore conducted a scoping review of research on peripheral and neural correlates of self-harm in this age group. METHODS PubMed and Embase databases were searched from January 1980-May 2020, seeking English language peer-reviewed studies about peripheral and neural correlates of self-harm, defined as completed suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, or non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in subjects, birth to 19 years of age. Studies were excluded if only investigating self-harm in persons with intellectual or developmental disability syndromes. A blinded multi-stage assessment process by pairs of co-authors selected final studies for review. Risk of bias estimates were done on final studies. RESULTS We screened 5537 unduplicated abstracts, leading to the identification of 79 eligible studies in 76 papers. Of these, 48 investigated peripheral correlates and 31 examined neural correlates. Suicidality was the focus in 2/3 of the studies, with NSSI and any type of self-harm (subjects recruited with suicidality, NSSI, or both) investigated in the remaining studies. All studies used observational designs (primarily case-control), most used convenience samples of adolescent patients which were predominately female and half of which were recruited based on a disorder. Over a quarter of the specific correlates were investigated with only one study. Inter-study agreement on findings from specific correlates with more than one study was often low. Estimates of Good for risk of bias were assigned to 37% of the studies and the majority were rated as Fair. CONCLUSIONS Research on peripheral and neural correlates of self-harm is not sufficiently mature to identify potential biomarkers. Conflicting findings were reported for many of the correlates studied. Methodological problems may have produced biased findings and results are mainly generalizable to patients and girls.

This paper describes a robust approach led by First Nations Health Authority and the Rural Coordination Centre of British Columbia. This was achieved using partnerships in British Columbia, Canada, where the health system features inequities in service and outcomes for rural and Indigenous populations. Social accountability is achieved when all stakeholders come together simultaneously as partners and agree on a path forward. This approach has enabled socially accountable healthcare, effecting change in the healthcare system by addressing the needs of the population. INNOVATION: Our innovative approach uses social accountability engagement to counteract persistent health inequities. This involves an adaptation of the Boelen Health Partnership model (policymakers, health administrators, health professionals, academics and community members) extended by addition of linked sectors (eg, industry and not-for-profits) to the Partnership Pentagram Plus. We used appreciative inquiry and deliberative dialogue focused on the rural scale and integrating Indigenous ways of knowing along with western scientific traditions (two-eyed seeing). Using this approach, partners are brought together to identify common interests and direction as a learning community. Equitable engagement and provision of space as peers and partners were key to this process. Groups with varying perspectives came together to create solutions, building on existing strengths and new collaborative approaches to address specific issues in the community and health services delivery. A resulting provincial table reflecting the Pentagram Plus model has fostered policies and practices over the last 3 years that have resulted in meaningful collaborations for health service change. CONCLUSION: This paper presents the application of the Partnership Pentagram Plus approach and uses appreciative inquiry and deliberative dialogue to bring about practical and positive change to rural and Indigenous communities.","output":"Addressing rural and Indigenous health inequities in Canada through socially accountable health partnerships"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryptosporidium spp. in diarrheic calves less than 30 days old from farms across Northern Ireland were examined over a year period by microscopic, genotyping, and subtyping techniques to characterize the transmission dynamics.

Immucillins are compared to the Glucantime standard drug in the chemotherapy of Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi infection in mice and hamsters. These agents are tested for toxicity and immune system response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: BALB/c mice were infected with 10(7) amastigotes, treated with IA, IH, SMIH or Glucantime (2.5mg/kg/day) and monitored for clinical variables, parasite load, antibody levels and splenocyte IFN-, TNF-, and IL-10 expression. Cytokines and CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+ lymphocyte frequencies were assessed in uninfected controls and in response to immucillins. Urea, creatinine, GOT and GPT levels were monitored in sera. Anti-Leishmania-specific IgG1 antibodies (anti-NH36) increased in untreated animals. IgG2a response, high levels of IFN-, TNF- and lower levels of IL-10 were detected in mice treated with the immucillins and Glucantime. Immucillins permitted normal weight gain, prevented hepato-splenomegaly and cleared the parasite infection (85C89%) without renal and hepatic toxicity. Immucillins promoted 35% lower secretion of IFN- in uninfected controls than in infected mice. IA and IH increased the CD4+ T and CD19+ B cell frequencies. SMIH increased only the proportion of CD-19 B cells. IA and IH also cured infected hamsters with lower toxicity than Glucantime. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Immucillins IA, IH and SMIH were effective in treating leishmaniasis in mice. In hamsters, IA and IH were also effective.

COVID-19 patients that develop cardiac injury are at increased risk of a worse clinical course with higher rates of mortality. Increasing amounts of evidence suggest that a system-wide inflammatory response and a cytokine storm mediated type syndrome plays a crucial role in disease progression. This systematic review investigates the possible role of hyperinflammation in inducing cardiac injury as one of the severe complications of COVID-19. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases to identify relevant clinical studies that investigated cardiovascular injury manifestations and reported inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. Only 29 studies met our inclusion criteria and the majority of these studies demonstrated significantly elevated inflammatory and cardiac blood markers. It was evident that underlying cardiovascular diseases may increase the risk of developing cardiac injury. However, many COVID-19 patients included in this review, developed different types of cardiac injury without having any underlying cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, many of these patients were either children or adolescents. Therefore, age and comorbidities may not always be the two main risk factors that dictate the severity and outcome of COVID-19. Further investigations are required to understand the underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity as an urgent requirement to develop the appropriate treatment and prevention strategies.

Wearing the SSHS in a fit testing hood, subjects were randomised to nebulised saccharin solution or placebo. Twenty were allocated to the saccharin group with 15 to placebo. Positive sweet taste represented test failure. Taste tests were performed with the helmet fan turned on and off. RESULTS: SSHS did not prevent saccharin taste (p < 0.0001). Within the saccharin cohort, 40% recorded a positive taste with the fan on and 100% with the fan off. There was a statistically significant difference in mean time-to-taste saccharin (p = 0.049) comparing fan on (123.5 s) vs. off (62.6 s).

Outcomes of transferred patients undergoing EAS were compared to patients primarily admitted to a tertiary care hospital from 01/2016 to 12/2018 using univariable and multivariable analyses. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Some 973 patients with a median (IQR) age of 58.1 (39.4C72.2) years and a median body mass index of 25.8 (22.5C29.3) kg/m(2) were included. The transfer group comprised 258 (26.3%) individuals and the non-transfer group 715 (72.7%).

Neither in the low surgical stress nor in the hollow viscus perforation group was the transfer status associated with mortality. However, in the potential bowel ischemia group inter-hospital transfer was a predictor for mortality (OR 3.54, 95%CI 1.03C12.12, p = 0.045).

Therefore, enhancing the public health surveillance system further will be helpful in managing upcoming pandemics at its earliest. Improvements in public health surveillance should be synchronised with the goals of Universal Health Coverage and its regulating standards of safe guarding universal health as a right besides privilege, ensuring equity, non-discrimination, guarding the affected individual's rights and respect their choice and placing health in people's hand. In alignment with the National Digital Health Mission, the new Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP) aims to substitute traditional surveillance data-entry system with modern advances in digital health and technology. This platform also initiates various sectors collaboration, including public and private healthcare organizations and civil societies. Recommendations to strengthen the surveillance system starts with enhancement of laboratory infrastructure, referral networks and health organizations at the block level with the aim of strengthening community-based surveillance and responding in a timely manner for upcoming outbreaks.","output":"Health Surveillance in India: Current and Future Prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Dysphonia and laryngeal problems are some of the manifestations of the COVID-19 pandemic due to respiratory disease as a primary effect of COVID-19. The aim of the present study was to investigate voice quality and vocal tract discomfort symptoms in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four COVID-19 patients with a mean age of 49.61  16.48 years and 44 healthy subjects with a mean age of 48.52  13.8 years participated in the study. The voice quality of the participants was evaluated using auditory-perceptual evaluation with the GRBAS scale. The vocal tract discomfort symptoms of the participants were assessed using the Persian version of the VTD scale. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 had higher scores in all items of the GRBAS, including grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain, than healthy subjects, and these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Among the GRBAS parameters, grade had the highest effect size and asthenia had the lowest effect size in both speech tasks. The COVID-19 patients had a greater frequency of vocal tract discomfort symptoms than healthy subjects in all items of the VTDp scale and these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in the following items: burning, tight, dry, pain, sore, irritable, and lump in the throat. The most and the least effect size in frequency of the vocal tract discomfort symptoms were related to dry (d = 1.502) and tickling (d = 0.157), respectively. Also, COVID-19 patients had more significant severity in all items of the VTDp scale except tight and tickling. The most and the least effect size in severity of the vocal tract discomfort symptoms was related to dry (d = 1.416) and tickling (d = 0.152), respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that COVID-19 patients have more deviations in voice quality than healthy subjects. Moreover, mild vocal tract discomfort is prevalent in patients with COVID-19, and patients have more frequent and severe physical discomforts of the vocal tract than healthy subjects.","output":"Voice Quality and Vocal Tract Discomfort Symptoms in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several trials have shown preliminary evidence for efficacy using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as a treatment for negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Here, we synthesize this literature using a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials of TMS in patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched for sham-controlled, randomized trials of TMS among patients with schizophrenia. The standardized mean difference (SMD, Cohen's d) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated for each study (TMS vs. sham) and pooled across studies using an inverse variance random effects model. We identified 56 studies with a total of 2550 participants that were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis showed statistically significant superiority of TMS (SMD=0.37, 95%CI: 0.23; 0.52, p-value <0.00001), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 4.85. Furthermore, stratified analyses suggested that TMS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, using a stimulation frequency >1 Hz, and a stimulation intensity at or above the motor threshold, was most efficacious. There was, however, substantial heterogeneity and high risk of bias among the included studies. In conclusion, TMS appears to be an efficacious treatment option for patients with schizophrenia suffering from negative symptoms, but the optimal TMS parameters have yet to be resolved.","output":"The efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for negative symptoms in schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Healthcare professionals (HCPs) experience difficulties in timely recognising and directing palliative care (PC) needs of their patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).

Tests for positive selection can identify apparently nonrandom patterns of mutation accumulation within genomes, highlighting regions where molecular function may have changed during the origin of a species. Several recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have identified signals of conservation and positive selection within the gene encoding Spike protein based on the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitution. Such tests cannot, however, detect changes in the function of RNA molecules. METHODS: Here we apply a test for branch-specific oversubstitution of mutations within narrow windows of the genome without reference to the genetic code. RESULTS: We recapitulate the finding that the gene encoding Spike protein has been a target of both purifying and positive selection. In addition, we find other likely targets of positive selection within the genome of SARS-CoV-2, specifically within the genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16. Homology-directed modeling indicates no change in either Nsp4 or Nsp16 protein structure relative to the most recent common ancestor. These SARS-CoV-2-specific mutations may affect molecular processes mediated by the positive or negative RNA molecules, including transcription, translation, RNA stability, and evasion of the host innate immune system. Our results highlight the importance of considering mutations in viral genomes not only from the perspective of their impact on protein structure, but also how they may impact other molecular processes critical to the viral life cycle.","output":"Positive selection within the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other Coronaviruses independent of impact on protein function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize inflammatory markers in comparisons of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) versus severe/non-severe COVID-19, severe MIS-C versus non-severe MIS-C, and among age groups of MIS-C.

METHODS: Using data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted in October 2020 among 855 adults (&#8805;18 years) in Greece, we estimated support rates for mandatory vaccination and respondents' intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19 as well as associations thereof with individual sociodemographic, clinical and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: About 74% of respondents supported mandatory vaccination and 62% intended to get vaccinated for COVID-19. The most prevalent reasons against COVID-19 vaccination were safety concerns related to the duration of clinical trials and potential side effects. Individuals who reported increased trust in healthcare authorities' recommendations, who revealed that their trust in the State increased due to the way the COVID-19 pandemic was handled, who used preventive services more often, and those with higher income were more likely to both support mandatory vaccination and to indicate intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Participants with worse or better self-reported health status (compared to average), younger adults, and females were less likely to intend to get vaccinated for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The survey revealed that the majority of the Greek citizens favour mandatory vaccination overall and intend to get vaccinated for COVID-19, driven mostly by utilization of preventive services and trust in healthcare authorities. However, intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19 was lower relative to mandatory vaccination support. This suggests a need to intensify evidence-based yet simplified messaging by esteemed healthcare providers to inform the public on the risks and benefits of vaccines.","output":"Mandatory vaccination support and intentions to get vaccinated for COVID-19: Results from a nationally representative general population survey in October 2020 in Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: There is a growing interest in the co-occurring natures of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and unmeasured types of adversity. The current body of knowledge may also lack plausible mechanisms linking ACEs to mental health in young adulthood. This study aims to identify early adversity patterns using expanded ACEs items and investigate the pathway of ACEs and self-esteem to depressive symptoms in young adulthood. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent and Adult Health, including a nationally representative sample in the U.S. (N = 10,702). We identified the ACEs patterns and estimated the direct and indirect associations between ACEs and depressive symptoms through self-esteem, using a latent class analysis with a distal outcome. RESULTS: This study identified four distinct groups of ACEs that include Child Maltreatment, Household Dysfunction, Violence, and Low Adversity. The Child Maltreatment class showed a significantly higher risk of depressive symptoms compared to other ACEs groups. Self-esteem mediated the negative association of child maltreatment with depressive symptoms. The Violence class presented a significantly higher risk of depressive symptoms than Low Adversity, but no mediation of self-esteem was found. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the profound consequence of child abuse/neglect and identifies self-esteem as a plausible mediating mechanism.

Antibodies against S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) have been shown to confer a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Assays quantitatively measuring anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be of great value for NAb screening of potential donors for convalescent-phase plasma therapy, assessing natural or vaccine-induced immunity, stratifying individuals for vaccine receipt, and documenting vaccine response. METHODS: Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S), a high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence double-antigen sandwich immunoassay for quantitative measurement of pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, was evaluated against NT on 357 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NT was performed in a BSL-3 laboratory using a Slovenian SARS-CoV-2 isolate; the NT titer &#8805;1:20 was considered positive. RESULTS: Elecsys-S detected pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 352/357 (98.6 %) samples. NAb were identified by NT in 257/357 (72 %) samples. The Elecsys-S/NT agreement was moderate (Cohen's kappa 0.56). High NT titer antibodies (&#8805;1:160) were detected in 106/357 (30 %) samples. Elecsys-S's pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations correlated with individual NT titer categories (the lowest concentrations were identified in NT-negative samples and the highest in samples with NT titer 1:1,280), and the Elecsys-S cutoff value for reasonable prediction of NAb generated after natural infection was established (133 BAU/mL). CONCLUSION: Although NT should remain the gold standard for assessing candidates for convalescent-phase plasma donors, selected commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays with optimized cutoff, like Elecsys-S, could be used for rapid, automated, and large-scale screening of individuals with clinically relevant NAb levels as suitable donors.","output":"Performance of the rapid high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay targeting total antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain in comparison to the neutralization assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We review the theoretical foundation for the need for human factors science. Over the past 2.8 million years, humans and tools have co-evolved. However, in the last century, technology is introduced at a rate that exceeds human evolution. The proliferation of computers and, more recently, robots, introduces new cognitive demands, as the human is required to be a monitor rather than a direct controller. The usage of robots and artificial intelligence is only expected to increase, and the present COVID-19 pandemic may prove to be catalytic in this regard. One way to improve overall system performance is to 'adapt the human to the machine' via task procedures, operator training, operator selection, a Procrustean mandate. Using classic research examples, we demonstrate that Procrustean methods can improve performance only to a limited extent. For a viable future, therefore, technology must adapt to the human, which underwrites the necessity of human factors science.

Furthermore, 92 CT scans of confirmed patients with influenza pneumonia, including 76 with influenza A and 16 with influenza B, scanned between January 1, 2019, to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Pulmonary lesion distributions, number, attenuation, lobe predomination, margin, contour, ground-glass opacity involvement pattern, bronchial wall thickening, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular septal thickening, and pleural effusion were evaluated in COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia cohorts. RESULTS: Peripheral and non-specific distributions in COVID-19 showed a markedly higher frequency compared with the influenza group (p < 0.05). Most lesions in COVID-19 showed balanced lobe localization, while in influenza pneumonia they were predominantly located in the inferior lobe (p < 0.05). COVID-19 presented a clear lesion margin and a shrinking contour compared with influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05). COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities, while a cluster-like pattern and bronchial wall thickening were more frequently seen in influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05).

Drilling services such as Measurement While Drilling (MWD), Logging While Drilling (LWD) and/or mud logging (ML) have been performed with an element of ROS for over the last two decades. Early adoption of these remote services delivered initial benefits to operators such as reducing HSE risks related to the travel and accommodation of field service employees at offshore rig sites. Meanwhile service companies were able to explore the added efficiencies gained by having multi-skilled employees providing a higher level of support to customers while also gaining additional agility to manage their personnel through tighter market cycles. The mutual benefit of this early adoption created a solid foundation for ROS to expand the scope of influence in drilling operations to include Directional Drilling (). Despite the maturity of ROS within a select community of operators in the North Sea, the industry standard for service delivery in offshore operations has continued to require field service employees to perform , MWD, and LWD services at rig sites until this past year. With the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, operators and service companies were quickly and abruptly confronted with the challenges of new HSE regulations, travel restrictions, and increased financial scrutiny. ROS presented a tailored solution to not only sustain business continuity but also create added efficiency, consistency, and risk management. Over the course of 2020, adoption of ROS rapidly accelerated across offshore operations in the North Sea and reached up to 100% penetration in key sectors. This tremendous achievement has made a significant impact on project performance and HSE efficiencies by ensuring on time service delivery while reducing personnel on board (POB). In addition, as more operators and services companies explore ways of reducing their carbon footprints and achieving a net zero future, ROS has proven to be a way to significantly reduce carbon emissions associated with transportation and utilities of offshore personnel. This paper discusses the methods that enabled a record high adoption rate for ROS and explores the critical components of its success. It illustrates the management of change in service delivery processes, the introduction of new technology to unlock greater productivity and synergies, and the new approach to design the core competencies needed to support ROS.

Fear of health, family pressure, and fear of a new procedure were major reason (27.2%) for unwillingness to donate. The main reasons for deferral among potential donors were multiparity (38%) and being overage/underage (31.6%). Finally, 468 donors were recruited including 408 by individual approach and 60 by a group approach. From these absence of detectable COVID-19 antibodies were found in 15.4%. Few donors (9.0%) were deferred as they had not completed 28 days post recovery. CONCLUSION: The process of CCP donor recruitment differs from that of whole blood donation and requires an individualised approach with involvement of clinicians in the initial phases of the pandemic. A group approach targeting specific organisations could be adopted for a successful CCP collection program. There is a need to relook into some aspects of donor selection such as consideration of multiparous female donors and overage/underage donors after reviewing scientific evidence.","output":"Deterrents in recruitment of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors: Experience from a hospital-based blood centre in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that features of a modern, sustainable and resilient city should not only relate to fulfilling economic and social urban strategies, but also to functional urban design, in particular, related to urban blue and green infrastructure (BGI) Using results from a web-based questionnaire survey conducted MayCJuly 2020 in Moscow (Russia) and Perth (Australia), this paper provides insights regarding citizens needs for and values of urban BGI as well as their changes during and after the COVID-19 restrictions Survey data collected during the lockdown period have captured information about peoples ability to access green and blue spaces within urban BGI, inequalities in access, feelings, and values as well as needs and perceived pathways of future development of urban natural environment In both cities, lockdowns limited access of people to green spaces which affected their mental and physical health Survey results revealed that the quality, functionality, and location of open green spaces illustrated a disparity in distribution, meaning that in many cases several communities from particular neighborhoods suffered from limited access to BGI Furthermore, in addition to analyzing perceptions and values of urban nature during the COVID-19 pandemic, some suggestions for improvement of urban BGI based on the survey responses are provided ? 2021 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Human dimensions of urban blue and green infrastructure during a pandemic.

COVID-19 is frequently associated with olfactory dysfunction after viral infection, which provides a research opportunity to evaluate the natural course of this neurological finding. Clinical trials and prospective and histological studies of new-onset post-viral olfactory dysfunction have been limited by small sample sizes and a paucity of advanced neuroimaging data and neuropathological samples. Although data from neuropathological specimens are now available, neuroimaging of the olfactory system during the acute phase of infection is still rare due to infection control concerns and critical illness and represents a substantial gap in knowledge. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: The active replication of SARS-CoV-2 within the brain parenchyma (ie, in neurons and glia) has not been proven. Nevertheless, post-viral olfactory dysfunction can be viewed as a focal neurological deficit in patients with COVID-19. Evidence is also sparse for a direct causal relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and abnormal brain findings at autopsy, and for trans-synaptic spread of the virus from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb. Taken together, clinical, radiological, histological, ultrastructural, and molecular data implicate inflammation, with or without infection, in either the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory bulb, or both. This inflammation leads to persistent olfactory deficits in a subset of people who have recovered from COVID-19. Neuroimaging has revealed localised inflammation in intracranial olfactory structures. To date, histopathological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence does not suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is an obligate neuropathogen. WHERE NEXT? The prevalence of CNS and olfactory bulb pathosis in patients with COVID-19 is not known. We postulate that, in people who have recovered from COVID-19, a chronic, recrudescent, or permanent olfactory deficit could be prognostic for an increased likelihood of neurological sequelae or neurodegenerative disorders in the long term. An inflammatory stimulus from the nasal olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulbs and connected brain regions might accelerate pathological processes and symptomatic progression of neurodegenerative disease. Persistent olfactory impairment with or without perceptual distortions (ie, parosmias or phantosmias) after SARS-CoV-2 infection could, therefore, serve as a marker to identify people with an increased long-term risk of neurological disease.","output":"Post-viral effects of COVID-19 in the olfactory system and their implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Norovirus (NoV) is one of the oldest recognized diseases and the leading causal pathogen for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide.

Questionnaires and a series of laboratory tests were conducted to analyze the effects of pores on the society and test the recycled and the regular mixtures performance to choose the best option regarding it. Marshal test portrayed that the recycled mixture has a high stability and flow. According to the tensile strength ratio test requirements which set a minimum ratio of 75%, it is recommended to reduce the proportion of recycled aggregate. The Hamburg wheel tracker (HWTD) test proved that the recycled asphalt mixture has a low rutting depth for wet and dry samples compared to the general one. On the other hand, the wet recycled mixture requires a reduction by of 20% to satisfy the specifications. The physical properties for both mixtures were compared, and the voids filled with asphalt (VFA) and voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) of the recycled mixture are lower than those in the regular mixture. The recycled mixture reveals a higher efficiency in saving costs and improving mixtures used for potholes maintenance activities. All the results proved that the mixtures consisting of recycled asphalt are most preferred since they are affordable and perform reasonably well compared to mixtures made of regular asphalt. As a future work, smaller percentages of recycled aggregate should be tested to check the robustness and sustainability of the designed recycled asphalt mixture using different tests such as Hamburg wheel tracker test (wet samples) and indirect tensile strength test.

OBJECTIVE: To assess if a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm can help detect pulmonary nodules on radiographs at different levels of detection difficulty. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic study included 100 posteroanterior chest radiograph images taken between 2000 and 2010 of adult patients from an ambulatory health care center in Germany and a lung image database in the US. Included images were selected to represent nodules with different levels of detection difficulties (from easy to difficult), and comprised both normal and nonnormal control. EXPOSURES: All images were processed with a novel AI algorithm, the AI Rad Companion Chest X-ray. Two thoracic radiologists established the ground truth and 9 test radiologists from Germany and the US independently reviewed all images in 2 sessions (unaided and AI-aided mode) with at least a 1-month washout period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Each test radiologist recorded the presence of 5 findings (pulmonary nodules, atelectasis, consolidation, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion) and their level of confidence for detecting the individual finding on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 representing lowest confidence; 10, highest confidence). The analyzed metrics for nodules included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and receiver operating characteristics curve area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Images from 100 patients were included, with a mean (SD) age of 55 (20) years and including 64 men and 36 women.

METHODS: In this systematic literature review, we apprised the quality of available evidence for different therapeutic options and also the basis for different treatment guidelines. To include all studies that are in different stages of publication, we also included studies from the preprint servers BioRxiv and MedRxiv and published studies from PubMed. RESULTS: We retrieved 5621 articles and included 22 studies for the systematic review.

Important considerations in addition to remission status and type of therapy (IV/SC or oral) included the patients performance status and chemotherapy oral adherence. Based on these, the group determined: (1) Newly diagnosed patients or relapsed patients with significant cytopenias who need parenteral therapy should continue with the current therapy, but the number of visits should be decreased to limit exposure to other HCPs. If the patient has had a good response to treatment, consider changing to an oral regimen. (2) Patients in remission (complete remission, very good partial remission) should consider switching therapy to an oral regimen (immunomodulatory agents, proteasome inhibitors, dexamethasone, and/or Histone deacetylase inhibitors).

Then, the presented OTA was captured by the aptamers, causing the release of cDNA-FAM probes. The free probes were adsorbed by GO, leading to an OTA concentration-dependent fluorescence quenching through fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Under optimum conditions, the fluorescent aptasensor exhibited outstanding sensitivity with a LOD of 11 pg/mL and a wide dynamic range of 0.04C30 ng/mL. The selectivity of the aptasensor was confirmed against other four mycotoxins, and the feasibility and reliability were verified by determining OTA in the spiked malt samples with satisfactory recovery of 95.50%-112.05%.

Virtual reality (VR), a new method to reduce stress and pain for patients, has been widely used in biomedical fields. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effectiveness of VR technology in reducing stress among night-shift anesthesiologists. METHODS: In this randomized controlled, crossover, single-center clinical trial, a total of 30 anesthesiologists will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either the VR immersion group (intervention group) or the routine night-shift group (control group) with a washout of 1 week. Anesthesiologists in the intervention group will undergo VR immersion twice, while anesthesiologists in the control group will not watch VR videos during the night shift. The primary outcome will be the difference in the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) score between the two groups. Secondary outcomes will include the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), perceived stress scores (visual analogue scale (VAS)), and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) scores; levels of satisfaction among the participants; incidence of arrhythmia; and incidence of chest tightness, headache, and palpitations. DISCUSSION: It is unknown whether the use of VR technology during the night shift can reduce stress among anesthesiologists. With the widespread use of VR technology, a positive result in this trial could spur hospitals to apply VR technology to reduce stress among night-shift doctors in every department and provide a relatively relaxed working environment.

The neural invasion can explain both the retrograde pathway of encephalitis and the early manifestation of anosmia by invading the olfactory bulb. Moreover, in the case of attacking the brain stem, it may take part in the early apnea manifestation reported by patients. Additionally, neurotropism of the virus could be the cause of acute hemorrhagic encephalitis.

In this example, five criteria have been selected, namely, power consumption, thermal comfort, risk of airborne infection of influenza and tuberculosis and effective differential temperature (t(eq)) of body parts. The goal is to select the optimal air exchange rate that makes reasonable trade-offs among all the objectives. Two scenarios have been studied. In the first scenario, there is an influenza outbreak and the important objective is to prevent the spread of infection. In the second scenario, energy prices are high and the primary objective is to reduce energy.

However, since patients may die in the hospital during study follow-up, using, for example, the duration of hospitalization to assess treatment efficacy can be misleading. If the treatment tends to prolong patients' survival compared with standard care, patients in the new treatment group may spend more time in hospital. This can lead to a \\"survival bias\\" issue, where a treatment that is effective for preventing death appears to prolong an undesirable outcome.

ASA is ineffective in some: inaccurate infarct and inability to identify a vessel contribute. We aimed to improve accuracy of infarct using CT angiography guidance and provide a more predictable and satisfactory outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-one successive patients with symptomatic LVOT obstruction refractory to medication underwent CT angiography planning to guide ASA. CT was performed using a dual-source CT system. Alcohol was delivered to the artery identified from CT: in 17/21 this was a sub-branch of a septal artery, in 2/21 the septal vessel was identified from the circumflex artery. Peak gradient improved from 98 (IQR 89.50-111.50) mmHg to 14 (IQR 8.50-22) mmHg (p=0.003). Systolic anterior motion (SAM) improved in 18/20 patients. NYHA class improved by 1 in 18/20. Peak VO2 improved from 79.19% of predicted value (14.01) to 91.62% (12.02) predicted (p<0.0001). Success at the first procedure is greater with CT guidance, 17/20 vs. 50/75 with traditional methods (pre-CT guidance) (p=0.02); 9/20 had six-month CMR with target septum infarct in all.

We have used a model-based approach to explore the relative impact of alternative dosing regimens proposed in different dosing protocols for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. METHODS We compared different PK exposures using Monte Carlo simulations based on a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, externally validated using both independent data in lupus erythematous patients and recent data in French COVID-19 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety information from COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ were used to contextualize and assess the actual clinical value of the model predictions. RESULTS Literature and observed clinical data confirm the variability in clinical responses in COVID-19 when treated with the same fixed doses. Confounding factors were identified that should be taken into account for dose recommendation. For 80% of patients, doses higher than 800mg day on D1 followed by 600mg daily on following days might not be needed for being cured. Limited adverse drug reactions have been reported so far for this dosing regimen, most often confounded by co-medications, comorbidities or underlying COVID-19 disease effects.

The standard process of introduction of a new drug into a market involves a lot of clinical trials and tests. This is a tedious and time consuming process and also involves a lot of monetary resources. The faster approval of a drug helps the patients who are in need of the drug. The in silico prediction of Adverse Drug Reactions can help speed up the aforementioned process. The challenges involved are lack of negative data present and predicting ADR from just the chemical structure. Although many models are already available to predict ADR, most of the models use biological activities identifiers, chemical and physical properties in addition to chemical structures of the drugs. But for most of the new drugs to be tested, only chemical structures will be available. The performance of the existing models predicting ADR only using chemical structures is not efficient. Therefore, an efficient prediction of ADRs from just the chemical structure has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method involves a separate model for each ADR, making it a binary classification problem. This paper presents a novel CNN model called Drug Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to predict ADRs using chemical structures of the drugs. The performance is measured using the metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Specificity, F1 score, AUROC and MCC. The results obtained by the proposed DCNN model outperform the competing models on the SIDER4.1 database in terms of all the metrics.

When spleen cells were treated with CAF supernatant, the proliferation of T cells was inhibited as determined by flow cytometry. After cinnamaldehyde treatment, this immunosuppressive function of CAFs was partially reversed. To explore the molecular mechanism, Western blotting and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were applied, and TLR4-dependent signaling pathway-related protein and mRNA levels were quantified. Results Cinnamaldehyde acted on the TLR4-dependent signaling pathway, altering the function of CAFs such that its supernatant no longer inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Conclusion These data indicate that cinnamaldehyde can modify the functions of CAFs, which may be helpful for treating tumors.

Sensor data from 2 weeks before the lockdown (Period 0, P0), 2 weeks immediately after the lockdown (period 1, P1), in mid-lockdown (Period 2, P2) and immediately after end of lockdown (Period 3, P3) were analyzed. RESULTS The study included 63 T1D patients, (FGM: 52, 82%; CGM:11, 18%). Sensor use (91%) were slightly reduced. Despite this reduction, Time in Range increased in P1 (62%), P2 (61%) and P3 (62%) as compared to P0 (58%, all p<0.05 or less) with concomitant reduction in the Time Above Range (P0: 38%; P1: 34%, P2: 34%, P3: 32%, all p<0.05 or less vs. P0).

The traditional approach of contact tracing is time consuming, manpower intensive, dangerous and prone to error due to fatigue or lack of skill. Due to this there is an emergence of mobile based applications for contact tracing. These applications primarily utilize a combination of GPS based absolute location and Bluetooth based relative location remitted from user's smartphone to infer various insights. These applications have eased the task of contact tracing; however, they also have severe implication on user's privacy, for example, mass surveillance, personal information leakage and additionally revealing the behavioral patterns of the user. This impact on user's privacy leads to trust deficit in these applications, and hence defeats their purpose. In this work we discuss the various scenarios which a contact tracing application should be able to handle. We highlight the privacy handling of some of the prominent contact tracing applications. Additionally, we describe the various threat actors who can disrupt its working, or misuse end user's data, or hamper its mass adoption.

Traditional masculine norms such as self-reliance and toughness are associated with a lower likelihood to vaccinate or follow safety restrictions. Furthermore, infection risk and traditional masculinity should be investigated in a differentiated manner including gender role orientation, underlying traditional masculine ideologies and male gender role conflict. Methods: In this pre-registered online survey conducted during March/April 2021 in German-speaking countries in Europe, 490 men completed questionnaires regarding contracting COVID-19 as confirmed by a validated test, fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S), and experience of psychological burden due to COVID-19. In addition, depression symptomatology was assessed by using prototypical internalizing and male-typical externalizing depression symptoms. Furthermore, self-identified masculine gender orientation, endorsement of traditional masculine ideologies, and gender role conflict were measured. Results: A total of 6.9% of men (n = 34) reported having contracted COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Group comparisons revealed that men who had contracted COVID-19 exhibited higher overall traditional masculine ideology and gender role conflict. Logistic regression controlling for confounders (age, income, education, and sexual orientation) indicated that only depression symptoms are independently associated with the risk of having contracted COVID-19. While prototypical depression symptoms were negatively associated with the risk of having contracted COVID-19, male-typical externalizing depression symptoms were positively associated with the risk of having contracted COVID-19. Conclusion: For traditional masculinity, no robust association for an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 could be established, while higher male-typical externalizingdepression symptoms were associated with an increased risk of having contracted COVID-19.","output":"Examining the role of traditional masculinity and depression in mens risk for contracting COVID-19 (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited data are available for clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outside Wuhan.

The blockage of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to downstream consequences such as increased vascular tone, extensive fibrosis and pronounced immune reactions. Different approaches to tackle the adverse viral effects by compensating the lost ACE2 function have been suggested. Here, we use an unequal-arm lever model to describe a simplified version of the biased regulation exercised by the angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) hormones, which are the substrate and the product of ACE2, respectively. We reason upon the lever dynamics and its disruptions caused by the virus, and propose that a combination of RAS modulators will most efficiently compensate the imbalance due to the excess of angiotensin II and the scarcity of angiotensin-(1-7). Specifically, we focus on the possible benefits of the simultaneous application of two agents, a MAS-receptor agonist and an angiotensin-II-type-2-receptor agonist. We conjecture that this combination has the potential to introduce a beneficial synergistic action that promotes anti-hypoxic, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative effects, thereby improving the clinical management of acute and chronic CoViD-19 pathologies.","output":"Strengthening CoViD-19 therapy via combinations of RAS modulators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Constraints on resources require healthcare systems to implement alternative and innovative means for delivering care. The COVID-19 pandemic amplified this issue throughout the world, leading to shortages of ventilators, hospital beds, and healthcare personnel. We report the results of an Acute Care at Home Program (ACHP) response to COVID-19, providing in-home hospital-level care to patients with mild symptoms, preserving in-hospital beds for more serious illness. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 were selected for ACHP after undergoing risk stratification for severe disease, including oxygen evaluation, time course of illness, and evaluation of comorbidities. Patients admitted to ACH met inpatient criteria, required oxygen supplementation of 4 liters, and received insurance approval. Services were provided consistent with best practice of inpatient care, including 24/7 provider availability via TeleMedicine, bedside care provided by paramedics and nurses, respiratory therapy, radiology and laboratory services, pulse oximetry monitoring, and administration of medications. Protocols existed for patient transfer to hospital in the event of clinical deterioration. RESULTS: Our initial cohort included 62 patients enrolled October 1, 2020 C May 31, 2021. Of these, 57 patients were discharged successfully from ACHP. Patients presented with initial oxygen requirements of 0-4 liters. Average length-of-stay in ACHP was 5.4 days. Five patients required hospitalization after enrollment in ACHP; one subsequently expired, two were discharged home, one returned to ACHP after inpatient hospitalization, and one remains hospitalized. One additional patient that was successfully discharged home from ACHP was later readmitted and expired in a subsequent hospitalization. The patients that expired had significant immunocompromising conditions that may have contributed to their outcomes. CONCLUSION: ACHP can provide care equivalent to hospitalization for select COVID-19 patients. Immunocompromised hosts with COVID-19 may represent a subset of patients in which in-house hospitalization must be carefully considered, even with mild oxygen requirements.

The original virus, along with newer variants, is highly transmissible. Aerosol is a multiphase system consisting of the atmosphere with suspended solid and liquid particles, which can carry toxic and harmful substances; especially the liquid components. The degree to which aerosol can carry the virus and cause COVID-19 disease is of significant research importance. In this study, we have discussed the aerosol transmission as the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), and the aerosol pollution reduction as a consequence of the COVID-19 lockdown. The aerosol transmission routes of the SARS-CoV-2 can be further subdivided into proximal human-exhaled aerosol transmission and potentially more distal ambient aerosol transmission. The human-exhaled aerosol transmission is a direct dispersion of the SARS-CoV-2. The ambient aerosol transmission is an indirect dispersion of the SARS-CoV-2 in which the aerosol act as a carrier to spread the virus. This indirect dispersion can also stimulate the up-regulation of the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE-2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) and protease TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2), thereby increasing the incidence and mortality of COVID-19. From the aerosol quality data around the world, it can be seen that often atmospheric pollution has significantly decreased due to factors such as the reduction of traffic, industry, cooking and coal-burning emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown. The airborne transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2, the infectivity of the virus in ambient aerosols, and the reduction of aerosol pollution levels due to the lockdowns are crucial research subjects.","output":"Multiple relationships between aerosol and COVID-19: A framework for global studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to perform a seroprevalence survey on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among Danish healthcare workers to identify high-risk groups.

Digital teaching and examinations are successful for cognitive learning objectives, whereas practical skills had to be carried out predominantly in person under strict hygiene standards. AIM: This study presents the opportunities and challenges of using a presence objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) at a distance with digital support. METHOD: Following surgical practical teaching an OSCE was conducted in presence, where students demonstrated practical skills in one room while the examiners were connected via videoconference from another room. Students were surveyed about the OSCE and sustained learning via a standardized online questionnaire after completion of the surgical teaching. Additionally, examiners were surveyed on their experiences. RESULTS: In the online survey 40 students participated (25% of n = 157 students contacted) and 36 completed questionnaires were analyzed. Overall, the implementation of an OSCE even under pandemic conditions was perceived as very positive by the students (92% of students n = 33). In particular, the acquisition of practical skills was rated as very high. For 78% (n = 28) of the students, the acquisition of competencies through the practical examination was particularly sustainable. The vast majority of students and examiners felt safe regarding infection control because of the hygiene concept (92%, n = 33). Overall, 80 students achieved grade 1 (51%), 71 students grade 2 (45.2%) and 6 students grade 3 (3.8%) (grade 1 = very good, grade 6 = very bad).

Therefore, the aim of the present exploration was to inspect the influence of jojoba oil in boosting the anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine natural product. To our knowledge, there is no formulation comprising colchicine and jojoba oil together to form a niosomal emulgel preparation anticipated for topical application. Colchicine is a natural product extracted from Colchicum autumnale that has been evidenced to show respectable anti-inflammatory activity. Owing to its drawbacks and low therapeutic index, it was preferable to be formulated into topical dosage form. The current study inspected colchicine transdermal delivery by developing niosomal preparation as a potential nanocarrier included into emulgel prepared with jojoba oil. Box Behnken design was constructed to develop 17 niosomal emulgel formulations. The optimized colchicine niosomal emulgel was evaluated for its physical characteristics and in vitro release studies. The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity was estimated via carrageenan-induced rat hind paw edema method. The developed colchicine niosomal preparation revealed particle size of 220.7 nm with PDI value 0.22, entrapment efficiency 65.3%. The formulation was found to be stable showing no significant difference in particle size and entrapment efficiency up on storage at 4 C and 25 C for 3 months. The optimized colchicine niosomal emulgel exhibited a pH value 6.73, viscosity 4598 cP, and spreadability 38.3 mm. In vitro release study of colchicine from niosomal emulgel formulation was around 52.4% over 6 h. Apparently, the proficient anti-inflammatory activity of colchicine niosomal emulgel was confirmed via carrageenan-induced rat hind paw edema test.

In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of the two variants combinations in comparison with the control arm, which underwent a conventional regimen of treatment alone, for a shorter duration. Methods: A total of 40 RT-PCR positive Covid-19 patients divided into two groups (Gr): Gr. 1 control (n=22). Standard treatment; Gr. 2 (n =18) Standard treatment + combination of AFO 202 and N 163 beta glucans for 15 days. Biomarkers of relevance to cytokine storm and coagulopathy were evaluated at baseline on Day 7 and Day 15. Results: The C-reactive protein (CRP), which declined from 33.95 ng/ml to 5.07 ng/ml in control and from 33.95 ng/ml to 5.64 ng/ml in the treatment arm on Day 7, increased to 14.6 ng/ml in the former while it continued to be under control in the treatment arm at 5.68 ng/ml on Day 15. The same trend was observed in Ferritin, whose values were 560.58 pg/ml at baseline to 261.44 pg/ml (day 7) and 182.40 pg/ml (day 15) in the treatment group, while it was 535.24 pg/ml at baseline, 116.66 pg/ml on day 7 and 291.95 pg/ml on day 15 in the control group.

Among the 12 walk tests identified, the 10-metre walk test (10mWT) at a comfortable pace was most commonly evaluated. Sixty-three unique protocols at comfortable and fast paces were identified. Walking pace and walkway surface, but not walkway length, influenced walking speed. Intraclass correlation coefficients for test-retest reliability ranged from 0.80-0.99 across walk tests. Measurement error values ranged from 0.04-0.40 and 0.06 to 0.20 for the 10mWT at comfortable and fast and paces, respectively.

We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported.

Viral antibodies are known to develop upon initial infection;however, it is unclear the amount of protection this confers against reinfection. Additionally, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) is a well-documented phenomenon;however, there are no high-quality studies to support the treatment of outpatients beyond standard indications of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. This case describes a patient with either COVID-19 reinfection or prolonged course of CAC resulting in pulmonary embolism (PE). Case summary: A 40-year-old healthy man presented with fever and cough. He tested positive for COVID-19 and was sent home to self-quarantine. His symptoms resolved and repeat COVID-19 testing returned negative. Two months later, he developed dyspnoea on exertion and syncope. Computed tomography with PE protocol demonstrated acute bilateral PE, and repeat COVID-19 testing returned positive. He was escalated to catheter-directed thrombolysis, but prior to the procedure went into cardiopulmonary arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and full-dose systemic alteplase was administered. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for consideration of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation;however, return of spontaneous circulation was unable to be achieved. Discussion: This case raises the question of COVID-19 reinfection and prolonged risk of VTE due to CAC. We believe the patient was reinfected with COVID-19 provoking his PE;however, a single COVID-19 infection causing a prolonged course of CAC is possible.

We hypothesized post-weight loss phenotype would be associated with changes in central reward system brain connectivity, differences in postprandial gut hormone responses, and increased gut microbiome diversity. METHODS: Subjects included participants undergoing VSG, n = 7; RYGB, n = 9; and MWL, n = 6. Ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide-YY, gut microbiome, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI; using fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations [fALFF]) were measured pre- and post-intervention in fasting and fed states. We explored phenotype characterization using clustering on gut hormone, microbiome, and rsfMRI datasets and a combined analysis. RESULTS: We observed more widespread fALFF differences post-bariatric surgery versus post-MWL. Decreased post-prandial fALFF was seen in food reward regions post-RYGB. The highest number of microbial taxa that increased post-intervention occurred in the RYGB group, followed by VSG and MWL. The combined hormone, microbiome, and MRI dataset most accurately clustered samples into pre- versus post-VSG phenotypes followed by RYGB subjects. CONCLUSION: The data suggest surgical weight loss (VSG and RYGB) has a bigger impact on brain and gut function versus MWL and leads to lesser post-prandial activation of food-related neural circuits. VSG subjects had the greatest phenotype differences in interactions of microbiome, rsfMRI, and gut hormone features, followed by RYGB and MWL. These results will inform future prospective research studying gut-brain changes post-bariatric surgery.","output":"The Neuro-Endo-Microbio-Ome Study: A Pilot Study of Neurobiological Alterations Pre- Versus Post-Bariatric Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The review summarizes data on contemporary approaches to diagnosis, prevention and treatment of severe acute parenchymal respiratory failure of various origins including in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by bacterial and viral pneumonia.

Differential localization can be explained by signal sequence. The sequence alignment using Clustal W shows that the signal sequence present at the cytoplasmic tail plays an important role in spike protein localization. A unique GYQEL motif is identified at the cytoplasmic terminal of OC43 spike protein which helps in localization in the lysosome, and a novel KLHYT motif is identified in the cytoplasmic tail of SARS spike protein which helps in ER or ERGIC localization. This study sheds some light on the role of cytoplasmic tail of spike protein in cell-to-cell fusion, coronavirus host cell fusion and subsequent pathogenicity.","output":"Cytoplasmic tail of coronavirus spike protein has intracellular targeting signals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: NHS Highland covers a wide geographical region encompassing the Isle of Skye, and Ben Nevis. Tourism is a significant contributor to the local economy and in 2017 the Highlands welcomed 534,000 visitors. Health services across the region treat tourists in addition to the local population. We investigated how many tourists accessed the Trauma and Orthopaedic (T&O) Department at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with data collected over one year (2017). The number of tourists referred to T&O including patient demographics, country of origin, type of injury and their clinical outcome were recorded. A freedom of information (FOI) request to NHS Highland was sought to investigate associated costs incurred by tourists. RESULTS: 376 tourists accessed T&O services in 2017. Country of origin: 47 (12.5%) Scotland; 177 (47.1%) rest of UK; 74 (19.7%) EU; 45 (12.0%) non-EU. Highest referral month August (61), lowest referral month November (8). Injuries: 224 (59.6%) fracture; 62 (16.5%) soft tissue injury; 20 (5.3%) laceration. Commonest sites of injury were ankle, distal radius and finger. Outcomes: 28 (7.4%) Virtual clinic; 137 (36.4%) hospital admission; 193 (51.3%) advice to referring team and discharge; 13 (3.5%) direct discharge by T&O; 4 (1.1%) missing. No. of trauma cases booked: tourists 133 (9%), local population 1415 (91%). CONCLUSIONS: Tourists account for fewer than ten percent of the T&O surgical workload over one year with common injuries being fractures affecting the extremities. Seasonal variation was observed with more referrals occurring in the summer months. Just under half of tourists originated from outside the UK and EU. Health boards should consider increasing resources over the summer months to deal with expected increases in tourist numbers and should be able to recover the cost of treatment from the patient or their travel insurance companies directly at point of care.","output":"Tourism and the Highlands: A cross-sectional study on trauma and orthopaedic service use by tourists in 2017"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(D,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/26.md","filePath":"consultation/26.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/26.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
