We focused on receptors involved in interactions between immune cells and virus-infected cells. We found that the diversity of receptor repertoires on natural killer (NK) cells was negatively correlated with the viral clearance rate. In addition, NK subsets expressing the receptor DNAM1 were increased in patients who more rapidly recovered from infection. Ex vivo functional studies revealed that NK subpopulations with high DNAM1 expression had cytolytic activities in response to target cell stimulation. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the expression of CD155 and nectin-4, ligands of DNAM1 and its paired coinhibitory receptor TIGIT, which counterbalanced the cytolytic activities of NK cells. Collectively, our results link the cytolytic immune responses of NK cells to the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and show that the DNAM1 pathway modulates host-pathogen interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"NK cell receptor and ligand composition influences the clearance of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction This study aims to develop and validate a questionnaire to assess workplace violence (WPV) domains in the healthcare setting. Methods The study used a mixed-method design. In Phase 1, qualitative methods for developing the questionnaire were employed, including literature review, focus-group discussion, expert evaluation, and pre-testing. During Phase 2, quantitative methods were employed for establishing the construct validity of the questionnaire. In Phase 1, experts from departments like emergency medicine, medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, trauma, anesthesia, and critical care unit participated. For Phase 2, data were collected from 213 participants; mean age (30.485.95) in metropolitan cities. Results The questionnaire consists of 37 items in five domains: (A) Forms of violence, (B) Impact of violent incidences, (C) Reporting of incidence, (D) Mitigation strategies, and (E) Risk factors. The Cronbachs alpha value of the questionnaire is 0.86, suggesting an excellent internal consistency. Conclusion A reliable and valid tool for gathering information regarding WPV in the healthcare system from around the world has been developed. The tool can be used to study the elements that may contribute to violence and its consequences, which will help policymakers curate various mitigation methods to safeguard WPV victims.","output":"Development and Validation of a Questionnaire to Evaluate Workplace Violence in Healthcare Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of the mayor in times of crisis - In the spring of 2020, mayors were on the front line in dealing with the non-health aspects of the Covid-19 epidemic, in particular to manage the lockdown of the population This text draws on reports from the French Parliament and the Association of French Mayors to analyse their action, citing numerous examples Generally speaking, it highlights the indispensable role of the mayors on the ground, which is often little or poorly understood ? cole nationale d'administration Tous droits rservs pour tous pays","output":"Le r?le du maire en temps de crise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Covid-19 has presented major challenges to face-to-face clinical encounters and facilitating safe and effective care remotely that is acceptable to children, parents and healthcare professionals is therefore of significant interest. Objectives To determine risks and benefits associated with a change in service delivery of paediatric minor injury follow up. Methods We conducted a prospective audit during introduction of a paediatric virtual fracture clinic (VFC) and associated same-day orthopaedic telephone advice line, staffed by orthopaedic consultants and registrars, on the outcomes of attendances to a dedicated paediatric emergency department at a district general hospital and associated minor injury units spanning nine weeks from April to June 2020, coinciding with the UK's first national lockdown due to Covid-19. Results were compared to a similar number of cases using standard face-to-face fracture clinics without an orthopaedic advice line during April 2019. Patients were identified through the department's established procedure for paediatric x-ray follow up and were included if they were suspected or confirmed to have an acute fracture or soft tissue injury. Patients were excluded from analysis if they presented with a soft tissue infection, wounds without fracture, non-acute injury or condition, were admitted to hospital or had safeguarding concerns. Initial and final diagnosis and management, number of radiographs, missed fractures, hospital attendances for the same injury, 'did not attend' episodes, adverse events and unplanned returns were recorded. Results There was a notable reduction in patient numbers during Covid-19 study period (1.4 vs 4.3 patients per day), commensurate with an overall drop in paediatric attendances during national lockdown. Reasons for attendances were broadly similar between VFC and standard practice groups, with comparable rates of admission (8.1 vs 11.6%). Compared to the standard practice group, the VFC group demonstrated a significant reduction in average face to face visits per patient (1.8 vs 2.9, p = 0.00001), average number of radiographs per patient (1.5 vs 1.8, p = 0.01) and no increase in rate of unplanned returns (0.06 vs 0.1 per patient). There were 2 instances of difficulty contacting parents for VFC appointments, which were both resolved by parents contacting fracture clinic. There were 3 instances of missed fractures in the VFC group;1 was missed in the emergency department and so unrelated to the introduction of VFC, 2 were missed after discussion with the advice line, of which 1 was detected after returning with on-going pain, put into a temporary back slab and discharged after 1 virtual clinic and the other which did not result in any change in management. There was 1 missed fracture in the standard practice group, but this was excluded from analysis due to missing records. Overall management in both groups was similar. Conclusions Face-to-face appointments for paediatric minor trauma can be safely replaced with a virtual fracture clinic system and associated advice line. This effectively saves each child one attendance per injury and one x-ray for every three children attending with minor injuries. Benefits would include reductions in missed school and work days for children and carers, and financial savings for healthcare organisations.","output":"Virtual fracture clinics significantly reduce face-to-face contacts and radiographs in children presenting with minor trauma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonists enhance endothelial barrier function and counteract the LPS-induced lung endothelial hyperpermeability, the cardinal feature of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a multifaceted molecular mechanism, strongly involved in tissue defense against injury. The current study introduces the induction of UPR by GHRH antagonists, since those peptides induced several UPR activation markers, including the inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). On the other hand, the GHRH agonist MR-409 exerted the opposite effects. Furthermore, GHRH antagonists counteracted the kifunensine (UPR suppressor)-induced lung endothelial barrier dysfunction. Our observations suggest that UPR mediates, at least in part, the protective effects of GHRH antagonists in the lung microvasculature. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first study to provide experimental evidence in support of the hypothesis that UPR induction is a novel mechanism by which GHRH antagonists oppose severe human disease, including ARDS.","output":"Involvement of the unfolded protein response in the protective effects of growth hormone releasing hormone antagonists in the lungs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smoking rates are higher for people who use mental health services which contributes substantially to health inequalities.

It has a production system characterized by an average milk yield of 6216 kg/cow/year, and the predominance of pasture-based feeding and cows that have longer productive lives and lower incidence of metabolic/production diseases, such as acidosis or mastitis. The biggest problem with the Azores Islands dairy sector is the cost of transport, as the main markets are located in continental Portugal, over 1500 km away, and local dairy products have to compete with dairy products produced in mainland Portugal and in the rest of the European Union. Herein, the evolution of the dairy sector in the Azores Islands from 2007 to 2017 is presented. A SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) analysis was performed to find potential solutions to increase the value of the Azorean dairy sector. The most relevant solution considered was the valorization of the dairy production through three major aspects: higher milk quality, namely, better organoleptic properties; lower carbon footprint (not considering transport costs); and higher levels of animal welfare. Three examples are shown of such valorization: protected denomination of origin (PDO) cheeses, the happy cows program, and the production of an organic milk, from the Terceira Island. Some of these programs are relatively recent, so, it will be interesting to see how their sales and acceptance by consumers evolve, particularly under the current economic framework.","output":"The dairy sector in the Azores Islands: possibilities and main constraints towards increased added value"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vaccines have had a great impact on disease prevention and mortality reduction. Very rarely, vaccines also can result in serious adverse effects. In consideration of this fact, vaccine injury compensation programs have been implemented in many countries to compensate a vaccinee for associated adverse effects. The existing vaccine injury compensation system addresses routine immunization schemes. However, there are rising concerns about the compensation for adverse effects caused by new vaccines such as those developed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this article is to review the existing vaccine injury compensation programs in different countries. The review also highlights the necessity to include all upcoming new vaccines for COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases in the compensation schemes. Methods: : Published articles relating to vaccine compensation injury programs, vaccines, injuries, disabilities, illnesses, and deaths resulting from vaccination were searched in data bases. Through a careful review of the abstracts, 25 relevant articles were selected for analysis. Results: : We identified 27 countries on four continents with vaccine injury compensation schemes: 17 countries in Europe, 7 countries in Asia, the United States, a Canadian Province and New Zealand. No programs were identified in Africa and in South America. Program design, funding, and eligibility for compensation vary vastly between countries. We identified 17 countries operating well-established vaccine injury compensation programs. However, minimal information is available on numerous other countries. Conclusion: We have identified 27 countries operating vaccine injury compensation programs. In Canada, Quebec is the only province with a scheme;however, discussions are ongoing in Canada for nationwide implementation in light of COVID 19. Study limitations include limited scientific material, which hindered our research. Additional data concerning payout for each type of injury and the number of claimants related to a specific vaccine injury worldwide could provide a more comprehensive analysis.","output":"Current situation of vaccine injury compensation program and a future perspective in light of COVID-19 and emerging viral diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucociliary clearance, mediated by a coordinated function of cilia bathing in the airway surface liquid (ASL) on the surface of airway epithelium, protects the host from inhaled pathogens and is an essential component of the innate immunity.

Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the contribution of van der Waals interaction dominated the binding free energies of these compounds, which may be attributed to the hydrophobicity of active site of PLpro from COVID-19. Moreover, all four compounds formed conservative hydrogen bonds with the residues Asp164, Gln269, and Tyr273. We hoped that these four compounds might represent the promising chemical scaffolds for further development of novel PLpro inhibitors against COVID-19.","output":"Discovery of small molecule PLpro inhibitor against COVID-19 using structure-based virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation, and molecular mechanics/Generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Concern for the development of actions against COVID-19 has continued to grow since February 2020.

Prior studies have applied survey techniques to investigate vaccine acceptance, but these may be slow and expensive. This study investigates 29 million vaccine-related tweets from August 8, 2020 to April 19, 2021 and proposes a social media-based approach that derives a vaccine acceptance index (VAI) to quantify Twitter users opinions on COVID-19 vaccination. This index is calculated based on opinion classifications identified with the aid of natural language processing techniques and provides a quantitative metric to indicate the level of vaccine acceptance across different geographic scales in the U.S. The VAI is easily calculated from the number of positive and negative Tweets posted by a specific users and groups of users, it can be compiled for regions such a counties or states to provide geospatial information, and it can be tracked over time to assess changes in vaccine acceptance as related to trends in the media and politics. At the national level, it showed that the VAI moved from negative to positive in 2020 and maintained steady after January 2021. Through exploratory analysis of state- and county-level data, reliable assessments of VAI against subsequent vaccination rates could be made for counties with at least 30 users.

A consistent finding in ARDS is the deposition of fibrin in the air spaces and lung parenchyma. COVID\\\\19 patients show elevated D\\\\Dimers and fibrinogen. Fibrin deposits are found in the lungs of patients due to the dysregulation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems.

We developed two online behavioural interventions to support eczema care called ECO (Eczema Care Online) for young people and ECO for families. This protocol describes two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate clinical and cost-effectiveness of the two interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Design: Two independent, pragmatic, unmasked, parallel group RCTs with internal pilots and nested health economic and process evaluation studies. Setting: Participants will be recruited from general practitioner practices in England. Participants: Young people aged 13C25 years with eczema and parents and carers of children aged 0C12 years with eczema, excluding inactive or very mild eczema (five or less on Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)). Interventions: Participants will be randomised to online intervention plus usual care or to usual eczema care alone. Outcome measures: Primary outcome is eczema severity over 24 weeks measured by POEM. Secondary outcomes include POEM 4-weekly for 52 weeks, quality of life, eczema control, itch intensity (young people only), patient enablement, health service and treatment use. Process measures include treatment adherence, barriers to adherence and intervention usage. Our sample sizes of 303 participants per trial are powered to detect a group difference of 2.5 (SD 6.5) in monthly POEM scores over 24 weeks (significance 0.05, power 0.9), allowing for 20% loss to follow-up. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be from a National Health Service and personal social service perspective. Qualitative and quantitative process evaluation will help understand the mechanisms of action and participant experiences and inform implementation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by South Central Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0351). Recruitment is ongoing, and follow-up will be completed by mid-2022. Findings will be disseminated to participants, the public, dermatology and primary care journals, and policy makers.

Both authors independently assessed the quality of each included trial and extracted the relevant data. Results From 158 potential titles, 17 controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. There were no differences between ADMG and SCTG for mean root coverage, percent root coverage, and clinical attachment level gain. ADMG was statistically better than SCTG for gain in width of KT (-0.43 mm; 95% confidence interval: -0.72, -0.15). Only one study compared patient-based outcomes.

METHODS: Women who delivered children at our hospital during June 2020 to July 2020 (control group), and October 2020 to December 2020 (exposure group) were recruited in the present study. All of the participants were not infected with COVID-19. The last menstrual period (LMP) of the exposure group was between January 24th, 2020 and March 12th, 2020, whilst in the control group, the LMP was between May 12th and October 31st, 2019. RESULTS: There were 1,456 women in the exposure group and 1,816 women in the control group. Women in the exposure group were more susceptible to hypertension during pregnancy (HDP, P = 0.004, OR[95%CI] = 1.90[1.22C2.95]) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM, P = 0.008, OR[95%CI] = 1.31[1.08C1.60]) compared to those in the control group. Mothers diagnosed with HDP were more likely to deliver premature infants, leading to a higher rate of low birth weight (all P < 0.05). The other common outcomes of pregnancy showed no statistical differences between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The initial COVID-19 outbreak might increase the incidence rates of HDP and GDM among pregnant women whose first trimesters were during that period, resulting in higher percentages of premature delivery and low birth weight.

Over the subsequent 5 months, NPI policies were eased in stages according to a national strategy. COVID-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously; the disease reached rural areas by July and case numbers peaked from July to August. A second COVID-19 wave began in late 2020. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic well-being and access to health care are limited. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine how rural residents in three South African provinces changed their behaviors during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. METHODS: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network nodes in the Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal, (Africa Health Research Institute) and Limpopo (Dikgale-Mamabolo-Mothiba) provinces conducted up to 14 rounds of longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and periurban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on the following topics: COVID-19-related knowledge and behaviors, the health and economic impacts of NPIs, and mental health. We analyzed how responses varied based on NPI stringency and household sociodemographics. RESULTS: In total, 5120 households completed 23,095 interviews between April and December 2020. Respondents' self-reported satisfaction with their COVID-19-related knowledge and face mask use rapidly rose to 85% and 95%, respectively, by August. As selected NPIs were eased, the amount of travel increased, economic losses were reduced, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When the number of COVID-19 cases spiked at one node in July, the amount of travel dropped rapidly and the rate of missed daily medications doubled. Households where more adults received government-funded old-age pensions reported concerns about economic matters and medication access less often. CONCLUSIONS: South Africans complied with stringent, COVID-19-related NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic, and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programs appeared to buffer interruptions in income and health care access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against the broader well-being of people in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems when such policies threaten peoples' income and access to basic services.","output":"Protective Behaviors and Secondary Harms Resulting From Nonpharmaceutical Interventions During the COVID-19 Epidemic in South Africa: Multisite, Prospective Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United States (US) has a complex healthcare system with a mix of public, private, nonprofit, and for-profit insurers, healthcare institutions and organizations, and providers. Unlike other developed countries, there is not a single payer healthcare system or a national pharmaceutical benefits scheme/plan. Despite spending over USD 10,000 per capita in healthcare, the US is among the worst performers compared to other developed countries in outcomes including life expectancy at birth, infant mortality, safety during childbirth, and unmanaged chronic conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes). Primary care is delivered by physicians and advanced practice providers (i.e., nurse practitioners and physician assistants) in a variety of settings including large health systems, federally qualified health centers or free clinics that provide care to the underserved, or specific facilities for veterans or American Indian and Alaska native peoples. Since 2010, primary care delivery has shifted toward providing patient-centered, coordinated, comprehensive care focused on providing proactive, rather than reactive, population health management, and on the quality, versus volume, of care. Community pharmacy comprises a mix of independently owned, chain, supermarket and mass merchant pharmacies. Community pharmacies provide services such as immunizations, medication therapy management, medication packaging, medication synchronization, point-of-care testing and, in specific states where legislation has been passed, hormonal contraception, opioid reversal agents, and smoking cessation services. There has been criticism regarding the lack of standard terminology for services such as medication synchronization and medication therapy management, their components and how they should be provided, which hampers comparability across studies. One of the main challenges for pharmacists in the US is the lack of provider status at the federal level. This means that pharmacists are not allowed to use existing fee-for-service health insurance billing codes to receive reimbursement for non-dispensing services. In addition, despite there being regulatory infrastructure in multiple states, the extent of service implementation is either low or unknown. Research found that pharmacists face numerous barriers when providing some of these services.

We used a main model with demographic, socioeconomic and comorbidity covariates highlighted in previous research as important predictors.

Our findings are aligned with previous research showing that the baseline features of the regions in terms of general health status, pollutant concentration levels (here NO(2) and PM(10)), type of agri-food industry, and type of land use and land cover have modulated the impact of COVID-19 at a regional scale. This study is among the first to explore the associations between COVID-19 and the type of agri-food industry and LULC data using a population-based approach.

In addition, a series of AraU monophosphate prodrugs in the form of triester phosphoramidates (ProTides) were also synthesized and tested against a range of viruses, leukaemia and solid tumour cell lines. Unfortunately, neither the parent compound (AraU) nor any of its ProTides showed antiviral activity, nor potent inhibitory activity against any of the cancer cell lines. Therefore, the metabolism of AraU phosphoramidates to release AraU monophosphate was investigated. The results showed carboxypeptidase Y, hog liver esterase and crude CEM tumor cell extracts to hydrolyse the ester motif of phosphoramidates with subsequent loss of the aryl group, while molecular modelling studies suggested that the AraU l-alanine aminoacyl phosphate derivative might not be a good substrate for the phosphoramidase enzyme Hint-1. These findings are in agreement with the observed disappearance of intact prodrug and concomitant appearance of the corresponding phosphoramidate intermediate derivative in CEM cell extracts without measurable formation of araU monophosphate.

This can only be partially ascribed to other comorbidities. A possible explanation is a factor that assures a prompt response to SARS-CoV-2 in younger people, independent from the novelty of the virus itself. A factor is believed to stimulate the immune system and provide immunity against more antigens. The only external stimulation received by healthy people is vaccination (eg, the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis [DTP] vaccine). One hypothesis is that vaccination helps develop specific immunity but generates sprouting immunity against antigens in transit. The underlying immunological phenomena are the bystander effect and trained immunity. The developed immunity gives protection for years until it naturally fades out. After the fifth decade of life, the immune system is almost incompetent when a viral infection occurs, and thus, at this stage, the novel coronavirus can enter the body and cause acute respiratory distress syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The initial aim is to demonstrate that blood monocytes and natural killer cells show overpowering hyperactivity, while CD4+ and CD8+ T cells experience impediments to their defensive functions in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary objectives are to correlate clinical data and vaccination history with laboratory immune patterns in order to identify protective factors. Subsequently, we are also interested in characterizing the phenotypes and state of the degree of activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including monocytes, natural killer cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in healthy subjects vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine. METHODS: Data will be collected using the following 3 approaches: (1) an experimental analysis to study the innate immune response and to identify genetic profiles; (2) an epidemiological analysis to identify the patients vaccination history; and (3) a clinical analysis to detect the immunological profile. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on April 16, 2020, and the study started on April 27, 2020. As of February 2021, enrollment has been completed. Immunological analysis is ongoing, and we expect to complete this analysis by December 2022. CONCLUSIONS: We will recognize different populations of patients, each one with a specific immunological pattern in terms of cytokines, soluble factor serum levels, and immune cell activity. Anamnestic data, such as preceding vaccinations and comorbidities, biochemical findings like lymphocyte immunophenotyping, and pre-existing persistent cytomegalovirus infection, allow depicting the risk profile of severe COVID-19. Proof of the roles of these immunological phenomena in the development of COVID-19 can be the basis for the implementation of therapeutic immunomodulatory treatments.

The Complex High Admission Management Program (CHAMP) was established as a multidisciplinary program to improve continuity of care and reduce readmissions for frequently hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare hospital utilization metrics among patients enrolled in CHAMP and usual care. DESIGN: Pragmatic randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria were as follows: 3 or more, 30-day inpatient readmissions in the previous year; or 2 inpatient readmissions plus either a referral or 3 observation admissions in previous 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Patients randomized to CHAMP were managed by an interdisciplinary team including social work, physicians, and pharmacists. The CHAMP team used comprehensive care planning and inpatient, outpatient, and community visits to address both medical and social needs. Control patients were randomized to usual care and contacted 18 months after initial identification if still eligible. MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcome was number of 30-day inpatient readmissions 180 days following enrollment. Secondary outcomes were number of hospital admissions, total hospital days, emergency department visits, and outpatient clinic visits 180 days after enrollment. KEY RESULTS: There were 75 patients enrolled in CHAMP, 76 in control. Groups were similar in demographic characteristics and baseline readmissions. At 180 days following enrollment, CHAMP patients had more inpatient 30-day readmissions [CHAMP incidence rate 1.3 (95% CI 0.9C1.8) vs. control 0.8 (95% CI 0.5C1.1), p=0.04], though both groups had fewer readmissions compared to 180 days prior to enrollment. We found no differences in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Frequently hospitalized patients experienced reductions in utilization over time. Though most outcomes showed no difference, CHAMP was associated with higher readmissions compared to a control group, possibly due to consolidation of care at a single hospital. Future research should seek to identify subsets of patients with persistently high utilization for whom tailored interventions may be beneficial.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of educational intervention based on the empowerment model on deaf and hard hearing females' self-efficacy, knowledge, and attitude toward PMSGC. A Quasi-experimental research design was conducted on 64 deaf and hard hearing female students. The data collection instrument comprised four parts: basic data and personal/family history, PMSGC quiz, Likert attitude scale, and general self-efficacy scale. Data were collected from September to December 2020. The empowerment educational intervention was conducted in four sequential phases; needs assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The intervention addressed the students' knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy. The results showed that 76.6% of the study participants had consanguineous marriage between their parents, 64.1% had a history of hereditary deafness in first-degree relatives. There were statistically significant differences between the total knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy before and after intervention (p <0.001).

Methods: In this nationwide retrospective cohort study of 14,138 patients, we analyzed associations between abnormalities in liver chemistries (ALT, AST, ALP, and Tbili) and mortality, intubation, and prolonged hospital LOS in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We used Pearson's chi-squared tests to detect significant differences in categorical variables for patients with and without abnormal liver chemistries. Welch's two-sample t-tests were used to make comparisons of liver chemistry (ALT, AST, ALP, Tbili) and serum albumin results. All other continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-tests. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results: Propensity score matching demonstrated that abnormalities in liver chemistries at admission are significantly associated with increased risk for mortality (RR 1.70) and intubation (RR 1.44) in patients with COVID-19. Elevated AST is the liver chemistry abnormality associated with the highest risk for mortality (RR 2.27), intubation (RR 2.12), and prolonged hospitalization (RR 1.19).

However, many public health officials have warned that mass protests could lead to a reduction in social distancing behavior, spurring a resurgence of COVID-19. This study uses newly collected data on protests in 315 of the largest U.S. cities to estimate the impacts of mass protests on social distancing and COVID-19 case growth. Event-study analyses provide strong evidence that net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent with the hypothesis that non-protesters' behavior was substantially affected by urban protests. This effect was not fully explained by the imposition of city curfews. Estimated effects were generally larger for persistent protests and those accompanied by media reports of violence. Furthermore, we find no evidence that urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth during the more than two and a half weeks following protest onset. We conclude that predictions of broad negative public health consequences of Black Lives Matter protests were far too narrowly conceived.","output":"Black Lives Matter Protests, Social Distancing, and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current best practice in placement of arterial lines is to attempt to cannulate the radial artery in the first instance.

Immunocompromised hosts (ICH) with respiratory illnesses often undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This prospective study aimed to evaluate the yield and concordance of NP and BAL FARP testing when performed on the same patient concurrently. METHODS: From February to December 2016, 125 patients (100 ICH and 25 non-ICH) were enrolled. NP swabs and BAL samples were sent for FARP testing. RESULTS: The yield of the BAL FARP among ICH and non-ICH was 24% (24/100) and 8% (2/25), respectively. The yield of positive NP swabs in ICH was 27% (27/100) versus 4% (1/25) in non-ICH. The majority of patients (89%; 111/125) had concordant results between NP and BAL specimens. Of the 24 ICH patients who had a positive BAL FARP, the majority (79%) had the same pathogen detected from the NP swab. CONCLUSION: The FARP may be useful in the ICH. Given the high concordance, in patients whom a pathogen is identified on the NP FARP, a FARP performed on BAL will likely yield the same result. However, if the NP FARP is negative, performing the test on a BAL sample may have an incremental yield.","output":"Comparison of Respiratory Pathogen Detection in Upper versus Lower Respiratory Tract Samples Using the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel in the Immunocompromised Host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel ?-cyclodextrin pendant polymer (?-PL-CD), composed of poly(?-lysine) (?-PL) main chain and glycine-?-cyclodextrin (Gly-CD) side chains, was prepared by a simple two-step procedure.

However, due to the lack of efficient algorithms for accurate RNA structure-sequence alignment, computer programs capable of fast and effectively searching genomes for RNA secondary structures have not been available. In this paper, a novel RNA structure profiling model is introduced based on the notion of a conformational graph to specify the consensus structure of an RNA family. Tree decomposition yields a small tree width t for such conformation graphs (e.g., t = 2 for stem loops and only a slight increase for pseudo-knots). Within this modelling framework, the optimal alignment of a sequence to the structure model corresponds to finding a maximum valued isomorphic subgraph and consequently can be accomplished through dynamic programming on the tree decomposition of the conformational graph in time O(k(t)N(2)), where k is a small parameter; and N is the size of the projiled RNA structure. Experiments show that the application of the alignment algorithm to search in genomes yields the same search accuracy as methods based on a Covariance model with a significant reduction in computation time. In particular; very accurate searches of tmRNAs in bacteria genomes and of telomerase RNAs in yeast genomes can be accomplished in days, as opposed to months required by other methods.

Pre-Tdap era data suggest that maternal pertussis antibodies in infants have a half-life of approximately 5-6 weeks. METHODS 34 mother-infant pairs had blood collected before maternal Tdap vaccination, 4 weeks later, at delivery (maternal and cord), and at infant ages 3 and 6 weeks from June 2014-March 2015. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), fimbrial proteins (FIM) and pertactin (PRN) was quantified by multiplex luminex assay (IU/ml). Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) and half-life of pertussis antibodies were calculated. RESULTS Tdap was administered to 34 women (mean age 31.1 years) at mean gestation 30.7 weeks (28-32.7). Mean neonatal gestation was 39.1 weeks (36-41.1) and mean birthweight was 3379 g (2580-4584). Four weeks post-Tdap vaccination, maternal pertussis-specific IgG GMCs increased 4-fold in 59%, 41%, 29% and 44% of women for PT, FHA, FIM and PRN, respectively, and then waned. The transplacental transport ratio of pertussis antibodies was 1.35 for PT, 1.41 for FHA, 1.31 for FIM and 1.36 for PRN. Between birth and age 6 weeks, infant serum GMC for PT-specific IgG decreased from 55.1 IU/mL (38.6-78.6) to 21.1 IU/ml (14.7-30.2), and the proportion of infants with PT levels 10 IU/ml fell from 97% to 67%. Half-life of pertussis-specific IgG in infants in days was 29.4 (95% CI 27.3-31.7) for PT, 29.8 (95% CI 27.7-32.2) for FHA, 31.2 (95% CI 28.9-33.7) for PRN, and 35.8 (95% CI 30.1-44.3) for FIM.

The aim of this study was to identify the preventive advice and interventions received by Australian pilgrims before Hajj, and the barriers to and facilitators of their use during Hajj. METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys of Australians pilgrims aged 18 years were undertaken, one before and one after the Hajj 2014. RESULTS: Of 356 pilgrims who completed the survey (response rate 94%), 80% had the influenza vaccine, 30% the pneumococcal vaccine, and 30% the pertussis vaccine. Concern about contracting disease at Hajj was the most cited reason for vaccination (73.4%), and not being aware of vaccine availability was the main reason for non-receipt (56%). Those who obtained pre-travel advice were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not seek advice. Of 150 pilgrims surveyed upon return, 94% reported practicing hand hygiene during Hajj, citing ease of use (67%) and belief in its effectiveness (62.4%) as the main reasons for compliance; university education was a significant predictor of hand hygiene adherence. Fifty-three percent used facemasks, with breathing discomfort (76%) and a feeling of suffocation (40%) being the main obstacles to compliance.

The aim of this paper is to introduce the integrative model of environmental health and explore its potential to illuminate the Toronto SARS experience. Discussion. SARS affected people on three continents in a matter of days. Response to this new disease varied from one area to another and was dependent upon the level of integration of health services and communication across services. The present focus of the health care system is on treating the results of disease rather than the causative factors. Reacting to a new disease had grave social and economic consequences. The time for a new global environmental approach to health is now. The Toronto SARS experience was examined using the integrative model of environmental health and the upstream perspective as exemplars to interrupt the traditional approach to disease. All health care providers share the responsibility to learn about and to understand how our environment creates disease. This knowledge comes through research on topics such as; chemicals, pesticides, soil erosion, killing of forests, contamination of water, destabilization of climate, and social disruption from wars.

Results: A total of 2657 female-patients of all ages were enrolled in this study with 1314 females during the 4 months pre COVID-19, and 1343 females during the pandemic. The mean age of patients presented before the pandemic was 27.216.6 years, while the mean age of patients during the pandemic was 28.115.6 years with no statistically significant difference in mean ages (P >0.05).

Using original cross-national surveys in six key and highly integrated economies in Asia C Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand C we found that most people support establishing closer trade relationships with foreign countries. However, most people prefer to buy more domestic products than foreign products. We test a behavioural model of trade preferences to understand the psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with prior studies, we found that a greater level of anxiety is negatively associated with support for trade and foreign product preference, after controlling for the effects of ethnocentrism, education and other socioeconomic factors. Job and health insecurities reduced public preference for buying more foreign products, but it stimulated more support for trade with other countries.

The reliability of biochemical data derived from these measurements is dependent on the quality of the sample collection and exact preparation and analysis protocols. Here, we describe systematically, the impact of variations in sample collection and preparation on information recovery from quantitative proton (1H) NMR spectroscopy of human blood plasma and serum. The effects of variation of blood collection tube sizes and preservatives, successive freeze-thaw cycles, sample storage at -80 C, and short-term storage at 4 and 20 C on the quantitative lipoprotein and metabolite patterns were investigated. Storage of plasma samples at 4 C for up to 48 h, freezing at -80 C and blood sample collection tube choice have few and minor effects on quantitative lipoprotein profiles, and even storage at 4 C for up to 168 h caused little information loss. In contrast, the impact of heat-treatment (56 C for 30 min), which has been used for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, that may be required prior to analytical measurements in low level biosecurity facilities induced marked changes in both lipoprotein and low molecular weight metabolite profiles. It was conclusively demonstrated that this heat inactivation procedure degrades lipoproteins and changes metabolic information in complex ways. Plasma from control individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are differentially altered resulting in the creation of artifactual pseudo-biomarkers and destruction of real biomarkers to the extent that data from heat-treated samples are largely uninterpretable. We also present several simple blood sample handling recommendations for optimal NMR-based biomarker discovery investigations in SARS CoV-2 studies and general clinical biomarker research.","output":"Quantitative In-Vitro Diagnostic NMR Spectroscopy for Lipoprotein and Metabolite Measurements in Plasma and Serum: Recommendations for Analytical Artifact Minimization with Special Reference to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small bowel capsule endoscopy can detect subtle mucosal lesions in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, and our aim was to evaluate its application in established ileocolonic Crohn's disease.

OBJECTIVE: Following a similar methodology, this study updates the previous findings with more recent data to report the economic burden of adults with MDD in 2018. METHOD: This study used a framework for evaluating the incremental economic burden of adults with MDD in the USA that combined original and literature-based estimates, focusing on key changes between 2010 and 2018. The prevalence rates of MDD by sex, age, employment, and treatment status over time were estimated based on the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The incremental direct and workplace costs per individual with MDD were primarily derived from administrative claims data and NSDUH data using comparative analyses of individuals with and without MDD. Societal direct and workplace costs were extrapolated by multiplying NSDUH estimates of the number of people with MDD by the direct and workplace cost estimates per patient. The suicide-related costs were estimated using a human capital method. RESULTS: The number of US adults with MDD increased by 12.9%, from 15.5 to 17.5 million, between 2010 and 2018, whereas the proportion of adults with MDD aged 18C34 years increased from 34.6 to 47.5%. Over this period, the incremental economic burden of adults with MDD increased by 37.9% from $US236.6 billion to 326.2 billion (year 2020 values). All components of the incremental economic burden increased (i.e., direct costs, suicide-related costs, and workplace costs), with the largest growth observed in workplace costs, at 73.2%. Consequently, the composition of 2018 costs changed meaningfully, with 35% attributable to direct costs (47% in 2010), 4% to suicide-related costs (5% in 2010), and 61% to workplace costs (48% in 2010). This increase in the workplace cost share was consistent with more favorable employment conditions for those with MDD. Finally, the proportion of total costs attributable to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions remained stable at 37% (38% in 2010). CONCLUSION: Workplace costs accounted for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD as this population trended younger and was increasingly likely to be employed. Although the total number of adults with MDD increased from 2010 to 2018, the incremental direct cost per individual declined.

Methods Applying the test-negative study design to linked provincial databases, we estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death) caused by Omicron or Delta between December 6 and 26, 2021. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness of 2 or 3 COVID-19 vaccine doses by time since the latest dose, compared to unvaccinated individuals. Results We included 16,087 Omicron-positive cases, 4,261 Delta-positive cases, and 114,087 test-negative controls. VE against symptomatic Delta infection declined from 89% (95%CI, 86-92%) 7-59 days after a second dose to 80% (95%CI, 74-84%) after []240 days, but increased to 97% (95%CI, 96-98%) []7 days after a third dose. VE against symptomatic Omicron infection was only 36% (95%CI, 24-45%) 7-59 days after a second dose and provided no protection after []180 days, but increased to 61% (95%CI, 56-65%) []7 days after a third dose. VE against severe outcomes was very high following a third dose for both Delta and Omicron (99% [95%CI, 98-99%] and 95% [95%CI, 87-98%], respectively). Conclusions In contrast to high levels of protection against both symptomatic infection and severe outcomes caused by Delta, our results suggest that 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines only offer modest and short-term protection against symptomatic Omicron infection. A third dose improves protection against symptomatic infection and provides excellent protection against severe outcomes for both variants.","output":"Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against Omicron or Delta infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research was conduct to determine the situation of learning mathematics physics online during the COVID-19 pandemic Participants in this study were physics semester 4th students of Universitas Muhammadiyah Makassar with 21 students Data collection techniques include online interviews and questionnaires The collected data analyzed by reduction, display, and conclusion drawing The results of the study describe the learning process of mathematical physics not conducive during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak The problem that arises in the form of difficulty lectures in teaching explicit physics material that has many mathematical formulas and calculations The difficulty on the part of students is that students experience limited costs to buy internet quota in online learning The lecturer provides the solution by creating a mathematical physics module that is given in stages This module is presented with language and examples of questions that are easily understood by students through the google classroom application Lectures also occasionally use the zoom application, and Google meets to explain the material that is difficult to understand","output":"Situation analysis of mathematical physics learning with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Platform work is a new form of employment that emerged over the last decade. In this form of work, digital infrastructure facilitates the matching between the demand and supply of specific services and organises their performance by means of guidelines, customer reviews, algorithmic governance and other mechanisms. The scale, pace and volume of this emerging phenomenon has added new impetus to discussions in several fields of law, including public, antitrust, tax and IT law. In the face of the concomitant trends that are reshaping the labour market (globalisation, tertiarisation, outsourcing and flexibilisation, to name but a few), the manifold challenges the digital transformation poses have also reignited heated disputes about such crucial issues as (i) the suitability of traditional methods for defining the legal status of workers;(ii) the allegedly narrow scope of the application of labour regulations;and (iii) whether existing labour and social security paradigms can adapt to changes in the labour market.The overarching theme of this paper is to address possible policy gaps and further implications for EU labour law by exploring the lessons that can be drawn from recent policy and judicial developments. This study deliberately takes some central issues for granted for two main reasons. On the one hand, a selection of developments is necessary due to space constraints. On the other, numerous studies have refocused the crux of the discussion, have resolved some points of controversy and moved the debate forward. As a result, ongoing research can now focus on a pressing goal, namely the assessment of the regulatory suitability of existing social institutions, with the aim of providing realistic and effective solutions for all actors involved in the platform economy.This paper is organised as follows. Aside from discussing the key lessons gleaned from previous studies on platform work, Section 2 briefly touches upon the trends and initiatives in policymaking in France and in Italy. Moreover, it presents and reviews the main outcomes of litigation at the domestic level, with a focus on the role played by algorithms. This section also assesses the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. After introducing the Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR), Section 3 critically analyses two key achievements at the EU level, namely the Directive on transparent and predictable working conditions and the Recommendation on access to social protection for workers and the self-employed. Section 4 assesses the elasticity of the triad of Directives regulating atypical employment. It is argued in this section that the narrow construction of the Directives personal scope of application represents an obstacle. An adaptive and purposive approach of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) could, however, result in the classification of platform workers as falling within the scope of the social acquis in some fields. Finally, Section 5 concludes by offering concrete proposals.","output":"Platform Work in the European Union: Lessons Learned, Legal Developments and Challenges Ahead"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of the Sofia SARS rapid antigen fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) to guide hospital-bed placement of patients being admitted through the emergency department (ED). DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a clinical quality improvement study. SETTING: This study was conducted in 2 community hospitals in Maryland from September 21, 2020, to December 3, 2020. In total, 2,887 patients simultaneously received the Sofia SARS rapid antigen FIA and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays on admission through the ED. METHODS: Rapid antigen results and symptom assessment guided initial patient placement while confirmatory RT-PCR was pending. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values of the rapid antigen assay were calculated relative to RT-PCR, overall and separately for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Assay sensitivity was compared to RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values. Assay turnaround times were compared. Clinical characteristics of RT-PCRCpositive patients and potential exposures from false-negative antigen assays were evaluated. RESULTS: For all patients, overall agreement was 97.9%; sensitivity was 76.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71%C82%), and specificity was 99.7% (95% CI, 99%C100%). We detected no differences in performance between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. As RT-PCR Ct increased, the sensitivity of the antigen assay decreased. The mean turnaround time for the antigen assay was 1.2 hours (95% CI, 1.0C1.3) and for RT-PCR it was 20.1 hours (95% CI, 18.9C40.3) (P < .001). No transmission from antigen-negative/RT-PCRCpositive patients was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Although not a replacement for RT-PCR for detection of all SARS-CoV-2 infections, the Sofia SARS antigen FIA has clinical utility for potential initial timely patient placement.","output":"Clinical evaluation of Sofia Rapid Antigen Assay for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among emergency department to hospital admissions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical psychology is a branch of applied psychology.

The neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies is even more focused on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) than for infection-elicited antibodies. However, within the RBD, binding of vaccine-elicited antibodies is more broadly distributed across epitopes than for infection-elicited antibodies.

It is a critical and challenging task to revive public life while minimizing the risk of infection. Reducing interactions between people by social distancing is an effective and prevalent measure to reduce the risk of infection and spread of the virus within a community. Current developments in several countries show that this measure can be technologically accompanied by mobile apps; meanwhile, privacy concerns are being intensively discussed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine central cognitive variables that may constitute people's motivations for social distancing, using an app, and providing health-related data requested by two apps that differ in their direct utility for the individual user. The results may increase our understanding of people's concerns and convictions, which can then be specifically addressed by public-oriented communication strategies and appropriate political decisions. METHODS: This study refers to the protection motivation theory, which is adaptable to both health-related and technology-related motivations. The concept of social trust was added. The quantitative survey included answers from 406 German-speaking participants who provided assessments of data security issues, trust components, and the processes of threat and coping appraisal related to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection by social distancing. With respect to apps, one central focus was on the difference between a contact tracing app and a data donation app. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses showed that the present model could explain 55% of the interindividual variance in the participants' motivation for social distancing, 46% for using a contact tracing app, 42% for providing their own infection status to a contact tracing app, and 34% for using a data donation app. Several cognitive components of threat and coping appraisal were related to motivation measurements. Trust in other people's social distancing behavior and general trust in official app providers also played important roles; however, the participants' age and gender did not. Motivations for using and accepting a contact tracing app were higher than those for using and accepting a data donation app. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed some important cognitive factors that constitute people's motivation for social distancing and using apps to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Concrete implications for future research, public-oriented communication strategies, and appropriate political decisions were identified and are discussed.","output":"Motivations for Social Distancing and App Use as Complementary Measures to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quantitative Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To identify factors associated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and/or intubation for children with bronchiolitis. METHODS We performed a 16-center, prospective cohort study of hospitalized children aged <2 years with bronchiolitis. For 3 consecutive years from November 1 until March 31, beginning in 2007, researchers collected clinical data and a nasopharyngeal aspirate from study participants. We oversampled children from the ICU. Samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate were tested by polymerase chain reaction for 18 pathogens. RESULTS There were 161 children who required CPAP and/or intubation. The median age of the overall cohort was 4 months; 59% were male; 61% white, 24% black, and 36% Hispanic. In the multivariable model predicting CPAP/intubation, the significant factors were: age <2 months (odds ratio [OR] 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-11.5), maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.9), birth weight <5 pounds (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.0-2.6), breathing difficulty began <1 day before admission (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.1), presence of apnea (OR 4.8; 95% CI 2.5-8.5), inadequate oral intake (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.3-4.3), severe retractions (OR 11.1; 95% CI 2.4-33.0), and room air oxygen saturation <85% (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.0-4.8).

However, a second wave started in November 2020, when an even higher magnitude of deaths hit the city. The arrival of the second wave coincided with the emergence of the Gamma (P.1) variant of SARS-CoV-2, with higher transmissibility, a younger age profile of cases, and a higher hospitalization rate.

We find that the two waves with 30% and 40% infection attack rates, respectively, and a reinfection ratio at 3.4C13.9%, can explain the two waves well. We argue that the second wave was likely because the city had not exceeded the herd immunity level after the first wave.

In addition to the core domains required to link the substrates, they often include specialized tailoring domains, which introduce chemical modifications and allow the product to access a large expanse of chemical space. It is still unknown how the NRPS tailoring domains are structurally accommodated into megaenzymes or how they have adapted to function in nonribosomal peptide synthesis.

This module includes the specialized tailoring formylation domain, and states are captured that represent every major step of the assembly-line synthesis in the initiation module. The transitions between conformations are large in scale, with both the peptidyl carrier protein domain and the adenylation subdomain undergoing huge movements to transport substrate between distal active sites. The structures highlight the great versatility of NRPSs, as small domains repurpose and recycle their limited interfaces to interact with their various binding partners.

METHODS: A total of 100 faecal samples of healthy broilers were screened by conventional methods and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect E. faecium and their resistance genes. Disk diffusion test was employed to determine antibiotic profiles. RESULTS: By PCR, among 100 samples, 45% [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.62%C54.76%] were positive for E. faecium. Based on antibiogram, all the E. faecium isolates were found resistant to ampicillin, and frequently (93.33%C55.56%) resistant to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, streptomycin, erythromycin, and imipenem; moderate to lower (26.67%C4.44%) resistance to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and vancomycin.

Methods: Cluster Randomised Trials in outpatients care, n = 254. The subjects were divided into experimental (EG: n = 110) and control groups (CG: n = 144). The EG received ivermectin orally 4 tablets of 6 mg = 24 mg every 7 days for 4 weeks. All participants were diagnosed by positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 and were evaluated by clinical examination, at the beginning and the end of protocol. Data analyzed using proportion, bivariate and logistic regression. P -value was considered significant at the p < 005 threshold.

Findings: Both groups were similar in age, sex, and comorbidities (EG: median age = 400, range: 180C750, 4211% Female;CG: median age = 36, range: 180C710, 5789% Female). A significant reduction in the percentage of participants with symptoms (PPS) was observed in the EG and CG when the clinical evaluation of symptoms was performed from 5th to 9th ( p = 00005). When the clinical evaluation was performed from 10th to 14th day there was no significant difference.

Then, the chance to obtain outpatient discharge was independent of variables sex, age, and comorbidities. Interpretation Treatment with ivermectin in outpatients care with mild disease of COVID-19 managed to slightly reduce PPS. Also, this treatment improved the clinical state to obtain outpatient discharge, even in the presence of comorbidities.

While vaccination is the preferred intervention strategy against influenza, its efficacy is reduced in the elderly and infants who are most susceptible to severe and/or fatal infections. In addition, antigenic variation of IAV complicates the production of efficacious vaccines. Similarly, effectiveness of currently used antiviral drugs is jeopardized by the development of resistance to these drugs. Like many viruses, IAV is reliant on host factors and signaling-pathways for its replication, which could potentially offer alternative options to treat infections. While host-factors have long been recognized as attractive therapeutic candidates against other viruses, only recently they have been targeted for development as IAV antivirals. Future strategies to combat IAV infections will most likely include approaches that alter host-virus interactions on the one hand or dampen harmful host immune responses on the other, with the use of biological response modifiers (BRMs). In principle, BRMs are biologically active agents including antibodies, small peptides, and/or other (small) molecules that can influence the immune response. BRMs are already being used in the clinic to treat malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Repurposing such agents would allow for accelerated use against severe and potentially fatal IAV infections. In this review, we will address the potential therapeutic use of different BRM classes to modulate the immune response induced after IAV infections.","output":"Response Modifiers: Tweaking the Immune Response Against Influenza A Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a rare complication associated with vaccines targeting various diseases, including influenza, measles\\\\mumps\\\\rubella, hepatitis B, and diphtheria\\\\tetanus\\\\pertussis.

The isolation and social distancing, the increased fear of being infected or infecting others and the insecurity generated by the economic impact, could contribute to an increase in the incidence of mental health issues, such as psychotic disorders.ObjectivesThe aim is to discuss four clinical cases in order to provide further evidence on this matter.MethodsWe report on three females and one male with no personal psychiatric history who were admitted to a tertiary hospital during the first three months after the declaration of the pandemic. The average age was 44,25  14,97 years.ResultsAll patients met the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria for acute and transient psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were triggered by the stress generated from the COVID-19. Complementary tests were unremarkable. They all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid discharge with favorable response to relatively low doses of antipsychotics was possible with a mean length of stay of 7,25  2,86 days. In two of the cases the delirious content was predominantly marked by the coronavirus itself.ConclusionsIt has been suggested that the intense psychosocial stress associated with a new life-threatening disease and national lockdown restrictions could be triggers for new-onset psychotic disorders.

Early detection of COVID-19 cases is essential to control the spread in healthcare facilities. However, real-world data on the screening criteria for hospitalized patients remain scarce. We aimed to explore whether patients with negative results of pre-hospital screening for COVID-19 should be rescreened after admission in a low-prevalence (less than 3% of the world average) setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included patients in central Taiwan who were negative at the first screening but were newly diagnosed with pneumonia or had a body temperature above 38 degrees Celsius during their hospitalization. Each patient might be included as an eligible case several times, and the proportions of cases who were rescreened for COVID-19 and those diagnosed with COVID-19 were calculated. A logistic regression model was constructed to identify factors associated with rescreening. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests were used to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 3549 cases eligible for COVID-19 rescreening were included. There were 242 cases (6.8%) who received rescreening. In the multivariable analysis, cases aged 75 years or older, those with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, or patients visiting specific departments, such as the Cardiovascular Center and Department of Neurology, were more likely to be rescreened. None was diagnosed with COVID-19 after rescreening. There was no known cluster infection outbreak in the hospital or in the local community during the study period and in the following two months. CONCLUSION: In Taiwan, a country with a low COVID-19 prevalence, it was deemed safe to rescreen only high-risk hospitalized patients.

METHOD: A retrospective cohort study took place, and data from 740 subjects, from all 32 states of Mexico, were analyzed. The association between the studied factors and severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) COVID-19 was evaluated through risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Severe illness was documented in 28% of participants. In multiple analysis, male gender (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06C1.20), advanced age ([reference: 15C29 years old] 30C44, RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.94C1.11; 45C59, RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.15C1.38; 60 years or older, RR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.29C1.60), chronic kidney disease (RR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.04C1.64) and thoracic pain (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.10C1.24) were associated with an increased risk of severe disease.

Mucosal vaccines that can induce antigen-specific immune responses in both the systemic and mucosal compartments are considered an effective measure to overcome infectious diseases caused by pathogenic microbes. We have recently developed a nasal vaccine system using cationic liposomes composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane and cholesteryl 3-N-(dimethylaminoethyl)carbamate in mice. However, the comprehensive molecular mechanism(s), especially the host soluble mediator involved in this process, by which cationic liposomes promote antigen-specific mucosal immune responses, remain to be elucidated. Herein, we show that intranasal administration of cationic liposomes elicited interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression at the site of administration. Additionally, both nasal passages and splenocytes from mice nasally immunized with cationic liposomes plus ovalbumin (OVA) were polarized to produce IL-6 when re-stimulated with OVA in vitro. Furthermore, pretreatment with anti-IL-6R antibody, which blocks the biological activities of IL-6, attenuated the production of OVA-specific nasal immunoglobulin A (IgA) but not OVA-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-6, exerted by nasally administered cationic liposomes, plays a crucial role in antigen-specific IgA induction.","output":"Role of interleukin-6 in antigen-specific mucosal immunoglobulin A induction by cationic liposomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular diagnosis of malaria by nucleotide amplification requires sophisticated and expensive instruments, typically found only in well-established laboratories. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has provided a new platform for an easily adaptable molecular technique for molecular diagnosis of malaria without the use of expensive instruments.

The efficacy of LAMP using the new primer set was assessed in this study in comparison to that of a previously described set of LAMP primers as well as with microscopy and real-time PCR as reference methods for detecting P. falciparum. Pre-addition of hydroxy napthol blue (HNB) in the LAMP reaction caused a distinct color change, thereby improving the visual detection system. The new LAMP assay was found to be 99.1% sensitive compared to microscopy and 98.1% when compared to real-time PCR. Meanwhile, its specificity was 99% and 100% in contrast to microscopy and real-time PCR, respectively. Moreover, the LAMP method was in very good agreement with microscopy and real-time PCR (0.94 and 0.98, respectively). This new LAMP method can detect at least 5 parasites/L of infected blood within 35 min, while the other LAMP method tested in this study, could detect a minimum of 100 parasites/L of human blood after 60 min of amplification.

This study identifies excess oceanic evaporation, in conjunction with the RCMs' boundary conditions, as drivers contributing to these biases in RCMs with forced sea surface temperatures in a CORDEX RCM ensemble over Europe. The RCMs are relaxed to the prescribed lateral boundary conditions originating from a global model, effectively matching the driving model's overall atmospheric moisture flux divergence. As a consequence, excess oceanic evaporation results in positive precipitation biases over land due to forced internal recycling of moisture to maintain the overall flux divergence prescribed by the boundary conditions. This systematic behaviour is shown through an analysis of long-term atmospheric water budgets and atmospheric moisture exchange between oceanic and continental areas in a multi-model ensemble.","output":"Boundary condition and oceanic impacts on the atmospheric water balance in limited area climate model ensembles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The small GTPase Rab5 has been well defined to control the vesicle-mediated plasma membrane protein transport to the endosomal compartment. However, its function in the internalization of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, an important component of adherens junctions, and as a result regulating the endothelial cell polarity and barrier function remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) simulation markedly enhanced the activation and expression of Rab5 in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), which is accompanied by VE-cadherin internalization. In parallel, LPS challenge also induced abnormal cell polarity and dysfunction of the endothelial barrier in HPMECs. LPS stimulation promoted the translocation of VE-cadherin from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments, and intracellularly expressed VE-cadherin was extensively colocalized with Rab5. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of Rab5a expression attenuated the disruption of LPS-induced internalization of VE-cadherin and the disorder of cell polarity. Furthermore, knockdown of Rab5 inhibited the vascular endothelial hyperpermeability and protected endothelial barrier function from LPS injury, both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that Rab5 is a critical mediator of LPS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, which is likely mediated through regulating VE-cadherin internalization. These findings provide evidence, implicating that Rab5a is a potential therapeutic target for preventing endothelial barrier disruption and vascular inflammation.

In addition, nursing home residents have been one of the most heavily affected populations during this pandemic. Due to insurance reasons, patients requiring outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) may be discharged to a post-acute care facility (PACF) for the sole purpose of receiving intravenous antibiotics, placing these patients at higher risk of COVID-19 infection. This study evaluated hospital readmissions due to COVID-19 in OPAT patients. METHODS: Adult patients who received OPAT between March 16 and May 31, 2020 were included. Patients were identified via an OPAT database and reason for readmission was reviewed via the electronic medical record. Patients with ongoing courses of OPAT as of May 31, 2020 were excluded. The primary outcome was readmission due to COVID while receiving OPAT. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: During the study period, 266 OPAT patients were identified, with 88 (31%) patients discharged to PACFs. There were 49 (18%) total readmissions, with 3 (6%) readmitted due to COVID-19. All 3 patients were readmitted from unique PACFs. This resulted in 3/16 (19%) readmissions due to COVID-19 in patients discharged to PACFs as compared to none for OPAT patients discharged to home.

After successfully validating the IDW-ICA, the iron grades were estimated in the Baba Ali iron mine, the most prominent iron mine in the west of Iran. For this, after gathering data from thirty-two boreholes, the grade estimations were conducted using IDW, kriging, and IDW-ICA.

One of these concepts is social intelligence (SI), i.e., the set of abilities that allow successful interaction with other people.

However, the relationship of ToM to SI remains poorly explored. Our recent research revealed an association between the gray matter volume of the caudate nucleus and the degree of SI as measured by the Guilford-Sullivan test. It led us to question whether this structural peculiarity is reflected in changes to the integration of the caudate with other areas of the brain associated with socio-cognitive processes, including the ToM system. We conducted seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis of resting-state fMRI data for 42 subjects with the caudate as a region of interest. We found that the scores of the Guilford-Sullivan test were positively correlated with the FC between seeds in the right caudate head and two clusters located within the right superior temporal gyrus and bilateral precuneus. Both regions are known to be nodes of the ToM network.

The independent role of each component contributing to the risk of COVID-19 is unknown, and how some non-cardiometabolic comorbidities affect the risk of COVID-19 remains unclear. Methods A retrospective follow-up design was adopted. A total of 1,160 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled from nine provinces in China. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the patients medical records. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the associations between comorbidities (cardiometabolic or non-cardiometabolic diseases), clinical severity, and treatment outcomes of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to describe the role of the palliative care team for patients on ECMO for COVID-19 infection. The secondary objective was to describe the clinical outcomes for this cohort. DESIGN: Case series. SETTINGS/SUBJECTS: All patients age 18 or older infected by the novel coronavirus who required cannulation on ECMO from March through July of 2020, at an urban, academic medical center in the United States. Inter-disciplinary palliative care consultation occurred for all patients. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (median age 43 years [range 28-64], mean body mass index 34.9 kg/m2 [SD 9.2], 65% Hispanic ethnicity) were cannulated on ECMO. Eleven patients died during the hospitalization (48%). Patients older than 50 years of age demonstrated a trend toward increased odds of death compared to those younger than 50 years of age (OR 9.1, P = 0.07).

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources confirmed that IPS data, which includes symptoms, therapies, medications, and laboratory data, can be efficiently transferred and exchanged on the system for easy access by physicians. To protect privacy, patient data are deidentified. All systems are protected by blockchain architecture, including data encryption, validation, and exchange of records. RESULTS: To achieve worldwide COVID-19 surveillance, a global infectious disease information exchange must be enacted. The COVID-19 surveillance system was designed based on blockchain architecture. The IPS was used to exchange case study information among physicians. After being verified, physicians can upload IPS files and receive IPS data from other global cases. The system includes a daily IPS uploading and enhancement plan, which covers real-time uploading through the interoperation of the clinic system, with the module based on the Open Application Programming Interface architecture. Through the treatment of different cases, drug treatments, and the exchange of treatment results, the disease spread can be controlled, and treatment methods can be funded. In the Infectious Disease Case Tracking module, we can track the moving paths of infectious disease cases. The location information recorded in the blockchain is used to check the locations of different cases. The Case Tracking module was established for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track cases and prevent disease spread. CONCLUSIONS: We created the IPS of infectious diseases for physicians treating patients with COVID-19. Our system can help health authorities respond quickly to the transmission and spread of unknown diseases, and provides a system for information retrieval on disease transmission. In addition, this system can help researchers form trials and analyze data from different countries. A common forum to facilitate the mutual sharing of experiences, best practices, therapies, useful medications, and clinical intervention outcomes from research in various countries could help control an unknown virus. This system could be an effective tool for global collaboration in evidence-based efforts to fight COVID-19.","output":"Global Infectious Disease Surveillance and Case Tracking System for COVID-19: Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the novel coronavirus, social distancing and crowd monitoring became vital in managing the spread of the virus.

Rapid detection of these viruses is crucial to inform implementation of appropriate control measures. The objective of our study is developing a simple, rapid and field applicable recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)Cnucleic acid lateral flow (NALF) immunoassay for detection of NDV and IBV. Isothermal amplification of the matrix protein (M) gene of NDV and the nucleoprotein (N) gene of IBV was implemented via recombinase polymerase amplification at 38 C for 40 min and 20 min, respectively using modified labeled primers. NALF device used in this study utilizes antibodies for detection of labeled RPA amplicons. The results revealed that RPA-NALF immunoassays can detect both viruses after 40 min at 38 C and only NDV after 20 min. The limit of detection (LOD) was 10 genomic copies/RPA reaction. The assays results on clinical samples collected from diseased chicken farms demonstrated a good performance in comparison with quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The assays established in this study can facilitate rapid, on-site molecular diagnosis of suspected cases of ND and IB viral infections as the results can be detected by the naked eye without the need for measuring fluorescence. Furthermore, the NALF device could be adapted to detect other infectious agents.","output":"Recombinase polymerase amplificationCnucleic acid lateral flow immunoassays for Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0245164.].","output":"Correction: Development of a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid and direct visual detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predictive machine learning models often lack interpretability, resulting in low trust from model end users despite having high predictive performance. While many model interpretation approaches return top important features to help interpret model predictions, these top features may not be well-organized or intuitive to end users, which limits model adoption rates. In this paper, we propose CrystalCandle, a user-facing model explainer that creates user-digestible interpretations and insights reflecting the rationale behind model predictions. CrystalCandle builds an end-to-end pipeline from machine learning platforms to end user platforms, and provides users with an interface for implementing model interpretation approaches and for customizing narrative insights. CrystalCandle is a platform consisting of four components: Model Importer, Model Interpreter, Narrative Generator, and Narrative Exporter. We describe these components, and then demonstrate the effectiveness of CrystalCandle through use cases at LinkedIn. Quantitative performance analyses indicate that CrystalCandle's narrative insights lead to lifts in adoption rates of predictive model recommendations, as well as to increases in downstream key metrics such as revenue when compared to previous approaches, while qualitative analyses indicate positive feedback from end users.","output":"CrystalCandle: A User-Facing Model Explainer for Narrative Explanations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coworking is characterized by different people sharing a workspace to benefit from the inspiring working atmosphere. Even before Covid-19, many positive effects and dynamics were not fully exploited by their users. One reason is a lack of trust among the users that leads to social isolation, although a coworking space should increase knowledge and idea exchange. As most people in coworking spaces use information and communication technologies (ICT) for their collaboration with their clients or employers, we examined if and how ICT can be used to support the positive effects and dynamics of coworking spaces. For this, we conducted eight interviews with freelancers and entrepreneurs who have already worked in coworking spaces in order to identify requirements for a complementary virtual coworking platform. We found that social proximity, motivation and knowledge sharing could be increased by such a platform. Based on the process virtualization theory, we derived six design principles.","output":"Virtually Extended Coworking Spaces? -- The Reinforcement of Social Proximity, Motivation and Knowledge Sharing Through ICT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Public health evaluation methods have been criticized for being overly reductionist and failing to generate suitable evidence for public health decision-making. A \\"complex systems approach\\" has been advocated to account for real world complexity. Qualitative methods may be well suited to understanding change in complex social environments, but guidance on applying a complex systems approach to inform qualitative research remains limited and underdeveloped. This systematic review aims to analyze published examples of process evaluations that utilize qualitative methods that involve a complex systems perspective and proposes a framework for qualitative complex system process evaluations. METHODS AND FINDINGS We conducted a systematic search to identify complex system process evaluations that involve qualitative methods by searching electronic databases from January 1, 2014-September 30, 2019 (Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science), citation searching, and expert consultations. Process evaluations were included if they self-identified as taking a systems- or complexity-oriented approach, integrated qualitative methods, reported empirical findings, and evaluated public health interventions. Two reviewers independently assessed each study to identify concepts associated with the systems thinking and complexity science traditions. Twenty-one unique studies were identified evaluating a wide range of public health interventions in, for example, urban planning, sexual health, violence prevention, substance use, and community transformation. Evaluations were conducted in settings such as schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods in 13 different countries (9 high-income and 4 middle-income). All reported some utilization of complex systems concepts in the analysis of qualitative data. In 14 evaluations, the consideration of complex systems influenced intervention design, evaluation planning, or fieldwork. The identified studies used systems concepts to depict and describe a system at one point in time. Only 4 evaluations explicitly utilized a range of complexity concepts to assess changes within the system resulting from, or co-occurring with, intervention implementation over time. Limitations to our approach are including only English-language papers, reliance on study authors reporting their utilization of complex systems concepts, and subjective judgment from the reviewers relating to which concepts featured in each study. CONCLUSION This study found no consensus on what bringing a complex systems perspective to public health process evaluations with qualitative methods looks like in practice and that many studies of this nature describe static systems at a single time point. We suggest future studies use a 2-phase framework for qualitative process evaluations that seek to assess changes over time from a complex systems perspective. The first phase involves producing a description of the system and identifying hypotheses about how the system may change in response to the intervention. The second phase involves following the pathway of emergent findings in an adaptive evaluation approach.","output":"Qualitative process evaluation from a complex systems perspective: A systematic review and framework for public health evaluators."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 has caused a great deal of fear indifferent communities.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional, bilingual web survey of 237 women who gave birth at two hospitals in New York City and assessed patient-reported experience and outcomes following the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the New York region. We ascertained SARS-CoV-2 status at delivery from the electronic medical record using participant-reported name and date of birth. We compared birth experience during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 15, 2020-May 11, 2020) to a pre-pandemic response period (January 1, 2020-March 14, 2020). We estimated risk ratios for associations between birth experience and anxiety, depressive symptoms, stress, birth-related PTSD, emergency department visits, timely postpartum visit, and exclusive breastfeeding. Multivariable models adjusted for age, race-ethnicity, insurance, education, parity, BMI, previous experience of maltreatment/abuse and cesarean delivery. RESULTS: Women who gave birth during the peak of the pandemic response, and those that were SARS-CoV-2 positive, Black, and Latina, had lower birth satisfaction and higher perceived health care discrimination. Women with lower birth satisfaction were more likely to report higher postpartum anxiety, stress, depressive symptoms, and lower exclusive breastfeeding. Experiencing one or more incident of health care discrimination was associated with higher levels of postpartum stress and birth-related PTSD. CONCLUSION: Hospitals and policy-makers should institute measures to safeguard against a negative birth experience during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among birthing people of color.","output":"Pandemic Birthing: Childbirth Satisfaction, Perceived Health Care Bias, and Postpartum Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Early, intensive, and high-quality interventions can often improve social communication outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

More than six million people have been infected, and more than 360,000 of them have died. This is the worst catastrophe suffered by mankind in recent history. In the face of this severe disaster, people all over the world are frightened of the prospect of facing an outbreak or an annual recurrence. However, the development of a vaccine will help control the impact of COVID-19. Women in particular have been more seriously affected by the pandemic. Since the pressure and physical load they suffer are often greater than what men endure, women are more threatened by COVID-19. Though women have a poorer quality of life and work and face worse economic conditions, they also tend to have better physiological immunity than men, which can ease the effect of COVID-19. The early development of a vaccine against COVID-19 is an important issue that must take into consideration womens better immune response to the virus along with the technique of hormone regulation. Relevant research has been conducted on female-specific vaccines in the past, and womens issues were considered during those clinical trials to ensure that complications and antibody responses were positive and effective in women. National policies should also propose good strategies for women to be vaccinated.

Only limited data are available on the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in France. AIMS: To investigate the characteristics, cardiovascular complications and outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in France. METHODS: The Critical COVID-19 France (CCF) study is a French nationwide study including all consecutive adults with a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection hospitalized in 24 centres between 26 February and 20 April 2020. Patients admitted directly to intensive care were excluded. Clinical, biological and imaging parameters were systematically collected at hospital admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. RESULTS: Of 2878 patients included (meanSD age 66.617.0 years, 57.8% men), 360 (12.5%) died in the hospital setting, of which 7 (20.7%) were transferred to intensive care before death.

The biosensor involves a disposable carbon electrode substrate doubly nanostructured with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and AuNPs modified with pyrene carboxylic acid (PCA) and 6-ferrocenylhexanethiol (Fc-SH), respectively. A synthetic amino terminated DNA capture probe was covalently immobilized on the CO2H moieties of PCA/rGO, while Fc-SH was used as a signaling molecule. Differential pulse voltammetry was employed to record the decrease in the oxidation peak current of Fc after the hybridization due to the hindering of the electron transfer upon the formation of the DNA-RNA duplex on the electrode surface.

Mediation analysis was used to examine the empirical model based on previous theories and literature. Close positive relationships were observed between all factors investigated (r = 0.22~0.73, p < 0.001). The relationships between sleep quality and physical and mental health were partially mediated by diet quality and physical activity. In clinical interventions, sleep quality, diet quality, and physical activity can be targeted to improve physical and mental health among the older adult populations.","output":"The Relationships between Sleep and Mental and Physical Health of Chinese Elderly: Exploring the Mediating Roles of Diet and Physical Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is rare autosomal recessive disease. CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 95% of cases. We aimed to share the first case of coexistence of simple virilizing-type congenital adrenal hyperplasia [I172N mutation in the CYP21A], triple translocation [t(9;11;12)], and ovarian granulose cell tumor. METHODS: A 59-year-old female patient was presented to our clinic, complaining with abdominal pain and distension. Physical examination revealed palpable abdominal mass, virilism, ambiguous genitalia, clitoramegaly, and hyperpigmentation. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed a giant mass originating from the right tubo-ovarian structure. RESULTS: The patient was operated in the light of the clinico-radiological features mentioned above. A giant mass weighing 3500 g was detected on the right tubo-ovarian structure during laparotomy, and mass was excised with right tubo-ovarian structure. Immunohistochemical examination revealed ovarian granulosa cell tumor. The high serum concentration of 17-OH progesterone was measured at baseline and after 250-g bolus of synthetic ACTH. In genetic analysis, we screened for six-point mutations, large deletions, and non-common mutations using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods, PCR, and sequencing of CYP21 gene respectively. The patient was detected to be homozygous for the I172N mutation. In addition, 50% of the metaphases examined had triple translocation [t(9;11;12)]. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, triple chromosomal translocations, and ovarian granulosa cell tumor has not been described previously.

Sweet almond (Prunus dulcis) oil is used as adjuvant therapy for a variety of health issues. Due to its high concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, it can prevent the formation of angiogenesis in a tumour. Also, aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that significantly reduces the angiogenesis of cancer. OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at investigating the effects of sweet almond oil alone and in combination with aspirin on angiogenesis. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats aged 12 to 14 weeks were used for the study. Oil was extracted from sweet almond seeds and was serially diluted. The ex vivo rat aorta ring assay was employed to investigate the antiangiogenic effect of sweet almond oil. An in vivo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay was used to quantify the zone of inhibition of blood vessels by sweet almond oil. The zone of inhibition was measured as the mean inhibition area of a blood vessel on eggs in mmstandard deviation. An acute toxicity study of sweet almond oil was conducted using the lethal dose 50 test. The data obtained were statistically analysed. RESULTS: The results revealed that when compared to the negative control, the serial concentration dose-response has a significant inhibition effect on blood vessel growth. The dose-dependent percentage of inhibition and sweet almond oil in combination with aspirin has a synergistic effect on the inhibition of blood vessel growth as a measure of the antiangiogenic activity. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the activity of sweet almond oil with aspirin synergism can greatly lower blood vessel growth in rat aorta rings and CAM assays.

As it detects photons after the cessation of real-time light excitation, autofluorescence can therefore be effectively eliminated. However, afterglow imaging is still in its infant stage due to the lack of afterglow agents with satisfactory lifetime, biocompatibility, and high luminescence brightness, particularly afterglow in the near-infrared region for in vivo applications. To address these issues, this study for the first time reports chlorin nanoparticles (Ch-NPs) emitting afterglow luminescence peaking at 680 nm with a half-life of up to 1.5 h, which is almost 1 order of magnitude longer than those of other reported organic afterglow probes. In-depth experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the brightness of the afterglow luminescence is strongly correlated with the singlet oxygen (1O2) capacity and the oxidizability of the chlorins. Benefitting from the ultralong half-life and the minimized imaging background, small metastatic tumor foci of 3 mm3 were successfully resected under the guidance of the afterglow luminescence generated upon a single shot of activation prior to the injection, which was impossible for conventional near-infrared fluorescence imaging due to tissue autofluorescence.","output":"Near-Infrared Afterglow Luminescence of Chlorin Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive In Vivo Imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade, Hong Kongs art market has experienced unprecedented growth, emerging as the second largest in the world in 2020 in terms of contemporary art auctions.

METHODS: The study was conducted in seven hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. The SF-36 questionnaire was administered one month after discharge. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression model were used to analyze the risk factors of psychometric properties impairment. RESULTS: In univariate analysis of independent risk factors, according to the comparison of whether the duration of positive nucleic acid was greater than 20 days, the positive nucleic acid duration was independently related to the decreased role-emotional value [100, IQR (66C100) vs 100, IQR (0, 100); p = 0.0156]. In addition, multivariable linear regression model showed that male sex and positive nucleic acid duration were related to decreased role-emotional value (p = 0.03< 0.05; p = 0.01< 0.05, respectively).

Histopathological organ changes might not only be attributable to a direct virus-induced effect, but also the immune response. The aims of this study were to assess the duration of viral presence, identify the extent of inflammatory response, and investigate the underlying cause of coagulopathy. METHODS: This prospective autopsy cohort study was done at Amsterdam University Medical Centers (UMC), the Netherlands. With informed consent from relatives, full body autopsy was done on 21 patients with COVID-19 for whom autopsy was requested between March 9 and May 18, 2020. In addition to histopathological evaluation of organ damage, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the composition of the immune infiltrate and thrombi were assessed, and all were linked to disease course. FINDINGS: Our cohort (n=21) included 16 (76%) men, and median age was 68 years (range 41C78). Median disease course (time from onset of symptoms to death) was 22 days (range 5C44 days). In 11 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 tropism, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were present in multiple organs, most abundantly in the lungs, but presence in the lungs became sporadic with increased disease course. Other SARS-CoV-2-positive organs included the upper respiratory tract, heart, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In histological analyses of organs (sampled from nine to 21 patients per organ), an extensive inflammatory response was present in the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. In the brain, extensive inflammation was seen in the olfactory bulbs and medulla oblongata. Thrombi and neutrophilic plugs were present in the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain and were most frequently observed late in the disease course (15 patients with thrombi, median disease course 22 days [5C44]; ten patients with neutrophilic plugs, 21 days [5C44]). Neutrophilic plugs were observed in two forms: solely composed of neutrophils with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), or as aggregates of NETs and platelets.. INTERPRETATION: In patients with lethal COVID-19, an extensive systemic inflammatory response was present, with a continued presence of neutrophils and NETs. However, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were only sporadically present at late stages of COVID-19. This suggests a maladaptive immune response and substantiates the evidence for immunomodulation as a target in the treatment of severe COVID-19.

However, there is controversy as to how long these patients should be followed up after coiling to detect reopening. We aimed to identify the rate of late reopening and the risk factors for reopening in a large single-center cohort of ruptured aneurysms that appeared adequately occluded at 6 months. We also aimed to assess whether rates of recurrence have altered over time with improving coil and angiographic technology. METHODS Patients treated between 1996 and 2010 were assessed and those with both 6-month initial and subsequent long-term follow-up with either digital subtraction angiography or magnetic resonance angiography were included. Aneurysms were stratified by features such as size, neck width, anatomical location and time of treatment: 1996-2005 (cohort 1) and 2006-2010 (cohort 2). ORs for risk of recurrence were calculated for aneurysm features and rates of recurrence in each cohort were compared using a (2) test. RESULTS 437 patients with 458 adequately occluded aneurysms at 6 months had mean long-term follow-up of 31 months; 57 (12.4%) were large ( 10 mm) and 104 (22.7%) were wide-necked (>4 mm). Nine aneurysms (2%) showed significant late anatomical deterioration whereby retreatment was considered or undertaken. The risk was greater for large aneurysms ( 10 mm) (OR 15.61, 95% CI 3.79 to 64.33, p=0.0001) or wide-necked aneurysms (>4 mm) (OR 12.70, 95% CI 2.60 to 62.13, p=0.0017).

High school students and college students tend to have a 1.7% higher risk of addiction. The length of time accessing e-commerce web and social media also increases the risk of internet addiction. YouTube and Instagram are social media applications that tend to pose a risk of addiction to respondents. A critical analysis of the Internet Addiction Test from a Philosophy of Science perspective was conducted. Finally we formulate recommendations on strategies the government and society could take in dealing with the problem of internet addiction.","output":"Study of internet and social media addiction in Indonesia during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, designated by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 has required many countries around the world to close work spaces, schools and public venues This has required policy makers and venue managers to investigate practical mitigation strategies using technology to exit the lockdown safely and enable the reopening of public spaces This paper introduces Digital personal protective equipment (PPE), a dynamic and affordable wearable approach that remind people to keep their distance and keep track of their contact traces This IoT based BLE probing technique approach empowers employers, city and venue managers to encourage social-distancing and trigger a friendly alert using vibration when social distancing is violated in privacy-preserving manner ? 2020 Owner/Author","output":"DigitalPPE: Low cost wearable that acts as a social distancingreminder and contact tracer: Poster abstract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recycling of CO2 by photoelectrochemical reduction has attracted wide interest due to its potential benefits when compared to electro- and photo-catalytic approaches Among the various available semiconductors, TiO2 is the most employed material in photoelectrochemical cells Besides, Cu is a well-known electrocatalyst for the production of alcohols from CO2 reduction RESULTS: A photoelectrochemical cell consisting of a TiO2-based membrane electrode assembly (MEA) photoanode and a Cu plate is employed to reduce CO2 to methanol and ethanol continuously under UV illumination (100 mW cm?2) A maximum increment of 4 3 mA cm?2 in current between the illuminated and dark conditions is achieved at ?2 V versus Ag/AgCl The continuous photoelectrochemical reduction process in the filter-press cell is evaluated in terms of reaction rate (r), as well as Faradaic efficiency (FE) and energy efficiency (EE) At ?1 8 V versus Ag/AgCl, a maximum reaction rate of r = 9 5 mol m?2 s?1, FE = 16 2% and EE = 5 2% for methanol and r = 6 8 mol m?2 s?1, FE = 23 2% and EE = 6 8% for ethanol can be achieved CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefits of the photoanode-driven system, in terms of yields and efficiencies, are observed when employing a TiO2-based MEA photoanode and Cu as dark cathode The results demonstrate first the effect of UV illumination on current density, and then the formation of alcohols from the continuous photoreduction of CO2 Increasing the external applied voltage leads to an enhanced production of methanol, but decreases ethanol formation The system outperforms previous photoanode-based systems for CO2-to-alcohols reactions ? 2019 Society of Chemical Industry","output":"Continuous conversion of CO2 to alcohols in a TiO2 photoanode-driven photoelectrochemical system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant was first detected in South Africa in November, 2021 and has rapidly spread to more than 90 countries.

We aimed to identify studies investigating pneumonia deaths in malnourished children and estimate mortality risk by malnutrition severity. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases to identify relevant studies. We used a network meta-analysis to derive ORs of death from pneumonia for moderately and severely underweight children using low weight-for-age, the most reported measure of malnutrition. We compared meta-estimates of studies conducted before and after 2000 to assess changes in mortality risk over time. We estimated the prevalence of underweight hospitalised children from hospital-based cohort studies and calculated the population attributable fraction of in-hospital pneumonia deaths from being underweight using our results. RESULTS: Our network meta-analysis included 33 544 underweight children from 23 studies. The estimated OR of death from pneumonia was 2.0 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.6) and 4.6 (95% CI 3.7 to 5.9) for children moderately and severely underweight, respectively. The OR of death from pneumonia for those severely underweight was 5.3 (95% CI 3.9 to 7.4) pre-2000 and remained high post-2000 at 4.1 (95% CI 3.0 to 6.0). Prevalence of underweight children hospitalised with pneumonia varied (median 40.2%, range 19.6C66.3) but was high across many LMIC settings. We estimated a median 18.3% (range 10.8C34.6) and 40.9% (range 14.7C69.9) of in-hospital pneumonia deaths were attributable to being moderately and severely underweight, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of death from childhood pneumonia dramatically increases with malnutrition severity. This risk has remained high in recent years with an estimated over half of in-hospital pneumonia deaths attributable to child malnutrition. Prevention and treatment of all child malnutrition must be prioritised to maintain progress on reducing pneumonia deaths.","output":"The impact of childhood malnutrition on mortality from pneumonia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Renal biopsy is useful to better understand the histological pattern of a lesion (glomerular, tubulointerstitial, and vascular) and the pathogenesis that leads to kidney failure.

Past experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and current reports suggest that making these decisions carries a heavy emotional toll for physicians around the world. We sought to explore Canadian physicians' preparedness and attitudes regarding resource allocation decisions. METHODS: From April 3 to April 13, 2020, we conducted an 8-question online survey of physicians practicing in the region of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, organized around 4 themes: physician preparedness for resource rationing, physician preparedness to offer palliative care, attitudes towards resource allocation policy, and approaches to resource allocation decision-making. RESULTS: We collected 219 responses, of which 165 were used for analysis. The majority (78%) of respondents felt \\"somewhat\\" or \\"a little prepared\\" to make resource allocation decisions, and 13% felt \\"not at all prepared.\\" A majority of respondents (63%) expected the provision of palliative care to be \\"very\\" or \\"somewhat difficult.\\" Most respondents (83%) either strongly or somewhat agreed that there should be policy to guide resource allocation. Physicians overwhelmingly agreed on certain factors that would be important in resource allocation, including whether patients were likely to survive, and whether they had dementia and other significant comorbidities. Respondents generally did not feel confident that they would have the social support they needed at the time of making resource allocation decisions. INTERPRETATION: This rapidly implemented survey suggests that a sample of Canadian physicians feel underprepared to make resource allocation decisions, and desire both more emotional support and clear, transparent, evidence-based policy.","output":"Physician preparedness for resource allocation decisions under pandemic conditions: A cross-sectional survey of Canadian physicians, April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined the effects of regional scale land use and local scale environmental and biotic stressors on alpha, beta and zeta diversities of native fish communities in wadeable streams and non-wadeable rivers in the Danube basin, Hungary. Relationships among land use and local scale environmental and biotic stressors were weak both in streams and rivers, suggesting that these stressors act relatively independently. Alpha diversity decreased strongly with increasing local scale environmental stressor intensity in rivers. On the contrary, its response to stressors was more obscure in streams, where the best-fit statistical model indicated the importance of the interaction between land use, local scale environmental and biotic stressors, while the secondly ranked model highlighted the negative impact of local scale environmental stressors. Analysis of variance using distance matrices provided evidence that stressors alone and in interactions explained compositional differences of pairs of study sites (beta diversity). Considering the degree of overall degradation, both local (alpha) and among-site (beta and zeta) diversity indices responded to increasing stressor intensity, generally negatively. Riverine fish communities showed higher degrees of similarity (lower beta and higher zeta) than stream fish communities. They also showed increasing similarity (i.e. homogenization) with increasing overall stressor intensity, unlike stream fish communities, which showed no relationship with overall stressor intensity. Our results suggest that the relationships between land use and local scale environmental and biotic stressors can be complex and so do their effects on biodiversity. While stressor specific indices can provide information on the role of specific stressors in some cases, the examination of overall stressor effects is needed to assess realistically the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on native fish diversity. Diversity indices that quantify among-site changes in species composition, such as measures of beta and zeta diversity, can be fruitful for better understanding the role of multiple stressors in structuring ecological communities.","output":"Multiple stressor effects on alpha, beta and zeta diversity of riverine fish"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Jails and prisons are exceptionally susceptible to viral outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

In contrast, there was no framing effect on attitudes and intentions in older adults, which might be a consequence of the positivity effect.

Traditional heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems operate with predefined schedules and maximum occupancy assumptions with no consideration of specific occupant information. These generalized assumptions usually do not align with the actual demand and result in over-conditioning and occupant discomfort. In recent years, with the aid of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) and Computer Science (CS), it is possible to acquire real-time and accurate occupant information to satisfy the exact thermal requirement through specific HVAC control in one particular built environment. This mechanism is called HVAC Occupant-centric Control (OCC). HVAC OCC strategy starts with collecting the occupants information (e.g., presence/absence) and then applies it to meet the occupants requirement (e.g., thermal comfort). However, even though some research studies and field pilot demonstrations have been devoted to the field of OCC, there is a lack of systematic knowledge about occupant data, which is the principal component of OCC for HVAC researchers and practitioners. To fill this gap, this review paper discusses OCC with a particular emphasis on occupant information and investigates how this information can assist HVAC operation in providing an acceptable built environment in required spaces during the required time.

All US states have adopted NPI policies, but the compliance to these measures and influence of sociopolitical factors on NPI adherence is unknown. NPI adherence may be approximated by personal mobility in a population that is tracked by anonymous mobile phone data. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study of state-level mobility changes across the US. METHODS: State-level mobility was based on anonymous mobile phone data from multiple participating carriers collected by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (http://www.healthdata.org). Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to examine the strength and direction of the relationship between political affiliations and mobility restriction across states. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to assess other factors that may impact personal travel. RESULTS: All states experienced a decline in personal mobility but had varying nadirs ranging from a 34% to a 69% reduction in mobility, which was not temporally related to the timing of state-level NPI measures. There was a statistically significant linear and negative correlation (r = -0.79) between the proportion of Republicans/leaning Republicans and NPI adherence across US states. The negative association between Republicans and NPI adherence was significant even when adjusting for urbanization, proportion of essential workers, population, Gini index, and poverty rates.

We develop this idea in a dynamic equilibrium model of an economy subject to a pandemic. Just as in conventional SIR models, infection rates depend on how much time people spend at home versus working outside the home. But in our model, whether to go out to work is a decision made by individuals who trade off higher pay from working outside the home today versus a higher risk of infection and expected future economic and health-related losses. As a result, pandemic dynamics depend on factors that have no relevance in conventional models. In particular, expectations and forward-looking behavior are crucial and can result in multiplicity of equilibria with different levels of economic activity, infection, and deaths.

METHODS: Data from 73 patients who underwent surgery for PC from November 2015 to January 2018 at the General and Pancreatic Surgery Unit, The Pancreas Institute, University Hospital of Verona Hospital, Verona, Italy, were retrospectively evaluated. The Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS)-2002 was used to evaluate the preoperative nutritional risk. Body composition was assessed using bioimpedance vectorial analysis (BIVA) on the day prior to surgery. The effect of clinical, pathological, and nutritional characteristics on overall survival (OS) was investigated using a Cox and logistic regression model. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Most patients (80.8%) were at preoperative risk of malnutrition (NRS-2002 &#8805; 3) despite a mean BMI of 24.1 kg/m2( 4.3). Twenty-four patients (32.9%) received neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey sent to healthcare practitioners working in various hospitals and community pharmacies. Demographic, professional and psychological characteristics (distress using Kessler-6 questionnaire, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion) were measured as were sources of fear. Descriptive and multivariable statistics were performed using level of distress as the outcome. RESULTS: We surveyed 937 practitioners (56.1% females). Approximately 68%, 14%, and 18% were nurses/technicians, physicians, and pharmacists (respectively). 32% suffered from high distress while 20% suffered from severe distress. Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were reported (in past seven days) by approximately 34%, 34%, 19%, and 29% of subjects (respectively). Being older or male, a positive perception of communications with peers, and being satisfied at work, were significantly associated with lower distress. Conversely, suffering burnout; reporting sleep-related functional problems; exhaustion; being a pharmacist (relative to a physician); working in a cancer center; harboring fear about virus spreading; fear that the virus threatened life; fear of alienation from family/friends; and fear of workload increases, were significantly associated with higher distress. CONCLUSION: Despite low caseloads, Jordanian practitioners still experienced high levels of distress. Identified demographic, professional and psychological factors influencing distress should inform interventions to improve medical professionals' resilience and distress likelihood, regardless of the variable Covid-19 situation.","output":"The inevitability of Covid-19 related distress among healthcare workers: Findings from a low caseload country under lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To explore whether comments could be used as an assistant tool for heuristic decision-making, especially in cases where missing, incomplete, uncertain, or even incorrect evidence is acquired. Methods: Six COVID-19 drug candidates were selected from WHO clinical guidelines. Evidence-comment networks (ECNs) were completed of these six drug candidates based on evidence-comment pairs from all PubMed indexed COVID-19 publications with formal published comments. WHO guidelines were utilized to validate the feasibility of comment-derived evidence assertions as a fast decision supporting tool. Results: Out of 6 drug candidates, comment-derived evidence assertions of leading subgraphs of 5 drugs were consistent with WHO guidelines, and the overall comment sentiment of 6 drugs was aligned with WHO clinical guidelines. Additionally, comment topics were in accordance with the concerns of guidelines and evidence appraisal criteria. Furthermore, half of the critical comments emerged 4.5 months earlier than the date guidelines were published. Conclusions: Comment-derived evidence assertions have the potential as an evidence appraisal tool for heuristic decisions based on the accuracy, sensitivity, and efficiency of evidence-comment networks. In essence, comments reflect that academic communities do have a self-screening evaluation and self-purification (argumentation) mechanism, thus providing a tool for decision makers to filter evidence.","output":"A comment-derived evidence appraisal approach for decision-making using uncertain evidence (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Over a year into the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 continues to perplex healthcare workers with several atypical clinical manifestations. There is growing literature on SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium. Scarce are cases illustrating this novel pathogen presenting with pneumoperitoneum. It remains unclear whether this relatively rare finding is benign or ominous of impending cardiorespiratory failure. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56yoM presents to the ER with dyspnea and hypoxia. He is PCR-positive for COVID-19. An ABG drawn after he is placed on BIPAP shows 7.072/99.5/66.9/29 with 80% SpO2. Due to PaO2:FiO2 ratio of 66, indicating severe ARDS, the patient was intubated. Follow-up CXR shows multifocal opacities. Within 1 hour, he becomes hypotensive and repeat CXR (Fig1.1a) shows a right pneumothorax. Physical exam findings include apical crepitus and diffuse rales. Labs show elevated inflammatory markers (Fig2.1). He is given high-dose dexamethasone, remdesevir, and tocilizumab. CXR 1 day later reveals free air under the diaphragm. A follow-up CT chest/abdomen (Fig3.1) shows bilateral pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoperitoneum. Bilateral chest tubes are placed within 48 hours (Fig1.1b), infraclavicular incisions (Gills' procedures) are made to release trapped subcutaneous air, and ventilator adjustments are made. His prognosis remains guarded and he continues to require ventilatory support. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 induced ARDS occurs via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The diaphragm surface is lined with ACE2 receptors and surface myofibers bind viral RNA. Highlighted via RNA in-situ hybridization, a post-mortem analysis has shown diaphragm fibrosis is >2x higher in COVID-ICU patients compared with other ICU patients. In our case, one possible mechanism of pneumoperitoneum is from mediastinal air seeding through one of many fibrosed diaphragmatic weak points to the peritoneal cavity. Other explanations for COVID-19 related pneumoperitoneum include the Macklin effect or direct intestinal penetration via ACE2 receptors expressed on intestinal mucosa. Our patient developed a small pneumothorax upon being placed on mechanical ventilation. This correlates to PRMV (Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum related to mechanical ventilation) inducing further barotrauma. Nonetheless, direct diaphragmatic myopathy from SARS-CoV-2 is also contributory. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe ARDS from COVID-19 are at significantly higher risk of barotrauma, as up to 40% of patients will have some form due to reduced lung compliance. A higher incidence of diaphragmatic fibrosis predisposes patients to an increased risk of pneumoperitoneum, especially in the setting of severe ARDS with PRMV-related barotrauma. We recommend clinicians to be vigilant about this complication as it poses a therapeutic challenge in patients continuing to require mechanical ventilation.

The overall (5 years) survival rate of PC is less than 9% and is anticipated to be aggravated in the future due to the lack of molecular acquaintance and diagnostic tools for its early detection. Multiple factors are involved in the course of PC development, including genetics, cigarette smoking, alcohol, family history, and aberrant epigenetic signatures of the epigenome. In this review, we will mainly focus on the genetic mutations and epigenetic signature of PC. Multiple tumor suppressor and oncogene mutations are involved in PC initiation, including K-RAS, p53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4. The mutational frequency of these genes ranges from 50 to 98% in PC. The nature of mutation diagnosis is mostly homozygous deletion, point mutation, and aberrant methylation. In addition to genetic modification, epigenetic alterations particularly aberrant hypermethylation and hypomethylation also predispose patients to PC. Hypermethylation is mostly involved in the downregulation of tumor suppressor genes and leads to PC, while multiple genes also represent a hypomethylation status in PC. Several renewable drugs and detection tools have been developed to cope with this aggressive malady, but all are futile, and surgical resection remains the only choice for prolonged survival if diagnosed before metastasis. However, the available therapeutic development is insufficient to cure PC. Therefore, novel approaches are a prerequisite to elucidating the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying PC progression for healthier lifelong survival.","output":"An overview of genetic mutations and epigenetic signatures in the course of pancreatic cancer progression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate nutritional approaches in university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Students participated voluntarily. The surveys were conducted on social media. Independent sample t and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied to analyze the difference in groups. Results: Nutrition scores on the days of curfew (Lockdown) and the days when there is no prohibition or restriction did not change according to gender (p>0.05). A significant difference was found in the nutrition scores of the students according to the levels they felt on the days when there was a curfew and, on the days, when there was no prohibition or restriction (p<0.05). A significant difference was found between the scores of the students of different faculties on the days when there was a curfew and, on the days, when there was no prohibition or restriction (p<0.05).

Previous studies in primary health care centers (PHCCs) in Indonesia have shown a high percentage of antibiotic therapy for URTIs. This study tries to analyze the difference in profiles of antibiotic prescription in the treatment of children and adults with URTI in Bangka Tengah, Indonesia. Methods Random prescriptions from patients diagnosed with URTIs (sinusitis, bronchitis, common cold, and pharyngitis) from all PHCCs in Bangka Tengah were collected from January to February 2018. Prescriptions from patients with overlapping diagnoses, such as URTI with diarrhea or typhoid, were excluded. Results During the two months of data collection, 1348 prescriptions for adults and children with URTIs were studied. Children were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.03-1.58) times more likely to be treated with antibiotics compared to adults. Amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic both in children (92.3%) and adults (78.6%). Ciprofloxacin was commonly prescribed in adults (14.6%) but not in children (0.3%). Conclusions This study confirms the major antibiotic overuse in patients with URTI, especially in children. Owing to the fact that children are more likely to get URTI of viral origin, they receive high percentage of antibiotic therapy.

Research on plant lncRNACmiRNA interactions is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose an accurate predictor, MILNP, for predicting plant lncRNACmiRNA interactions based on improved linear neighborhood similarity measurement and linear neighborhood propagation algorithm.

Oxidative stress and inflammation might play a role in migraine pathogenesis and the mood disorders. Considering the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), this study was designed to investigate its effect on oxidative, inflammatory and mood conditions in women with episodic migraine. METHODS In total 92 women with episodic migraine participated in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, receiving a 300 mg capsule of ALA or placebo twice daily for 3 months. To assess the oxidative and inflammatory status, the serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidative stress index (OSI) and C - reactive protein (CRP) were determined at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. A depression, anxiety, stress scale (DASS-21-items) questionnaire was used to evaluate mood status. RESULTS Finally, 79 patients reached the final analysis stage. At the end of the intervention, a significant decrease in the serum levels of MDA (means difference (MD): -0.83, 95% confidence intervals (CI): -1.04,-0.62 nmol/ml vs MD: -0.32, CI: -0.48,-0.15 nmol/ml; P <0.001) and CRP (MD:-0.78, CI: -1.17,-0.39 mg/L vs MD:-0.63, CI: -1.80,0.52 mg/L; P <0.001) was observed in the ALA as compared with the placebo group. But changes in serum GSH (P=0.086), TAC (P=0.068), TOS (P=0.225), and OSI (P=0.404) were not statistically significant. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress (with p<0.001, in all cases) had significantly decreased in the intervention as compared with the control group.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process, with educators now required to quickly adapt to and adopt such changes. The abundance of available systematic reviews has made the effectiveness of such approaches ambiguous especially in healthcare education. Therefore, a protocol of the overview of systematic reviews (OoSR) is planned to extrapolate the effectiveness of technology-based learning in undergraduate healthcare education. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Scopus, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection databases were selected. Screening was conducted independently by at least two authors and the decision for inclusion was done through discussion or involvement of an arbiter against a predetermined criteria. Included articles will be evaluated for quality using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews and Risk of Bias in Systematic Review tools, while primary systematic review articles will be cross-checked and reported for any overlapping using the 'corrected covered area' method. Only narrative synthesis will be employed according to the predefined themes into two major dimensions-theory and knowledge generation (focusing on cognitive taxonomy due to its ability to be generalised across disciplines), and clinical-based competence (focusing on psychomotor and affective taxonomies due to discipline-specific influence). The type of technology used will be identified and extracted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The OoSR involves analysis of secondary data from published literature, thus ethical approval is not required. The findings will provide a valuable insight for policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers in terms of technology-based learning implementation and gaps identification. The findings will be published in several reports due to the extensiveness of the topic and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conferences.

MethodA phase 1-2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done. Subjects were randomly distributed in 3 groups: placebo, 25 and 50{micro}g RBD. The product was applied intramuscularly, 0.5 mL in the deltoid region. During the first phase, two immunization schedules were studied: short (0-14-28 days) and long (0-28-56 days). In phase 2, only the short scheme was evaluated. The main endpoints were: safety and proportion of subjects with seroconversion of anti-RBD IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Blood samples were collected in several points according to the corresponding vaccination schedule to determine the level of RBD-specific IgG antibodies (seroconversion rates and geometric mean of the titers), the percentage of inhibition of RBD-ACE-2 binding and levels of neutralizing antibodies. ResultsThe product was well tolerated. Severe adverse events were not reported. Adverse reactions were minimal, mostly mild and local (from the injection site), resolved in the first 24-48 hours without medication. In phase 1, at day 56 (28 days after the third dose of the short vaccination schedule, 0-14-28 days) seroconversion of anti-RBD IgG was seen in 95.2 % of the participants (20/21) for the 50g group and 81 % of the participants (17/21) for the 25g group, and none in the placebo group (0/22); whereas neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were seen in 80 % of the participants (8/10) for the 50g group and 94.7% of the participants (18/19) for the 25g group. For the long schedule, at day 70 (14 days after the third dose) seroconversion of anti-RBD IgG was seen in 100% of the participants (21/21) for the 50g group and 94.7% of the participants (18/19) for the 25g group, and none in the placebo group (0/22); whereas neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were seen in 95 % of the participants (19/20) for the 50g group and 93.8% of the participants (15/16) for the 25g group In phase 2, at day 56 seroconversion of anti-RBD IgG was seen in 89.2% of the participants (214/240) for the 50g group, 77.7% of the participants (185/238) for the 25g group, and 4.6% in the placebo group (11/239); whereas neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were seen in 97.3% of the participants (146/150) for the 50g group and 95.1% of the participants (58/61) for the 25g group.

In this systematic review, we summarise studies that investigated the immunogenicity and safety of routine vaccines in children and adolescents with JARD on immunosuppressive treatment. We identified 37 studies investigating 2571 children and adolescents with JARD on immunosuppressive treatment and 4895 control children. Of the 56 geometric mean antibody titres measured, 19 (34%) were lower, six (11%) higher, and 31 (55%) similar; of the 39 seroprotection rates measured, 10 (26%) were lower, two (5%) higher, and 27 (69%) similar; and of the 27 seroconversion rates measured, nine (33%) were lower, two (8%) higher, and 16 (59%) similar in children with JARD on immunosuppressive treatment compared with control children. However, many of the studies were underpowered, and not designed to show non-inferiority between children with JARD and controls. Subgroup analysis for different types of immunosuppressive treatments was not feasible, as most studies did not report results by treatment. Severe adverse events were reported in 38 children (33 with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, four with systemic lupus erythematosus, and one in a healthy child); most of them were likely not related to the vaccination (e.g. elective hospitalisation or surgery). A worsening in disease activity was reported in 44 (2%) children with JARD; again, many of them were likely not related to the vaccination. There were no safety concerns with live attenuated vaccines; however, only few studies reported results for this. Conclusion: Vaccination in children with JARD on immunosuppressive treatment is safe and should be promoted, especially since these children are at increased risk for infection. The importance for the completion of vaccination schedules should be stressed. Strategies to compensate for the lower vaccine responses, which are found in approximately one-third of these children, include measuring antibody levels to determine the optimal timing for the administration of additional booster doses.

Social insects of temperate regions hibernate as well, but despite abundant knowledge on structural and functional plasticity in insect brains, the question of how seasonal activity variations affect insect central nervous systems has not yet been thoroughly addressed. Here, we studied potential variations of serotonin-immunoreactivity in visual information processing centres in the brain of the long-lived ant species Lasius niger. Quantitative immunofluorescence analysis revealed stronger serotonergic signals in the lamina and medulla of the optic lobes of wild or active laboratory workers than in hibernating animals. Instead of statistical inference by testing, differentiability of seasonal serotonin-immunoreactivity was confirmed by a machine learning analysis using convolutional artificial neuronal networks (ANNs) with the digital immunofluorescence images as input information. Machine learning models revealed additional differences in the third visual processing centre, the lobula. We further investigated these results by gradient-weighted class activation mapping. We conclude that seasonal activity variations are represented in the ant brain, and that machine learning by ANNs can contribute to the discovery of such variations.","output":"Seasonal variations of serotonin in the visual system of an ant revealed by immunofluorescence and a machine learning approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This editorial introduces the special issue on Diverse Disciplinary Approaches to the Study of Adolescent Religious and Spiritual Development.

A total of 40 individuals who had experienced at least two months of strict social distancing measures followed COVID Feel Good between June and July 2020 for one week. Primary outcome measures were depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, perceived stress levels, and hopelessness. Secondary outcomes were the experienced social connectedness and the level of fear experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Additionally, we also performed a clinical change analysis on primary outcome measures. As concerning primary outcome measures, participants exhibited improvements from baseline to post-intervention for depression levels, stress levels, general distress, and perceived stress (all p < 0.05) but not for the perceived hopelessness (p = 0.110). Results for the secondary outcomes indicated an increase in social connectedness from T0 to T1 (p = 0.033) but not a significant reduction in the perceived fear of coronavirus (p = 0.412). Among these study variables, these significant improvements were maintained from post-intervention to the 2-week follow-up (p > 0.05). Results indicated that the intervention was associated with good clinical outcomes, low-to-no risks for the treatment, and no adverse effects or risks.

The dimensionality of tasks ranges from small molecule physicochemical property assessment over protein-ligand interaction up to statistical analyses of biological data. This way, method development and usability both benefit from insights gained at both ends, when predictiveness and readiness of novel approaches are confirmed, but the pharmaceutical drug makers get early access to novel tools for the quality of drug products and benefit of patients. Quantum-mechanical and simulation methods particularly fall into this group of methods, as they require skills and expense in their development but also significant resources in their application, thus are comparatively slowly dripping into the realm of industrial use. Nevertheless, these physics-based methods are becoming more and more useful. Starting with a general overview of these and in particular quantum-mechanical methods for drug discovery we review a decade-long and ongoing collaboration between Sanofi and the Kast group focused on the application of the embedded cluster reference interaction site model (EC-RISM), a solvation model for quantum chemistry, to study small molecule chemistry in the context of joint participation in several SAMPL (Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands) blind prediction challenges. Starting with early application to tautomer equilibria in water (SAMPL2) the methodology was further developed to allow for challenge contributions related to predictions of distribution coefficients (SAMPL5) and acidity constants (SAMPL6) over the years. Particular emphasis is put on a frequently overlooked aspect of measuring the quality of models, namely the retrospective analysis of earlier datasets and predictions in light of more recent and advanced developments. We therefore demonstrate the performance of the current methodical state of the art as developed and optimized for the SAMPL6 pKa and octanol-water log P challenges when re-applied to the earlier SAMPL5 cyclohexane-water log D and SAMPL2 tautomer equilibria datasets. Systematic improvement is not consistently found throughout despite the similarity of the problem class, i.e. protonation reactions and phase distribution. Hence, it is possible to learn about hidden bias in model assessment, as results derived from more elaborate methods do not necessarily improve quantitative agreement. This indicates the role of chance or coincidence for model development on the one hand which allows for the identification of systematic error and opportunities toward improvement and reveals possible sources of experimental uncertainty on the other. These insights are particularly useful for further academia-industry collaborations, as both partners are then enabled to optimize both the computational and experimental settings for data generation.","output":"Quantum-mechanical property prediction of solvated drug molecules: what have we learned from a decade of SAMPL blind prediction challenges?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: COVID19 pandemic has forced physicians from different specialties to assist cases overload. Our aim is to assess gastroenterologist's assistance in COVID-19 by assessing mortality, ICU admission, and length of stay, and seek for risk factors for in-hospital mortality and longer hospital stay. METHODS: A total of 41 COVID-19 patients assisted by gastroenterologist (GI cohort) and 137 assisted by pulmonologist, internal medicine practitioners, and infectious disease specialists (COVID expert cohort) during October-November 2020 were prospectively collected. Clinical, demographic, imaging, and laboratory markers were collected and compared between both cohorts. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed to search for risk factors of mortality and longer hospital stays. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients died (15.1%), 11 were admitted to ICU (6.1%). There were no differences between cohorts in mortality (14.6% vs 15.4%;p = 0.90), ICU admission (12.1% vs 4%;p = 0.13), and length of stay (6.67  4 vs 7.15  4.5 days; p = 0.58).

The lockdown policy and period data were retrieved from the Indonesian Ministry of Health COVID-19 special task force website. The authors' empirical model for performance specification is based on annual data, following a common performance function in economics and finance literature. In addition to controlling for the standard error and province effect, the authors also controlled the COVID-19 cases and the province effect. Findings The lockdown deteriorates the firm's profitability, but it is not up to making the firms at financial distress level. Simply put, lockdown erodes the profitability significantly, leading to declining performance;however, it does not mean the firms generate default.

These DM-specific Abs were mutually exclusive and were detected in none of 34 patients with polymyositis, 326 with systemic sclerosis, and 97 with systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-Mi-2 was associated with classical DM without interstitial lung disease or malignancy, whereas anti-155/140 was associated with malignancy. Patients with anti-CADM-140 frequently had clinically amyopathic DM and rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease. Cumulative survival rates were more favorable in patients with anti-Mi-2 compared with those with anti-155/140 or anti-CADM-140 (P < .01 for both comparisons). Nearly all deaths occurred within 1 year after diagnosis in patients with anti-CADM-140. Conclusion Dermatomyositis-specific Abs define clinically distinct subsets and are useful for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with DM.","output":"Clinical correlations with dermatomyositis-specific autoantibodies in adult Japanese patients with dermatomyositis: a multicenter cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has shocked the world and fully alerted scientific community against means to tackle the pandemic The current work tries to assess the impact of COVID-19 in three European countries and evaluate the outcome using Gombertz function methods Methods: Daily mortality data were collected and analyzed from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for Greece, France, and Italy Results: The results show a good fit between the observed data and those obtained by the Gompertz function methods for the three countries Using standardization methods for population incidence parameters for comparison, Greece, France, and Italy show substantial differences among disease dynamics regarding incidence and mortality rates as well as disease doubling times Conclusions: The availability of daily epidemiological data about confirmed cases gives opportunities for research contributions through mathematical models, such as Gombertz, regarding comparison and analysis of COVID-19 dynamics and future trends among regions and countries ? 2020, Technogramma All rights reserved","output":"Covid-19 epidemic: Comparison of three european countries with different outcome using gompertz function method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existing literature evidences the potential of the e-learning methodology, although some call it into question Our study aimed to analyse the real scope of applying this methodology type to a lockdown situation like that caused by COVID-19 It could provide the scientific and educational community with useful novel information on e-learning and its real adequacy for schools in pre-university educational stages This qualitative study was designed using questionnaires with open-ended questions for students and semistructured interviews for teachers, management board members, and families of students of Primary and Secondary Education The scripts of data collection tools were made ad hoc The thematic analysis was carried out in accordance with the study dimensions by relating the access and use of technological resources in classrooms, implementing the e-learning methodology during face-to-face teaching, and finally knowing the effects of its application during remote teaching in the lockdown situation The results clearly show a need to adapt and adjust the implementation of this methodology by considering not only its specificities, but also a combination of e-learning and traditional teaching methodologies can help to introduce information and communication technologies (ICT) into classrooms To conclude, including such a methodology in the educational context can be argued for, provided that specific training is received to allow the potential of both online and traditional teaching to be leveraged","output":"A Qualitative Analysis of Implementing E-Learning during the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents an exploratory study of the posting behavior of digital influencers in social participation platforms.

However, influencers tend to restrict their posts to the domain subject they became popular for. Our goal is to identify the cost structure of posting behavior of influencers, from the desire to post to the actual act of posting. The findings indicate the two key factors influencers consider when posting are (a) the risk of losing followers and (b) the effort required to verify the information. On the other hand, followers indicate they like it when influencers voice their opinion on social causes. These findings are anchored on social influence theory. We also found different factors that motivate/demotivate people to post on social media. We noticed that the factors that will motivate a user to post can either be aroused in him (i.e., already internalized in the person) or can be planted in the person (i.e., from outside).","output":"The cost structure of influencers posts: the risk of losing followers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comprehensively characterizing the cellular composition and organization of tissues has been a long-term scientific challenge that has limited our ability to study fundamental and clinical aspects of human physiology.

In these low-income countries, most patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), whether it is mild or severe, are still treated empirically. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with the evolution and outcome of respiratory illnesses in patients aged under 5 years old. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in a paediatric ward in Antananarivo from November 2010 to July 2012 including patients under 5 years old suffering from respiratory infections. We collected demographic, socio-economic, clinical and epidemiological data, and samples for laboratory analysis. Deaths, rapid progression to respiratory distress during hospitalisation, and hospitalisation for more than 10 days were considered as severe outcomes. We used multivariate analysis to study the effects of co-infections. RESULTS: From November 2010 to July 2012, a total of 290 patients were enrolled. Co-infection was found in 192 patients (70%). Co-infections were more frequent in children under 36 months, with a significant difference for the 19C24 month-old group (OR: 8.0). Sixty-nine percent (230/290) of the patients recovered fully and without any severe outcome during hospitalisation; the outcome was scored as severe for 60 children and nine patients (3%) died. Risk factors significantly associated with worsening evolution during hospitalisation (severe outcome) were admission at age under 6 months (OR = 5.3), comorbidity (OR = 4.6) and low household income (OR = 4.1). CONCLUSION: Co-mordidity, low-income and age under 6 months increase the risk of severe outcome for children infected by numerous respiratory pathogens. These results highlight the need for implementation of targeted public health policy to reduce the contribution of respiratory diseases to childhood morbidity and mortality in low income countries.","output":"Outcome Risk Factors during Respiratory Infections in a Paediatric Ward in Antananarivo, Madagascar 2010C2012"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Although Saudi Arabia harbors a large number of confirmed cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Kingdom is characterized by a low case fatality rate, compared to that of other parts of the world Patient-specific factors can play a role in this observation Thus, we conducted the present retrospective study to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics of all fatalities resulting from COVID-19 infection in Saudi Arabia as of April 27, 2020 Materials and Methods: The present study was a multicentric, retrospective study that retrieved the data of all confirmed COVID-19-related deaths in Saudi Arabia from March 2 to April 27, 2020 Only records of the cases who underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction laboratory tests to confirm the presence of COVID-19 were retrieved The data of COVID-19 fatalities in Saudi Arabia were obtained from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network of the Ministry of Health Results: Up to April 27, 2020, 147 cases of COVID-19-related deaths were reported in Saudi Arabia Almost two-thirds of them were aged above 50 years and majority of them were male (83 7%) Health-care workers represented 3 1% of the dead cases (n = 4 cases) The vast majority of the cases were from Makkah (44 9%) and Madinah (21 8%) Among males, the number of Saudi cases was much lower than non-Saudi cases with 22 and 101 deaths, respectively Over 80% of the included cases had reported signs and symptoms before death, mainly fever and cough Out of the 129 cases who had available data regarding comorbidities, 104 cases (80 6%) had one or more comorbidities The median (interquartile range [IQR]) time from the onset of symptoms till test result confirmation was 5 5 (5) days, while the median (IQR) time from sample collection till test result confirmation was 1 (2) day On the other hand, the median time from symptom onset till hospitalization and that till death was 1 (3) and 7 (8) days, respectively Conclusion: COVID-19 is a growing pandemic with unprecedented spread rate and profound impact on the health of specific subsets of affected patients In the present report, we demonstrated that fatalities from COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia are more common in older age groups, male patients, and non-Saudi residents Besides, the presence of comorbidities is highly prevalent among fatalities from COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia The Saudi health-care system has the advantage of fast-track diagnosis, which, in return, could have contributed to the low case fatality rate observed in the Kingdom Further studies are required to identify the independent predictors of mortality for patients with COVID-19 ? 2021 Journal of Nature and Science of Medicine","output":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of fatalities from covid-19 in Saudi Arabia: A Multicentric, retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: People with depression, Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, and other psychiatric disorders suffer from fatigue, avolition, anergia, and other motivational dysfunctions, which can be highly treatment resistant. Animal tasks have been developed to measure effort-related choice, offering the option of high effort actions leading to more valued reinforcers vs. low effort/low reward activities. Such tasks are useful for preclinical studies related to drug development. Methods: A low effort bias can be induced in male and female rats by injection of the vesicular monoamine transport (VMAT-2) inhibitor tetrabenazine (TBZ), which induces depressive symptoms in people. Suppression of lever pressing is also induced by injections of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which provide an inflammatory challenge. These deficits can be reversed by drugs that are known dopamine transport (DAT) inhibitors, including lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and GBR-12909. Because many drugs that block DAT act as major stimulants and produce undesirable side effects, there is a need to develop and characterize novel atypical DAT inhibitors with unique neurochemical profiles. Results: Recent studies have shown that novel atypical DAT inhibitors, including modafinil analogs, also can reverse motivational dysfunctions induced by TBZ and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increase selection of high-effort activities involving physical effort. These compounds include modafinil, CE-123, CE-158, CT-005404, and others. Drugs that stimulate serotonin transmission are not effective in this regard. Conclusions: It is possible that this research will identify new avenues for drug treatment of effort-related motivational symptoms in humans, such as fatigue, avolition, anergia, and COVID-related fatigue.

In addition, the optimized gene was ligated to pPICZA and transformed to P. pastoris X33. After screening, a recombinant strain named X33-Sh33 with the highest activity was isolated from 96 recombinant colonies. The maximum activity and total protein concentration of the recombinant strain ShCsn46 were 2250 U/ml and 3.98 g/l, respectively. The optimal pH and temperature of purified ShCsn46 were 5.5 and 55C, respectively. Meanwhile, ShCsn46 was stable from pH 5.0 to 10.0 and 40 to 55C, respectively. The purified ShCsn46 was activated by Mn2+ and inhibited by Cu2+, Fe2+, and Al3+. In addition, substrate specificity of the purified ShCsn46 showed highest activity toward colloidal chitosan with 95% degree of deacetylation.

Whether they are triggered by signals emitted by productively infected cells of the respiratory tract or are, at least partially, resulting from physical interaction with virus particles, remains unclear. Here, we analyzed susceptibility and expression profiles of PBMCs from healthy donors upon ex vivo exposure to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In line with the absence of detectable ACE2 receptor expression, human PBMCs were refractory to productive infection. Bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing revealed JAK/STAT-dependent induction of interferon-stimulated genes, but not pro-inflammatory cytokines. This SARS-CoV-2-specific response was most pronounced in monocytes. SARS-CoV-2-RNA-positive monocytes displayed a lower ISG signature as compared to bystander cells of the identical culture. This suggests a preferential invasion of cells with a low ISG base-line profile or delivery of a SARS-CoV-2-specific sensing antagonist upon efficient particle internalization.

This study proposes a new idea to explore the effects of urban functional fragmentation on NO(2) variation with anthropogenic-emission restriction in China. First, NO(2) variations are quantified by an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with external variables-Dynamic Time Warping (SARIMAX-DTW)-based model.

Finally, the mediated impacts of anthropogenic-emission restriction are assessed by evaluating the fragmentation-NO(2) variation association before and during the lockdown during COVID-19. The findings reveal negative effects of industrial ED, public LSI, urban functional AI and NP and positive effects of public ED and industrial LSI on NO(2) variation based on the restricted anthropogenic emissions.

Moreover, in this common female patient population, there is markedly high prevalence of multiple cardio-metabolic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, which may significantly increase the risk for adverse COVID-19-related outcomes. This strong overlap of risk factors for both worse PCOS cardio-metabolic manifestations and severe COVID-19 should be highlighted for the clinical practice, particularly since women with PCOS often receive fragmented care from multiple healthcare services. Comprehensively informing women with PCOS regarding the potential risks from COVID-19 and how this may affect their management is also essential.

In this study we are aiming to validate an experimental model for the induction of uniform temperature elevation in osteolytic bone tumours, using the natural acoustic window provided by the cortical breakthrough. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experiments were conducted on ex vivo lamb shank by mimicking osteolytic bone tumours. The cortical breakthrough was exploited to induce hyperthermia inside the medullar cavity by delivering acoustic energy from a phased array HIFU transducer. MR thermometry data was acquired intra-operatory using the proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) method. Active temperature control was achieved via a closed-loop predictive controller set at 6 C above the baseline. Several beam geometries with respect to the cortical breakthrough were investigated. Numerical simulations were used to further explain the observed phenomena. Thermal safety of bone heating was assessed by cross-correlating MR thermometry data with the measurements from a fluoroptic temperature sensor inserted in the cortical bone. RESULTS Numerical simulations and MR thermometry confirmed the feasibility of spatio-temporal uniform hyperthermia ( 0.5 C) inside the medullar cavity using a fixed focal point sonication. This result was obtained by the combination of several factors: an optimal positioning of the focal spot in the plane of the cortical breakthrough, the direct absorption of the HIFU beam at the focal spot, the \\"acoustic oven effect\\" yielded by the beam interaction with the bone, and a predictive temperature controller. The fluoroptical sensor data revealed no heating risks for the bone and adjacent tissues and were in good agreement with the PRFS thermometry from measurable voxels adjacent to the periosteum. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of MR-guided focused ultrasound hyperthermia inside the medullar cavity of bones affected by osteolytic tumours.

Vaccinated animals developed humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibody titers at levels comparable to those found in convalescent humans and macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. After vaccination, all animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2, and the vaccine encoding the full-length S protein resulted in >3.1 and >3.7 log10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa, respectively, as compared with viral loads in sham controls.

Tissue damage caused by COVID-19 could be detected by several clinical indicators including hematological, immunological, biochemical, and inflammatory markers. This study was to detect these clinical parameters to reveal the correlation between the factors and their roles in the development of COVID-19, to explore the hazard factors in severe cases. Materials and Methods. A total of 200 participants of both sexes were included in the study, with an age range of (25C72) years, categorized into three main groups: 50 healthy individuals, 62 mild infected patients, and 88 severe infected patients with pneumonia. Different hematological and clinical parameters were included in the analysis (Basrah city, Iraq). Serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), ferritin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were assessed for all participants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The liver, renal, and cardiac functions were assessed by clinical chemistry testing. Results. COVID-19 patients had leukocytosis, with an increased number of neutrophils and a decreased lymphocyte count, according to our findings. In regard to inflammatory parameters, both ESR and hs-CRP showed significant differences between the two groups, whereas IL-6 was significantly higher in the total severe group compared to the other two groups. Biochemical results revealed that each lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) had significant changes in the total severe group. Among pneumonic with an O2 requirement and pneumonic without an O2 requirement, there were significant differences in immunological and inflammatory markers (p > 0.05). The neutrophils-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) was highly elevated in severe who required O2. Moreover, IL-6, lymphocytes, and neutrophils were possible risk factors for COVID-19 infection, with the strongest influence of IL-6 with a high odds ratio (OR: 24.138, 95% CI: 8.437C30.65, p < 0.01). Furthermore, there were significant correlations among the indicators. Conclusion. Each of IL-6, lymphocytes, and neutrophils might represent major factors in the severity of COVID-19 and IL-6 plays the main role in inducing the inflammatory and pathophysiology process that is known as the cytokine storm.","output":"Extensive Study on Hematological, Immunological, Inflammatory Markers, and Biochemical Profile to Identify the Risk Factors in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work investigates the increase of confirmed cases of West Nile virus and the relationship between weather-related patterns and the geographical expansion of West Nile virus in Greece, with a special focus on West Attica, Central Greece, a semi-arid, ecologically fragile Mediterranean area. Using data from the European Environment Agency, European Drought Observatory of Joint Research Centre, the pairwise relationship between surface air temperature anomalies, precipitation anomalies, soil moisture index anomalies, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation anomalies (fAPAR) was evaluated during summer time of 2018, a particularly intense virus outbreak. The empirical results of this study indicate that total precipitation during 2018 was extremely high, nearly 500% above the average. These conditions contributed to the increase of soil moisture index anomaly and fAPAR, creating an ideal microenvironment (wet soils and green pastures) for mosquito breeding. This phenomenon was directly associated with a drastic outbreak of West Nile virus cases in the area, compared with earlier years. Our results indicate how unusually high values of summer precipitation may have contributed (both through direct and indirect ecological channels) to the rapid spread of the West Nile virus in West Attica, causing a significant number of confirmed cases and fatalities.

In this report, we describe the assembly of a full-length cDNA from the positive-sense genomic RNA of the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an important poultry pathogen. The IBV genomic cDNA was assembled immediately downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter by in vitro ligation and cloned directly into the vaccinia virus genome. Infectious IBV RNA was generated in situ after the transfection of restricted recombinant vaccinia virus DNA into primary chick kidney cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. Recombinant IBV, containing two marker mutations, was recovered from the transfected cells.

However, due to the performance deterioration over time, its robustness and reliability appear not sufficient to allow a non-expert to use outside laboratory. It would be thus helpful to study what happens behind the decreasing tendency of the BCI performance. This paper explores the changes of brain networks and electrooculography (EOG) signals to investigate the cognitive capability changes along the use of the SSVEP-based BCI. The EOG signals are characterized by the blink amplitudes and the speeds of saccades, and the brain networks are estimated by the instantaneous phase synchronizations of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Experimental results revealed that the characteristics derived from EOG and brain networks have similar trends which contain two stages. At the beginning, the blink amplitudes and the saccade speeds start to reduce. Meanwhile, the global synchronizations of the brain networks are formed quickly. These observations implies that the cognitive decline along the use of the SSVEP-based BCI. Then, the EOG and the brain networks related characteristics demonstrate a slow recovery or relatively stable trend.

We compare seroprevalence in the same HCW population six months later, assess changes in risk factors for seropositivity with progression of the pandemic and serological response to vaccination.Methods: All staff of both hospitals (N=9038) were invited to participate in an online questionnaire and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in April 2021. We measured anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike antibodies. Frequencies and percentages for positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were calculated and adjusted relative risks for participant characteristics were calculated using multivariable regression analysis. - Findings: 5085 HCW participated. Seroprevalence increased to 21% and 13% respectively;26% of infections were previously undiagnosed. Black ethnicity, lower level of education, living with other HCW, and direct patient contact were significantly associated with seropositivity (p<.001). Breakthrough infection occurred in 23/4111(0.6%) of fully vaccinated participants;all had anti-S antibodies.Interpretation: The increase in seroprevalence reflects the magnitude of the third wave of the pandemic in Ireland. Genomic sequencing is needed to apportion risk to the workplace versus the household/community. Concerted efforts are needed to mitigate risk factors due to ethnicity and lower level of education, even at this stage of the pandemic. The undiagnosed and breakthrough infections call for ongoing infection prevention and control measures and testing of HCW in the setting of close contact. Vaccinated HCW with confirmed infection should be actively assessed, including SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing (WGS), serology testing and assessment of host determinants, to advance understanding of the reasons for breakthrough infection.Funding: This work was supported financially by the Irish Health Service Executive COVID-19budget.Declaration of Interest: None to declare.

The aim of this study was to explore the quality of the online education in China for international medical and nursing students from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as well as the factors that influenced their satisfaction with online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Questionnaires were developed and administered to 316 international medical and nursing students and 120 teachers at a university in China. The Chi-square test was used to detect the influence of participants' personal characteristics on their satisfaction with online education. The Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test was employed to identify the negative and positive factors influencing the online education satisfaction. A binary logistic regression model was performed for multiple-factor analysis to determine the association of the different categories of influential factors-crisis-, learner-, instructor-, and course-related categories, with the online education satisfaction. RESULTS: Overall, 230 students (response rate 72.8%) and 95 teachers (response rate 79.2%) completed the survey. It was found that 36.5% of students and 61.1% of teachers were satisfied with the online education. Teachers' professional title, students' year of study, continent of origin and location of current residence significantly influenced the online education satisfaction. The most influential barrier for students was the severity of the COVID-19 situation and for teachers it was the sense of distance. The most influential facilitating factor for students was a well-accomplished course assignment and for teachers it was the successful administration of the online courses. CONCLUSIONS: Several key factors have been identified that affected the attitudes of international health science students from LMICs and their teachers towards online education in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. To improve the online education outcome, medical schools are advised to promote the facilitating factors and cope with the barriers, by providing support for students and teaching faculties to deal with the anxiety caused by the pandemic, caring for the state of mind of in-China students away from home, maintaining the engagement of out-China students studying from afar and enhancing collaborations with overseas institutions to create practice opportunities at students' local places.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to online medical and nursing education during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives from international students from low- and middle-income countries and their teaching staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac amyloidosis, the majority of cases of which are due to immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), affects different aspects of the heart and cardiovascular system.

Is one of their goals, or virtues, to change individual responses to the pandemic? In this essay, we offer our perspective on these questions and place them in the context of other recent philosophical arguments about epidemiological models. We argue that clarifying the intended purpose of a model, and assessing its adequacy for that purpose, are moral-epistemic duties, responsibilities which pertain to knowledge but have moral significance nonetheless. This moral significance, we argue, stems from the inherent value-ladenness of models, along with the potential for models to be used in political decision making in ways that conflict with liberal values and which could lead to downstream harms.

During the lockdown period in 2020, 332 acute presentations were noted, and in the same period in 2019, 310 cases were noted. The mean patient age was higher in 2020, largely due to a 327% increase in do-it-yourself (DIY) injuries. Workplace injuries increased in 2020 despite a 9.5% reduction in hours-worked, reflecting a redistribution of workers into manual labour jobs with a higher risk for hand injuries. Patients who suffered low-energy injuries at work were also significantly younger in 2020, suggesting this effect was most pronounced in younger age-groups, probably due to the shutdown of hospitality-based industries. Domestic violence-related injuries increased in 2020, highlighting the need to maintain resources to provide support in such cases at subspecialty hand units, which are often largely outpatient-centred.

In a quantitative survey analysis based on the theory of planned behavior, we found high behavioral intention to use telemedicine among Swedish primary care physicians, but low reported use. The aim of this study was to further examine the physicians experiences regarding telemedicine, with a focus on possible explanations for the gap between intention and use, through analysis of the free-text comments supplied in the survey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The material was collected through a web-based survey which was sent out to physicians at 160 primary health care centers in southern Sweden from May to August 2019. The survey covered four areas: general experiences of telemedicine, digital contacts, chronic disease monitoring with digital tools, and artificial intelligence. A total of 100 physicians submitted one or more free-text comments. These were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach. RESULTS: The primary care physicians expressed attitudes towards telemedicine that focused on clinical usefulness. Barriers to use were the loss of personal contact with patients and a deficient technological infrastructure. The major concerns were that these factors would result in patient harm and an increased workload. The connection between intention and use postulated by the theory of planned behavior was not applicable in this context, as external factors in the form of availability and clinical usefulness of the specific technology were major impediments to use despite a generally positive attitude. CONCLUSION: All telemedicine tools must be evaluated regarding clinical usefulness, patient safety, and effects on staff workload, and end users should be included in this process.

The estimated R0 for the J&K region was 1.041; but by decreasing the RO by 10, 25, and 50%, we observed a great decrease in the daily number of new cases, especially by decreasing by 50%. Conclusion: In this study, we indicate positive effects of the preventive measures, such as lockdown and social distancing, taken in the J&K region, showing a stabilization of the growth curves of new cases of SARS-CoV-2, which tends to a strong decrease over time as the R0 decreases.","output":"Predicted impacts of government policies and actions on the SARS-CoV-2 disease in the northwestern Himalayan region, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxidative stress (OS) has been strongly associated with postprandial lipemia (PPL) in humans, and still requires further investigation in dogs. However, since lipemia interferes with spectrophotometric determinations such as those used to assess OS, the present study investigated the effect of PPL on OS parameters of healthy dogs. Twenty dogs had lipemic postprandial samples compared to the average of two non-lipemic moments. Subsequently, PPL was simulated in vitro using a commercial lipid emulsion and twelve pools of non-lipemic serum of these dogs were used to simulate the minimum, median and maximum concentrations of triglycerides obtained during the lipemic state. Serum OS parameters were assessed using the antioxidants uric acid, albumin and total bilirubin; total antioxidant capacity (TAC); total oxidant capacity (TOC); and lipid peroxidation. In vivo PPL caused an increase in albumin, TAC-CUPRAC, TAC-FRAP, uric acid (p < 0.0001), TOC (p = 0.0012) and total bilirubin (p = 0.0245); reduction of TAC-ABTS (p = 0.0008); and did not alter the lipid peroxidation (p = 0.8983). In vitro, levels of albumin increased at the three lipemic concentrations (p < 0.0001), uric acid increased in the median and maximum levels (p < 0.0001), and total bilirubin concentration increased only at the maximum lipemic level (p = 0.0012). All lipemic levels tested increased TAC-ABTS (p = 0.0011) and TAC-FRAP (p < 0.0001). TAC-CUPRAC (p = 0.5002), TOC (p = 0.5938) and lipid peroxidation (p = 0.4235) were not affected by in vitro lipemia. In conclusion, both the in vivo postprandial state and in vitro simulated lipemia affect oxidative stress markers in dogs depending on the oxidative stress marker, and thus the postprandial state and/or lipemic samples should be avoided.","output":"Postprandial lipemia causes oxidative stress in dogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to describe radiation level at our institution during transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus occlusion and to evaluate the components contributing to radiation exposure. BACKGROUND Transcatheter occlusion relying on X-ray imaging has become the treatment of choice for patients with patent ductus arteriosus. Interventionists now work hard to minimise radiation exposure in order to reduce risk of induced cancers. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive children who underwent transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus from January 2012 to January 2016. Clinical data, anatomical characteristics, and catheterisation procedure parameters were reported. Radiation doses were analysed for the following variables: total air kerma, mGy; dose area product, Gy.cm2; dose area product per body weight, Gy.cm2/kg; and total fluoroscopic time. RESULTS A total of 324 patients were included (median age=1.51 [Q1-Q3: 0.62-4.23] years; weight=10.3 [6.7-17.0] kg). In all, 322/324 (99.4%) procedures were successful. The median radiation doses were as follows: total air kerma: 26 (14.5-49.3) mGy; dose area product: 1.01 (0.56-2.24) Gy.cm2; dose area product/kg: 0.106 (0.061-0.185) Gy.cm2/kg; and fluoroscopic time: 2.8 (2-4) min. In multivariate analysis, a weight >10 kg, a ductus arteriosus width <2 mm, complications during the procedure, and a high frame rate (15 frames/second) were risk factors for an increased exposure. CONCLUSION Lower doses of radiation can be achieved with subsequent recommendations: technical improvement, frame rate reduction, avoidance of biplane cineangiograms, use of stored fluoroscopy as much as possible, and limitation of fluoroscopic time. A greater use of echocardiography might even lessen the exposure.","output":"Radiation exposure in transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus closure: time to tune?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Afatinib is an oral, irreversible ErbB family blocker approved for first-line treatment of metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expanded access program (EAP) allowed early access to afatinib and provided additional data on its safety, tolerability, and efficacy. METHODS The afatinib EAP was an open-label, multicenter, single-arm program in the United States that treated and followed patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. Afatinib 40 mg was administered orally once daily until discontinuation due to disease progression, adverse events (AEs), or transition to commercially available drug. RESULTS Three hundred twenty-two patients received 1 dose of afatinib. Most patients had received prior therapies. Drug-related AEs occurred in 89.4% of patients, including 7.8% with serious AEs. The most common afatinib-related AEs (all grades) were diarrhea (77.0%) and rash (36.0%). Dose reductions occurred in 31.1% of patients. Discontinuation rates due to diarrhea (1.6%) or rash/acne (0.3%) were low. Efficacy data were collected and analyzed when available, with 17.1% and 69.9% of patients achieving objective response and disease control, respectively, in this highly pretreated population.

Pathology training programs must adapt to these changes to ensure overall safety without significantly compromising training and educational mission of the institution. OBJECTIVE To describe the hybrid on-site and remote anatomic pathology training model in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was implemented in our pathology department and report the clinical fellows' responses to the survey about their experiences. DESIGN The hybrid model was implemented March 25, 2020. Fellows alternate weekly between working on-site and working remotely. On-site, fellows wear personal protective equipment and maintain social distancing. Remotely, fellows use digital pathology to review cases and supplement with online educational activities. Virtual \\"coffee breaks,\\" meditation, and exercise are part of the curriculum. Online platforms, including WebEx, Google Classroom, and Canvas, are used to continue educational activities. The survey was open May 19 through June 8. RESULTS Twenty-eight of the 29 clinical fellows (96%) responded. Many of the respondents indicated substantial increase in their skill with using digital pathology and online platforms during the pandemic. The top most helpful resources were the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology Interactive Microscopy courses (22/23=91% of clinical fellows found very or somewhat helpful), ExpertPath (19/23=82%), the College of American Pathologists virtual learning series (18/23=78%), the World Health Organization Blue Books (16/23=70%), the American Society of Cytopathology webinars (14/23=61%), and our institutional digital slide collection (12/23=52%).

We find substantial but temporary effects on spending and revenues, with more moderate but permanent effects on the long-term projections. We project that the debt-to-GDP ratio, currently 98%, will rise to 190% in 2050 under current law, compared to a CBO pre-COVID projection of 180%. Sharply lower interest rates projected for the next dozen years help moderate future debt accumulation. Under a current policy projection that allows temporary tax provisionssuch as those in the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017to be made permanent, the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 222% by 2050 and would continuing rising thereafter. The long-term projections are sensitive to interest rates. We discuss several aspects of these results, including how the current episode compares to past debt changes, the role of historically low interest rates, and the role of recent Federal Reserve Board policies and actions. Because of the macro-stabilization effects of fiscal tightening, and because low interest rates create breathing room for fiscal policy, we do not see the large, short-run debt accumulation resulting from the current pandemic as necessitating any immediate offsetting response.

Viral load by real-time RT-PCR has been suggested as a biomarker of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the association of viral load and severity of the disease is not yet resolved. Nasopharyngeal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Relative quantitation was made by the comparative threshold cycle (CT) formula between ORF1ab viral and RNase P housekeeping genes. Absolute viral load was calculate using a reference positive control. Most prevalent clinical signs were cough (75.8%), myalgia (66.7%) and fever (48.5%). Hypertension (18.2%), neurological diseases (15.1%), and asthma and hypothyroidism (12.1%) were most frequent comorbidities. Fever, either as an exclusive symptom or combined with others, was associated with high viral loads (2Ct range 35.65-155.16; 4.25-4.89 log10 RNA copies/test]). During the first week after onset of symptoms in mild patients up to 60 years-old was detected the peak of viral load. Children under 10 years-old have a high viral load (313.84; 2.50) in the first two days post-infection with a sharp decline thereafter. Cases between 10 and 49 years-old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first two days post-infection (range 0.03-17.24; -1.50-1.24). Patients over 60 years-old have high viral load up to the second week after the onset of symptoms (range 25.32-155.42; 1.40-2.19), indicating the longer presence of the virus in them.

PURPOSE: The aim of this article is to examine the role that nurses played in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic through the voices of the participants. METHODS: Using a phenomenological methodology thirty-one interviews were completed via phone and thematic analysis was completed. RESULTS: The major themes that emerged from this phenomenological study were: emotional challenges, uncertainty, and protective factors. Emotional challenges included, stress, anxiety, exhaustion, frustration, guilt, and loneliness. These challenges were magnified by uncertainty through leadership and communication challenges, needs of the pandemic versus needs of the patient, and Covid-19 and best practice. In this study, emotional challenges were mitigated by the protective factors of: education, ability to contribute, team cohesiveness, and community support.

Taking multiple medications increases the risk of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), and residents in long-term care (LTC) are frequently prescribed 10 or more medications at once. One strategy to address this problem is for the physician and/or pharmacist to perform regular medication reviews; however, this process can be complicated and time-consuming. With a prescription review, medications may be decreased, changed, or stopped altogether. MedReviewRx is a software that runs an analysis using deprescribing rules to produce a report to guide medication reviews addressing medication overload for residents in LTC. METHODS: This study will employ a mixed methods effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 study design. To measure effectiveness, a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design is planned, which allows us to approximate a randomized clinical trial. Approximately 1000 residents living in LTC will be recruited from five facilities in New Brunswick. The study will begin with 3 months of baseline data on rates of deprescribing. Thereafter, every 3 months a new cluster will enter the intervention mode. The intervention consists of medication reviews augmented with the MedReviewRx software, which will be used by staff and clinicians in the facilities. The estimated study duration is 18 months and the main outcome will be the proportion of patients with one or more PIMs deprescribed (reduced/stopped or changed to a safer alternative) in the 90 days following a prescription review. The goal is to study the impact of MedReviewRx on medication overload among older adults living in LTC. In typical fashion of a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial, each cluster acts as an internal control (before and after) as well as a control for the other clusters (external control). Qualitative data collected will include resident/caregiver attitudes towards deprescribing and semi-structured interviews with staff working in the long-term care homes. DISCUSSION: This study design addresses issues with seasonality and allows all clusters to participate in the intervention, which is an advantage when the intervention is related to quality improvement. This study will provide valuable information on PIM use, cost savings, and facilitators and challenges associated with medication reviews and deprescribing. This study represents an important step towards understanding and promoting tools to guide safe and rational reduction of PIM use among older adults.

GABRP is the  subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor, which is expressed in a number of non-neuronal tissues. GABRP is significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer, but its biological and immunological role as well as its clinical diagnostic and prognostic value in pancreatic cancer is still incompletely known. METHODS: In this study, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) cohorts from TCGA and GEO datasets were used to compare GABRP mRNA levels in cancerous and normal tissues and protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The Kaplan-Meier plotter and GEPIA2 database were used to analyze the correlation between GABRP expression, overall survival, and disease-free survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed with the Linked Omics database to explore the molecular mechanisms of GABRP in pancreatic cancer. And the correlation between GABRP expression and immune infiltration was explored using the TIMER database, CIBERSORT database and ESTIMATE algorithm. RESULTS: GABRP mRNA was significantly overexpressed in TCGA-PAAD cohorts (P<0.0001) and enhanced GABRP expression predicted poorer overall survival according to Kaplan-Meier plotter database (P=0.0024) and GEPIA2 (P=0.038). Hypomethylation of promoter (P<0.01) and the regulation of hsa-miR-3655 may contribute to the overexpression of GABRP in pancreatic cancer. GSEA analysis revealed that GABRP played an important role in the immune response. GABRP expression was also correlated with immune infiltration and immune cell markers. Higher GABRP expression was significantly associated with greater infiltration of immune cells and stromal cells into pancreatic cancer microenvironments as well as higher expression of six important immune check point genes including PDCD1 (P<0.05), CD274 (P<0.05), CTLA4 (P<0.01), PDCD1LG2 (P<0.01), TIGHT (P<0.01) and TIM3 (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: GABRP is a potential prognostic biomarker and is correlated with immune infiltration and tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer. This suggests that GABRP may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer as well as a possible regulator of tumor microenvironment affecting the efficacy of immunotherapy.

We aimed to assess perceptions of remote learning among pre-clinical medical students and subsequently to identify pros and cons of remote learning, as well as uncover gaps to address in ongoing curricular development. METHODS: A survey was distributed to first- and second-year medical students at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine in March 2020. Frequencies of responses to structured multiple-choice questions were compared regarding impacts of remote learning on quality of instruction and ability to participate, value of various remote learning resources, living environment, and preparedness for subsequent stages of training. Responses to open-ended questions about strengths and weaknesses of the remote curriculum and overall reflections were coded for thematic content. RESULTS: Of 268 students enrolled, 104 responded (53.7% of first-year students and 23.9% of second-year students). Overall, students felt that remote learning had negatively affected the quality of instruction and their ability to participate. Most (64.1%) preferred the flexibility of learning material at their own pace. Only 25.5% of respondents still felt connected to the medical school or classmates, and feelings of anxiety and isolation were noted negatives of remote learning. Most second-year students (56.7%) felt their preparation for the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 exam was negatively affected, and 43.3% felt unprepared to begin clerkships. In narrative responses, most students appreciated the increased flexibility of remote learning, but they also identified several deficits that still need to be addressed, including digital fatigue, decreased ability to participate, and lack of clinical skills, laboratory, and hands-on learning.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify availability and wait times for new patient appointments in primary care and to describe how primary care practices are guiding patients with suspected COVID-19. DESIGN: Trained callers conducted simulated patient calls to 800 randomly sampled primary care practices between September 14, 2020, and September 28, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: We extracted complete primary care physician listings from large commercial insurance networks in four geographically dispersed states between September 10 and 14, 2020 (n=11,521). After excluding non-physician providers and removing duplicate phone numbers, we identified 2705 unique primary care physician practices from which we randomly sampled 200 practices in each region. MAIN MEASURES: Primary care appointment availability, median wait time in days, and practice guidance to patients suspecting COVID-19 infection. KEY RESULTS: Among 56% of listed practices that had accurate contact information listed in the directory, 84% offered a new patient in-person or virtual appointment. Median wait time was 10 days (IQR 3-26 days). The most common guidance in case of suspected COVID-19 was clinician consultation, which was offered in 41% of completed calls. Callers were otherwise directed to on-site testing (14%), off-site testing (24%), a COVID-19 hotline (8%), or an urgent care/emergency department (12%), while 2% of practices had no guidance to offer.

Breaking down barriers and overcoming the limits of human endurance are at the heart of sports activity. Ever since high-performance sports, people have tried to gain an advantage over a competitor, i.e., by consuming various substances. The pursuit of being more agile, faster, stronger, and more enduring has given rise to a multi-billion dollar dietary supplements market. Athletes dietary supplements can be divided into sports food, vitamin and minerals, and ergogenic supplements. Despite the centuries-old history of doping, the problem of substances that improve performance is still the most discussed topic in modern all types of sport, regardless of discipline or popularity. Dietary supplements are considered safe products, but their concentrated form may expose consumers to the risk of overdosing. Sports supplements are dangerous because they often have higher doses of active substances than over-the-counter medicinal products. Taking many dietary supplements, often with prescribed medications, increases your risk of harmful interactions. Another problem related to dietary supplements is the lack of uniform legal regulations, and hence the high probability of adulteration with substances prohibited in sport or substances hazardous to health. During the COVID-19 pandemic and over the isolation, the number of people exercising at home increased. In problematic contact with primary health care, social media became the main information source about athletes dietary supplements, their effectiveness, and safety. Not only nutritionists but also pharmacists and doctors should participate in assessing athletes needs and health problems. The increase in health awareness and knowledge about dietary supplements for athletes should be permanently included in the map of health services of the integrated health care model. The decision to take a dietary supplement should be consulted as part of pharmaceutical care or a visit to the doctor. On the other hand, the selection of a specific preparation should be made based on certified brands that verify, authenticate labels, test for the presence of contaminants and substances prohibited in sports. In healthcare, system solutions are needed that focus on strict control and official certification of dietary supplements, as is the case in the pharmaceutical industry. Creating a state certification system for dietary supplements seems essential as a reliable source of verified information for medical professionals. ? 2021 National Museum.

Additionally, a circular economy has been proposed as the most efficient production system since it allows for reducing and reutilizing different wastes. Current agriculture is responsible for producing high quantities of organic agricultural waste (e.g., discarded fruits and vegetables, peels, leaves, seeds or forestall residues), that usually ends up underutilized and accumulated, causing environmental problems. Interestingly, these agri-food by-products are potential sources of valuable bioactive molecules such as tannins. Tannins are phenolic compounds, secondary metabolites of plants widespread in terrestrial and aquatic natural environments. As they can be found in plenty of plants and herbs, they have been traditionally used for medicinal and other purposes, such as the leather industry. This fact is explained by the fact that they exert plenty of different biological activities and, thus, they entail a great potential to be used in the food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, this review article is directed towards the description of the biological activities exerted by tannins as they could be further extracted from by-products of the agri-food industry to produce high-added-value products.","output":"By-Products of Agri-Food Industry as Tannin-Rich Sources: A Review of Tannins Biological Activities and Their Potential for Valorization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In reversible computing, the management of space is subject to two broad classes of constraints.

In this systematic review, the authors summarize the literature on smoking-cessation implementation strategies and evaluate their success to guide the implementation of best-practice smoking interventions into hospital settings. The CINAHL Complete, Embase, MEDLINE Complete, and PsycInfo databases were searched using terms associated with the following topics: smoking cessation, hospitals, and implementation. In total, 14,287 original records were identified and screened, resulting in 63 eligible articles from 56 studies. Data were extracted on the study characteristics, implementation strategies, and implementation outcomes. Implementation outcomes were guided by Proctor and colleagues' framework and included acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, cost, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and sustainability. The findings demonstrate that studies predominantly focused on the training of staff to achieve implementation. Brief implementation approaches using a small number of implementation strategies were less successful and poorly sustained compared with well resourced and multicomponent approaches. Although brief implementation approaches may be viewed as advantageous because they are less resource-intensive, their capacity to change practice in a sustained way lacks evidence. Attempts to change clinician behavior or introduce new models of care are challenging in a short time frame, and implementation efforts should be designed for long-term success.

The present study examined physicians perceptions of the ethical and clinical aspects of the recommendation and use of unfunded technologies for cancer treatment. This mixed-methods study surveyed 127 oncologists regarding their perceptions toward using unfunded innovative cancer treatment technologies, followed by in-depth interviews with 16 oncologists. Most respondents believed that patients should be offered all treatment alternatives, regardless of their financial situation. However, 59% indicated that they often face dilemmas regarding recommending new unfunded treatments to patients with financial difficulties and without private health insurance. Over a third (38%) stated that they felt uncomfortable discussing the cost of treatment with patients. A predictive model found that physicians facing patients whose medical condition worsened due to an inability to access new treatments, and who expressed the opinion that physicians can assist in locating funding for patients who cannot afford treatments, were more likely to recommend unfunded innovative therapies to patients (F = 5.22, R(2) = 0.15, p < 0.001). Subsequent in-depth interviews revealed four key themes: economic considerations in choosing therapy, patientCphysician communication, the public healthcare fund, and discussion of treatment costs. Physicians feel a professional commitment to offer patients the best medical care and a moral duty to discuss costs and minimize patients financial difficulty. There is a need for careful and balanced use of innovative life-prolonging technologies while putting patients at the center of discourse on this complex and controversial issue.

These have included patients in combination with corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (dxm). This work aims to test the response of hospitalized patients with severe or critical COVID-19 treated with rxb with or without dxm. METHODS: An experimental, open, prospective study in a single third-level hospital in Mexico was performed. The primary outcome was favorable clinical response defined as withdrawal or decline of supplementary oxygen. Secondary outcomes such as mean hospital stay, improvement in systemic inflammatory response parameters, and mortality were also evaluated. Statistical differences for baseline and final measure and the use and not use of dxm were estimated. The study included adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with polymerase chain reaction, radiological pneumonia, and oxygen saturation less than 90%. Rxb was administered 5mg/12hrs/15days, IV dxm 6mg/day/10days. RESULTS: The final sample was 108 adults with complete information and informed consent. Sixty-two patients (57%) received only rxb. There were no differences between groups for any parameter at the beginning of treatment, and all patients were receiving supplemental oxygen. After 28-day follow-up, 70% reduce supplemental oxygen requirement (74% rxb and 71% rxb+dxm; p=0.628), 18% remained, and 2% increases support (1% with rxb, and 5% rxb+dxm; p< 0.001); 87% of patients were discharged (89% rxb and 85% rxb+dxm; p=0.603).

Symposium themes included trends and future projections in cardiovascular disease (in the United States and internationally), the evolving obesity and diabetes epidemics, and harnessing emerging and innovative opportunities to preserve and promote cardiovascular health and prevent cardiovascular disease. In addition, participant-led discussion explored the challenges and barriers in promoting cardiovascular health across the lifespan and established a potential framework for observational research and interventions that would begin in early childhood (or ideally in utero). This report summarizes the relevant research, policy, and practice opportunities discussed at the symposium.","output":"Bending the Curve in Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Bethesda + 40 and Beyond."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The infectious pandemics and epidemics of the past 200 years have caused millions of deaths.

Using this platform, we sequenced SARS-CoV genomes from Vero cell culture isolates of 12 patients and directly from four patient tissues. The sequence obtained from the array is highly reproducible, accurate (>99.99% accuracy) and capable of identifying known and novel variants of SARS-CoV. Notably, we applied this technology to a field specimen of probable SARS and rapidly deduced its infectious source. We demonstrate that array-based resequencing-by-hybridization is a fast, reliable, and economical alternative to capillary sequencing for obtaining SARS-CoV genomic sequence on a population scale, making this an ideal platform for the global monitoring of SARS-CoV and other small-genome pathogens.","output":"Tracking the evolution of the SARS coronavirus using high-throughput, high-density resequencing arrays."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for knowledge about the mental health consequences of the ongoing pandemic. The aim of this study was to identify vulnerability factors for psychological distress and reduced life satisfaction in the general population. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the role of COVID-related worries for psychological distress and life satisfaction. METHODS: A presumed representative sample for the Norwegian population (n = 1041, response rate = 39.9%) responded to a web-survey in May 2020. The participants were asked about potential vulnerability factors including increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (underlying illness, older age), socioeconomic disadvantage (living alone, unemployment, economic problems), and pre-existing mental health vulnerability (recent exposure to violence, previous mental health challenges). Additional measures included COVID-related worry, psychological distress, and life satisfaction. RESULTS: More than one out of four reported current psychological distress over the threshold for clinically significant symptoms. Socioeconomic disadvantages, including living alone and pre-existing economic challenges, and pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities, including recent exposure to violence and previous mental health problems, were associated with a higher level of psychological distress and a lower level of life satisfaction. A higher level of COVID-related worry was significantly associated with a higher level of psychological distress, and a lower level of life satisfaction, even when adjusting for all the vulnerability factors. CONCLUSION: This study identified several vulnerability factors for mental health problems in the pandemic. Individuals recently exposed to violence and individuals with pre-existing mental health problems are at particular risk. Worrying about the consequences of the pandemic contributes negatively to current mental health. However, worry cannot explain the excess distress in vulnerable groups. Future research should focus on how COVID-related strains contribute to mental health problems for vulnerable groups.","output":"Worry and mental health in the Covid-19 pandemic: vulnerability factors in the general Norwegian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to identify the social and psychological burdens placed on educators during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and to propose an optimal form of support. We investigated educators perceptions of psychological and socioeconomic anxieties and burdens, sense of coherence, and social capital using a questionnaire survey of 1000 educators in January 2021. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to analyze the associations between the variables. Results: Approximately 80% of the respondents considered COVID-19 a formidable, life-threatening illness. Our results revealed that the higher the social capital, the greater the fear of COVID-19, and the higher the sense of coherence, the lower this fear. Conclusions: The anxiety burden of implementing infection prevention was higher than the anxiety burden associated with distance learning. The predictive factors for educators perceptions of burden included sense of coherence, gender, and age.

Until now, multi-locus VNTR Analysis (MLVA) based on 16 loci has been considered as the gold standard for Brucella typing. However, this methodology is laborious, and, with the rampant release of Brucella genomes, the transition from the traditional MLVA to whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based typing is on course. Nevertheless, in order to avoid a disruptive transition with the loss of massive genetic data obtained throughout the last decade and considering that the transition timings will vary considerably among different countries, it is important to determine WGS-based MLVA alleles of the nowadays sequenced genomes. On this regard, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a Python script that had been previously developed for the rapid in silico extraction of the MLVA alleles, by comparing it to the PCR-based MLVA procedure over 83 strains from different Brucella species. The WGS-based MLVA approach detected 95.3% of all possible 1,328 hits (83 strains16 loci) and showed an agreement rate with the PCR-based MLVA procedure of 96.4% for MLVA-16. According to our dataset, we suggest the use of a minimal depth of coverage of ~50x and a maximum number of ~200 contigs as guiding boundaries for the future application of the script. In conclusion, the evaluated script seems to be a very useful and robust tool for the in silico determination of MLVA profiles of Brucella strains, allowing retrospective and prospective molecular epidemiological studies, which are important for maintaining an active epidemiological surveillance of brucellosis.","output":"Genetic Characterization of Brucella spp.: Whole Genome Sequencing-Based Approach for the Determination of Multiple Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Profiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The flavonoid silymarin extracted from the seeds of Sylibum marianum is a mixture of 6 flavolignan isomers. The 3 more important isomers are silybin (or silibinin), silydianin, and silychristin. Silybin is functionally the most active of these compounds. This group of flavonoids has been extensively studied and they have been used as hepato-protective substances for the mushroom Amanita phalloides intoxication and mainly chronic liver diseases such as alcoholic cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver. Hepatitis C progression is not, or slightly, modified by silymarin. Recently, it has also been proposed for SARS COVID-19 infection therapy. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms of action of these substances in cancer are subjects of ongoing research. Paradoxically, many of its identified actions such as antioxidant, promoter of ribosomal synthesis, and mitochondrial membrane stabilization, may seem protumoral at first sight, however, silymarin compounds have clear anticancer effects. Some of them are: decreasing migration through multiple targeting, decreasing hypoxia inducible factor-1 expression, inducing apoptosis in some malignant cells, and inhibiting promitotic signaling among others. Interestingly, the antitumoral activity of silymarin compounds is limited to malignant cells while the nonmalignant cells seem not to be affected. Furthermore, there is a long history of silymarin use in human diseases without toxicity after prolonged administration. The ample distribution and easy accessibility to milk thistlethe source of silymarin compounds, its over the counter availability, the fact that it is a weed, some controversial issues regarding bioavailability, and being a nutraceutical rather than a drug, has somehow led medical professionals to view its anticancer effects with skepticism. This is a fundamental reason why it never achieved bedside status in cancer treatment. However, in spite of all the antitumoral effects, silymarin actually has dual effects and in some cases such as pancreatic cancer it can promote stemness. This review deals with recent investigations to elucidate the molecular actions of this flavonoid in cancer, and to consider the possibility of repurposing it. Particular attention is dedicated to silymarin's dual role in cancer and to some controversies of its real effectiveness.","output":"Role of Silymarin in Cancer Treatment: Facts, Hypotheses, and Questions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Mortality due to COVID-19 is higher among elderly patients with comorbidities. Even so, prognostication in COVID-19 remains limited. METHODS We assessed 90-day mortality stratified by comorbidities, routine biochemical markers and oxygen need in a consecutive single-centre cohort from 2 March to 2 June 2020. RESULTS We included 263 hospitalised patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. On admission, fitness for intensive care was determined in 254 patients including 98 (39%) with a do-not-resuscitate order. Ninety-day overall mortality was 29%, whereas intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was 35% (14/40). Alcohol abuse, liver disease and elevated urea were strongly associated with mortality in univariable analyses. In a mutually adjusted multivariable analysis, we found an independent incremental increase in 90-day mortality with each increasing age by decade (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-1.9), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (HR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.0-1.4), number of abnormal blood tests (HR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.3) and l/min. of supplemental oxygen (HR = 1.1; 95% CI: 1.1-1.2). CONCLUSIONS The overall mortality was similar to that of other hospitalised patients, whereas the ICU mortality was lower than expected.

A direct consequence of this inflammatory state in the lungs is the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), frequently observed in severe COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storm is associated with severe forms of COVID-19 and poor prognosis for COVID-19 patients. Sulforaphane (SFN), one of the main components of Brassica oleraceae L. (Brassicaceae or Cruciferae), is known to possess anti-inflammatory effects in tissues from several organs, among which joints, kidneys and lungs. PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to determine whether SFN is able to inhibit IL-6 and IL-8, two key molecules involved in the COVID-19 cytokine storm. METHODS: The effects of SFN were studied in vitro on bronchial epithelial IB3-1 cells exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein). The anti-inflammatory activity of SFN on IL-6 and IL-8 expression has been evaluated by RT-qPCR and Bio-Plex analysis. RESULTS: In our study SFN inhibits, in cultured IB3-1 bronchial cells, the gene expression of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by SARS-CoV-2. This represents the proof-of-principle that SFN may modulate the release of some key proteins of the COVID-19 cytokine storm. CONCLUSION: The control of the cytokine storm is one of the major issues in the management of COVID-19 patients. Our study demonstrates that SFN can be employed in protocols useful to control hyperinflammatory state associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Sulforaphane inhibits the expression of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 induced in bronchial epithelial IB3-1 cells by exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has been a serious threat to global health. Previous work has focused primarily on hospitalized patients or on identifying risk factors for disease severity and mortality once the infection has taken place. We sought to leverage the ubiquity of smartphones and mobile applications to study risk factors for Covid-19 infection in a large, geographically heterogenous cohort. METHODS: We analyzed data obtained from the Covid-19 Citizen Science (CCS) Study, a worldwide, mobile application-based cohort. After employing forward selection to identify variables with p values < 0.1, multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to identify independent risk factors associated with prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 36,041 participants in 113 countries and all 50 states in the US, 484 participants had prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection. After multivariable adjustment, being a healthcare worker, living with at least one school-aged child, having pets at home, and having immunodeficiency were each associated with an increased odds of SARS-CoV-2. The association between pets and prevalent SARS-CoV-2 was driven by dog ownership. After adjustment for the same covariates, Asian or Pacific Islander race, receiving a flu shot within the past year, increased level of education, and smoking or vaping marijuana within the last 30 days were each associated with a lower odds of SARS-CoV-2.

The present study aimed to evaluate retrospectively the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 and to analyze CT findings and determine their relationships with clinical severity. METHODS: Chest CT and clinical features of 271 COVID-19 patients were assessed. The presence of CT findings and distribution of parenchymal abnormalities were evaluated, and CT patterns were classified as bronchopneumonia, organizing pneumonia (OP), or diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Total extents were assessed using a visual scoring system and artificial intelligence software. Patients were allocated to two groups based on clinical outcomes, that is, to a severe group (requiring O(2) therapy or mechanical ventilation, n = 55) or a mild group (not requiring O(2) therapy or mechanical ventilation, n = 216). Clinical and CT features of these two groups were compared and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: Age, lymphocyte count, levels of C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were significantly different in the two groups. Forty-five of the 271 patients had normal chest CT findings. The most common CT findings among the remaining 226 patients were ground-glass opacity (98%), followed by consolidation (53%). CT findings were classified as OP (93%), DAD (4%), or bronchopneumonia (3%) and all nine patients with DAD pattern were included in the severe group. Uivariate and multivariate analyses showed an elevated procalcitonin (odds ratio [OR], 2.521; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001C6.303, P = 0.048), and higher visual CT scores (OR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.042C1.236; P = 0.003) or higher total extent by AI measurement (OR, 1.048; 95% CI, 1.020C1.076; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a severe clinical course. CONCLUSION: CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia can be classified into OP, DAD, or bronchopneumonia patterns and all patients with DAD pattern were included in severe group.

To monitor and address the health needs of pilgrims in field clinics near the pilgrimage route, a syndromic surveillance system was designed and implemented by Global Health Development/Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network in collaboration with Iraq Ministry of Health. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of the surveillance system and the data it gathered in evaluating the burden of common acute and infectious conditions, chronic conditions, and trauma and injuries during the Arba'een pilgrimage in 2018. Data were collected at 152 field clinics located across 11 governorates in Iraq at strategic points along the Arba'een pilgrimage route from all governorates to Karbala between October 8 and November 3, 2018. A team of 24 surveillance supervisors trained, oversaw, and provided technical support for 304 data collectors. The data collectors recorded data from 338,399 patients (42.5% female and 57.5% male) in the span of 26 days. The vast majority of patients were from Iraq (n = 294,260, 87.6%) and Iran (n = 34,691, 10.3%). Of the 338,399 patients whose data were recorded by the surveillance system, 246,469 (72.8%) reported acute and infectious conditions, 202,032 (59.70%) reported chronic conditions, and 6,737 (2.0%) reported traumas and injuries. Many patients reported several conditions in multiple categories.

Due to a lack of physicians, emergency facilities, and equipment, medical systems have been unable to treat all patients in many countries. Deep learning is a promising approach for providing solutions to COVID-19 based on patients medical images. As COVID-19 is a new disease, its related dataset is still being collected and published. Small COVID-19 datasets may not be sufficient to build powerful deep learning detection models. Such models are often over-fitted, and their prediction results cannot be generalized. To fill this gap, we propose a deep learning approach for accurately detecting COVID-19 cases based on chest X-ray (CXR) images. For the proposed approach, named COVID-CGAN, we first generated a larger dataset using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, a customized conditional GAN (CGAN) was designed to generate the target COVID-19 CXR images. The expanded dataset, which contains 84.8% generated images and 15.2% original images, was then used for training five deep detection models: InceptionResNetV2, Xception, SqueezeNet, VGG16, and AlexNet. The results show that the use of the synthetic CXR images, which were generated by the customized CGAN, helped all deep learning models to achieve high detection accuracies. In particular, the highest accuracy was achieved by the InceptionResNetV2 model, which was 99.72% accurate with only ten epochs. All five models achieved kappa coefficients between 0.81 and 1, which is interpreted as an almost perfect agreement between the actual labels and the detected labels. Furthermore, the experiment showed that some models were faster yet smaller compared to the others but could still achieve high accuracy. For instance, SqueezeNet, which is a small network, required only three minutes and achieved comparable accuracy to larger networks such as InceptionResNetV2, which needed about 143 min. Our proposed approach can be applied to other fields with scarce datasets.","output":"COVID-CGAN: Efficient Deep Learning Approach for COVID-19 Detection Based on CXR Images Using Conditional GANs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research question: The creation of sport media content is guided by the need to cover live, seasonal events, which typically results in the greater coverage of men's sport than women's. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, live sport was halted. This paper presents the findings of a study into the media coverage of women in sport during the pandemic. Specifically, the study sought to answer the research question, how has Australian mainstream media covered women in sport during a period of time with no live sport on the global stage? Research methods: The study used quantitative content analysis to track the coverage from 20 media outlets using consistent one-directional coding practices, involving a single individual coder at the same time each day to focus on counting articles covering women in sport. Results and findings: The findings show a slight reduction in the coverage of women in sport at the start of the COVID-19 crisis in Australia and that low levels of coverage persisted throughout. This indicates that in the absence of live sport, media institutions reflexively revert to traditional ritualized, routinized practices to create sport media content, and women in sport stories are excluded regardless of the presence of play. Implications: The major contribution of this study is its demonstration that the ongoing dominance of men's sport media coverage does not emerge as a result of weekly, seasonal coverage of live sport, but is founded on deeply entrenched notions of commercial value and upheld by newsroom routines and social rituals.","output":"The (un)level playing field: sport media during COVID-19.

Guidelines regarding the antibiotic prophylaxis in EESBS have not been developed yet, and today, there are no universally accepted protocols. In this article, we investigated the efficacy of our new ultra-short antibiotic prophylaxis protocol for EESBS guided by the cultural results of preoperative microbiological nasal swabs. METHODS We defined as \\"nasal swab-related antibiotic protocol\\" the administration of a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin 2 g) in patients whose nasal swabs revealed the presence of normal nasal flora or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and the administration of vancomycin 1 g intravenously in patients whose nasal swabs revealed the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or with reported cephalosporin/penicillin allergy. This case-control study included 120 patients who underwent EESBS. The case group included 60 cases who received the \\"nasal swab-related antibiotic protocol,\\" while the control group included 60 cases who received the \\"standard hospital antibiotic protocol\\" used in neurosurgery (cefazolin 2 g plus metronidazole 500 mg at induction, and 2 g of cefazolin repeated after 180 min). RESULTS The preoperative microbiological nasal swabs showed normal nasal flora in 42 patients (70%), MSSA in 17 patients (28.3%), and MRSA in 1 patient (1.6%). During the study period, no cases of meningitis or sinusitis occurred in the case group (\\"nasal swab-related antibiotic protocol\\"), while two infections (3.3%, 1 sinusitis and 1 meningitis) were reported in the control group (\\"standard hospital antibiotic protocol\\"). Mean length of hospitalization was 6.5 days for the case group and 8.5 days in the control group. \\"Standard hospital antibiotic protocol\\" is less expensive (range, 2.88-5.42 euros) compared with our new \\"nasal swab-related antibiotic protocol\\" (range, 10.02-32.56 euros), but in line with other antibiotic prophylaxis protocols reported in literature. DISCUSSION The low complication rates of our case series (0%) is comparable to complication rates reported in literature (1.6% for meningitis and 8% for sinusitis). Compared with other perioperative antibiotic regimens reported in literature, the \\"nasal swab-related antibiotic protocol\\" is cheap and at least equally effective.

Results: In a binary logistic regression model comparing faculty whose self-rated academic productivity increased with those whose productivity decreased, the authors found that controlling for multiple factors, men were more than twice as likely to be in the accelerated productivity group as women. In a similar model comparing partnered faculty whose self-rated work-life balance increased with partnered faculty whose work-life balance decreased, being in the positive work-life balance group was predicted by increased academic productivity, increased job stress, and having higher job priority than your partner. Conclusions: While the COVID-19 pandemic placed huge stressors on academic medical faculty, pandemic placed huge stressors on academic medical faculty, some experienced gains in productivity and work-life balance, with potential to widen the gender gap. As academic medicine evolves post-COVID, leaders should be aware that productivity and work-life balance predict each other, and that these factors have connections to work location, stress, and relationship dynamics, emphasizing the inseparable connections between work and life success.","output":"Winners and Losers in Academic Productivity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Is the Gender Gap Widening for Faculty?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Influenza is a globally occurring viral respiratory infection that can lead to hospitalizations and death. An influenza outbreak can interfere with combat readiness in a military setting, as the infection can incapacitate soldiers. Vaccination remains the most effective tool to prevent and mitigate seasonal influenza. Although influenza vaccinations for U.S. Army soldiers can be monitored through military health systems, those systems cannot capture DoD civilians and Army dependents who may not use military health services. This study aims to gauge flu vaccine uptake and perceptions in U.S. Army civilians and dependents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was e-mailed to civilian and dependent enrollees of Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. The survey contained 24 questions pertaining to demographics, vaccine history, history of the flu, and beliefs toward vaccines. Chi-square tests, t-tests, and logistic regressions were performed to investigate the association between demographic, behavior, and belief factors with vaccine uptake. Free-text answers were coded and categorized by themes. RESULTS: Over 70% of respondents were vaccinated for the flu. There were differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated respondents regarding their perceptions of barriers to vaccination, benefits of the flu vaccine, severity of flu symptoms, and personal risk of getting ill with the flu. After controlling for confounders, flu vaccination in the previous season and healthcare worker status were associated with increased vaccine uptake, while perceived barriers to influenza vaccination were associated with decreased vaccine uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Flu vaccine uptake may be increased by increasing access to vaccination, promoting vaccination and addressing concerns at the provider level, and engaging positively framed public messaging. Increasing flu vaccine uptake is of particular importance as the flu season approaches during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.","output":"Perceptions of Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Among U.S. Army Civilians and Dependents in the Kaiserslautern Military Community: A Mixed-Methods Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), representing a major global health problem, are caused by different microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Unfortunately, infections of different sexually transmitted pathogens often present similar clinical symptoms, so it is almost impossible to distinguish them clinically. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a sensitive, multitarget, and high-throughput method that can detect various agents responsible for STIs. METHODS: We developed and tested a 23-plex PCR coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) assay (sexually transmitted infection-mass spectrometry, STI-MS) that simultaneously targets 11 different agents, including 8 most common clinical pathogens related to STIs (HSV-1, HSV-2, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Haemophilus ducreyi) and 3 controversial microorganisms as pathogens (Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum). RESULTS: The results showed that the STI-MS approach can accurately detect the expected agents, without cross-reaction with other organisms. The limit of detection of each STI-MS assay was ranged from 1.739 to 10.009 copies/reaction, using probit analyses. The verification rate for each target organism of the STI-MS ranged from a minimum of 89.3% to a maximum of 100%, using conventional assays and ultrasensitive digital PCR to confirm the STI-MS-positive results. To further evaluate the clinical performance of this assay, 241 clinical specimens (124 urethral/cervical swabs and 117 urine) were tested in parallel using the STI-MS assay and monoplex real-time PCR for each agent. The overall validation parameters of STI-MS were extremely high including sensitivity (from 85.7% to 100%), specificity (from 92.3% to 100%), PPV (from 50% to 100%), and NPV (from 99.1% to 100%) for each target. CONCLUSION: STI-MS is a useful high-throughput screening tool for detecting mixed infections of STIs and has great potential for application in large-scale epidemiological programs for specific microorganisms of STI.","output":"Simultaneous detection of eleven sexually transmitted agents using multiplexed PCR coupled with MALDI-TOF analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has strikingly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, with most individuals contracting mild disease but a substantial minority experiencing fulminant cardiopulmonary symptoms or death. The clinical covariates and the laboratory tests performed on a patient provide robust statistics to guide clinical treatment. Deep learning approaches on a data set of this nature enable patient stratification and provide methods to guide clinical treatment. OBJECTIVE: Here, we report on the development and prospective validation of a state-of-the-art machine learning model to provide mortality prediction shortly after confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Mayo Clinic patient population. METHODS: We retrospectively constructed one of the largest reported and most geographically diverse laboratory information system and electronic health record of COVID-19 data sets in the published literature, which included 11,807 patients residing in 41 states of the United States of America and treated at medical sites across 5 states in 3 time zones. Traditional machine learning models were evaluated independently as well as in a stacked learner approach by using AutoGluon, and various recurrent neural network architectures were considered. The traditional machine learning models were implemented using the AutoGluon-Tabular framework, whereas the recurrent neural networks utilized the TensorFlow Keras framework. We trained these models to operate solely using routine laboratory measurements and clinical covariates available within 72 hours of a patients first positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test result. RESULTS: The GRU-D recurrent neural network achieved peak cross-validation performance with 0.938 (SE 0.004) as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. This model retained strong performance by reducing the follow-up time to 12 hours (0.916 [SE 0.005] AUROC), and the leave-one-out feature importance analysis indicated that the most independently valuable features were age, Charlson comorbidity index, minimum oxygen saturation, fibrinogen level, and serum iron level. In the prospective testing cohort, this model provided an AUROC of 0.901 and a statistically significant difference in survival (P<.001, hazard ratio for those predicted to survive, 95% CI 0.043-0.106). CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning approach using GRU-D provides an alert system to flag mortality for COVID-19Cpositive patients by using clinical covariates and laboratory values within a 72-hour window after the first positive nucleic acid test result.","output":"COVID-19 Mortality Prediction From Deep Learning in a Large Multistate Electronic Health Record and Laboratory Information System Data Set: Algorithm Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Chronic heart failure (HF) is a major comorbidity accounting for an increased severity and mortality related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

Previously, the large majority of patients have been seen in the hospital with direct patient\\\\provider contact. We compared both strategies of follow\\\\up, in pre\\\\pandemic (PPP) and pandemic (PP) periods, regarding total mortality and hospitalizations/emergency department (ED) visits due to HF exacerbation. We prospectively studied a cohort of 196 patients. The mean follow\\\\up time in PPP was 1.4 years. In this period, 20 patients died. In PP (follow\\\\up of 71 days), there was one additional death.

There is considerable variability in the reported sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions (MPE) in the literature. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this review is to determine the diagnostic sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology for MPE, both overall and by tumour type, to better inform the decision-making process when investigating pleural effusions. DATA SOURCES A literature search of EMBASE and MEDLINE was performed by four reviewers. Articles satisfying inclusion criteria were evaluated for bias using the QUADAS-2 tool. DATA EXTRACTION For quantitative analysis, we performed a metaanalysis using a binary random-effects model to determine pooled sensitivity. Subgroup analysis was performed based on primary cancer site and meta-regression by year of publication. SYNTHESIS Thirty-six studies with 6057 patients with MPE were included in the meta-analysis. The overall diagnostic sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology for MPE was 58.2% (95% CI 52.5% to 63.9%; range 20.5%-86.0%). There was substantial heterogeneity present among studies (I2 95.5%). For primary thoracic malignancies, sensitivity was highest in lung adenocarcinoma (83.6%; 95% CI 77.7% to 89.6%) and lowest in lung squamous cell carcinoma (24.2%; 95% CI 17.0% to 31.5%) and mesothelioma (28.9%; 95% CI 16.2% to 41.5%). For malignancies with extrathoracic origin, sensitivity was high for ovarian cancer (85.2%; 95% CI 74.2% to 96.1%) and modest for breast cancer (65.3%; 95% CI 49.8% to 80.8%). CONCLUSIONS Pleural fluid cytology has an overall sensitivity of 58.2% for the diagnosis of MPE.

With the confirmation of resistance against the only available drug toltrazuril, there is a substantial need for novel therapeutics to combat the infection and its negative effects on animal health. In closely related apicomplexan species, bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) targeting calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) were shown to be effective in inhibiting host-cell invasion and parasite growth. Therefore, the gene coding for Cystoisospora suis CDPK1 (CsCDPK1) was identified and cloned to investigate activity and thermal stabilization of the recombinant CsCDPK1 enzyme by BKI 1369. In this comprehensive study, the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BKI 1369 in piglets experimentally infected with Cystoisospora suis (toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and toltrazuril-resistant, Holland-I strains) were determined in vivo and in vitro using an established animal infection model and cell culture, respectively. BKI 1369 inhibited merozoite proliferation in intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) by at least 50% at a concentration of 40 nM, and proliferation was almost completely inhibited (>95%) at 200 nM. Nonetheless, exposure of infected cultures to 200 nM BKI 1369 for five days did not induce structural alterations in surviving merozoites as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Five-day treatment with BKI 1369 (10 mg/kg BW twice a day) effectively suppressed oocyst excretion and diarrhea and improved body weight gains in treated piglets without obvious side effects for both toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and resistant, Holland-I C. suis strains. The plasma concentration of BKI 1369 in piglets increased to 11.7 M during treatment, suggesting constant drug accumulation and exposure of parasites to the drug. Therefore, oral applications of BKI 1369 could potentially be a therapeutic alternative against porcine cystoisosporosis. For use in pigs, future studies on BKI 1369 should be directed towards ease of drug handling and minimizing treatment frequencies.","output":"Bumped kinase inhibitor 1369 is effective against Cystoisospora suis in vivo and in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has struck the world since the ending of 2019.

METHODS Sixty-seven patients with 76 IDAs were consecutively enrolled in the study from December 2011 to May 2013. DSA was performed to diagnose an IDA and to categorize its angiography patterns into either aneurysmal dilation, steno-occlusive, combined, or unclassifiable. Images of 3T high-resolution MRI were used to evaluate arterial wall imaging features of each lesion. Chi-squared tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS Aneurysmal dilation (51 of 76, [67%]) was the most common angiography pattern of IDAs, followed by the combined pattern (20 of 76, [26%]). Seven percent (five of 76) of IDAs showed steno-occlusive (n = 3) and unclassifiable (n = 2) angiography patterns, in which intramural hematomas were detected in the arterial wall without luminal connection. Intimal flaps (32 of 76, [42%]), double-lumen sign (38 of 76, [50%]) and intramural hematomas (46 of 76, [61%]) were recognized as the characteristic features of dissection by high-resolution MRI. Intramural hematomas occurred more frequently in the combined patterns group (16 of 20, [80 %]) than in the aneurysmal dilation group (25 of 51, [49%]) (P = .017), while the occurrence of intimal flaps and double-lumen sign did not differ between angiographic patterns (P > .05).

Some research from the United States indicates that military Veterans are sometimes framed in a stereotypical and stigmatizing manner, however there is a lack of research on Canadian media coverage of Veterans. As such, the overarching aim of this study is to assess the tone and content of Canadian media coverage of military Veterans, with a focus on PTSD and suicide. The first objective is to document and analyze common themes, content and temporal patterns in Canadian media coverage of Veterans per se. The second objective is to examine common themes and content in the sub-set of articles having PTSD as a theme. The third objective is to assess adherence to responsible reporting of suicide guidelines in the sub-set of articles having suicide as a theme. METHODS: We used validated and systematic methods including use of key words, retrieval software and inter-rater reliability tests to collect and code news articles (N = 915) about Veterans from over 50 media sources during a 12-month period, with specific coding of articles about PTSD (N = 93) and suicide (N = 61). RESULTS: Analysis revealed that the most common theme is honour or commemoration of Veterans which occurred in over half of the articles. In contrast 14% of articles focused on danger, violence or criminality. In the sub-set of articles with PTSD as a theme, over 60% focused on danger, violence or criminality, while only around 1 in 3 focused on recovery, rehabilitation, or health/social service intervention. In the sub-set of articles about suicide, there was generally strong adherence to responsible reporting guidelines, though less than 5% gave help-seeking information. Moreover, most reporting on PTSD and suicide focused on a single anomalous murder-suicide incident, with few articles about suicide prevention, helpful resources and modifiable risk factors.

The causal agent of the disease, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is classified into the Betacoronaviruses family. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a huge family of viruses. Therefore, homologous recombination studies can help recognize the phylogenetic relationships among these viruses. METHODS: In order to detect possible recombination events in SASRS-CoV-2, the genome sequences of Betacoronaviruses were obtained from the GenBank. The nucleotide sequences with the identity  60% to SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence were selected and then analyzed using different algorithms. RESULTS: The results showed two recombination events at the beginning and the end of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. Bat-SL-CoVZC21 (GenBank accession number MG772934) was specified as the minor parent for both events with p-values of 8.66  10(C87) and 3.29  10(C48), respectively. Furthermore, two recombination regions were detected at the beginning and the middle of the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene. Pangolin-CoV (PCoV_GX-P4L) and Rattus CoV (ChRCoV-HKU24) were determined as the potential parents with the GenBank accession number MT040333 and KM349742, respectively.

To do so I will argue that the lowest common denominator approach to public health policy justification to which neutralists are committed yields policy that is strong in justification but feeble in impact. Perfectionist public health policy does not face this problem. Perfectionism however, is allegedly elitist and objectionably paternalistic. I will argue that the former objection is based on an uncharitable reading of perfectionism.

This has prompted investigation into additional checkpoint receptors. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) is a checkpoint receptor expressed by a wide variety of immune cells as well as leukemic stem cells. Coblockade of Tim-3 and PD-1 can result in reduced tumor progression in preclinical models and can improve antitumor T-cell responses in cancer patients.

By analyzing 444 questionnaires completed by employees in China and using the conditional process analysis to test a hypothesis, results showed that the association between employees CSR perception and taking charge is significantly and positively correlated, with thriving at work mediating the connection. We also found that task significance negatively moderates the mediating effect between CSR and taking charge, such that the lower the level of task significance of a job, the more positive the effect of CSR on taking charge via thriving at work.

The aim of this study is to develop a multistate predictive model to estimate the future burden of CKD in Chile, given the high and rising RRT rates, population ageing, and prevalence of comorbidities contributing to CKD. METHODS: A dynamic stock and flow model was developed to simulate CKD progression in the Chilean population aged 40 years and older, up to the year 2041, adopting the perspective of the Chilean public healthcare system. The model included six states replicating progression of CKD, which was assumed in 1-year cycles and was categorised as slow, medium or fast progression, based on the underlying conditions. We simulated two different treatment scenarios. Only direct costs of treatment were included, and a 3% per year discount rate was applied after the first year. We calibrated the model based on international evidence; the exploration of uncertainty (95% credibility intervals) was undertaken with probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: By the year 2041, there is an expected increase in cases of CKD stages 3a to ESKD, ceteris paribus, from 442,265 (95% UI 441,808C442,722) in 2021 to 735,513 (734,455C736,570) individuals. Direct costs of CKD stages 3a to ESKD would rise from 322.4M GBP (321.7C323.1) in 2021 to 1,038.6M GBP (1,035.5C1,041.8) in 2041. A reduction in the progression rates of the disease by the inclusion of SGLT2 inhibitors and pre-dialysis treatment would decrease the number of individuals worsening to stages 5 and ESKD, thus reducing the total costs of CKD by 214.6M GBP in 2041 to 824.0M GBP (822.7C825.3). CONCLUSIONS: This model can be a useful tool for healthcare planning, with development of preventive or treatment plans to reduce and delay the progression of the disease and thus the anticipated increase in the healthcare costs of CKD.","output":"Projection of the health and economic impacts of Chronic kidney disease in the Chilean population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Anatomy education in US medical schools has seen numerous changes since the call for medical education reform in 2010. The purpose of this study was to survey US medical schools to assess recent trends in anatomy education, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anatomy teaching, and future directions of medical school anatomy curricula. Methods: : We sent a 29-item survey to anatomy course directors of 145 AAMC-associated allopathic medical schools inquiring about their schools anatomy curricula. The survey contained objective discrete questions concerning the curricula changes preceding COVID-19 and those directly related to COVID-19. We also asked subjective and open-ended questions about the impact of COVID-19 and future directions of anatomy education. Results: : A total of 117/143 course directors (82%) completed the survey. Most schools (60%) reported a major change to their anatomy course within the past five years, including a decrease in total course time (20%), integration of anatomy into other courses (19%), and implementation of a flipped classroom (15%) teaching style. Due to COVID-19, there was a decrease in the fraction of course time dedicated to hands-on learning (p<0.01) and teaching of clinical correlates (p=0.02) and radiology (p<0.01). Most course directors (79%) reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on quality of learning due to decreased interactive or in-person (62%) learning and lack of dissection (44%). Incorporation of virtual-reality applications or 3D anatomy software (23%) and a decrease in cadaver dissection (13%) were the most common future anticipated changes. Conclusion: The constraints conferred by COVID-19 highlight the importance of maximizing interactive learning in the discipline of anatomy. In an era of social distancing and decreased emphasis on conventional anatomy dissection, adaptations of new technologies and teaching modalities may allow for traditional educational rigor to be sustained.","output":"Anatomy Education In US Medical Schools: Before, During, and Beyond COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) is the type species of the genus Leishmaniavirus in the family Totiviridae.

Understanding the prevalence of spiritual and social support needs in critical illness survivors may guide development of targeted interventions for support, which, in turn, may improve critical illness survivor quality of life. To characterize unmet spiritual and social support needs in critical illness survivors approximately 1 month after hospital discharge and examine the association of these needs with postintensive care syndrome (PICS)-related symptom burden. DESIGN Retrospective, cross-sectional study. SETTING University-affiliated hospital in Pittsburgh, PA. PATIENTS One hundred ninety-six consecutive adult critical illness survivors seen during an initial post-ICU clinic visit from June 2018 to March 2020. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient-reported clinical outcome measures assessing spiritual and social support needs and PICS-related symptoms were extracted from the electronic health record. Patients had a median age of 61 (interquartile range [IQR], 51-68.5), and majority were male (55.1%) with a moderate comorbidity burden (Charlson comorbidity index median score, 3; IQR, 2-5). Social support and spiritual needs were prevalent. Of the 196 patients, over 50% reported unpreparedness/fearful for the future, half of patients reported not feeling in control of their care, and over one-third reported needing more support than their family, friends, or insurance can provide. Nearly 13% of respondents reported feeling abandoned or punished by God/not supported by their church/faith. Many patients reported overlapping PICS-related symptom domains (physical, psychologic, and cognitive). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed associations between reported PICS-related symptoms and the presence of spiritual and social needs. CONCLUSIONS Patients surviving critical illness experience significant social support and spiritual needs independent of commonly identified manifestations of PICS.

Measures are needed that complement lockdowns and reduce adverse effects. Epidemiological studies, to date, have identified high-risk populations, but not workplaces appropriate for closure. This study was conducted to provide evidence-based measures that used exact and reliable follow-up data of the PCR-positive COVID-19 cases to complement lockdowns. The data are not subjected to selection or follow-up biases, since the Japanese government, by law, must register and follow all the PCR-positive cases until either recovery or death. Direct customer exposure may affect the quantity of viral inoculum received, which, in turn, may affect the risk of the severity of disease at infection. Therefore, the professions of the cases were grouped according to their frequency of direct customer exposure (FDCE) based on subjective observations, which resulted in five workplaces; hospital, school, food service, outdoor service, and indoor office being identified. Analyzing the follow-up data, we obtained precise estimates for the risk of severe disease, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization or death, for the workplaces adjusted for age, sex, family status, and comorbidity. Major findings are as follows: hospital and school are the lowest risk, food and outdoor services are, despite higher FDCE, safer than indoor office. Unemployed and unclear are the highest risk, despite low FDCE. These results suggest the following workplace-specific measures complementing the lockdown: school should not be closed and indiscriminate closing of food and outdoor service industries should be avoided, since it would be more effective to reinforce their efforts to promote adherence to public health guidelines among students and customers. These actions would also reduce the adverse effects of the lockdown. This study is the first to address the causality between the workplaces and severe disease.

Concomitant treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapies has been hypothesized to improve the therapeutic potential of the virus. Chemotherapy side effects can include immunosuppression, which may slow the rate of the antiviral antibody response, as well as potentially make the patient more vulnerable to viral infection. METHOD: Reovirus neutralizing antibody data were aggregated from separate phase I clinical trials of reovirus administered as a single agent or in combination with gemcitabine, docetaxel, carboplatin and paclitaxel doublet or cyclophosphamide. In addition, the kinetics of individual antibody isotypes were profiled in sera collected in these trials. RESULTS: These data demonstrate preserved antiviral antibody responses, with only moderately reduced kinetics with some drugs, most notably gemcitabine. All patients ultimately produced an effective neutralizing antibody response. CONCLUSION: Patients responses to infection by reovirus are largely unaffected by the concomitant drug treatments tested, providing confidence that RNA viral treatment or infection is compatible with standard of care treatments.","output":"Antiviral antibody responses to systemic administration of an oncolytic RNA virus: the impact of standard concomitant anticancer chemotherapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge toll on both the physical and mental health of people around the globe.

Around 30% of patients with COVID-19 experience severe respiratory distress and are admitted to the intensive care unit for comprehensive critical care. Patients with COVID-19 often present an enhanced immune response with a hyperinflammatory state characterized by a cytokine storm, which may reflect changes in the microbiota composition. Moreover, the evolution to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may increase the severity of COVID-19 and related dysbiosis. During critical illness, the multitude of therapies administered, including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, body position, invasive mechanical ventilation, and nutritional support, may enhance the inflammatory response and alter the balance of patients' microbiota.

Monitoring of transmissions of individuals from different age groups could offer information that would be valuable for planning adequate disease control strategies. We compared the age-specific effective reproductive numbers (R) of measles during 2009C2016 in Guangdong, China. METHODS: We estimated the age-specific R values for 7 age groups: 0C8 months, 9C18 months, 19 months to 6 years, 7C15 years, 16C25 years, 26C45 years, and 46 years adapting the contact matrix of China. The daily numbers of laboratory and clinically confirmed cases reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong were used. RESULTS: The peak R values of the entire population were above unity from 2012 to 2016, indicating the persistence of measles in the population. In general, children aged 0C6 years and adults aged 26C45 years had larger values of R when comparing with other age groups after 2012. While the peaks of R values for children aged 0C6 years dropped steadily after 2013, the peaks of R values for adults aged 26C45 years kept at a high range every year. CONCLUSIONS: Although the provincial supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) conducted in 2009 and 2010 were able to reduce the transmissions from 2009 to 2011, larger values of R for children aged 0C6 years were observed after 2012, indicating that the benefits of the SIAs were short-lived.

Despite work highlighting the link between previous epidemics and elevated suicide rates, there is limited research on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Utilizing an online survey, the current study aimed to better understand the presence, and extent, of the association between COVID-19-related experiences and past-month suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adults in the United States recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 907). Results support an association between several COVID-19-related experiences (i.e., general distress, fear of physical harm, effects of social distancing policies) and past-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Further, a significant proportion of those with recent suicidal ideation explicitly link their suicidal thoughts to COVID-19. Exploratory analyses highlight a potential additional link between COVID-19 and suicidal behavior, suggesting that a portion of individuals may be intentionally exposing themselves to the virus with intent to kill themselves. These findings underscore the need for suicide risk screening and access to mental health services during the current pandemic.

Some positive reports on the use of telemedicine among patients and healthcare providers have been published(1-4), but a patients trust perspective is not available yet. The aim of our study was to verify IBD patients trust in telemedicine. This study was approved by our local Ethics Committee. MATERIAL AND METHODS: At our Gastroenterology Unit in Milan (Italy), 123 video-consultations were delivered to IBD patients with mild or moderate disease, in place of follow-up visits scheduled but not provided during the general lockdown (March-April 2020). Video-calling solutions from Google (Hangouts or Meet) or Microsoft Teams were used according to the patients preference. The patients trust in telemedicine was assessed through an adapted version of the PAtient Trust Assessment Tool (PATAT) questionnaire.(5) The primary endpoint was expressed as a >75% percentage of patients giving a score of at least 4 out of 5 in a Likert Scale for three selected key statements: I can trust video-consultation, I can trust that possible problems with the telemedicine service will be solved properly and I feel at ease when working with this website. The questionnaire was formulated through the EUSurvey platform, widely used for clinical research questionnaires in Europe. RESULTS: One-hundred-fifteen (93.4%) video-consultations were performed out of the 123 scheduled. Among the 115 consultations, 100 questionnaires were completed (86.9%). The primary endpoint of trust in the telemedicine service was achieved in 95%, 90% and 84% of patients for the three selected key statements about the trust in the telemedicine service, its capability to solve clinical problems and its ease to use. While clinical outcomes were beyond our intentions, we reported no drugs withdrawal in this cohort nor major events. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic most of our IBD patients accepted to receive a video-consultation in spite of the traditional in-person visit and trusted the video-consultation.

This review aims to identify, summarize and synthesize the methods and study designs used to measure and understand public opinion, community attitudes and acceptability of strategies to prevent chronic noncommunicable disease (NCDs) in order to allow for examination of imbalances in methodological approaches and gaps in content areas. We searched four scientific databases (CINAHL, Embase, Ovid/MEDLINE and Scopus) for peer-reviewed, English-language studies published between January 2011 and March 2020 in high-income, democratic countries across North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Studies were included if they focused on opinions, attitudes and acceptability of primary prevention strategies and interventions addressing the key NCD risk factors of alcohol use, unhealthy diet, overweight/obesity, tobacco use and smoking, and physical inactivity. A total of 293 studies were included. Two thirds of studies (n = 194, 66%) used quantitative methods such as cross-sectional studies involving surveys of representative (n = 129, 44%) or convenience (n = 42, 14%) samples. A smaller number of studies used qualitative methods (n = 60, 20%) such as focus groups (n = 21, 7%) and interviews (n = 21, 7%). Thirty-nine studies (13%) used mixed methods such as content analysis of news media (n = 17, 6%). Tobacco control remains the dominant topic of public opinion literature about prevention (n = 124, 42%). Few studies looked solely at physical inactivity (n = 17, 6%). The results of this review suggest that public opinion and acceptability of prevention in the peer-reviewed literature is investigated primarily through cross-sectional surveys.

Methods This retrospective study was conducted in patients with IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which were diagnosed and treated for the first time in our hospital between January 2005 and December 2020. Doctors including gastroenterologists (group G) and professional endoscopists (group E) participated in the study. The data divided into CD or UC and group G or group E were compared. Results Patients with CD exhibited higher rates of terminal ileal lesions, reexamined colonoscopy within 6 months, and intestinal stenosis than patients with UC (P < 0.001). The positive endoscopic IBD diagnosis rate was significantly higher in group G than in group E (89.6% vs. 74.0%, P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis for patients with CD, the positive endoscopic IBD diagnosis rate was significantly higher for group G than for group E (81.5% vs. 41.8%, P < 0.001). However, the two groups exhibited no significant difference in the subgroup analysis for patients with UC (94.1% vs. 86.5%, P = 0.060).

Conclusion Professional endoscopists showed lower rates of terminal ileal intubation, positive endoscopic diagnosis, and standard pathological biopsy than gastroenterologists. Hence, additional training on IBD, particularly on CD, must be provided to professional endoscopists to increase their efficiency for terminal ileal intubation and positive endoscopic diagnosis and to enhance their awareness regarding standard biopsy.","output":"A Study on Differences between Professional Endoscopists and Gastroenterologists in Endoscopic Detection and Standard Pathological Biopsy of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction It is common knowledge that mobility refers to a distinct vector for pathogens, but the importance of prevention and the infusion of public health practices within transportation systems is not manifest Replication studies of this effect are important because transportation remains veiled in modern societies, since its demand is not direct, but derived Methods Variables mirroring transportation and logistics' systems intensity (trade data, the logistics performance index, and investment in transportation) are cross-tabulated with epidemiological data from the recent coronavirus pandemic As the samples of the data pertain to a dependent commonality, the statistical hypothesis test applicable is McNemar's test In addition, the statistical power of the test(s) is calculated as a marker of methodological validity and reliability To further strengthen the analytical methodology, a plethora of descriptive statistics have been calculated and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) has been conducted Results This work confirms that the domain of transportation bears a strong association with not only mortality of a disease, but its recovery rates as well All crosstabs provide statistically significant results and the statistical power calculated is very high, signifying the appropriateness of the methodology and the very low probability of Type II error The MCA results are significant, as well Conclusions The impact, or even the presence of transportation is veiled, as transportation comprises of derived demand dynamics As such, its activities and even the prerequisites for its efficient operations many times go unnoticed This work replicates a known effect, that mobility exacerbates the presence of a pathogen The significance of this research lies on the fact that distinct indicators that reflect transportation and logistics are (though a robust calculatory methodology) statistically associated with epidemiological data","output":"Transportation, the pathogen vector to rule them all: Evidence from the recent coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) currently constitute the most frequently used cell type in advanced therapies with different purposes, most of which are related with inflammatory processes.

The aim of the present study is to explore older people's perspectives about what we should learn from this pandemic and how to build a better future. METHODS: The Well-being, Interventions and Support during Epidemics (WISE) study is an exploratory qualitative project that has collected information from 46 individuals aged 65+, who live in Irish community settings. Data collection included in-depth interviews over the phone or videoconference platforms. Analysis is ongoing utilizing NVivo12 to identify themes and linkages within a socio-ecological framework. PRELIMINARY RESULTS: Findings indicate that at the macrosystems level, several participants expect policymakers and researchers to commit to challenging ageist misconceptions of a homogeneous aging experience- such as the notion that older people are merely recipients of care with a high degree of needs. Upon reflection of their experiences with shelter-in-place restrictions and its consequences, at the exosystem level, many respondents called for older voices to be consulted in public health decisions and included in decision-making bodies. Concerning the microsystem, participants referred policymakers should further develop natural and built environments that enable physical, mental and social well-being for all. Cutting across all levels, participants advised for stronger political will and accountability, as they recognized some of their concerns had been addressed in past policies but were not being implemented.

Applications in real-world time series should consider two factors for achieving reliable predictions: modeling dynamic dependencies among multiple variables and adjusting the model's intrinsic hyperparameters.

They generally disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the competing algorithms.

Many existing studies rely on such sensory data for human activity recognition (HAR); however, one of the major bottlenecks is their reliance on pre-annotated or labeled data. Manual human-driven annotations are neither scalable nor efficient, whereas existing auto-annotation techniques heavily depend on video signatures. Still, video-based auto-annotation needs high computation resources and has privacy concerns when the data from a personal space, like a smart-home, is transferred to the cloud. This paper exploits the acoustic signatures generated from human activities to label the wearables' IMU data at the edge, thus mitigating resource requirement and data privacy concerns. We utilize acoustic-based pre-trained HAR models for cross-modal labeling of the IMU data even when two individuals perform simultaneous but different activities under the same environmental context. We observe that non-overlapping acoustic gaps exist with a high probability during the simultaneous activities performed by two individuals in the environment's acoustic context, which helps us resolve the overlapping activity signatures to label them individually. A principled evaluation of the proposed approach on two real-life in-house datasets further augmented to create a dual occupant setup, shows that the framework can correctly annotate a significant volume of unlabeled IMU data from both individuals with an accuracy of $\\\\mathbf{82.59\\\\%}$ ($\\\\mathbf{\\\\pm 17.94\\\\%}$) and $\\\\mathbf{98.32\\\\%}$ ($\\\\mathbf{\\\\pm 3.68\\\\%}$), respectively, for a workshop and a kitchen environment.","output":"Accoustate: Auto-annotation of IMU-generated Activity Signatures under Smart Infrastructure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter explores the variety of cultural contexts at colleges and universities related to IC.

As racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, the objective of this analysis was to assess disparities in influenza vaccination at HRSA-funded health centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and HRSA analyzed cross-sectional data on influenza vaccinations from a weekly, voluntary Health Center COVID-19 survey after addition of an influenza-related question covering November 7-27, 2020. RESULTS: During the three-week period, 1,126 (81%) of 1385 health centers responded to the survey. Most of the 811,738 influenza vaccinations took place in urban areas and in the Western US Region. There were disproportionately more health center influenza vaccinations among racial and ethnic minorities in comparison with county demographics, except among Non-Hispanic Blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives.

Exposed flexible amino acid residues are known to evolve rapidly suggesting that secondary functions may generate diverse interaction potentials between viruses within the same viral family. One mechanism of interaction is viral mimicry through short linear motifs (SLiMs) that act as functional signatures in host proteins. Viral SLiMs display specific patterns of adjacent amino acids that resemble their host SLiMs and may occur by chance numerous times in viral proteins due to mutational and selective processes. Through mimicry of SLiMs in the host cell proteome, viruses can interfere with the protein interaction network of the host and utilize the host-cell machinery to their benefit. The overlap between rapidly evolving protein regions and the location of functionally critical SLiMs suggest that these motifs and their functional potential may be rapidly rewired causing variation in pathogenicity, infectivity, and virulence of related viruses. The following review provides an overview of known viral SLiMs with select examples of their role in the life cycle of a virus, and a discussion of the structural properties of experimentally validated SLiMs highlighting that a large portion of known viral SLiMs are devoid of predicted intrinsic disorder based on the viral SLiMs from the ELM database.","output":"Dynamic, but Not Necessarily Disordered, Human-Virus Interactions Mediated through SLiMs in Viral Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technologies play an essential role in monitoring, managing, and self-management of chronic diseases. Since chronic patients rely on life-long healthcare systems and the current COVID-19 pandemic has placed limits on hospital care, there is a need to explore disease monitoring and management technologies and examine their acceptance by chronic patients. We systematically examined the use of smartphone applications (apps) in chronic disease monitoring and management in databases, namely, Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Proquest, published from 2010 to 2020. Results showed that app-based weight management programs had a significant effect on healthy eating and physical activity (p = 0.002), eating behaviours (p < 0.001) and dietary intake pattern (p < 0.001), decreased mean body weight (p = 0.008), mean Body Mass Index (BMI) (p = 0.002) and mean waist circumference (p < 0.001). App intervention assisted in decreasing the stress levels (paired t-test = 3.18; p < 0.05). Among cancer patients, we observed a high acceptance of technology (76%) and a moderately positive correlation between non-invasive electronic monitoring data and questionnaire (r = 0.6, p < 0.0001). We found a significant relationship between app use and standard clinical evaluation and high acceptance of the use of apps to monitor the disease.

The optimal selection of interventions targeting the virus is unknown. Therefore, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support specific treatment against COVID-19 is urgently needed. The use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) might have a role in the treatment and symptomatic management of patients with COVID-19. It was aimed at providing an overview of the available evidence and ongoing trials concerning the effects of CHMs for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: This is a narrative review of relevant studies. Searches were conducted to identify documents published till April 22, 2020. Electronic databases, evidence-based collections, websites of relevant organizations, and trial registries were consulted. Results: A total of 25 guidelines on the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were identified. Four guidelines provided recommendations on the use of CHMs; these guidelines were developed in China and South Korea and were based on the consensus of experts exclusively. The remaining 21 guidelines provided no guidance on CHMs. No finished RCTs of CHMs for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 was found. According to the evidence evaluated in this review, a Cochrane review of CHMs for severe acute respiratory syndrome and five uncontrolled observational studies of the effects of CHMs in patients with COVID-19, the effects of CHMs for COVID-19 are unknown. A total of 52 ongoing clinical trials of CHM interventions for the treatment of COVID-19 were found. These trials will be carried out mostly in China (n = 51). Forty (77%) of the ongoing trials will be randomized, whereas 12 (23%) have an unclear sequence generation procedure. Forty-seven trials (90%) will have a sample size <400 participants. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, only the Chinese and the South Korean guidelines recommend CHMs as a treatment option for patients with COVID-19. These guidelines base their recommendations on the consensus of experts. Clinical guidelines or health authorities from other countries do not provide advice on CHMs. Due to the absence of RCT, there is currently no reliable evidence on the effects of any specific CHM intervention for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Decontamination of FFRs has been posited as one solution to support the re-use of FFRs with a growing body of literature over the last 10+ years beginning to examine both the efficacy of disinfection of contaminated FFRs but also the impact of the decontamination process on the FFR's performance. Physical and chemical methods of decontamination have been tested for treatment of FFRs with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, sterilization by steam, ethylene oxide and vaporous hydrogen peroxide, demonstrating the most promising results thus far. Many of these methods utilize existing equipment that may already be available in hospitals and could be re-purposed for FFR decontamination. Importantly, some methods may also be replicated on household equipment, broadening the utility of FFR decontamination across a range of healthcare settings. Utilizing techniques to experimentally contaminate FFRs with a range of microorganisms, most decontamination methods appear to reduce the risk of the mask as a source of infection to the wearer and others to negligible levels. The performance of the filter, especially the efficiency of particle penetration following treatment, varied greatly depending on the processing method as well as the model of the filter itself, however.

The additional diagnostic performance of rapid serological test was evaluated in comparison to molecular tests. Likewise, an approximation was made to the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid serological test. RESULTS 144 people were included. With the rapid test, 19.4% of positive results were obtained compared to 11.1% in the molecular test (p = 0.03). The rapid serological test detected 21 cases that had been negative by the initial (RT-PCR), providing an additional diagnostic performance of 56.8% compared to the RT-PCR.

Using a zein suspension prepared by the antisolvent precipitation method, the impact of varying the voltage during dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) treatment on the physicochemical and conformational properties of zein in water was investigated. Analysis of the particle size, specific surface area, and free sulfhydryl content indicated that the protein solubility was maximized by treatment at 70 V for 70 s. DBD treatment destroyed covalent bonds and introduced some hydrophilic groups onto the zein surface, thus enhancing the contact area with water molecules and leading to a more uniform dispersion. A decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of zein micelles indicated that intermolecular interactions were disrupted, thus improving dispersion stability. A more hydrophilic microenvironment was formed owing to the reduction in hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, evaluation of the secondary structure demonstrated that DBD treatment broke hydrogen bonds, resulting in a loose conformation with more exposed sites of action for water. These results are expected to facilitate the development of technologies for improving utilization of zein.

METHODS: The medical records of patients with colorectal cancer who underwent elective surgery in our department during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1 to May 31, 2020) were collected and analyzed. We compared the clinical data with colorectal cancer during the same 4-month period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer underwent elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was 66% of the number of patients that underwent the procedure during the same period in 2018 and 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of patients without any digestive system symptoms decreased to 3% and severe clinical symptoms decreased by 20.9%. The proportion of right colon cancer decreased by 17.9%, while the proportion of rectal cancer increased by 52.2%, as compared with 2018 and 2019. The fraction of protective stoma was significantly higher than in 2018 (23.9% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.011). Compared with 2019, the average post-operative stay was significantly shorter than in 2018 (9.6  3.7 vs. 12.1  9.1, p = 0.015). Compared with 2019, the number of patients with perineural invasion (a feature of adverse prognosis) significantly increased (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer was reduced. However, the tumor stage of patients did not change substantially. We suggest that the clinical diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer should strictly comply with national and professional standards.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Elective Surgery for Colorectal Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of dual infection in dogs with canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV\\\\1) and canine coronavirus (CCV) infection is reported in an animal shelter that comprised approximately 200 adults stray dogs and 30 puppies.

Previous research suggested the existence of three attentional networks: alerting, orienting and executive. However, one important topic is how to enhance the efficiency of attentional networks. In this context, understanding how this system behaves under two different modulatory conditions, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS), will provide important insights towards the understanding of the attention network system. Twenty-seven healthy students took part on a randomized single-blinded crossover study, testing the effects that involved three modalities of unilateral stimulation (tRNS, anodal tDCS, and sham) over the DLPFC, during the performance of the attention network test (ANT) in three different conditions: standard, speed and accuracy. Results showed that tRNS was able to increase attention during more complex situations, namely by increasing alerting and decreasing conflict effect in the executive network. Under the Speed condition, tRNS increased efficiency of the alerting network, as well as under the more demanding conflict network, tRNS overall increased the performance when comparing to sham. No statistical significant effects of tDCS were observed.

University policies and public health recommendations removed medical students from their clinical learning environments. Given this shift from work-based learning, incoming residents and educators alike were wary of the impact on residency readiness. With the current context in mind, and with an approaching CBD launch, the UBC Pediatrics training program developed a bootcamp curriculum in an attempt to ease residency transition. This month-long rotation included instruction and experiential learning in all CanMED roles, with heavy focus on medical expert, communication and collaboration skills required of new residents. Wellness topics were also included given the additional stressors associated with the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: 1). Develop a novel bootcamp curriculum for incoming pediatrics residents with a focus on all CanMED roles in the context of the unique learning constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2). Use cross-sectional survey data to assess comfort levels of new pediatrics residents in all CanMED roles prior to, and after, participating in bootcamp. 3). Discuss implications for medical educators in transitioning new residents into their role, given current limitations imposed by the pandemic. DESIGN/METHODS: We created and distributed a cross-sectional survey to 19 incoming pediatric residents through a secure online platform (RedCAP). Using a 5-point likert scale, survey questions focused on assessing resident comfort levels with competencies from all CanMED roles prior to, and after, participating in bootcamp. Free text comments were included to expand on quantitative data. RESULTS: Response rate was 100% (19/19) for pre-bootcamp surveys, and 84% (16/19) for post-bootcamp surveys. Prior to residency, respondents reported feeling uncomfortable with physical exam skills, pediatric hospital medicine and procedures. After the bootcamp block, participants noted increased comfort with medical management in acute care settings (for example, approach to pediatric cardiac arrest), procedural skills such as LPs, and managing common on call problems (for example, electrolyte disturbances and antibiotics). In free text comments, simulation training was highlighted as being particularly important for building communication and teamwork skills. Trainees seemed to find enjoyment in learning new wellness techniques such as mindfulness and narrative medicine. Residents also noted increased social connection within the group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that during a period of heightened vulnerability, purposeful attention to transitioning new residents into their new role through a bootcamp rotation provided increased comfort and confidence in many CanMED roles. Furthermore, residents endorsed increased cohesion and acknowledged the social benefits of participating in team-based learning, a particularly important and potentially protective outcome given current limitations imposed by the pandemic.","output":"152 Transition to residency - Evaluation of a novel bootcamp for incoming paediatric residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expectations for physicians are rapidly changing, as is the environment in which they will practice.

We compare factors and practices that affect how pharmacology is integrated into the undergraduate medical education curriculum, including teaching techniques, resources, time allocated to pharmacology teaching, and assessment strategies. We use data from seven medical schools in the United States, along with results from a literature survey, to inform the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches and to raise important questions that can guide future research regarding integration of foundational sciences in medical school and health professions curricula. In this comparative study, we found that there is significant heterogeneity in the number of hours dedicated to pharmacology in the preclerkship curriculum, whereas there was concordance in the use of active learning pedagogies for content delivery. Applying the ICAP (Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive) Framework for cognitive engagement, our data showed that pharmacology was presented using more highly engaging pedagogies during sessions that are integrated with other foundational sciences.

Individuals seeking mental health treatment may not be aware of the multiple modalities of digital mental health care available to address their problems (eg, self-guided and group modalities, or one-to-one care with a provider). In fact, one-to-one, in-person treatment is the dominant care model with a masters- or doctoral-level trained mental health provider, and it may or may not be the appropriate or preferred level of care for an individual. Technology-enabled mental health platforms may be one way to improve access to mental health care by offering stepped care, but more research is needed to understand the care modality preferences of digital mental health care seekers because additional modalities become increasingly validated as effective treatment options. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe and evaluate the predictors of care modality preferences among individuals enrolled in a technology-enabled stepped mental health care platform. METHODS: This exploratory, cross-sectional study used employee data from the 2021 Modern Health database, an employer-sponsored mental health benefit that uses a technology-enabled platform to optimize digital mental health care delivery. Chi-square tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to evaluate associations among the categorical and continuous factors of interest and the preferred care modality. Bivariate logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of preferring a one-on-one versus self-guided group, or no preference for digital mental health care modalities. RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 3661 employees. The most common modality preference was one-on-one care (1613/3661, 44.06%). Approximately one-fourth of the digital mental health care seekers (881/3661, 24.06%) expressed a preference for pursuing self-guided care, and others (294/3661, 8.03%) expressed a preference for group care. The ORs indicated that individuals aged 45 years and above were significantly more likely to express a preference for self-guided care compared to individuals aged between 18 and 24 years (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.70-3.59; P<.001). Individuals screening positive for anxiety (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.86; P<.001) or depression (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.95; P=.02) were more likely to prefer one-on-one care.

Much of the current literature on mentoring in gastroenterology is based on expert opinion rather than data. In this study, we aimed to identify gender-related barriers to successful mentoring relationships from the mentor and mentee perspectives. METHODS A voluntary, web-based survey was distributed to physicians at 20 academic institutions across the United States. Overall, 796 gastroenterology fellows and faculty received the survey link, with 334 physicians responding to the survey (42% response rate), of whom 299 (90%; 129 women and 170 men) completed mentorship questions and were included in analysis. RESULTS Responses of women and men were compared. Compared with men, more women preferred a mentor of the same gender (38.6% women vs 4.2% men, P < 0.0001) but less often had one (45.5% vs 70.2%, P < 0.0001). Women also reported having more difficulty finding a mentor (44.4% vs 16.0%, P < 0.0001) and more often cited inability to identify a mentor of the same gender as a contributing factor (12.8% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0004). More women mentors felt comfortable advising women mentees about work-life balance (88.3% vs 63.8%, P = 0.0005). Nonetheless, fewer women considered themselves effective mentors (33.3% vs 52.6%, P = 0.03).

However, acute hypoxia exposure could be shorter and more severe when oxygen systems fail during, e.g., high-altitude sky diving, aircraft cabin pressure drop, balloon flights, extreme altitude climbing, and in some maladies. We aimed to evaluate the speed and magnitude of spleen contraction during short exposure to extreme eupneic hypoxia and its subsequent recovery on oxygen. Eight female and seven male volunteers were exposed to normobaric hypoxia (10% oxygen) for 10 min during sitting rest, followed by 10 min on 100% oxygen. Heart rate (HR), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were measured continuously. The spleen was measured via ultrasonic imaging every minute for volume calculations, and venous blood samples were drawn before and after exposure for hemoglobin concentration (Hb). Mean (SD) spleen volume was 279 (115) mL before exposure, 219 (75) mL (21% reduction; P = 0.005) at 3 min of exposure, and 201 (93) mL after 10 min exposure to hypoxia (28% reduction; P < 0.001). Hb was 138.8 (7.6) gL(?1) before and 142.9 (8.1) gL(?1) after 10 min of exposure (2.9% increase; P < 0.001). SpO(2) was 96.4 (1.7)% before exposure and 74.7 (8.4)% during the last minute of exposure (22.5% reduction; P < 0.001). HR increased from 80 (14) to 90 (17) bpm during exposure (12% increase, P < 0.05). MAP remained unchanged. After 10 min recovery on oxygen, values had been restored for spleen volume and Hb, while SpO(2) was higher and HR lower compared with before hypoxia exposure. We concluded that acute normobaric hypoxia of only 10 min caused significant spleen volume contraction with Hb increase.

Despite recent attempts to broaden its scope, the term remains typically reserved to sudden unexplained death in young adults. In this study, we aim to showcase the utility of molecular autopsy in defining lethal variants in humans. METHODS: We describe our experience with a cohort of 481 cases in whom the cause of premature death was investigated using DNA from the index or relatives (molecular autopsy by proxy). Molecular autopsy tool was typically exome sequencing although some were investigated using targeted approaches in the earlier stages of the study; these include positional mapping, targeted gene sequencing, chromosomal microarray, and gene panels. RESULTS: The study includes 449 cases from consanguineous families and 141 lacked family history (simplex). The age range was embryos to 18 years. A likely causal variant (pathogenic/likely pathogenic) was identified in 63.8% (307/481), a much higher yield compared to the general diagnostic yield (43%) from the same population. The predominance of recessive lethal alleles allowed us to implement molecular autopsy by proxy in 55 couples, and the yield was similarly high (63.6%). We also note the occurrence of biallelic lethal forms of typically non-lethal dominant disorders, sometimes representing a novel bona fide biallelic recessive disease trait. Forty-six disease genes with no OMIM phenotype were identified in the course of this study. The presented data support the candidacy of two other previously reported novel disease genes (FAAH2 and MSN). The focus on lethal phenotypes revealed many examples of interesting phenotypic expansion as well as remarkable variability in clinical presentation. Furthermore, important insights into population genetics and variant interpretation are highlighted based on the results.

RESULT: Our finding indicated that moderate intake of total dairy (OR: 0.63, 95% CI 0.46C0.87, P-trend = 0.97) could reduce the odds of COVID-19 and higher intake of low-fat dairy products (OR: 0.51 CI: 0.37C0.69, p-trend < 0.001) and low-fat milk (OR: 0.47 CI: 0.35C0.64, p-trend < 0.001) had a protective effect on COVID-19 after adjusting for confounders. However, higher intake of high-fat-dairy-product (OR: 1.40 CI: 1.09C1.92, p-trend = 0.03), high-fat milk (OR: 1.54 CI: 1.20C1.97, p-trend < 0.001), total yogurt (OR: 1.40 CI: 1.04C1.89, p-trend = 0.01), cheese (OR: 1.80 CI: 1.27C2.56, p-trend = 0.001), and butter (OR: 1.80 CI: 1.04C3.11, p-trend = 0.02) were related to increase the odds of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate intake of total dairy could reduce odds of COVID-19 by 37% and, a higher intake of low-fat dairy products had a protective role on COVID-19. Although our study has promising results, stronger clinical studies are needed.","output":"The association between dairy products and the risk of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disparities among vulnerable populations are a paramount concern that extends to COVID-19 vaccine administration. We aim to better characterize the scope of vaccine inequity in California by comparing the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) of California counties and respective vaccination rates, modeling the growth rate and anticipated maximum proportion of individuals vaccinated by SVI group. Methods: Overall SVI, its four themes, and 9228 data points of daily vaccination numbers across all 58 California counties were used to model, overall and by theme, growth velocity of proportion of population vaccinated and the expected maximum proportion of individuals (at least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson/Janssen) that will be vaccinated for each theme. Results: Overall high vulnerability counties in California have lower vaccine coverage velocity compared to low and moderate vulnerability counties. The largest disparity in coverage velocity between low and highly vulnerable counties was observed in Theme 3 (minority status & language). However, our model showed that highly vulnerable counties based on Theme 3 are expected to eventually achieve a higher proportion of vaccinated individuals compared to low vulnerable counterparts if current trajectories continue. Counties in the overall low vulnerability category are estimated to achieve a higher proportion of vaccinated individuals when compared to high and moderate vulnerable counties, assuming current trajectories. The largest disparity in asymptotic proportion vaccinated between high and low vulnerable counties was observed in Theme 2 (household composition & disability). Conclusion: This study provides insight into the problem of COVID-19 vaccine disparity across California which can be used to help promote equity during the current pandemic as well as guide the allocation of future vaccines such as COVID-19 booster shots.","output":"Modeling the COVID-19 Vaccination Dynamics in the United States: An Estimation of Coverage Velocity and Carrying Capacity Based on Socio-demographic Vulnerability Indices in California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter reports on the 'Corona teaching' in a department of English studies at a German university of technology.

This variant comprises several mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD(Delta)) of its spike glycoprotein, which binds to the peptidase domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in host cells. The RBDCPD interaction has been targeted by antibodies and nanobodies to prevent viral infection, but their effectiveness against the Delta variant remains unclear. Here, we investigated RBD(Delta)CPD interactions in the presence and absence of nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing 21.8 s of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Unbiased simulations revealed that Delta variant mutations strengthen RBD binding to ACE2 by increasing the hydrophobic interactions and salt bridge formation, but weaken interactions with H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1. Among these nanobodies H11-H4 and H11-D4 bind RBD without overlapping ACE2. They were unable to dislocate ACE2 from RBD(Delta) when bound side by side with ACE2 on RBD. Steered molecular dynamics simulations at comparable loading rates to high-speed atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments estimated lower rupture forces of the nanobodies from RBD(Delta) compared to ACE2. Our results suggest that existing nanobodies are less effective to inhibit RBD(Delta)CPD interactions and a new generation of nanobodies is needed to neutralize the Delta variant.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant Decreases Nanobody Binding and ACE2 Blocking Effectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019 the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the cause of the pandemic Covid 19. Early symptoms overlap with other common conditions such as common cold and Influenza, making early screening and diagnosis are crucial goals for health practitioners. The aim of the study was to use machine learning, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a simple statistical test to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from full blood counts without knowledge of symptoms or history of the individuals. The dataset included in the analysis and training contains anonymized full blood count results from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at S?o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR test during a visit to the hospital. Patient data was anonymised by the hospital, clinical data was standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation. This data was made public with the aim to allow researchers to develop ways to enable the hospital to rapidly predict and potentially identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. We find that with full blood counts random forest, shallow learning and a flexible ANN model predict SARS-CoV-2 patients with high accuracy between populations on regular wards (AUC = 93-94%) and those not admitted to hospital or in the community (AUC = 80-86%). Here AUC is the Area Under the receiver operating characteristics Curve and a measure for model performance. Moreover, a simple linear combination of 4 blood counts can be used to have an AUC of 85% for patients within the community. The normalised data of different blood parameters from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibit a decrease in platelets, leukocytes, eosinophils, basophils and lymphocytes, and an increase in monocytes. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibit a characteristic immune response profile pattern and changes in different parameters measured in the full blood count that are detected from simple and rapid blood tests. While symptoms at an early stage of infection are known to overlap with other common conditions, parameters of the full blood count can be analysed to distinguish the viral type at an earlier stage than current rt-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 allow at present. This new methodology has potential to greatly improve initial screening for patients where PCR based diagnostic tools are limited.","output":"Use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection from full blood counts in a population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 infection has particularly affected older adults.

The main reasons are: (1) lack of standardization of electrode placement, (2) time-consuming diagnostic procedures and (3) a complex multi-channel recording setup. We proposed a methodology in which an easy-to-use single-channel EGG, with a less time-consuming protocol (<1 h), would provide sufficient information for gastric motility assessment.

Factors influencing the microbiome can cause dysbiosis and precipitate symptoms of colic through several mechanisms such as increased gas-production and low grade gut inflammation. Other possible factors are immaturity of the enterohepatic bile acid cycle and administration of antibiotics and other medications during the perinatal period.

In addition to the lung, cytokine storm-induced inflammatory cascade also affects other organs. SARS-CoV-2 infection-related vascular inflammation is characterized by endotheliopathy in the lung and other organs. Whether SARS-CoV-2 causes endotheliopathy by directly infecting endothelial cells is not known and is the focus of the present study. We observed 1) the co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 with the endothelial cell marker CD31 in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice expressing hACE2 in the lung by intranasal delivery of adenovirus 5-hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2 mice) and non-human primates at both the protein and RNA levels, and 2) SARS-CoV-2 proteins in endothelial cells by immunogold labeling and electron microscopic analysis. We also detected the co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 with CD31 in autopsied lung tissue obtained from patients who died from severe COVID-19. Comparative analysis of RNA sequencing data of the lungs of infected Ad5-hACE2 and Ad5-empty (control) mice revealed upregulated KRAS signaling pathway, a well-known pathway for cellular activation and dysfunction. Further, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects mature mouse aortic endothelial cells (AoECs) that were activated by performing an aortic sprouting assay prior to exposure to SARS-CoV-2. This was demonstrated by co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 and CD34 by immunostaining and detection of viral particles in electron microscopic studies. Moreover, the activated AoECs became positive for ACE-2 but not quiescent AoECs.

Scans were examined to compare with recorded SLIO findings. Primary outcome: analyse the proportion of eyes with maculopathy missed by SLIO. Secondary outcome: to assess the proportion of patients with maculopathy on OCT, the incidence of maculopathy in the fellow eye on OCT and proportion with cataracts too dense to allow SLIO or OCT. RESULTS: Six hundred twenty-six patients were enroled. Eighty (12.8%) had maculopathy detectable only on OCT which included: 26 (4.2%) epiretinal membrane (ERM), 25 (4%) dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 19 (3%) vitreomacular traction (VMT), 5 (0.8%) lamellar macular hole (LMH), 2 (0.3%) cystoid macular oedema (CMO) and 1 (0.2%) wet AMD. 166 (26.5%) had maculopathy on OCT, of which only 48 (7.7%) had known history of maculopathy.

Therefore, real-life experience and pharmacovigilance studies describing the use and side effects of antimalarials for COVID-19 in developing countries are still relevant. Objective: To describe the adverse effects associated with the use of antimalarial drugs in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at a reference center in Mexico City. Methods: We integrated a retrospective cohort with all adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia from March 13th, 2020, to May 17th, 2020. We compared the baseline characteristics (demographic and clinical) and the adverse effects between the groups of patients treated with and without antimalarial drugs. The mortality analysis was performed in 491 patients who received optimal care and were not transferred to other institutions (210 from the antimalarial group and 281 from the other group). Results: We included 626 patients from whom 38% (n = 235) received an antimalarial drug. The mean age was 51.2  13.6 years, and 64% were males. At baseline, compared with the group treated with antimalarials, the group that did not receive antimalarials had more dyspnea (82 vs. 73%, p = 0.017) and cyanosis (5.3 vs. 0.9%, p = 0.009), higher respiratory rate (median of 28 vs. 24 bpm, p < 0.001), and lower oxygen saturation (median of 83 vs. 87%, p < 0.001). In the group treated with antimalarials, 120 patients had two EKG evaluations, from whom 12% (n = 16) prolonged their QTc from baseline in more than 50 ms, and six developed a ventricular arrhythmia. Regarding the trajectories of the liver function tests over time, no significant differences were found for the change in the mean value per day between the two groups.

We aimed to further evaluate the influence of corticosteroids on mortality in adult patients with influenza pneumonia by comparing corticosteroid-treated and placebo-treated patients. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Information Sciences Institute (ISI) Web of Science databases were searched for all controlled studies that compared the effects of corticosteroids and placebo in adult patients with influenza pneumonia. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were mechanical ventilation (MV) days, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU LOS), and the rate of secondary infection. RESULTS: Ten trials involving 6548 patients were pooled in our final analysis. Significant heterogeneity was found in all outcome measures except for ICU LOS (I(2) = 38%, P = 0.21). Compared with placebo, corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30 ~ 2.36, Z = 3.71, P = 0.0002), longer ICU LOS (mean difference [MD] 2.14, 95% CI 1.17 ~ 3.10, Z = 4.35, P < 0.0001), and a higher rate of secondary infection (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.04 ~ 3.78, Z = 2.08, P = 0.04) but not MV days (MD 0.81, 95% CI ? 1.23 ~ 2.84, Z = 0.78, P = 0.44) in patients with influenza pneumonia.

Firstly, it is to provide the audience with scientific research which aims to have a better understanding of both the capacity issues which have been identified in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the (potential) solutions to increase capacity during inter-pandemic times and future pandemics. Secondly, it is to provide the opportunity for audience to discuss about the findings and interact with the authors. The structure of the workshop will be as follows: The session starts with two thought-provoking statements related to the first two presentations. The audience will be given the opportunity to react to these thoughts using a voting tool and via the chat. This will prime the audience for the upcoming presentations and invite them to participate interactively during the workshop. In the next 15 minutes, the first two presentations will take place. The presenters will end once again with the aforementioned statements. The audience will be given the opportunity to react by asking clarifying questions, respond to, or challenge the statements.

Data were collected from 447,346 reports from the VAERS between 1 January 2021 and 31 July 2021. Propensity-score-matched populations were constructed by adjusting for demographic characteristics and 11 underlying diseases in eligible subjects who received 1 of 3 COVID-19 vaccines: 19,462 Ad26.COV2.S, 120,580 mRNA-1273, and 100,752 BNT162b2. We observed that 88 suspected AEFIs (22 in Ad26.COV2.S, 62 in mRNA-1273, and 54 in BNT162b2) were associated with an increased risk of delayed recovery within 2 weeks after COVID-19 vaccinations. Nervous system, musculoskeletal and connective tissue, gastrointestinal, skin, and subcutaneous tissue disorders were the most common AEFIs after COVID-19 vaccination. Interestingly, four local and systemic reactions affected recovery in different vaccine recipients during our study period: asthenic conditions and febrile disorders in Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA-1273; general signs and symptoms in mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2; injection site reactions in Ad26.COV2.S and BNT162b2.

Not only are women twice as likely as men to develop PTSD, they experience different symptoms and comorbidities associated with PTSD. Yet the dearth of preclinical research on females leaves a notable gap in understanding the underlying neuropathology of this sex difference. METHODS Using two standard measures of PTSD-like responses in rats, the acoustic startle response (ASR) and dexamethasone suppression test (DST), we tested the effects of traumatic stress in adult male and female rats using two rodent models of PTSD, single prolonged stress and predator exposure. We then examined the neural correlates underlying these responses with cFos and glucocorticoid receptor immunohistochemistry in brain regions implicated in the traumatic stress response. RESULTS We now report that adult male and female rats across two models of PTSD show consistent sex-specific responses that recapitulate fundamental differences of PTSD in men and women. Trauma-exposed males showed the well-established hyper-responsive phenotype of enhanced ASR and exaggerated negative feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, while the same traumatic event had little effect on these same measures in females. Dramatic sex differences in how trauma affected cFos and glucocorticoid receptor expression in the brain lend further support to the idea that the trauma response of male and female rats is fundamentally different. CONCLUSIONS Two standard measures, ASR and DST, might suggest that females are resilient to the effects of traumatic stress, but other measures make it clear that females are not resilient, but simply respond differently to trauma. The next important question to answer is why. We conclude that males and females show fundamentally different responses to trauma that do not simply reflect differences in resilience. The divergent effects of trauma in the brains of males and females begin to shed light on the neurobiological underpinnings of these sex differences, paving the way for improved diagnostics and therapeutics that effectively treat both men and women.","output":"Sex differences in the traumatic stress response: PTSD symptoms in women recapitulated in female rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 excess mortality has been estimated for more than 100 countries and shows a dramatic death toll in many countries.","output":"A comprehensive look at the COVID-19 pandemic death toll"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are notorious reservoirs of several zoonotic diseases and may be uniquely tolerant of infection among mammals. Broad sampling has revealed the importance of bats in the diversification and spread of viruses and eukaryotes to other animal hosts. Vector-borne bacteria of the genus Bartonella are prevalent and diverse in mammals globally and recent surveys have revealed numerous Bartonella lineages in bats. We assembled a sequence database of Bartonella strains, consisting of nine genetic loci from 209 previously characterized lineages and 121 new cultured strains from bats, and used these data to perform the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Bartonella to date. This analysis included estimation of divergence dates using a molecular clock and ancestral reconstruction of host associations and geography. We estimate that Bartonella began infecting mammals 62 million years ago near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Additionally, the radiation of particular Bartonella clades correlate strongly to the timing of diversification and biogeography of mammalian hosts. Bats were inferred to be the ancestral hosts of all mammal-associated Bartonella and appear to be responsible for the early geographic expansion of the genus. We conclude that bats have had a deep influence on the evolutionary radiation of Bartonella bacteria and their spread to other mammalian orders. These results support a bat seeding hypothesis that could explain similar evolutionary patterns in other mammalian parasite taxa. Application of such phylogenetic tools as we have used to other taxa may reveal the general importance of bats in the ancient diversification of mammalian parasites. Significance statement Discovering the evolutionary history of infectious agents in animals is important for understanding the process of host adaptation and the origins of human diseases. To clarify the evolution of the Bartonella genus, which contains important human pathogens, we performed phylogenetic analysis on a broad diversity of Bartonella strains, including novel strains from bats. Our results indicate that Bartonella clades diversified along with their mammal hosts over millions of years. Bats appear to be especially important in the early radiation and geographic dispersal of Bartonella lineages. These patterns are consistent with research indicating a chiropteran origin of important human viruses and eukaryotic parasites, suggesting that bats may play a unique role as historical sources of infections to other hosts.","output":"Bats are key hosts in the radiation of mammal-associated Bartonella bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile device location data (MDLD) contains abundant travel behavior information to support travel demand analysis. Compared to traditional travel surveys, MDLD has larger spatiotemporal coverage of the population and its mobility. However, ground truth information such as trip origins and destinations, travel modes, and trip purposes are not included by default. Such important attributes must be imputed to maximize the usefulness of the data. This paper targets at studying the capability of MDLD on estimating travel mode share at aggregated levels. A data-driven framework is proposed to extract travel behavior information from MDLD. The proposed framework first identifies trip ends with a modified Spatiotemporal Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm. Then three types of features are extracted for each trip to impute travel modes using machine learning models. A labeled MDLD dataset with ground truth information is used to train the proposed models, resulting in a 95% recall rate in identifying trip ends and over 93% tenfold cross-validation accuracy in imputing the five travel modes (drive, rail, bus, bike and walk) with a random forest (RF) classifier. The proposed framework is then applied to two large-scale MDLD datasets, covering the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area and the United States, respectively. The estimated trip distance, trip time, trip rate distribution, and travel mode share are compared against travel surveys at different geographies. The results suggest that the proposed framework can be readily applied in different states and metropolitan regions with low cost in order to study multimodal travel demand, understand mobility trends, and support decision making.","output":"A data-driven travel mode share estimation framework based on mobile device location data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM: Thiol status is a good reflector of the cellular redox and have vital roles in various cellular signaling pathways. The purpose of the study was to investigate thiol status in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 587 subjects (517 patients/70 healthy controls) were enrolled in the study.The patients were categorized into the groups regarding to the severity of disease (mild, moderate, severe, and critical).Thiol status of all groups were compared. RESULTS: The patients had significantly diminished thiol levels compared to controls. Thiol levels were gradually decreased as the severity of the disease increased. Logistic regression analyses identified that thiol concentrations were an independent risk factor for the disease severity in each phase (mild group OR 0.975, 95%CI 0.965-0.986; moderate group, OR 0.964, 95%CI 0.953-0.976; severe group OR 0.953, 95%CI 0.941-0.965; critical group OR 0.947, 95%CI 0.935-0.960).Thiol test exhibited the largest area under the curve at 0.949, with the highest sensitivity (98.6%) and specificity (80.4%).

We assess whether the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+). METHODS: Three analyses were conducted: (i) a comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013-17) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (ii) an assessment of the cross-sectional correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness (May 2020) and (iii) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes (March-June 2020) in loneliness (Corona panel). RESULTS: We found (i) increased loneliness in 2020 compared with previous years, (ii) a moderate positive association between the number of restriction measures older adults were affected from and their loneliness and (iii) that loneliness was higher during 'lockdown' compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus no strong negative consequences for older adults' mental health are expected. Nonetheless, the effects on loneliness, and subsequent mental health issues, could be both more long-lasting and severe if future restriction measures are enacted repeatedly and/or over longer time periods.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 restriction measures on loneliness among older adults in Austria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The monitoring data of a micrometeorological station in Lecce (Southern Italy, Puglia region, Salento Peninsula) were used with the aim of interpreting the variations in the groundwater level in a shallow aquifer as a function of hydrometeorological forcing.

Each Indian state has its own mechanism for reporting COVID-19 data, and the quality of their reporting has not been systematically evaluated. We present a comprehensive assessment of the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the Indian state governments between 19 May and 1 June, 2020. METHODS: We designed a semi-quantitative framework with 45 indicators to assess the quality of COVID-19 data reporting. The framework captures four key aspects of public health data reporting - availability, accessibility, granularity, and privacy. We used this framework to calculate a COVID-19 Data Reporting Score (CDRS, ranging from 0-1) for each state. RESULTS: Our results indicate a large disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting across India. CDRS varies from 0.61 (good) in Karnataka to 0.0 (poor) in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with a median value of 0.26. Ten states do not report data stratified by age, gender, comorbidities or districts. Only ten states provide trend graphics for COVID-19 data. In addition, we identify that Punjab and Chandigarh compromised the privacy of individuals under quarantine by publicly releasing their personally identifiable information. The CDRS is positively associated with the state's sustainable development index for good health and well-being (Pearson correlation: r=0.630,p=0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Our assessment informs the public health efforts in India and serves as a guideline for pandemic data reporting. The disparity in CDRS highlights three important findings at the national, state, and individual level. At the national level, it shows the lack of a unified framework for reporting COVID-19 data in India, and highlights the need for a central agency to monitor or audit the quality of data reporting done by the states. Without a unified framework, it is difficult to aggregate the data from different states, gain insights, and coordinate an effective nationwide response to the pandemic. Moreover, it reflects the inadequacy in coordination or sharing of resources among the states. The disparate reporting score also reflects inequality in individual access to public health information and privacy protection based on the state of residence.","output":"Disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting across India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations comprised with six classes depicting the spread of the 1918 to 1920 Spanish flu has been considered in this work.

We combined a meta-analysis of nationwide measurements and air quality modeling to identify efficiency gains by striking a balance between controlling NH3 and acid gas (SO2 and NOx) emissions. We found that PM2.5 concentrations decreased from 2000 to 2019, but annual mean PM2.5 concentrations still exceeded 35 g m-3 at 74 % of 1498 monitoring sites during 2015C2019. The concentration of PM2.5 and its components were significantly higher (16 %C195 %) on hazy days than on non-hazy days. Compared with mean values of other components, this difference was more significant for the secondary inorganic ions SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+ (average increase 98 %). While sulfate concentrations significantly decreased over this period, no significant change was observed for nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Model simulations indicate that the effectiveness of a 50 % NH3 emission reduction for controlling secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) concentrations decreased from 2010 to 2017 in four megacity clusters of eastern China, simulated for the month of January under fixed meteorological conditions (2010). Although the effectiveness further declined in 2020 for simulations including the natural experiment of substantial reductions in acid gas emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting reductions in SIA concentrations were on average 20.8 % lower than those in 2017. In addition, the reduction in SIA concentrations in 2017 was greater for 50 % acid gas reductions than for the 50 % NH3 emission reductions.

This included many services for people with dementia and their families, such as day centres and dementia cafes.Objective:To explore the changes made to services during the pandemic and the impact of these changes on the delivery of good post-diagnostic dementia support.Method:Professionals who had previously been recruited to the ongoing PriDem qualitative study were approached for follow up interview. Eighteen interviews with a total of 21 professionals working in health, social care and the third sector were conducted using telephone or video conferencing.Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and checked prior to thematic analysis.Results:Key themes emerging from preliminary analysis of the data include: uncertainty about the future and the need to adapt quickly to shifting guidance;changing job roles and ways of working;the emotional and physical impact of the pandemic on staff working with people with dementia and their families;and the impact of changes made (e.g. increased PPE, remote working) on the ability to deliver post-diagnostic support.

Repeated subcutaneous immunization of C57BL/6 mice with the PmE-L peptide efficiently induced the production of Abs against the E epitope of mouse/human AQP5 (AQP5E), and we aimed to characterize the antigen specificity, the sequences of AQP5E-specific B cell receptors, and salivary gland phenotypes of these mice. Sera containing anti-AQP5E IgG not only stained mouse Aqp5 expressed in the submandibular glands but also detected PmApq and PmE-L by immunoblotting, suggesting molecular mimicry. Characterization of the AQP5E-specific autoantibodies selected from the screening of phage display Ab libraries and mapping of the B cell receptor repertoires revealed that the AQP5E-specific B cells acquired the ability to bind to the Ag through cumulative somatic hypermutation. Importantly, animals with anti-AQP5E Abs had decreased salivary flow rates without immune cell infiltration into the salivary glands. This model will be useful for investigating the role of anti-AQP5 autoantibodies in glandular dysfunction in SS and testing new therapeutics targeting autoantibody production.","output":"Induction of Anti-Aquaporin 5 Autoantibody Production by Immunization with a Peptide Derived from the Aquaporin of Prevotella melaninogenica Leads to Reduced Salivary Flow in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Hyposmia is among the most common symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Previous research has mainly described this issue at the diseases early stages. Because olfactory impairment can indicate neurological degeneration, we investigated the possibility of permanent olfactory damage by assessing hyposmia during the late recovery stage of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Ninety-five patients were assessed with the Brief Smell Identification Test for Chinese (B-SITC) and Hyposmia Rating Scale (HRS) after 16 weeks from disease onset. Five weeks later, 41 patients were retested with B-SITC. RESULTS: At the first visit, hyposmia was identified in 26/82 (31.7%) and 22/95 (23.2%) of participants by HRS (HRS score 22) and B-SITC (B-SITC score <8), respectively. The rates of hyposmia in patients who performed B-SITC after 14C15 weeks, 16C17 weeks, and 18 weeks from disease onset were 7/25 (28%), 8/35 (23%) and 7/35 (20%), respectively, which demonstrated a trend of olfaction improvement as recovery time prolonging. Hyposmia percentages decreased from the first visit (34.1%) to the second visit (24.4%) for the 41 patients who completed 2 visits. B-SITC scores of the first-visit hyposmia participants increased significantly at the second visit (5.29  2.02 to 8.29  2.40; n = 14, P = 0.001). Severe cases tended to recover less than common cases. CONCLUSIONS: Hyposmia was present in up to one-third of COVID-19 patients after about 3 months from disease onset. Notable recovery of olfactory function was observed at a next 5-weeks follow-up. Clinical severity had little influence on olfactory impairment and recovery.","output":"Residual olfactory dysfunction in Coronavirus Disease 2019 patients after long term recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent pandemic outbreak of coronavirus is pathogenic and a highly transmittable viral infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). In this time of ongoing pandemic, many emerging reports suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 has inimical effects on neurological functions, and even causes serious neurological damage. The neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 include headache, dizziness, depression, anosmia, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, and Guillain-Barre syndrome along with many others. The involvement of the CNS may be related with poor prognosis and disease worsening. Here, we review the evidence of nervous system involvement and currently known neurological manifestations in COVID-19 infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. We prioritize the 332 human targets of SARS-CoV-2 according to their association with brain-related disease and identified 73 candidate genes. We prioritize these 73 genes according to their spatio-temporal expression in the different regions of brain and also through evolutionary intolerance analysis. The prioritized genes could be considered potential indicators of COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms and thus act as a possible therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of CNS manifestations associated with COVID-19 patients.","output":"Neurological manifestations of COVID-19: available evidences and a new paradigm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the evolution of machine learning, the facial recognition technology has already been used in different kinds of situations.

Therefore, the METI suggests that what is most important is how quickly rules can be changed in line with technological innovations and the changes in business settings resulting from such innovations and how we can build a mechanism for such changes. This paper introduces how the Japanese government and the private sector analyze the risks posed by using the face recognition technology. Then, the issues of these analyses are discussed. Generally, businesses are at the heart of using personal data to drive innovation and create value for society. As a result, they are expected to play a central role in the design of governance. Also, given the nature of face recognition, which fosters discrimination and surveillance, this paper introduces some ideas that can be used as a reference point for businesses to consider when establishing governance in the use of the face recognition technology.","output":"Governance Framework for Facial Recognition Systems in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines changes in the frequency and characteristics of domestic violence reports following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the imposition of mobility restrictions in six Latin American countries.

Calls to domestic violence hotlines soared, suggesting that this channel was best suited to respond to victims needs during the pandemic. In turn, calls to emergency lines and police complaints declined (especially in the first weeks of the pandemic), consistent with an increase in the perceived (relative) cost of using these channels.

To prevent the massive COVID-19 burden, several vaccination campaigns were initiated. We performed a single center observational trial to evaluate adaptive immunity in naive healthcare workers upon BNT162b2 vaccination. Methods: Serological analysis was performed through conventional immunoassays. Antibody functionality was analyzed via in vitro neutralization assays. Circulating receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific B cells were assessed via flowcytometry. The induction of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells was investigated through interferon-{gamma} release assay combined with flowcytometric profiling of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells. Results: Three months after vaccination, all but one of the subjects (N = 31) displayed vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. In 10 out of 31 subjects, circulating RBD specific B cells were found of which the rate showed moderate correlation to serological parameters. Specific interferon-{gamma} release was present in all subjects and correlated with the significant upregulation of CD69 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and CD40L on CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, no relation was found between B and T cell parameters. In addition, one symptomatic breakthrough infection with the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant of concern was reported. Conclusion: Three months post vaccination, both humoral and cellular immune responses are detectable in all but one participant.

Setting Nation-wide survey across the four nations of the United Kingdom. Representative sample in terms of age and sex for each of the nations recruited using an online panel between 29th October and 12th December 2020. Participants Individuals who are over 18 years old. A total of 4120 adults completed the survey (1112 in England, 848 in Northern Ireland, 1143 in Scotland and 1098 in Wales). Primary outcome measure Adult preferences for, and trade-offs between, type of lockdown restrictions, length of lockdown, postponement of routine healthcare, excess deaths, impact on ability to buy things and unemployment. Results In all four countries, one out of five respondents were willing to reduce excess deaths at all costs. The majority of adults are willing to accept higher excess deaths if this means lockdowns that are less strict, shorter and do not postpone routine healthcare. On average, respondents in England were willing to accept a higher increase in excess deaths to have less strict lockdown restrictions introduced compared to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales, respectively. Conclusions The majority of the UK population is willing to accept the increase in excess deaths associated with introducing less strict lockdown restrictions. The acceptability of different restriction scenarios varies according to the features of the lockdown and across countries.

Presence of tandem occlusions may hamper intracranial access and potentially increases the risk of procedural complications of endovascular treatment (EVT). Our aim was to assess neurological, functional and technical outcome and complications of EVT for intracranial LVO in patients with CAD in comparison to patients with ACAO and to patients without CAD or ACAO. Methods: We analyzed data of the MR CLEAN trial intervention arm and MR CLEAN Registry, acquired in 16 Dutch EVT-centers. Primary outcome was the change in stroke severity by comparing the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 24-48 h after treatment vs. baseline. Secondary outcomes included reperfusion rate and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). We compared outcomes and complications between patients with CAD vs. patients with ACAO and patients without CAD or ACAO. Results: In total, we identified 74 (4.7%) patients with CAD, 92 (5.9%) patients with ACAO and 1398 (89.4%) patients without CAD or ACAO. Neurological improvement at short-term after EVT in patients with CAD was significantly better compared to ACAO (resp. mean -5 vs. mean -1 NIHSS point; p = 0.03) and did not differ compared to patients without CAD or ACAO (-4 NIHSS points; p = 0.62). Rates of successful reperfusion in patients with CAD (47%) was comparable to patients with ACAO (47%; p = 1.00), but was less often achieved compared to patients without CAD or ACAO (58%; p = 0.08). Occurrence of sICH did not differ significantly between CAD patients (5%) and ACAO (11%; p = 0.33) or without CAD/ACAO (6%; p = 1.00). Conclusion: EVT in patients with intracranial LVO due to CAD results in neurological improvement comparable to patients without tandem occlusions. Therefore, carotid artery dissection by itself should not be a contraindication for endovascular treatment in stroke patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion. Although more challenging endovascular procedures are to be suspected in both patients with CAD or ACAO, accurate distinction between CAD and ACAO might influence clinical decision making as better clinical outcome can be expected in patients with CAD.","output":"Acute Endovascular Treatment of Patients With Ischemic Stroke From Intracranial Large Vessel Occlusion and Extracranial Carotid Dissection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Backgrounds: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common comorbidities in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Despite the presence of shared risk factors and comorbidities and the possible effects on sexual health of long-term gout complications, awareness of this association is severely lacking and the pathogenetic mechanisms have only partially been identified. In the present review, we aimed to investigate the current evidence regarding the potential mechanisms linking sexual dysfunctions and gout. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search within PubMed was performed to provide a summary of currently available evidence regarding the association between gout and sexual dysfunctions. RESULTS: Gout and sexual dysfunctions share several risk factors, including diabesity, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and peripheral vascular disease. Gout flares triggered by intense inflammatory responses feature severe pain and disability, resulting in worse sexual function, and some, but not all, treatments can also impair sexual health. Long-term gout complications can result in persistent pain and disability due to joint deformity, fractures, or nerve compression, with negative bearing on sexual function. The presence of low-grade inflammation impairs both sex steroids synthesis and endothelial function, further advancing sexual dysfunctions. The psychological burden of gout is another issue negatively affecting sexual health. CONCLUSIONS: According to currently available evidence, several biological and psychological mechanisms link sexual dysfunctions and gout. Addressing risk factors and providing adequate treatment could potentially have beneficial effects on both conditions. Appropriate clinical evaluation and multidisciplinary approach are recommended to improve patient care.","output":"Relationship between hyperuricemia with deposition and sexual dysfunction in males and females"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Taking care of patients with chronic, terminal diseases presents unique challenges to the mental health of medical oncologists The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated these mental health risks brought about by isolation and exhaustion Delegated to be a national COVID-19 referral centre, the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital faced many challenges, including the increased workload in a perilous and anxiety-inducing national crisis which placed the entire healthcare team in an unprecedented situation To adapt to these challenges, the Division of Medical Oncology employed the following measures to safeguard the mental health of its faculty and fellows: 1) use of psychological support materials;2) initiation of a psychological intervention programme and 3) establishment of peer support programmes Caring for the carers through evidence-based interventions ensures the delivery of quality care to our cancer patients despite the challenges during these trying times","output":"Caring for the carers: safeguarding oncologists' mental health in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reductions in ambient pollution have been taken as an indisputable \\"silver lining\\" to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

No studies to date have investigated the awareness of DCD among key stakeholders in Australia. METHODS An online survey was complete by 494 Australian participants: primary caregivers (n=153), teachers (n=149), allied health professionals (n=165) and medical professionals (n=27). RESULTS DCD and related terms were among the least known childhood disorders. Approximately half of the sample were familiar with the term DCD but every stakeholder group were more familiar with the term dyspraxia. Allied health professionals demonstrated greater knowledge of the features of DCD, particularly motor features. Every stakeholder group showed poor recognition of the social and psychological effects of DCD. A relatively low percentage of allied health (53%) and medical (33%) professionals reported they had identified or diagnosed DCD and less than 20% of these felt that the DSM-5 contained adequate information to make a DCD diagnosis. Most teachers (82%) believed they should play a role in identifying early warning signs of this disorder and 80% believed there are children in the school system who were labelled as lazy or defiant when they have motor skills impairments. Primary caregivers were supportive of a diagnosis of DCD being provided; however, only 16% were confident that a physician would provide an accurate and timely diagnosis. CONCLUSION Key stakeholders play a unique and important role in the identification of children with DCD. Though most participants acknowledge the role that they play, all stakeholder groups demonstrated poor familiarity with the term DCD and low levels of knowledge about the features of this disorder. Improved familiarity and knowledge of the disorder is needed for access to appropriate services and improved long-term outcomes for this condition.","output":"Awareness and knowledge of developmental coordination disorder: A survey of caregivers, teachers, allied health professionals and medical professionals in Australia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An allele-specific oligonucleotide microarray was developed for rapid typing of pathogens based on analysis of genomic variations. Using a panel of Escherichia coli strains as a model system, selected loci were sequenced to uncover differences, such as single- or multiple-nucleotide polymorphisms as well as insertion/deletions (indels). While typical genomic profiling experiments employ specific sequences targeted to genomic DNA unique to a single strain or virulent gene, the present array is designed to type bacteria based on a patterned signature response across multiple loci. In the signature concept, all strains are interrogated by hybridizing their amplified DNA to an array containing multiple probe sequences. Allele-specific oligonucleotide probe sequences targeting each of these variable regions were synthesized and included in a custom fiber-optic array. For each locus, a set of specific probe sequences is selected, such that hybridization gives a binary signal/no signal response to each of the probes. Using this strategy for multiple loci, many pathogens or microorganisms could be classified using a limited number of probes. Because of the advantages of the fiber-optic array platform over other array formats, including sensitivity and speed, the platform described in this paper is capable of supporting a high-throughput diagnostic strategy.","output":"Array-based binary analysis for bacterial typing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the dynamics of the human proteome is crucial for developing biomarkers to be used as measurable indicators for disease severity and progression, patient stratification, and drug development.

Its impact on the cost of surgical and obstetric care is significant. More so, in a country like Nigeria, where even before the pandemic, out-of-pocket spending (OOPS) has been the major payment method for healthcare. The increased cost of surgical and obstetric care occasioned by the pandemic has principally been due to the additional burden of ensuring the use of adequate/appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during patient care as a disease containment measure. These PPE are not readily available in public hospitals across Nigeria. Patients are therefore compelled to bear the financial burden of procuring scarce PPE for use by health care personnel, further increasing the already high cost of healthcare. In this study, we sought to appraise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cost of surgical and obstetric care in Nigeria, drawing from the experience from one of the major Nigerian teaching hospitals- the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Osun State. The cost of surgical and obstetric care was reviewed and compared pre- and during the COVID-19 pandemic, deriving relevant examples from some commonly performed surgical operations in our centre (OAUTHC). We reviewed patients' hospital bills and receipts of consumables procured for surgery.

Thermotherapy and chemical agents were used to control this disease; however, the effectiveness of these treatments is frequently inconsistent. In addition, CLas cannot be cultured in vitro. Therefore, structure-based virtual screening is a novel method to find compounds that work against CLas. This study used CLas GMPS as a target for high-throughput screening and selected some compounds which have a higher binding affinity to test their inhibition of CLas GMPS. Finally, two molecules were identified as the lead compound to control citrus HLB. ABSTRACT: Citrus production is facing an unprecedented problem because of huanglongbing (HLB) disease. Presently, no effective HLB-easing method is available when citrus becomes infected. Guanosine 5-monophosphate synthetase (GMPS) is a key protein in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. GMPS is used as an attractive target for developing agents that are effective against the patogen infection. In this research, homology modeling, structure-based virtual screening, and molecular docking were used to discover the new inhibitors against CLas GMPS. Enzyme assay showed that folic acid and AZD1152 showed high inhibition at micromole concentrations, with AZD1152 being the most potent molecule. The inhibition constant (K(i)) value of folic acid and AZD1152 was 51.98 M and 4.05 M, respectively. These results suggested that folic acid and AZD1152 could be considered as promising candidates for the development of CLas agents.","output":"Discovery of Novel GMPS Inhibitors of Candidatus Liberibacter Asiaticus by Structure Based Design and Enzyme Kinetic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regenerative medicine is a medical treatment that aims to restore lost human body functions by regenerating missing or dysfunctional organs and tissues using stem cells, etc. There are three major types of stem cells used in regenerative medicine: induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), embryonic stem cells (ES cells), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs are expected to be widely applied to regenerative medicine because of their ability to differentiate into various types of cells, repair cells and tissues; anti-inflammatory effects; secretion of various growth factors; and resolution of abnormally accumulated protein amyloid. MSCs can be derived from bone marrow, dental pulp, and other sources, but adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) may be superior in that they can be harvested with the least amount of invasion, and therefore, a sufficient amount of stem cells can be cultured relatively easily. When MSCs are administered systemically by intravenous infusion, they tend to accumulate at the site of disease, a property known as homing, which is extremely advantageous for clinical applications. In Japan, stem cell therapy can be performed only after the research or treatment plan has been reviewed and approved by the Committee for Specific Approval of Regenerative Medicine and submitted to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for approval in accordance with the Act on Securing the Safety of Regenerative Medicine and after approval by the ethics committee of the facility where the therapy is performed.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2017 and May 2018. A sample of 253 individuals who had experienced a traumatic event in the last two years, was included. Participants completed an online self-reported survey, including demographic variables, trauma characteristics, the German Posttraumatic Growth and Depreciation Inventory - Expanded, the Brief COPE Inventory, and the Event Related Rumination Inventory. An analysis of correlation, a principal component analysis and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. Statistical analyses were undertaken on SPSS (version 25.0; IBM, New York, USA). RESULTS: After controlling for the effects of personal and trauma characteristics, self-sufficient coping and socially supported coping were found to favor the emergence of PTG. Event-related and recent deliberate rumination were positively related to PTG. Avoidant-focused coping and recent intrusive rumination were positively associated with PTD. Overall, the final models accounted for 46% and 58% of the variance in PTG and PTD. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the PTG model and support the central role of deliberate rumination, self-sufficient coping and socially supported coping in the development of PTG. Our results indicate that a similar model of PTD with comparable influencing factors can be assumed: if the individual is stuck in ongoing intrusive rumination and uses more avoidance-focused coping, it might lead to more reports of PTD.","output":"Coping and rumination as predictors of posttraumatic growth and depreciation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3D) motion measured at the lower back during walking can describe the regularity and symmetry of gait that may be related to osteoarthritis (OA) and functional status. However, gait speed and inherent sex differences, regardless of the presence of OA, may confound these measures. Therefore, there is a need to understand the effect of OA separately among males and females, without the confounding influence of gait speed. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the difference in 3D gait regularity and symmetry measures between gait speed-matched males and females with and without knee OA. METHOD: Gait regularity and symmetry were computed as autocorrelations of pelvic accelerations during treadmill walking in four groups of older adults: healthy asymptomatic females (AsymF; n = 44), healthy asymptomatic males (AsymM; n = 45), females diagnosed with knee OA (OAF; n = 44), and males diagnosed with knee OA (OAM; n = 45). Data were obtained from a larger research database, allowing for the matching of gait speed between groups. The main effect of OA, sex, and interaction effect between them was examined for the 3D gait regularity and symmetry measures at an alpha level of 0.05. RESULTS: There was no main effect of OA on any variable, but there was a significant main effect of sex on mediolateral and anteroposterior gait regularity measures. Specifically, females demonstrated significantly greater gait regularity, most notably in the mediolateral directions compared to males. CONCLUSION: Older adult females were found to display significantly greater mediolateral gait regularity as compared to males, regardless of the presence of OA. Further, this difference exists among matched gait speeds, suggesting it is not the result of gait speed. Overall, these results highlight the importance of sex-specific analyses and considering gait speed when examining gait acceleration patterns near the center of mass for both cross sectional and longitudinal gait assessments.","output":"Sex differences in the regularity and symmetry of gait in older adults with and without knee osteoarthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on survey responses from more than 1,700 managers in Germany, this study elicits employers perceptions of working from home during COVID-19 and their long-term expectations for the time after the pandemic.

A total of 286 non-duplicate matches were screened for original contributions reporting brain imaging data related to SARS-Cov-2 presentation in adults. RESULTS: The selection criteria were met by 26 articles (including 21 case reports, and 5 cohort studies). The data analysis in a total of 361 patients revealed that brain abnormalities were noted in 124/361 (34%) reviewed cases. Neurologic symptoms were the primary reason for referral for neuroimaging across the studies. Modalities included CT (-angiogram, -perfusion, -venogram), EEG, MRI (-angiogram, functional), and PET. The most frequently reported brain abnormalities were brain white matter (WM) hyperintensities on MRI 66/124 (53% affected cases) and hypodensities on CT (additional 23% affected cases), followed by microhemorrhages, hemorrhages and infarcts, while other types were found in <5% affected cases.

Greece is a main geographical point of entry in Europe for refugees, but epidemiological data on scabies in this population is scarce. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of scabies, including trends over the study period. Methodology/Principal findings Data were collected from June, 2016 to July, 2020, using the surveillance system of the Greek National Public Health Organization. Staff at health centers for refugees/asylum seekers compiled daily reports on scabies and other infectious diseases. Observed proportional morbidity for scabies was calculated using consultations for scabies as a proportion of total consultations. There were a total of 13118 scabies cases over the study period. Scabies was the third most frequently observed infectious disease in refugees/asylum seekers population after respiratory infections and gastroenteritis without blood in the stool. The scabies monthly observed proportional morbidity varied between 0.3% (August 2017) to 5.6% (January 2020). Several outbreaks were documented during the study period. An increasing number of cases was observed from October 2019 until the end of the study period, with a peak of 1663 cases in January 2020, related to an outbreak at one center. Spearman correlation test between the number of reported scabies cases and time confirmed an increasing trend ({rho}=0.67). Conclusions/Significance Scabies is one of the most frequently reported infectious diseases by health care workers in refugee/asylum seekers centers in Greece. Consultations for scabies increased over time and there were several outbreaks. The current surveillance system effectively detects new cases in an early stage.

Tomatoes are found all over the world and are cultivated in a wide variety of environmental conditions. Light-emitting diode (LED) lamps are increasingly being used in the cultivation of tomatoes due to their cost-effectiveness and wide range of possibilities to adapt the spectrum of light emitted to the needs of plants. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different additional lighting used in the greenhouse on the accumulation of biologically active compounds in different varieties of tomato fruit. Chemical composition-content of organic acids, lycopene, total carotenoids, total phenolics and flavonoids as well as dry matter, soluble solids content, and taste index were determined in five tomato cultivars (\\"Bolzano F1,\\" \\"Chocomate F1,\\" \\"Diamont F1,\\" \\"Encore F1,\\" and \\"Strabena F1\\"), which were cultivated in greenhouse in an autumn-spring season by using additional lighting with 16 h photoperiod. Three different lighting sources were used: LED, induction (IND) lamp, and high-pressure sodium lamp (HPSL). Experiments were performed during 3 years. Results showed that tomato varieties react differently to the supplemental lighting used. Cultivars, such as \\"Encore\\" and \\"Strabena,\\" are the most unresponsive to supplemental light. Experiments have shown that HPSL stimulates the accumulation of primary metabolites in tomato fruit. In all the cases, soluble solids content was 4.7-18.2% higher as compared to other lighting sources. As LED and IND lamps emit about 20% blue-violet light, the results suggest that blue-violet light of the spectrum stimulates the accumulation of phenolic compounds in the fruit by 1.6-47.4% under IND and 10.2-15.6% under LED compared to HPSL. Red fruit varieties tend to synthesize more ?-carotene under supplemental LED and IND light.

Inhibition of p97 function by small molecule inhibitors shows antiviral activity, particularly at early stages of the virus life cycle, during virus uncoating and viral RNA replication. Importantly, p97 activity inhibition protects human cells against HCoV-induced cytopathic effects. The p97 knockdown also inhibits viral production in infected cells. Unbiased quantitative proteomics analyses reveal that HCoV-OC43 infection resulted in proteome changes enriched in cellular senescence and DNA repair during virus replication. Further analysis of protein changes between infected cells with control and p97 shRNA identifies cell cycle pathways for both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infection.

The aim of our study is to assess the association of an increased FIB-4 score with COVID-19 disease prognosis. Methods: We performed a prospective study on hospitalized patients with known type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and confirmed COVID-19, with imaging evidence of liver steatosis within the last year or known diagnosis of MAFLD. All individuals were screened for liver fibrosis with a FIB-4 index. We evaluated the link between FIB-4 and disease prognosis. Results: Of 138 participants, 91.3% had MAFLD and 21.5% patients had a high risk of fibrosis. In the latter group of patients, the number of severe forms of disease, the hospital stay length, the rate of ICU admissions and the number of deaths reported registered a statistically significant increase. The independent predictors for developing severe forms of COVID-19 were obesity (odds ratio (OR), 3.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), p = 0.003), higher values of ferritin (OR-1.9; 95% CI, 1.17-8.29, p = 0.031) and of FIB-4 &#8805; 3.25 (OR-4.89; 95% CI, 1.34-12.3, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Patients with high scores of FIB-4 have poor clinical outcomes and liver fibrosis may have a relevant prognostic role.

DESIGN: This is a sequential mixed-methods study using online surveys and semistructured interviews. Interview data were inductively coded and thematically analysed. Survey data were descriptively analysed. SETTING: GP surgeries and acute National Health Service Trusts in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: GPs and clinicians leading care for patients discharged from ICU. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Usual follow-up practice after ICU discharge, changes in follow-up during the pandemic, and GP awareness of follow-up and support needs of patients discharged from ICU. RESULTS: We obtained 170 survey responses and conducted 23 interviews. Over 60% of GPs were unaware of the follow-up services generally provided by their local hospitals and whether or not these were functioning during the pandemic. Eighty per cent of ICUs reported some form of follow-up services, with 25% of these suspending provision during the peak of the pandemic and over half modifying their provision (usually to provide the service remotely). Common themes relating to barriers to provision of follow-up were funding complexities, remit and expertise, and communication between ICU and community services. Discharge documentation was described as poor and lacking key information. Both groups mentioned difficulties accessing services in the community and lack of clarity about who was responsible for referrals and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has highlighted long-standing issues of continuity of care and complex funding streams for post-ICU follow-up care.

Even though it is still controversial about the possible explanation for clinical cases of long-term viral shedding, it remains unclear whether the persistent viral shedding means re-infection or recurrence. METHODS: Specimens were collected from three COVID-19-confirmed patients, and whole-genome sequencing was performed on these clinical specimens during their first hospital admission with a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory tests were examined and analyzed throughout the whole course of the disease. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out for SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes. RESULTS: We found haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in two COVID-19 patients (YW01 and YW03) with a long period of hospitalization. However, only one haplotype was observed in the other patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (YW02), which was verified as one kind of viral haplotype. Patients YW01 and YW02 were admitted to the hospital after being infected with COVID-19 as members of a family cluster, but they had different haplotype characteristics in the early stage of infection; YW01 and YW03 were from different infection sources; however, similar haplotypes were found together. CONCLUSION: These findings show that haplotype diversity of SARS-CoV-2 may result in viral adaptation for persistent shedding in multiple recurrences of COVID-19 patients, who met the discharge requirement. However, the correlation between haplotype diversity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and immune status is not absolute.

METHODS: Using a mixed methods approach blending the capabilities of social media analytics and qualitative analysis, we analyzed COVID-19-related tweets posted by medical professionals and examined their content. We used qualitative analysis to explore the collected data to identify relevant tweets and uncover important concepts about the pandemic using qualitative coding. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques and text analysis were used to identify topics and opinions. RESULTS: Data were collected from 119 medical professionals on Twitter about the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 10,096 English tweets were collected from the identified medical professionals between December 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020. We identified eight topics, namely actions and recommendations, fighting misinformation, information and knowledge, the health care system, symptoms and illness, immunity, testing, and infection and transmission. The tweets mainly focused on needed actions and recommendations (2827/10,096, 28%) to control the pandemic. Many tweets warned about misleading information (2019/10,096, 20%) that could lead to infection of more people with the virus.

As shown, 22% of surveyed admitted not to wash their hands frequently, while 12% did not use disinfectants. These two behaviors were also less frequent in individuals with medical education. The highest levels of pandemic-related fears were associated with health loss in relatives, pandemic-induced economic crisis, and government using a pandemic to control citizens by the state. A significant share of surveyed individuals believed that the pandemic was intentional action to weaken non-Chinese economies (32%) or was deliberately induced for profits from selling vaccines (27%). Men, individuals with no children, and subjects with lower education were significantly less likely to adhere to sanitary measures (handwashing, disinfection, avoiding face touching, changes in greeting etiquette, face-covering when coughing or sneezing), and were less concerned over self and relatives health. At the same time, men were less prone than women to the conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that adherence to sanitary measures during the pandemic can be a challenge also in developed countries, while misinformation campaigns (also concerning vaccines) have already affected the general public during the early phase of the epidemiological outbreak.

Methods: All participants were tested with PCR against SARS-CoV-2 at a clinical microbiology laboratory. Comparing with results from PCR tests, we evaluated the rapid tests' performances in three arms; 1) 20 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 2) 23 recovered outpatients with former PCR-confirmed COVID-19, and 3) 49 participants with suspected COVID-19 presenting at a primary care emergency room. Results: All eleven tests detected antibodies in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, though with varying sensitivities.

The study aims to assess the effectiveness of teaching radiology to undergraduate medical students using synchronous distance learning compared to traditional on-campus learning through exploring students perceived satisfaction and concerns. Students perceptions were correlated with their attendance, grades, and frequency of technical difficulties. METHODS: The study was designed as an observational study involving fourth-year medical students (2019/2020) from two institutions. The cohort students were exposed to traditional learning, distance learning, or both. Students completed an online self-administered questionnaire concerning their perceptions of distance learning. Students attendance, engagement, technical difficulties, and post-clerkship knowledge assessments were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: A total of 145 participants completed the clerkship using the following strategies: traditional learning (n = 66), both traditional and distance learning (n = 67), and distance learning alone (n = 12). The most important result indicates that the abrupt transition to distance learning was well perceived. Most students preferred distance learning over traditional learning in the radiology clerkship (p = .05). During the synchronous sessions, student attendance was high, reaching to 100%. Technical difficulties were limited (1.9%), and they did not affect learning. CONCLUSION: Synchronous distance teaching promotes learning, interaction, and enjoyment in undergraduate radiology education, and it can be as effective as traditional on-campus learning. The technical difficulties encountered, although they were limited, can be overcome by recording the synchronous sessions.","output":"Synchronous distance teaching of radiology clerkship promotes medical students learning and engagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GC\\\\MS was applied to identify 24 main substances in Melaleuca cajuputi essential oil (TA) extracted from fresh cajeput leaves through steam distilling.

First-generation fusion partners were compared for fusion efficiency and the number of antigen-specific antibody-producing clones generated. Hybrid cell colonies that initially secreted antibodies were selected from first-generation heteromyelomas to function as second-generation fusion partners. Although fusion efficiencies for both generations did not differ, the second-generation heteromyelomas yielded a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones. Fusion of heteromyelomas with either lymph node cells or splenocytes indicated that fusion with lymph node cells results in a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones, whereas fusion efficiency was found to be higher with splenocytes.

The collected data are analyzed to generate moment-by-moment quantification of a persons mental state and potentially predict future mental states. Digital phenotyping projects incorporate data from multiple sources, such as electronic health records, biometric scans, or genetic testing. As digital phenotyping tools can be used to study and predict behavior, they are of increasing interest for a range of consumer, government, and health care applications. In clinical care, digital phenotyping is expected to improve mental health diagnoses and treatment. At the same time, mental health applications of digital phenotyping present significant areas of ethical concern, particularly in terms of privacy and data protection, consent, bias, and accountability. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop consensus statements regarding key areas of ethical guidance for mental health applications of digital phenotyping in the United States. METHODS: We used a modified Delphi technique to identify the emerging ethical challenges posed by digital phenotyping for mental health applications and to formulate guidance for addressing these challenges. Experts in digital phenotyping, data science, mental health, law, and ethics participated as panelists in the study. The panel arrived at consensus recommendations through an iterative process involving interviews and surveys. The panelists focused primarily on clinical applications for digital phenotyping for mental health but also included recommendations regarding transparency and data protection to address potential areas of misuse of digital phenotyping data outside of the health care domain. RESULTS: The findings of this study showed strong agreement related to these ethical issues in the development of mental health applications of digital phenotyping: privacy, transparency, consent, accountability, and fairness. Consensus regarding the recommendation statements was strongest when the guidance was stated broadly enough to accommodate a range of potential applications. The privacy and data protection issues that the Delphi participants found particularly critical to address related to the perceived inadequacies of current regulations and frameworks for protecting sensitive personal information and the potential for sale and analysis of personal data outside of health systems. CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi study found agreement on a number of ethical issues to prioritize in the development of digital phenotyping for mental health applications. The Delphi consensus statements identified general recommendations and principles regarding the ethical application of digital phenotyping to mental health. As digital phenotyping for mental health is implemented in clinical care, there remains a need for empirical research and consultation with relevant stakeholders to further understand and address relevant ethical issues.","output":"Ethical Development of Digital Phenotyping Tools for Mental Health Applications: Delphi Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION During an avian influenza (AI) pandemic, primary-care physicians (PCPs) are expected to play key roles in the prevention and control of the disease. Different groups of PCPs could have different concerns and preparedness level. We assessed the concerns, perceived impact and preparedness for an outbreak among PCPs in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey of PCPs working in private practice (n=200) and public clinics (n=205) from March to June 2006 with an anonymous self-administered questionnaire on concerns (12- items), perceived impact (10 items) and preparedness (10 items) for an outbreak. RESULTS Two hundred and eighty-five PCPs responded - 149 (response rate: 72.7%) public and 136 (response rate: 67.3%) private. The majority were concerned about risk to their health from their occupation (95.0%) and falling ill with AI (89.7%). Most (82.5%) accepted the risk and only 33 (11.8%) would consider stopping work. For perceived impact, most felt that people would avoid them (69.6%) and their families (54.1%). The majority (81.3%) expected an increased workload and feeling more stressed at work (86.9%). For preparedness, 78.7% felt personally prepared for an outbreak. Public PCPs were more likely to be involved in infection-control activities and felt that their workplaces were prepared. CONCLUSIONS Most PCPs felt personally prepared for an outbreak but were concerned about their exposure to AI and falling ill. Other concerns included social ostracism for themselves and their families. Public PCPs appeared to have a higher level of preparation.

However, the difficulty of this crisis may lead these professionals to display personal resources, such as harmonious passion, that could be involved in posttraumatic growth. The goal of this study is to examine the STS and posttraumatic growth among healthcare professionals and the demands and resources related to COVID-19. A longitudinal study was carried out in April 2020 (T1) and December 2020 (T2). The participants were 172 health professionals from different health institutions and they reported their workload, fear of contagion, lack of staff and personal protection equipment (PPE), harmonious passion, STS and posttraumatic growth. The results revealed that workload and fear of contagion in T2 were positive predictors for STS, whereas harmonious passion was a negative predictor. Fear of contagion of both times seemed to positively predict posttraumatic growth, as well as harmonious passion. One moderation effect was found concerning the lack of staff/PPE, as posttraumatic growth was higher when the workload was high, especially in those with a high lack of staff/PPE.

Differentiating between local food systems and short supply chains, a review of the literature on the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability is carried out.

SARS-CoV2 could enter human from bat with its poorly developed entry-point residues much before its known appearance with slower mutation rate or recently with efficiently developed entry-point residues with higher mutation rate or through an intermediate host. Temporal analysis of SARS-CoV2 genome shows that its nucleotide substitution rate is as low as 27nt/year with an evolutionary rate of 9x10(?4)/site/year, which is well within the range of other RNA virus (10(?4) to 10(?6)/site/year). TMRCA of SARS-CoV2 from bat RaTG13 lineage appears to be in between 9-14 years. Evolution of a critical entry-point residue Y493Q needs two substitutions with an intermediate virus carrying Y493H (Y>H>Q) but has not been identified in known twenty-nine bat CoV virus. Genetic codon analysis indicates that SARS-CoV2 evolution during propagation in human disobeys neutral evolution as nonsynonymous mutations surpass synonymous mutations with the increase of  (d(n)/d(s)).

AIM: We have been appointed by the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) to update with the current statement ESE members and the whole endocrine community on the emerging endocrine phenotype of COVID-19 and its implication for the prevention and management of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes has a major role in this phenotype since it is one of the most frequent comorbidities associated with severity and mortality of COVID-19. Careful management including treatment modifications may be required for protecting our patients rather with known diabetes from the most dangerous consequences of COVID-19 or hospitalized with COVID-19, but also in patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced newly onset diabetes. Obesity increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and the risk for COVID-19 adverse outcome. Adequate nutritional management needs to be granted to patients with obesity or undernourishment in order to limit their increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection. Lack of vitamin D, hypocalcemia and vertebral fractures have also emerged as frequent findings in the hospitalized COVID-19 population and may negatively impact on the outcome of such patients.

This study aimed to characterize HCV genotypes circulating among Egyptian HCV patients, to dissect the full sequences of HCV NS3-4A and NS5B regions, and to characterize RASs associated with NS3-4A and NS5B inhibitors in HCV treatment-na?ve patients. Genotyping of 80 HCV samples from treatment-na?ve patients was done using restriction fragment length polymorphism and phylogenetic analysis based on some full NS5B sequences. Results showed the prevalence of HCV subtype 4a. Twenty four new full sequences of NS3-4A and NS5B regions of subtype 4a were deposited in the GenBank database. In general, the substitutions associated with NS3-4A-targeting drugs were absent predicting possible responsiveness of Egyptian HCV patients to these drugs. In addition, the absence of amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to Sofosbuvir may predict good response to treatment with Sofosbuvir. Some amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to different classes of non-nucleoside inhibitors were detected.

Investigation was done before and after heterologous (n=31 and 42) or homologous booster vaccination (AZD1222/AZD1222, n=8/9; BNT162b2/BNT162b2, n=8/8). After the second immunisation, 26 age and gender matched sera (AZD1222/mRNA, n=9; AZD1222/AZD1222, n=9; BNT162b2/BNT162b2, n=8) were also tested for VNA against VOC B.1.617.2 (delta) in the cVNT. The strength of IgG binding to separate SARS-CoV-2 antigens was measured by avidity. ResultsAfter the first vaccination, prevalence of IgG directed against (trimeric) SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) varied from 55-95 % (AZD1222) to 100% (BNT162b2), depending on the vaccine used and the SARS-CoV-2 antigen used. The booster vaccination resulted in 100 percent seroconversion and appearance of highly avid IgG as well as VNA against VOC B.1.1.7. The results of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests showed an excellent correlation to the VNA titres against this VOC. The agreement of cVNT and sVNT results was good. However, the sVNT seems to overestimate non and weak B.1.1.7-neutralising titres. The mean anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and B.1.1.7-neutralising titres were significantly higher after heterologous vaccination compared to the homologous AZD1222 scheme. If VOC B.1.617.2 was used as antigen, significantly lower mean VNAs were measured in the cVNT, and three (33.3%) vector vaccine recipients had a VNA titre <1:10. ConclusionsThe heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination leads to a strong antibody response with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and VNA titres at a level comparable to that of a homologous BNT162b2 vaccination scheme. Irrespectively of the chosen immunisation regime, highly avid IgG antibodies can be detected just two weeks after the second vaccine dose indicating the development of a robust humoral immunity. The observed reduction in the VNA titre against VOC B.1.617.2 is remarkable and may be attributed to a partial immune escape of the delta variant.","output":"Heterologous immunisation with vector vaccine as prime followed by mRNA vaccine as boost leads to humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2, which is comparable to that according to a homologous mRNA vaccination scheme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The United States (U.S.) benefits economically and socially from the diverse skill-set and innovative contributions of immigrants. By applying a socio-ecological framework with an equity lens, we aim to provide an overview of the health of children in immigrant families (CIF) in the U.S., identify gaps in related research, and suggest future areas of focus to advance health equity. METHODS The literature review consisted of identifying academic and gray literature using a MeSH Database, Clinical Queries, and relevant keywords in three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and BrowZine). Search terms were selected with goals of: 1) conceptualizing a model to of key drivers of health for CIF; 2) describing and classifying key drivers of health for CIF; and 3) identifying knowledge gaps. RESULTS The initial search produced 1,120 results which were screened for relevance using a meta-narrative approach. Of these, 224 papers were selected, categorized by topic, and reviewed in collaboration with the authors. Key topic areas included patient and family outcomes, institutional and community environments, the impact of public policy, and opportunities for research. Key inequities were identified in health outcomes; access to quality health care, housing, education, employment opportunities; immigration policies; and inclusion in and funding for research. Important resiliency factors for CIF included strong family connections and social networks. CONCLUSIONS Broad structural inequities contribute to poor health outcomes among immigrant families. While resiliency factors exist, research on the impact of certain important drivers of health, such as structural and cultural racism, is missing regarding this population. More work is needed to inform the development and optimization of programs and policies aimed at improving outcomes for CIF. However, research should incorporate expertise from within immigrant communities. Finally, interventions to improve outcomes for CIF should be considered in the context of the socio-ecological model which informs the upstream and downstream drivers of health outcomes.","output":"The Health of Children in Immigrant Families: Key Drivers and Research Gaps through an Equity Lens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There seems to be a broad consensus that there is a positive correlation between resilience and sport performance. However, different studies show divergent results on the role played by certain variables in this relationship. This study aimed to analyze the possible relationships between resilience levels and the practiced sport according to gender, age, and competitive level of the athletes in 1047 competitive athletes from five different sports (handball, basketball, volleyball, athletics, and judo). Resilience was assessed with the Spanish version of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). Results of independent samples t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no significant differences on the level of resilience according to the practiced sport or the competitive level. However, the analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that they were related to the gender and age of the athletes, being higher in males than in females, and there was a positive correlation with age. These results seem to suggest the convenience of using differentiated strategies, according to gender and age, when working on all those protective factors that could allow the athlete to perform better when facing adversity in the competitive environment.","output":"Resilience in Sports: Sport Type, Gender, Age and Sport Level Differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is the most important ingredient in licorice due to its outstanding anti-inflammatory activity and wide application in the medicine and cosmetics industries. Contemporary industrial production of GA by acid hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin which was extracted from Glycyrrhiza plants, is not environment-friendly and devastates farmland since the Glycyrrhiza rhizomes grow up to 10 m underground. RESULTS: In this study, GA was produced through metabolically engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae by introducing the entire heterogeneous biosynthetic pathway of GA. Codon optimized CYP88D6 and CYP72A154, combined with -AS (-amyrin synthase encoding gene) and the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase gene of Arabidopsis thaliana were introduced into S. cerevisiae. The resulting strain (Y1) produced 2.5 mg/L of -amyrin and 14 g/L of GA. The cytochrome b5 from G. uralensis (GuCYB5) was identified and the introduction of this novel GuCYB5 increased the efficiency of GA production by eightfold. The joint utilization of the GuCYB5 gene along with 10 known MVA pathway genes from S. cerevisiae were overexpressed in a stable chromosome integration to achieve higher GA production. Using the combined strategy, GA concentration improved by 40-fold during batch fermentation. The production was further improved to 8.78 mg/L in fed-batch fermentation, which was increased by a factor of nearly 630. CONCLUSIONS: This study first investigated the influence of carbon flux in the upstream module and the introduction of a newly identified GuCYB5 on GA production. The newly identified GuCYB5 was highly effective in improving GA production. An integrated strategy including enzyme discovery, pathway optimization, and fusion protein construction was provided in improving GA production, achieving a 630 fold increase in GA production. The metabolically engineered yeast cell factories provide an alternative approach to glycyrrhetinic acid production, replacing the traditional method of plant extraction.

In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed medical records of 240 COVID-19 patients admitted to Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, between December 24, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Physical, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcome data were abstracted. Patients who were obese [body mass index (BMI) 28 kg/m(2)], underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2)), under 18 years old, pregnant, or still in hospital were excluded. Disease severity was classified as moderate or severe pneumonia based on the World Health Organization interim guidance. Overweight was defined as BMI 24 kg/m(2) and <28 kg/m(2). Patients were followed for discharge or death through April 10, 2020. We used logistic regression models to identify risk factors for severe disease, Cox proportional hazard models to explore associations between medications and patient outcomes (discharge or in-hospital death), and KaplanCMeier survival curves and Cox regression models to evaluate risk factors for in-hospital death. One-half of patients (120, 50.0%) had severe pneumonia, while nearly one-half (114, 47.5%) were overweight. Among patients over 45 years old, overweight patients had significantly lower rates of fatigue, higher rates of headache, and higher median C-reactive protein levels. Patients under 45 years old had higher rates of cough and myalgia and higher proportions of increased alanine aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase, as well as more pulmonary lobes involved in the pneumonia revealed by chest computed tomography scans. Overweight patients were at higher risk of developing severe pneumonia. Although weight was not a risk factor for in-hospital death, overweight patients showed different responses to medications compared with normal weight patients. Intravenous interferon-, intravenous glucocorticoids, and antifungal drugs were associated with reduced mortality in overweight patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin, oseltamivir, and ribavirin were associated with reduced mortality in normal weight patients. Overweight is a worldwide health problem. We found overweight to be related to the COVID-19 severity but not to in-hospital death.

Foster care placement can facilitate mental health service use, yet youth from marginalized and oppressed racial and ethnic groups in foster care are still less likely to receive mental health services compared to non-Latinx white youth. This study aims to examine this discrepancy Black and Latinx youth face by testing (a) whether mental health need moderates the relationship between race or ethnicity and foster care placement and (b) whether race or ethnicity moderates the relationship between foster care placement and mental health service use. Data come from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II), a longitudinal national probability study of youth in contact with the child welfare system. Internalizing need was associated with a decreased likelihood of foster care placement for non-Latinx white youth compared to those with no need; findings showed the opposite for Latinx youth. Race and ethnicity did not significantly moderate the relationship between foster care placement and mental health service use, although predicted probabilities suggest that differences in mental health service use were more pronounced for Black and Latinx youth in in-home and kinship care compared to non-kinship foster care. Results suggest that despite main effects of race and ethnicity on foster care placement and mental health service use, discrepancies across these outcomes are not explained by race and ethnicity alone. Findings highlight the need to comprehensively examine predictors together, rather than separately, when assessing foster care care placement and mental health service use.

Methods: From December 2018 to March 2019, 10 inpatients with mild and 10 inpatients with severe influenza pneumonia admitted to the Department of Infection and Clinical Microbiology of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital were included. Clariom&#8482; D gene chip was used to explore the circRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from the patients. The absolute value of the fold change (FC value)>2 and P<0.05 were used as the criteria to screen the differentially expressed circRNA, and the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG) signal pathway enrichment analysis were also performed. Results: The age of mild patients [M (P25, P75)] was 62.0 (34.5, 69.8) years old, including 4 males; the age of severe patients [M (P25, P75)] was 50.0 (37.0, 60.0) years old, all were males. A total of 137 differentially expressed circRNAs in PBMCs of mild and severe patients were screened. The numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated circRNAs in mild patients were 101 and 36, respectively. Among them, hsa_circ_0091073 (FC value=160.898, P<0.05) was the most significantly up-regulated circRNA and hsa_circ_0092219 (FC value =-17.630, P<0.05) was the most significantly down-regulated circRNA. GO enrichment analysis showed that a total of 111 secondary GO items were significantly associated with related differential expression of circRNA (P<0.05). The GO terms associated with upregulated circRNAs included DNA-templated transcription, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase a ? promoter, etc.; The GO terms associated with downregulated circRNAs included neutrophil degranulation, killing of cells of other organism, defense response to fungus, etc. KEGG signaling pathway analysis showed that there were 37 metabolic pathways related to differentially expressed circRNAs (P<0.05). Signaling pathways related to up-regulated circRNAs included nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, etc. Signaling pathways related to down-regulation of circRNAs included cancer transcription disorders, folate carbon pool, and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis.

Expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only relatively subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrated markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including TNF, IFN{gamma}, IL-2 and IL-4 production. Cell type deconvolution confirmed greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibited a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection with the virus.

The COVID-19 pandemic leads to several debates regarding the possible risk for healthcare professionals during surgery. SAGES and EAES raised the issue of the transmission of infection through the surgical smoke during laparoscopy.

The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of different SEDs evaluating the CO(2) environmental dispersion in the operating theater. Methods. We prospectively evaluated the data of 4 group of patients on which we used different SEDs or standard trocars: AIRSEAL system (S1 group), a homemade device (S2 group), an AIRSEAL system + homemade device (S3 group), and with standard trocars and without SED (S4 group). Quantitative analysis of CO2 environmental dispersion was carried out associated to the following data in order to evaluate the pneumoperitoneum variations: a preset insufflation pressure, real intraoperative pneumoperitoneum pressure, operative time, total volume of insufflated CO(2), and flow rate index. Results. 16 patients were prospectively enrolled. The [CO(2)] mean value was 711 ppm, 641 ppm, 593 ppm, and 761 ppm in S1, S2, S3, and S4 groups, respectively. The comparison between data of all groups showed statistically significant differences in the measured ambient CO(2) concentration. Conclusion. All tested SEDs seem to be useful to reduce the CO(2) environmental dispersion respect to the use of standard trocars.

Technologies used for early screening of severe hepatitis B include gene-based diagnostic techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction, gene sequence analysis, gene chips, and GWAS. Protein-based methods include two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry; and epigenetic-based methods include assays of DNA methylation and histone modifications. In addition, meta-genomics and systematic biology have been used to analyze microbial sequence and function. 3. Early-warning parameters for severe hepatitis B mainly include serum concentrations of ALT, AST, total bilirubin, albumin and pre-albumin, and cholinesterase; and measurements of blood ammonia, prothrombin time and prothrombin activity. Several new parameters related to severe hepatitis B have been identified, including gene mutations (e.g. HBV 1896 site mutation and 1762/1764 double mutation), genetic molecular targets (e.g. CXCL10-201 g/A, IL10-592 t/C, ESR1 IVS1-401 t/C, TBX21-1993 t/C, and ICAM1 R241-E469), immune factors (e.g. TNF-, reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, sCD163, hfgl2, HLA-DR, NK cells, CTL, Th17 cells, Treg cells, PD-1/PD-L), and metabolic factors (e.g. lecithin, fat amides and bile acids). 4. The clinical diagnosis of severe hepatitis B is mainly based on clinical manifestations, including jaundice, coagulation disorders, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites, and laboratory tests, including prothrombin time, prothrombin activity, international normalized ratio, AST/ALT ratio, and serum concentrations of albumin, bilirubin, cholinesterase, cholesterol, lactic acid, and alpha-fetoprotein. 5. At present, there are differences among countries in the standard for diagnosing liver failure. In China, liver failure is referred to as severe hepatitis, whereas, in western counties, liver failure caused by viruses is diagnosed as fulminant hepatitis and refers only to acute liver failure. The main difference is that, in China, the concept of acute fulminant hepatitis has been extended to patients without encephalopathy. In contrast, hepatic encephalopathy II is a necessary condition to diagnose severe hepatitis in the United States, Europe and Japan. 6. Liver failure can be subdivided into acute and chronic liver failure. Acute liver failure includes acute and sub-acute liver failure, and chronic liver failure includes acute-on-chronic and chronic decompensated liver failure. To date, hepatic encephalopathy has been necessary for the diagnosis of acute, but not chronic, liver failure, which is characterized by decompensated liver.","output":"Early Prognostic Predictive System of AECHB and the Diagnosis of Severe Hepatitis B (Liver Failure)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic COVID-19 is a contagious disease affecting more than 200 countries, territories and regions.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 in Wuhan, based on epidemiological modelling, researchers have used various models to predict the future of the epidemic and the time of peak, yielding a diverse number in different countries. This study aims to estimate the basic reproductive number ( R0 ) for COVID-19 in KRI, using the standard SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) epidemic model. A system of nonlinear differential equations is formulated and solved numerically by the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. Reproductive numbers R0 have been estimated by this method of fitting the curves between the actual daily data and numerical solution by applying the least square method. For the analysis, data were taken for the duration of 165 days from 1st of March to 12th August in a population of 5.2 million. It has been concluded that R0 is fluctuating during the outbreak with an average of 1.33, predicting that infected cases will reach their maximum value of around 540,000 on 5th of November 2020. Then the spread of the disease will die out since the number of susceptible will decrease to about 3.2 million.

However, there is no definitive information regarding the type of clinical specimens that is the best for SARS-CoV-2 detection, the antibody levels in patients with different duration of disease, and the relationship between antibody level and viral load. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs, anal swabs, saliva, blood, and urine specimens were collected from patients with a course of disease ranging from 7 to 69 days. Viral load in different specimen types was measured using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Meanwhile, anti-nucleocapsid protein (anti-N) IgM and IgG antibodies and anti-spike protein receptor-binding domain (anti-S-RBD) IgG antibody in all serum samples were tested using ELISA. RESULTS: The positive detection rate in nasopharyngeal swab was the highest (54.05%), followed by anal swab (24.32%), and the positive detection rate in saliva, blood, and urine was 16.22%, 10.81%, and 5.41%, respectively. However, some patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs had other specimens tested positive. There was no significant correlation between antibody level and days after symptoms onset or viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Other specimens could be positive in patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs, suggesting that for patients in the recovery period, specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs should also be tested to avoid false negative results, and anal swabs are recommended. The antibody level had no correlation with days after symptoms onset or the viral load of nasopharyngeal swabs, suggesting that the antibody level may also be affected by other factors.","output":"Analysis of viral load in different specimen types and serum antibody levels of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The distinct ways the COVID-19 pandemic has been unfolding in different countries and regions suggest that local societal and governmental structures play an important role not only for the baseline infection rate, but also for short and long-term reactions to the outbreak. We propose to investigate the question of how societies as a whole, and governments in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalization of the SIR model, the reactive SIR (short-term and long-term reaction) model. We posit that containment measures are equivalent to a feedback between the status of the outbreak and the reproduction factor. Short-term reaction to an outbreak corresponds in this framework to the reaction of governments and individuals to daily cases and fatalities. The reaction to the cumulative number of cases or deaths, and not to daily numbers, is captured in contrast by long-term reaction. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short and long-term control parameters. We find increased contributions of long-term control for countries and regions in which the outbreak was suppressed substantially together with a strong correlation between the strength of societal and governmental policies and the time needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, for numerous countries and regions we identified a predictive relation between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak of daily fatality counts, which allows to gauge the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks that should be expected after the peak. These results suggest that the proposed model is applicable not only for understanding the outbreak dynamics, but also for predicting future cases and fatalities once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty. Finally, we provide a web app (https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/covid-19/) with tools for visualising the phase space representation of real-world COVID-19 data and for exporting the preprocessed data for further analysis.","output":"Predicting the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks after the peak in daily fatalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In this review, we evaluate the role of liquid biopsy in managing lung cancer patients during the still ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) healthcare emergency. BACKGROUND: The novel influenza coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2) has upended several aspects of our lives, including medical activities. In this setting, many routine cancer diagnostic and therapeutic procedures have been suspended, leading to delays in diagnosis, treatments, and, ultimately, increases in cancer mortality rates. Equally drastic has been the impact of COVID-19 on clinical trials, many of which have been stalled or have never begun. This has left many patients who were hoping to receive innovative treatments in a limbo. Although, as of today, the introduction of drastic security measures has been crucially important to contain the pandemic, one cannot ignore the need to continue providing chronically ill patients all the health care they need, in terms of detection, prevention, and treatment. In these unprecedented times, liquid biopsy, more than ever before, may play a relevant role in the adequate management of these frail patients. METHODS: we performed a deep analysis of the recent international literature published in English on PUBMED in the last six months focused on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the management of lung cancer patients, focusing the attention on the role of liquid biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has significantly modified our lives and overall medical practice. In these unprecedented times, liquid biopsy may represent a valid and less time-consuming diagnostic approach than conventional tissue and cytological specimens.","output":"A narrative review on the implementation of liquid biopsy as a diagnostic tool in thoracic tumors during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Numerous concerns regarding maintenance of blood inventory have been raised after SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak. These concerns were based on the experience of blood centres in previous pandemics where shortage of blood components was reported. The present study had tried to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on blood collection and demand as well as the impact of disaster planning in maintaining an adequate inventory. METHODS: Data related to blood supply and demand were collected retrospectively using blood bank management software for pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 time period and compared. Strategies adopted and effects of changes in existing disaster plans to maintain an adequate inventory were studied. RESULTS: A drastic fall in the red cell inventory was observed as compared to pre-COVID-19 time period was observed due to disproportionate decrease in blood collection (1/6 to 1/9 of the previous collection) and demand (1/2 of the previous demand). The buffer stock fell gradually over a period of three weeks with cancellation of planned blood donation drives. A buffer stock equivalent to 2-week inventory led to adequate inventory in the initial lockdown periods. Similar fall was observed in the platelet inventory with reduction in the blood collection but almost a proportionate reduction in the platelet demand led to adequate inventory. No increase in wastage was observed for both red cells and platelets during this period. DISCUSSION: A buffer stock of blood and blood components, strict adherence to the transfusion triggers, good coordination with the clinical staff and a prospective review of blood transfusion requests to ensure rational blood transfusion were some of the steps which helped us to successfully maintain transfusion requirements in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of first-in-first-out policy prevented any wastage due to outdating of blood.","output":"Blood supply management in times of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - challenges, strategies adopted, and the lessons learned from the experience of a hospital-based blood centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compared to the traditional teaching (TT) method where students are lectured during class time, the flipped teaching (FT) design shifts lecture out of the classroom, as homework, and uses the class time to engage students in discussion, peer collaboration, and knowledge application. The COVID\\\\19 pandemic displaced students and teachers from classrooms around the world. In response to these alterations, universities emergently transitioned to online course offerings. In this study, the perceptions and attitudes towards emergency remote teaching for faculty using the FT method were compared to those practicing the TT method, A survey instrument was used to collect the experiences of both FT educators (FTEs; n=23) and TT educators (TTEs; n=18) during their transition to mandatory online teaching. It was hypothesized that the FTEs would experience a smoother transition to online teaching compared to TTEs because FTEs had access to previously developed resources such as lecture videos and engaging resources for students to utilize outside the classroom. Three researchers coded the participants responses to the survey questions and extracted common and recurring themes. It was found that 47% of FTEs reported a smooth transition to online teaching whereas only 17% of TTEs made a similar claim. Conversely, only 4% of FTEs reported having a difficult transition to online teaching compared to 33% of TTEs. Moreover, 100% of FTEs felt that at least one aspect of their flipped classroom helped them transition their course to the online platform. FTEs generally reported higher levels of confidence and experience with online teaching. These findings suggest that FTEs were more experienced with online teaching, had greater confidence in their skillset, and FT strategies supported their transition to emergency remote learning.

We hypothesized that altered systemic glucose metabolism as a consequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, contributes to TB pathogenesis, and when normalized with anti-glycemic drugs would improve clinical outcomes. To test this hypothesis, guinea pigs were treated daily with the anti-diabetic drug metformin starting 4 weeks prior or concurrent with aerosol exposure to the H37Rv strain of Mtb. In the chronic stages of infection, Mtb infected metformin-treated animals had restored systemic insulin sensitivity but remained glucose intolerant as determined by oral glucose tolerance testing. Despite persistent glucose intolerance, metformin-treated guinea pigs had a 2.8-fold reduction in lung lesion burden and a 0.7 log decrease in CFUs. An alternative hypothesis that metformin treatment improved clinical disease by having a direct effect on immune cell energy metabolism was tested using extracellular flux analysis and flow cytometry. The proinflammatory immune response to Mtb infection in untreated guinea pigs was associated with a marked increase in energy metabolism (glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which was normalized in metformin-treated guinea pigs. Moreover, both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes from Mtb infected, metformin treated animals maintained a more normal mitochondrial membrane potential while those isolated from untreated animals had persistent mitochondrial hyperpolarization. These data suggest that metformin promotes natural host resistance to Mtb infection by maintaining immune cell metabolic homeostasis and function during the chronic stages of active TB disease.","output":"Metformin enhances protection in guinea pigs chronically infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. During December 2020, the vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use among persons aged 18 years (1), which was adopted by CDC. During December 19, 2020-January 30, 2022, approximately 204 million doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were administered in the United States (2) as a primary series of 2 intramuscular doses (100 g [0.5 mL] each) 4 weeks apart. On January 31, 2022, FDA approved a Biologics License Application (BLA) for use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Spikevax, ModernaTX, Inc.) in persons aged 18 years (3). On February 4, 2022, the ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group conclusions regarding recommendations for the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were presented to ACIP at a public meeting. The Work Group's deliberations were based on the Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) Framework,* which incorporates the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach? to rank evidence quality. In addition to initial clinical trial data, ACIP considered new information gathered in the 12 months since issuance of the interim recommendations, including additional follow-up time in the clinical trial, real-world vaccine effectiveness studies, and postauthorization vaccine safety monitoring. ACIP also considered comparisons of mRNA vaccine effectiveness and safety in real-world settings when first doses were administered 8 weeks apart instead of the original intervals used in clinical trials (3 weeks for BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] COVID-19 vaccine and 4 weeks for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine). Based on this evidence, CDC has provided guidance that an 8-week interval might be optimal for some adolescents and adults. The additional information gathered since the issuance of the interim recommendations increased certainty that the benefits of preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death outweigh vaccine-associated risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

Herein, we report that VCAM-1 was a top upregulated adhesion molecule in the NASH mouse liver transcriptome. Open chromatin landscape profiling combined with genome-wide transcriptome analysis showed robust transcriptional upregulation of LSEC VCAM-1 in murine NASH. Moreover, LSEC VCAM-1 expression was significantly increased in human NASH. LSEC VCAM-1 expression was upregulated by palmitate treatment in vitro and reduced with inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase (MAP3K) mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3). Likewise, LSEC VCAM-1 expression was reduced in the Mlk3-/- mice with diet-induced NASH. Furthermore, VCAM-1 neutralizing Ab or pharmacological inhibition attenuated diet-induced NASH in mice, mainly via reducing the proinflammatory monocyte hepatic population as examined by mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Moreover, endothelium-specific Vcam1 knockout mice were also protected against NASH. In summary, lipotoxic stress enhances the expression of LSEC VCAM-1, in part, through MLK3 signaling.

In patients, symptoms such as fatigue, decreased physical, psychological, and cognitive function, and nutritional problems have been reported. How the disease has affected next of kin, as well as staff involved in the care of patients with covid-19, is also largely unknown. The overall aim of this study is therefore three-fold: (1) to describe and evaluate predictors of patient recovery, the type of rehabilitation received and patients experiences of specialized rehabilitation following COVID-19 infection; (2) to study how next of kin experienced the hospital care of their relative and their experiences of the psychosocial support they received as well as their psychological wellbeing; (3) to describe experiences of caring for patients with COVID-19 and evaluate psychological wellbeing, coping mechanisms and predictors for development of psychological distress over time in health care staff. METHODS: This observational longitudinal study consists of three cohorts; patients, next of kin, and health care staff. The assessments for the patients consist of physical tests (lung function, muscle strength, physical capacity) and questionnaires (communication and swallowing, nutritional status, hearing, activities of daily living, physical activity, fatigue, cognition) longitudinally at 3, 6 and 12 months. Patient records auditing (care, rehabilitation) will be done retrospectively at 12 months. Patients (3, 6 and 12 months), next of kin (6 months) and health care staff (baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months) will receive questionnaires regarding, health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, sleeping disorders, and post-traumatic stress. Staff will also answer questionnaires about burnout and coping strategies. Interviews will be conducted in all three cohorts. DISCUSSION: This study will be able to answer different research questions from a quantitative and qualitative perspective, by describing and evaluating long-term consequences and their associations with recovery, as well as exploring patients, next of kins and staffs views and experiences of the disease and its consequences.

We collected lung tissue samples from former smokers who underwent lung tissue resection. One hundred thirty samples from white subjects were included for this analysis. Regression models for sex as a predictor of methylation were adjusted for age, presence of COPD, smoking variables and technical batch variables revealed 710 associated sites. 294 sites demonstrated robust sex-specific methylation associations in foetal lung tissue.

Governments have taken several measures to work around this shortage: the FDA has become more liberal on the approval of Covid-19 tests in the US. In the UK emergency measures allowed to increase the daily number of locally produced test kits to 100,000. China has recently launched a massive test manufacturing program. However, all those efforts are very insufficient and many poor countries are still under threat. A popular method for reducing the number of tests consists in pooling samples, i.e. mixing patient samples and testing the mixed samples once. If all the samples are negative, pooling succeeds at a unitary cost. However, if a single sample is positive, failure does not indicate which patient is infected. This paper describes how to optimally detect infected patients in pools, i.e. using a minimal number of tests to precisely identify them, given the a priori probabilities that each of the patients is healthy. Those probabilities can be estimated using questionnaires, supervised machine learning or clinical examinations.

It is a common reason for presentations to an emergency department (ED) and frequently results in hospital admission, contributing to paediatric units approaching or exceeding capacity each winter. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the circulation of RSV was dramatically reduced in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Evidence from the Southern Hemisphere and other European countries suggests that as social distancing restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 are relaxed, RSV infection returns, causing delayed or even summer epidemics, with different age distributions. Study question: The ability to track, anticipate and respond to a surge in RSV cases is critical for planning acute care delivery. There is an urgent need to understand the onset of RSV spread at the earliest opportunity. This will influence service planning, to inform clinicians whether the population at risk is a wider age range than normal, and whether there are changes in disease severity. This information is also needed to inform decision on the timing of passive immunisation of children at higher risk of hospitalisation, intensive care admission or death with RSV infection, which is a public health priority. Methods and likely impact: This multi-centre prospective observational cohort study will use a well-established research network (Paediatric Emergency Research in the UK and Ireland, PERUKI) to report in real time cases of RSV infection in children aged under two years, through the collection of essential, but non-identifying patient information.

The live and killed vaccines are available for the prevention of infection in the market, but the drug for the treatment is not available. Nitazoxanide (NTZ), a member of thiazolides, is an antiparasitic drug. In the present study, the effect of NTZ on the NDV replication was explored.

The inhibition of the NDV was observed upon post-treatment of NTZ at a concentration of 12.5 M. Cytokine profiling of the DF-1, PBMC, and chicken embryonic tissue treated with NTZ revealed significant upregulation in all the cytokines studied except for IL-1 in DF-1 cells. It is plausible that NTZ is involved in causing immune-modulatory effects in poultry. NTZ treatment in two weeks old chicken showed significant reduction in NDV replication in trachea, and lungs, respectively, at 72 h post-infection.

Among those with minor comorbidities, persistent respiratory abnormalities, fatigue, dyspnea, and headache were common, and mental health symptoms emerged by 1-2 mo postinfection.DISCUSSION: After presumed recovery from mild COVID-19, a range of symptoms can persist and later emerge. Whether these are new or previously unrecognized is unclear. Under-recognized COVID-19 sequelae may increase the risk of subtle or sudden incapacitation and have implications for return-to-work (RTW) screening and surveillance for safety-critical roles.Tucci V, Saary J.

Current diagnostic methods can be affected by supply chain bottlenecks and require the assistance of medical professionals, impeding the implementation of large-scale testing. Self-collection of saliva may solve these problems, as it can be completed without specialized training and uses generic materials. METHODS: We observed 30 individuals who self-collected saliva using four different collection devices and analyzed their feedback. Two of these devices, a funnel and bulb pipette, were used to evaluate at-home saliva collection by 60 individuals. SARS-CoV-2-spiked saliva samples were subjected to temperature cycles designed to simulate the conditions the samples might be exposed to during the summer and winter seasons and sensitivity of detection was evaluated. RESULTS: All devices enabled the safe, unsupervised self-collection of saliva. The quantity and quality of the samples received were acceptable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing, as determined by human RNase P detection. There was no significant difference in SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene (N1) detection between the freshly spiked samples and those incubated with the summer and winter profiles. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate inexpensive, generic, buffer free collection devices suitable for unsupervised and home saliva self-collection.

Methods of assessing asymmetry have been inconsistent and focused on the analysis of jumping asymmetry. Dual ground reaction forces are prevalent in athlete monitoring, though underutilized in asymmetry research. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of countermovement jump (CMJ) impulse asymmetry to performance in collegiate soccer athletes. Male and female athletes were selected from an ongoing athlete research repository database of NCAA D-I soccer athletes. All athletes contributed two maximal effort unweighted (CMJ0) and weighted countermovement jumps (CMJ20) using the mean for calculations. Propulsive phase asymmetry scores (PrPAS) and positive impulse asymmetry scores (PIAS) were calculated to determine the magnitude of asymmetry for each prospective phase. Statistically significant correlations were found between CMJ0 jump height and unweighted PIAS (r = -0.43) in females. Males had statistically significant correlations between CMJ20 jump height and weighted PIAS (r = -0.49). Neither unweighted PrPAS nor weighted PrPAS produced statistically significant correlations (r < 0.26) to their prospective jump heights. When assessing CMJ asymmetry, it is recommended to conduct both weighted and unweighted CMJ testing, utilizing PIAS as the metric to be assessed.","output":"Positive Impulse Phase versus Propulsive Impulse Phase: Correlations between Asymmetry and Countermovement Jump Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Physician treatment preferences for early stage, estrogen positive breast cancer (ER + BC) patients were evaluated during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US when neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) was recommended to allow safe deferral of surgery. METHODS: A validated electronic survey was administered May-June, 2020 to US medical oncologists (MO), radiation oncologists (RO), and surgeons (SO) involved in clinical trials organizations. Questions on NET use included practice patterns for locoregional management following NET. RESULTS: 114 Physicians from 29 states completed the survey-42 (37%) MO, 14 (12%) RO, and 58 (51%) SO. Before COVID-19, most used NET 'rarely' (49/107, 46%) or 'sometimes' (36, 33%) for ER + BC. 46% would delay surgery 2 months without NET. The preferred NET regimen was tamoxifen for premenopausal and aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women. 53% planned short term NET until surgery could proceed. Most recommended omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for one micrometastatic node after 1, 2, or 3 months of NET (1 month, N = 56/93, 60%; 2 months, N = 54/92, 59%; 3 months, N = 48/90, 53%). With longer duration of NET, omission of ALND decreased, regardless of years in practice, percent of practice in BC, practice type, participation in multidisciplinary tumor board, or number of regional COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: More physicians preferred NET for ER + BC during the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic times. As the duration of NET extended, more providers favored ALND in low volume metastatic axillary disease. The Covid-19 pandemic affected practice of ER + BC; it remains to be seen how this may impact outcomes.","output":"Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy use in early stage breast cancer during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"\\"...but why think? Why not try the experiment?...\\" John Hunter (1728-1793), in a letter to Edward Jenner. August 2nd, 1775. When Galen of Pergamum (2nd c. A.D.), physician, philosopher and experimentalist, sought to ascertain the therapeutic properties of Theriac, an antidote of repute against poisons, he resorted to an experiment. Theriac or Theriaca was a compound drug, containing in some versions used in antiquity numerous components; Galen's own composition included over 70 ingredients! One of its uses was as an antidote against snakebites, a frequent peril for the Roman armies marching on in sandals. Galen spent most of his life in Rome and was elevated to Imperial Physician at the court of Marcus Aurelius, who apparently took daily doses of Theriac, which among other components included opium. Describing the experiment to his friend Pison, Galen wrote, \\"as I could not possibly conduct a trial on humans, I experimented on roosters\\" For his experiment, Galen, studied two groups of roosters, but he doesn't tell us how many animals he included in each category. Both groups were exposed to poisonous snakebites. All roosters who were fed with theriac prior to exposure to viper bites survived, whereas in the second group that had not received prophylactic Theriac, all roosters died. Not only is Galen's methodology remarkable, preceding the modern randomised trial by eighteen centuries, but more importantly, it is notable for his ethical stance at a time when sensitivities about human rights, prevalent in our times, were largely absent in societies of widespread slavery. For example, Mithridates VI (132-63 BC), the King of Pontus who is credited with the first use of Theriac, tested its efficacy on criminals and slaves. For his experiment Galen used the random allocation of treatment, today's prospective randomised clinical trial, implemented in the evaluation of novel therapies, widely used internationally, particularly in cancer research! This experimental method used for ascertaining the efficacy of new drugs became established after the second half of the 20th century and is now firmly entrenched as a research tool. On the other hand, the retrieval of information from observational studies or non-randomised series is considered scientifically inferior and is often dismissed or ignored as irrelevant or anecdotal. Such is the compulsion for the randomised study that in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, respected physicians and scientists appeared in the media hesitant to recommend the use of protective facial masks, as there was no evidence of benefit for their use from prospective randomised studies in the general population! Logic had no place in the argument! COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 new corona virus, brought to the fore the randomised trial, as well as, the ethical dilemmas that surround the allocation of treatment at random, in the face of a devastating pandemic. Anthony Fauci, distinguished infectious diseases expert and an adviser to the President of the USA, at a recent briefing from the Situation Room of the White House, endorsed categorically and unreservedly the randomised trial for the evaluation of drugs potentially effective against SARS-CoV-2, in patients afflicted with COVID-19. A few days later on April 8th, 2020, Professor Sotiris Tsiodras, scientific advisor to the Greek Government for COVID-19 and an expert on infectious diseases, when asked by a journalist about chloroquine, he responded, \\"Antony Fauci is correct. Nevertheless, we give the drug to everyone, that is, not half of the patients will receive it, and the other half will not\\". If we accept that the randomised trial represents the unique, impregnable method of evaluating new treatments-several clinicians dispute this dogma. -the question arises how will treatments be allocated to patients? According to the Declaration of Helsinki participation of a subject in a clinical trial requires their explicit written consent. Will, a potentially hypoxic patient rapidly deteriorating, be able to understand what is being asked of them, and will that patient be in a position to provide consent? And if that patient refuses to be randomised, what are the options? Is it his/her right to request the active treatment that a fellow patient is receiving in the next bed? Although the Declaration of Helsinki allows the option of no treatment or even placebo, where no known treatment is available for a certain condition, such as COVID-19, it also emphasizes that \\"while the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects\\". Consider now the physicians and nurses on the first line of the battle against the pandemic; to the enormous pressures and risks that they experience daily, they may have to endure the added psychological burden of the randomised trial, knowing that half of their patients are receiving the promising drug, whilst the other half are denied the chance of potential benefit. When during the Medical Research Council's randomized trial of streptomycin, one senior physician contracted tuberculosis, the Medical Research Council obtained supplies for him outside the trial. In this brief instance of medical history, the equipoise, the scientific imperative, all arguments and other justifications for providing treatment at random, were thrown out of the window in favour of the human factor! Why is randomization necessary? Because-it is presumed-the process of randomising subjects, protects the study from the selective inclusion of patients with favourable characteristics, thus inadvertently allowing or facilitating a falsely favourable result for the drug or treatment under investigation. However, the process of randomising patients does not necessarily result in the randomisation of the characteristics of their disease. Exactly because of this, at the end of a randomised study, even if the prognostic variables are evenly represented and balanced in the strata, further confirmation of the result is sought with a statistical multifactorial analysis. Such multifactorial analyses can also be applied to a non-randomised group of patients engaged in the trial of a new drug. Since the middle of the 20th century a generation of physicians have been trained to dismiss, or are incapable of evaluating the validity of a treatment beyond the established etiquette of the randomised study. This, some have argued, constitutes intellectual indolence, it is not scientific robustness. Pandits foresee that the world will be different after the end of this pandemic. Perhaps human ingenuity will seek new investigative methods that will render the randomised clinical trial obsolete, both, on methodological and ethical grounds. Until then and even if we have to accept the scientific supremacy of the randomised study in the evaluation of novel therapies, the ethical considerations in the unprecedented circumstances of a relentless pandemic demand a more humane approach, befitting the beneficent precepts of the Hippocratic tradition.","output":"Clinical trials and the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the reason for this ongoing pandemic infection diseases termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has emerged since early December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.

In the hospital environment, certain high-risk procedures have the potential to cause transmission of the virus to health-care workers and nosocomial transmission to patients through different mechanisms including the generation of aerosols and fomite formation via contamination of medical devices.Areas covered: Aerosol-generating procedures such as bronchoscopy are considered high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. As a result, single-use devices should be used where possible and changing to single-use flexible bronchoscopes has been advised by respiratory societies internationally. In this paper, we outline the rationale for this advice and have analyzed the evidence relating to the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission arising from a switch to these single-use devices and the potential impact that this switch may have on the quality of pulmonology services.Expert opinion: In this paper, we outline the rationale for this advice and have analyzed the evidence relating to the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission arising from a switch to these single-use devices and the potential impact that this switch may have on the quality of pulmonology services.","output":"Can single-use bronchoscopes help prevent nosocomial COVID-19 infections?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We assessed the impact of COVID-19 infection on cardiovascular events in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD) referred to stress single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPS). METHODS: A total of 960 consecutive patients with suspected or known CAD were submitted by referring physicians to stress MPS for assessment of myocardial ischemia between January 2018 and June 2019. All patients underwent stress-optional rest MPS. Perfusion defects were quantitated as % of LV myocardium and expressed as total perfusion defect (TPD), representing the defect extent and severity. A TPD  5% was considered abnormal. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 27 months (range 4C38) 31 events occurred. Moreover, 55 (6%) patients had a COVID-19 infection. The median time from index MPS to COVID-19 infection was 16 months (range 6C24). At Cox multivariable analysis, abnormal MPS and COVID-19 infection resulted as independent predictors of events. There were no significant differences in annualized event rate in COVID-19 patients with or without abnormal MPS (p = 0.56). Differently, in patients without COVID-19, the presence of abnormal MPS was associated with higher event rate (p < .001). Patients with infection compared to those without had a higher event rate in the presence of both normal and abnormal TPD.

Trained staff followed up participants for two weeks by a Telephone number, and the outcome was recorded. Result: Up to 13 June, 41,498 patients recruited and their data were analyzed;the incidence of COVID-19 was 27.5% (95% CI: 27.1, 28.2). Among the participants with the positive test, 93.2% of them, treated by outpatient basis or discharged, 2.1% were hospitalized, and the case fatality rate (CFR) was 4.8%. Khansar and Aradestan was the hotspot of COVID-19 and had the highest incidence among cities of Isfahan province.

In this work, however, we studied a case which may be opposite to this intuition. The prototypical phase change material, GeTe, undergoes the phase transition from the rhombohedral structure to a more symmetric cubic one at a625 K. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that even in the cubic phase, the lattice is constructed by random short and long bonds, instead of bonds with a uniform length. Such bifurcation of the bond lengths enabled by Peierls-like distortion persists in the entire temperature range (0-900 K), yet with different degrees of disorder, e.g., the atoms are distorted along a certain direction in the rhombohedral phase (i.e., structural order) but the distortion varies stochastically in terms of direction and amplitude at high T (i.e., structural disorder). A more symmetric lattice frame coexisting with severe local structural disorder is the signature of this cubic GeTe. Our simulations have provided a theoretical support on the disordered Peierls-like distortion in the high-T cubic phase discovered earlier by X-ray experiments. By modulating the physical properties that different degrees of disorder may induce, we are able to design better functional materials for various applications in electronic and photonic devices.","output":"Structural disorder in the high-temperature cubic phase of GeTe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is expected that families will take care of their children until such time as they can care for themselves, and then families will also care for their aging relatives when these elders can no longer do so.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the attitude of nursing students, should they be faced with severe acute respiratory syndrome patients during their future work. RESEARCH DESIGN: A questionnaire survey was carried out to examine the attitude among final-year nursing students to three ethical areas, namely, duty of care, resource allocation, and collateral damage. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was carried out in accordance with the requirements and recommendations of the Central Research and Ethics Committee, School of Health Sciences at Caritas Institute of Higher Education. FINDINGS: Complete responses from 102 subjects were analyzed. The overwhelming majority (96.1%) did not agree to participate in the intubation of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients if protective measures, that is, N95 mask and gown, were not available. If there were insufficient N95 masks for all the medical, nursing, and allied health workers in the hospital (resource allocation), 37.3% felt that the distribution of N95 masks should be by casting lot, while the rest disagreed. When asked about collateral damage, more than three-quarters (77.5%) said that severe acute respiratory syndrome patients should be admitted to intensive care unit. There was sex difference in nursing students' attitude toward severe acute respiratory syndrome care during pregnancy and influence of age in understanding intensive care unit care for these patients. Interestingly, 94.1% felt that there should be a separate intensive care unit for severe acute respiratory syndrome patients. CONCLUSION: As infection control practice and isolation facilities improved over the years, relevant knowledge and nursing ethical issues related to infectious diseases should become part of nursing education and training programs, especially in preparation for outbreaks of infectious diseases or distress.","output":"Student nurses' ethical views on responses to the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of review A recent American Academy of Neurology Evidence-Based Practice Guideline on vestibular myogenic evoked potential (VEMP) testing has described superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) and evaluated the merits of VEMP in its diagnosis.

Minimum procedural guarantees have been strengthened under the 2021 WADA Code and the International Standard for Results Management. However, implementation of these guarantees by National Anti-Doping Organizations (NADOs) and domestic anti-doping panels are critical in ensuring that athletes are afforded procedural fairness. While some countries have enacted reforms in anti-doping dispute resolution infrastructure, other jurisdictions are arguably lagging behind. Since few doping disputes are heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), a strong domestic dispute resolution framework should encourage independence, efficiency and cost-effectiveness, as well as promote consistency and procedural fairness at all levels of hearing. First instance hearings are particularly significant given that CAS is not considered a practical option for many athletes, especially those from developing countries, predominately due to challenges of access to justice and affordability. Irrespective of procedurally unfair decisions at first instance, CAS has the de novo right of review to correct any such irregularities. However, this approach alone is inadequate, especially given that most athletes do not appeal to CAS. CAS, WADA and NADOs all have significant roles to play in ensuring procedural fairness for athletes. WADA and NADOs need to do more to ensure compliance with procedural guarantees at first instance. This paper advances the debate on the importance of procedural fairness and proposes a research agenda to support future reform, arguing that the current anti-doping model needs to reconsider how these important standards are upheld, from first instance until final appeal.","output":"A level playing field in anti-doping disputes?

For a two-patch model with one high prevalence patch and one low prevalence patch, results pertaining to the dependence of ?(0) on the travel rates between the two patches are obtained. For parameter values relevant for influenza, these results show that, while banning travel of infectives from the low to the high prevalence patch always contributes to disease control, banning travel of symptomatic travelers only from the high to the low prevalence patch could adversely affect the containment of the outbreak under certain ranges of parameter values. Moreover, banning all travel of infected individuals from the high to the low prevalence patch could result in the low prevalence patch becoming diseasefree, while the high prevalence patch becomes even more disease-prevalent, with the resulting number of infectives in this patch alone exceeding the combined number of infectives in both patches without border control.

While the CC lines are phenotypically diverse, their genetic diversity in drug disposition processes, such as detoxification reactions, is still largely uncharacterized. Here we systematically measured RNA-sequencing expression profiles from livers of 29 CC lines under baseline conditions. We then leveraged a reference collection of metabolic biotransformation pathways to map potential relations between drugs and their underlying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). By applying this approach on proximal eQTLs, including eQTLs acting on the overall expression of genes and on the expression of particular transcript isoforms, we were able to construct the organization of hepatic eQTL-drug connectivity across the CC population. The analysis revealed a substantial impact of genetic variation acting on drug biotransformation, allowed mapping of potential joint genetic effects in the context of individual drugs, and demonstrated crosstalk between drug metabolism and lipid metabolism.

METHODS: The clinical data of 420 patients with hydatid disease who were treated in our hospital from October 2015 to October 2018 were collected from the database of our hospital. According to the postoperative pathological diagnosis, 200 patients were assigned into the alveolar echinococcosis (AE) group, and 220 patients were assigned into the cystic echinococcosis (CE) group. A total of 160 healthy examinees were enrolled as the control group. The main observation indexes included preoperative PLR and NLR. Pearsons correlation was used to analyze the correlation between PLR and NLR with clinical indicators in HE patients, and the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the clinical values of PLR and NLR in diagnosing different types of hydatid diseases. RESULTS: The results revealed that the expressions of PLR and NLR were significantly higher in the AE group than in the CE and control groups (P<0.05). The results of multiple linear regression analysis revealed that PLR was positively correlated with aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and -glutamyltranspeptidase (P<0.05). NLR was correlated with albumin content (P<0.05). ROC curve analysis results revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of PLR and NLR for AE was 0.800 and 0.700 respectively, and the AUC for CE was 0.78 and 0.75 respectively. CONCLUSION: The NLR and PLR of AE patients were higher than those of CE patients, and the high inflammation of CE patients may be correlated to the reproductive mode of Echinococcus multilocularis.

While the reduction of total physical activity is assumed to negatively impact psychological health (higher stress and anxiety levels), regular sports activity during lockdown conditions has beneficial effects on health. Mechanisms are however unclear. The present analysis therefore examined the associations of sports activity with mental health, and assessed whether this is due to a direct effect on experiencing positive emotions and mental health, due to a stress-buffering mechanism, and/or through protecting/enhancing resilience. Methods An online survey, accessible from April 7th to April 30th 2020, gathered data on sports activity (Physical Activity, Exercise, and Sport Questionnaire, BSA), mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire-4, PHQ-4, WHO Wellbeing Index, WHO-5), momentary stress (single item), and resilience (i.e. feeling determined, cheerful, content, and being interested in the things one is doing). The final data set comprised 742 subjects including 534 (72.0%) women and ranging in age from 16 to 83 years (mean: 28.13  11.46 years). Results Across all participants, sports activity was related to higher wellbeing and resilience but lower affective psychopathology. Importantly, all coefficients were below 0.2 indicating only small-sized associations. Moderation analyses confirmed a direct effect of sports activity on affective symptoms and wellbeing. Stress-buffering effects were not confirmed for either outcome but a resilience-protecting effect was seen for both wellbeing and affective psychopathology. Conclusions During the initial phase of the first COVID-19 lockdown, sports activity was associated with better mental health and wellbeing. Besides this direct effect, there was also evidence for a resilience-protecting effect of sport. The assumed stress-buffering effect could not be confirmed.

However, their elicitation in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. We have hypothesized that HIV-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of the highly conserved epitopes of such antibodies by using holes (absence or very weak binding to these epitopes of germline antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an efficient immune response) in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. To begin to test this hypothesis we have designed germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to b12, 2G12 and 2F5 as well as to X5, m44 and m46 which are cross-reactive but with relatively weak neutralizing activity as natively occurring antibodies due to size and/or other effects. The germline-like X5, m44 and m46 bound with relatively high affinity to all tested Envs. In contrast, germline-like b12, 2G12 and 2F5 lacked measurable binding to Envs in an ELISA assay although the corresponding mature antibodies did. These results provide initial evidence that Env structures containing conserved vulnerable epitopes may not initiate humoral responses by binding to germline antibodies. Even if such responses are initiated by very weak binding undetectable in our assay it is likely that they will be outcompeted by responses to structures containing the epitopes of X5, m44, m46, and other antibodies that bind germline BCRs with much higher affinity/avidity. This hypothesis, if further supported by data, could contribute to our understanding of how HIV-1 evades immune responses and offer new concepts for design of effective vaccine immunogens.","output":"Germline-like predecessors of broadly neutralizing antibodies lack measurable binding to HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins: implications for evasion of immune responses and design of vaccine immunogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Wuhan coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, and the disease it causes, COVID-19, are declared as a global pandemic thus breaking havoc on lives and economies around the world The extent of the outbreak of COVID-2019, which was discovered quite recently, and its massive impact on lives, societies as well as the economies of the affected countries is unprecedented Cases of COVID -19 infection have so far been reported in 212 countries and territories where more than 71 2 million individuals have been affected till December 2020, resulting in more than 1 6 million deaths Both, outside and inside China all around the world, COVID-19 is transmitted via human-to-human transmission,which has resulted in such a global outcome To decrease the cases all the affected countries were under lockdown and eventhoug the cases were incresed dramaticlly However, all the dailly activiets were moved to a virtual reality which adds more impact to investigate the future of the virtual reallity and its great impact during this hard time This paper presents a critical study on the outbreak of COVID-19 by providing an analysis on the confirmed cases at Corona's first wave along with discussing the impact of the disease on social lives and economies all around the world","output":"The emergence of covid-19 and its pandemic potentialas a global health security threat and its effect on future life strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, case reports have suggested that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may lead to adverse outcomes.

Rapid and selective methods to detect Salmonella bacteria can prevent outbreaks when ingesting contaminated food. Nanobiosensors are a highly sensitive, simple, faster, and lower cost method for the rapid detection of Salmonella, an alternative to conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. This study systematically searched and analyzed literature data related to nucleic acid-based nanobiosensors (NABs) with nanomaterials to detect Salmonella in food, retrieved from three databases, published between 2010 and 2021. We extracted data and critically analyzed the effect of nanomaterial functionalized with aptamer or DNA at the limit of detection (LOD). Among the nanomaterials, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were the most used nanomaterial in studies due to their unique optical properties of the metal, followed by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) of Fe(3)O(4), copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), and also hybrid nanomaterials multiwalled carbon nanotubes (c-MWCNT/AuNP), QD/UCNP-MB (quantum dotes upconverting nanoparticle of magnetic beads), and cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe QDs@MNPs) showed excellent LOD values. The transducers used for detection also varied from electrochemical, fluorescent, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), RAMAN spectroscopy, and mainly colorimetric due to the possibility of visualizing the detection result with the naked eye. Furthermore, we show the magnetic separation system capable of detecting the target amplification of the genetic material. Finally, we present perspectives, future research, and opportunities to use point-of-care (POC) diagnostic devices as a faster and lower cost approach for detecting Salmonella in food as they prove to be viable for resource-constrained environments such as field-based or economically limited conditions.","output":"Nucleic Acid-Based Nanobiosensor (NAB) Used for Salmonella Detection in Foods: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Online teaching and assessments have been introduced in dental education for the 1st time during the corona pandemic.

Mutations in TP53 not only impair its antitumor activity, but also confer mutant p53 protein oncogenic properties. The p53-targeted therapy approach began with the identification of compounds capable of restoring/reactivating wild-type p53 functions or eliminating mutant p53. Treatments that directly target mutant p53 are extremely structure and drug-species-dependent. Due to the mutation of wild-type p53, multiple survival pathways that are normally maintained by wild-type p53 are disrupted, necessitating the activation of compensatory genes or pathways to promote cancer cell survival. Additionally, because the oncogenic functions of mutant p53 contribute to cancer proliferation and metastasis, targeting the signaling pathways altered by p53 mutation appears to be an attractive strategy. Synthetic lethality implies that while disruption of either gene alone is permissible among two genes with synthetic lethal interactions, complete disruption of both genes results in cell death. Thus, rather than directly targeting p53, exploiting mutant p53 synthetic lethal genes may provide additional therapeutic benefits. Additionally, research progress on the functions of noncoding RNAs has made it clear that disrupting noncoding RNA networks has a favorable antitumor effect, supporting the hypothesis that targeting noncoding RNAs may have potential synthetic lethal effects in cancers with p53 mutations. The purpose of this review is to discuss treatments for cancers with mutant p53 that focus on directly targeting mutant p53, restoring wild-type functions, and exploiting synthetic lethal interactions with mutant p53. Additionally, the possibility of noncoding RNAs acting as synthetic lethal targets for mutant p53 will be discussed.","output":"Targeting mutant p53 for cancer therapy: direct and indirect strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Africa, while most countries report some COVID-19 cases, the fraction of reported patients is low, with about 20,000 cases compared to the more than 2.3 million cases reported globally as of April 18, 2020. Few African countries have reported case numbers above one thousand, with South Africa reporting 3,034 cases being hit hardest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Several African countries, especially South Africa, have already taken strong non-pharmaceutical interventions that include physical distancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced human mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of such interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing interests in most African countries: strongly limited health care capacities and testing capabilities largely conflict with pressured national economies and socio-economic hardships on the individual level, limiting compliance to intervention targets. Here we investigate implications of interventions on the COVID-19 outbreak dynamics, focusing on South Africa before and after the national lockdown enacted on March 27, 2020. Our analysis shows that initial exponential growth of existing case numbers is consistent with doubling times of about 2.5 days. After lockdown, the growth remains exponential, now with doubling times of 18 days, but still in contrast to subexponential growth reported for Hubei/China after lockdown. Moreover, a scenario analysis of a computational data-driven agent based mobility model for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (with 1.14 million inhabitants) hints that keeping current levels of intervention measures and compliance until the end of April is of insufficient length and still too weak, too unspecific or too inconsistently complied with to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring, slightly stronger, more specific interventions combined with sufficient compliance may constitute a viable option for interventions for regions in South Africa and potentially for large parts of the African continent and the Global South.","output":"COVID-19 in Africa -- outbreak despite interventions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is significant to precisely isolate potential active compounds from medicinal herbs containing multiple compounds.

First, representative alkaloids from RCY were docked with LSD1 for screening active skeleton compounds. Simultaneously, the crude extract of RCY was preliminarily separated via pH-zone refining CCC. Subsequently, guided by LC-MS/MS analysis of the fragmentation pathways, three potential active fractions were obtained, followed by further online-storage and recycling CCC separation. Finally, three high-purity target quaternary alkaloids compound 3 (dehydrocorydaline), 7 (coptisine), and 8 (columbamine) were successfully isolated as a new class of potential natural LSD1 inhibitors by only one CCC instrument with multiple modes. Compound 3, with the highest LSD1 inhibition ratio of 2.44 M, was tested for its ability to inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis in U2OS cells. Therefore, the CCC separation guided by virtual screening is a promising method for the targeted isolation of enzyme inhibitors from medicinal herbs.","output":"Precise separation of lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitors from Corydalis yanhusuo using multi-mode counter-current chromatography guided by virtual screening."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: ESports is a new trend of sports, which has gained considerable popularity worldwide.

Bacterial and Fungal co-infections increase the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. AIM: To study the bacterial profile in patients with COVID-19 who needed admission to receive treatment in the main centres concerned with managing COVID-19 disease in the Kingdom of Bahrain. METHODS: The study was a retrospective observational analysis of the bacterial profile and the bacterial resistance in patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease who needed admission to receive treatment in the main centres assigned to manage patients with COVID-19 disease in the Kingdom of Bahrain from February to October 2020. We used the electronic patients records and the microbiology laboratory data to identify patients demographics, clinical data, microbial profile, hospital or community-acquired, and the outcomes. RESULTS: The study included 1380 patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 disease during the study period. 51% were admitted from February to June, and 49% were admitted from July to October 2020, with a recurrence rate was 0.36%. There was a significant increase in bacterial and fungal co-infection in the second period compared to the first period. The most common isolated organisms were the gram-negative bacteria (mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli), the gram-positive bacteria (mainly coagulase negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and fungaemia (Candida galabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida parapsilosis, Aspergillus niger). The hospital-acquired infection formed 73.8%, 61.6%, 100% gram-negative, gram-positive and fungaemia. Most of the hospital-acquired infection occurred in the second period with a higher death rate than community-acquired infections. CONCLUSION: Bacterial and fungal co-infections in patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 disease pose higher morbidity and mortality risks than those without co-infections.

This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian nonlinear mixed model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectory. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for infections and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluate forecasting accuracy on a two-week holdout set, finding that the model predicts COVID-19 cases and deaths well, with a mean absolute scaled error of 0.40 for cases and 0.32 for deaths throughout the two-week evaluation period. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Ohio, and Mississippi.

The virus is called SARS-CoV-2, and the virus-induced disease is called COVID-19. The infection spreads via droplets or direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Airborne transmission occurs during aerosol-generating procedures on patients. Many otologic procedures are considered AGPs and therefore require precautions to protect staff and patients and minimize transmission of the disease. MAIN BODY: Outpatient otology activity has seen changes, including virtual clinics and limitation of face-to-face consultations, to ensure safety. Powered instrumentation should be avoided during surgical procedures unless necessary or replaced with other tools, and if performed, enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) must be used. Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination is recommended for any patient with full PPE in place except for consultations done without examination. Systemic steroid administration for treating conditions such as Bells palsy and sudden sensorineural hearing loss should be discussed with both the patient and infectious diseases specialist to weigh risks against benefits. Triaging of patients and prioritization is unavoidable during the pandemic and even after due to the limitations of clinic and theater time. All emergency/urgent cases are considered potentially COVID-19 positive. For the semi-urgent and all elective cases, COVID-19 testing 48 h prior to surgery, strict quarantine awaiting test results, and repeat testing on day of surgery if rapid tests are available are the precautions suggested. Different measures should be in place to minimize staff potential exposure intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Otology practice has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to technical limitations, the reported positive rates of qRT-PCR assay of throat swab samples vary from 30 to 60%. Therefore, the evaluation of alternative strategies to overcome the limitations of qRT-PCR is required. A previous study reported that one-step nested (OSN)-qRT-PCR revealed better suitability for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, information on the analytical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR is insufficient. METHOD: In this study, we aimed to analyze OSN-qRT-PCR by comparing it with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and qRT-PCR by using a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA and a quality assessment panel. The clinical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR was also validated and compared with ddPCR and qRT-PCR using specimens from COVID-19 patients.

The SARS crisis severely challenged not only the medical skills of nurses, but also their professional commitment. DESIGN Survey. METHODS This study was conducted between August-December 2005, in Taiwan. Data were collected by structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed by post to 8056 nurses nationwide; 2833 nurses completed and returned the questionnaire for a valid response rate of 39%. RESULTS The results showed that knowledge sharing correlated positively with professional commitment but negatively with the impact of SARS. Professional commitment negatively correlated with SARS impact (r = -0.074, p < 0.001); however, as knowledge sharing was a controlled variable, the partial correlation between SARS impact and professional commitment was -0.039 with a p-value of 0.045, indicating virtual insignificance. That is, knowledge sharing was an antecedent variable for both SARS impact and professional commitment. CONCLUSION This cross-sectional study provides preliminary evidence that knowledge sharing is significantly correlated with impact of SARS and professional commitment of nursing personnel.

RESULTS Overall, reperfusion was successful in 75.8% (47/62) of CRS patients, and a good clinical outcome at 90 days was observed in 17.7%. The CA group showed a higher rate of successful reperfusion (89.3% vs 64.7%, P=0.025) shorter procedure time (22 vs 42 min; P=0.029), higher rate of first pass effect (35.7% vs 11.8%, P=0.025), and lower number of passes (1 vs 3, P=0.023) when compared with the SR group.

This problem is particularly severe in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries because of shortages in certain medical disciplines, due to a lack of nationally-trained professionals and a less developed educational system compared to other high income countries. Consequently, GCC countries are heavily dependent on an expatriate health care workforce; a problem exacerbated by high turnover. We discuss challenges and potential strategies for improving and strengthening capacity building efforts in health care professions in the GCC. MAIN TEXT: In the GCC, there are 139 schools providing professional health education in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, midwifery, and other specialties. Health education school density reported for the GCC countries ranges between 2.2 and 2.8 schools per one million inhabitants, except in Oman where it is 4.0 per one million inhabitants. The GCC countries rely heavily on expatriate health professionals. The number of physicians and nurses in the GCC countries are 2.1 and 4.5 per 1000 respectively, compared to 2.8 and 7.9 among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Interestingly, the number of dentists and pharmacists is higher in the GCC countries compared to OECD countries. A nationally trained health care workforce is essential for the GCC countries. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are two identified areas where growth and development are recommended. Custom-tailored continuing medical education and continuing professional development (CPD) programs can augment the skills of health practitioners, and allow for the expansion of their scope of practice when warranted.

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A literature review was conducted to identify the ethical and regulatory challenges of DCT. The review showed that, with few exceptions, the publications on DCT have been written by IT experts, researchers or representatives of the pharma industry. There are hardly any independent or multidisciplinary analyses of DCT, e.g., by ethicists, medical sociologists or patients. This suggests that, currently, the potential advantages of digitized clinical research are still to be tested empirically and confirmed independently.

In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated. Examples discussed include the lipocalins, human  1B-glycoprotein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the globins.","output":"Amino acid substitution matrices from an information theoretic perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was aggressively expanding throughout the world, and no effective vaccines and drugs are available Giant pharmaceutical industries and researchers use computer intelligence coupled with bioinformatics knowledge to accelerate the development process of designing an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a time-consuming, complicated, intricate, and complex process Supercomputers are used to give power to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) assistance for structural modeling of unresolved protein, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) of the modeled protein structure, target finding, selection of B and T cell epitopes and simulations study for vaccine development In this chapter, we described an in-depth overview on the use and impact of various revolutionary and game-changing technology of computer intelligence like AI and ML which with the guide of computational biology, bioinformatics, structural biology, and genomics paved the way in understanding, design, and development of vaccines at a much diminished time and minimal cost Various software and tools used in the developmental process are also consolidated here Finally, the limitations and future prospects of overcoming the global crisis and tackling pandemics with the help of computational intelligence are speculated here ? 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Computational Intelligence in Vaccine Design Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infection, is currently spreading worldwide, causing the worst pandemic experienced this century.

In this study, feasibility of a non-invasive gentamicin TDM strategy using saliva was investigated. METHODS This was a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study including 54 neonates. Any neonate treated with intravenous gentamicin was eligible for the study. Up to 8 saliva samples were collected per patient at different time-points. Gentamicin levels in saliva were determined with liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed using Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Modeling (NONMEM) to describe the relation between gentamicin concentrations in saliva and plasma. Monte Carlo simulations with a representative virtual cohort (N=3000) were performed to evaluate the probability of target attainment with saliva- versus plasma TDM. RESULTS Plasma PK was adequately described with an earlier published model. An additional saliva compartment describing the salivary gentamicin concentrations was appended to the model with first-order input (k13 0.023 h-1 ) and first-order elimination (k30 0.169 h-1 ). Inter-individual variability of k30 was 38%. Postmenstrual age (PMA) correlated negatively with both k13 and k30 . Simulations demonstrated that TDM with 4 saliva samples was accurate in 81% of the simulated cases versus 94% when performed with 2 plasma samples and 87% when performed with 1 plasma sample. CONCLUSION TDM of gentamicin using saliva is feasible and the difference in precision between saliva and plasma TDM may not be clinically relevant, especially for premature neonates.","output":"Saliva as a sampling matrix for therapeutic drug monitoring of gentamicin in neonates: A prospective population pharmacokinetic and simulation study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The inconsistent effects of lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) on COVID-19 seem to be caused by the therapeutic window.

The participants were 1724 young adults between 20 and 40 years of age (M = 30.74, SD = 5.74). The first measurement (T1) was in February 2021 and the second (T2) was in MayCJune 2021. The samples were representative of young adults in each country: Germany (n = 418, 24%), Israel (n = 428, 25%), Poland (n = 446, 26%), and Slovenia (n = 431, 25%). Women constituted 54% (n = 935) of the total sample. The mental health indicators were coronavirus-related PTSD measured by PCL-S, perceived stress (PSS-10), anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), and suicidal ideation (PHQ-9). The participants completed an online questionnaire that also included a physical activity (PA) measurement and sociodemographic variables. The Pearsons (2) independence test was used for prevalence comparisons and McNemars (2) was used for longitudinal changes, whereas generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used for the predictors of change in mental health indices. Significant differences were found between countries in each mental health dimension in both T1 and T2, with moderate effect sizes for coronavirus-related PTSD and suicidal ideation. The highest rate of PTSD and depression risk was in Germany, the highest rates of stress and anxiety risk were in Poland, and there was insufficient PA in Slovenia. The anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation rates were the lowest in Israel and Slovenia. Israeli participants reported the lowest rate of coronavirus-related PTSD among the other countries in T1 and T2. Significant decreases in coronavirus-related PTSD and stress were observed during T2 compared to T1 in the total sample. There was no change in the risk of anxiety, depression, or suicidal ideation. Being single was a predictor of changes in all mental health indices. Having children was a risk factor for coronavirus-related PTSD and high stress. Being a student was a predictor of depression and suicidal ideation. A younger age (20C29 years) predicted coronavirus-related PTSD risk, whereas female gender predicted high stress. The mental health indices improved over time or remained stable. The groups that are most prone to mental health problems were single individuals, students, and parents in young adulthood across all countries. Future intervention programs for young adults should consider these factors when prioritizing, planning, and implementing such programs.","output":"Prevalence and Sociodemographic Predictors of Mental Health in a Representative Sample of Young Adults from Germany, Israel, Poland, and Slovenia: A Longitudinal Study during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Viral RNA amplification by real-time RT-PCR still represents the gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, but the development of rapid, reliable and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods is crucial for public health, because of the need of shortening the time of result-reporting with a cost-efficient approach. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our research was to assess the performance of FREND&#8482; COVID-19 Ag assay (NanoEntek, South Korea) as a ultra-rapid frontline test for SARS-CoV-2 identification, in comparison with RT-PCR and another COVID-19 antigen fluorescence immunoassay (FIA). STUDY DESIGN: The qualitative FIA FREND&#8482; test, designed to detect within 3a?min the Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, was evaluated using nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM&#8482;, Copan Diagnostics Inc, US) from suspected COVID-19 cases who accessed the Emergency Room of the Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Liguria, Northwest Italy. Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and STANDARD F&#8482; COVID-19 Ag FIA test (SD BIOSENSOR Inc., Republic of Korea). RESULTS: In November 2020, 110 nasopharyngeal samples were collected consecutively; 60 resulted RT-PCR positive.

Epidemiological and clinical data were extracted. Otolaryngological symptoms, including OD and GD, were collected through patient-reported outcome questionnaire and Sniffin'Sticks tests were carried out in a subset of patients. RESULTS: A total of 2579 patients were included, including 2166 mild (84.0%), 144 moderate (5.6%) and 269 severe-to-critical (10.4%) patients. Mild patients presented an otolaryngological picture of the disease with OD, GD, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and sore throat as the most prevalent symptoms. The prevalence of subjective OD and GD was 73.7 and 46.8%, and decreases with the severity of the disease. Females had higher prevalence of subjective OD and GD compared with males. Diabetes was associated with a higher risk to develop GD. Among the subset of patients who benefited from psychophysical olfactory evaluations, there were 75 anosmic, 43 hyposmic and 113 normosmic patients.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus appeared in China, and since then, scientific production, including preprints, has drastically increased. In this study, we intend to evaluate how often preprints about COVID-19 were published in scholarly journals and cited. METHODS: We searched the iSearch COVID-19 portfolio to identify all preprints related to COVID-19 posted on bioRxiv, medRxiv, and Research Square from January 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020. We used a custom-designed program to obtain metadata using the Crossref public API. After that, we determined the publication rate and made comparisons based on citation counts using non-parametric methods. Also, we compared the publication rate, citation counts, and time interval from posting on a preprint server to publication in a scholarly journal among the three different preprint servers. RESULTS: Our sample included 5,061 preprints, out of which 288 were published in scholarly journals and 4,773 remained unpublished (publication rate of 5.7%). We found that articles published in scholarly journals had a significantly higher total citation count than unpublished preprints within our sample (p < 0.001), and that preprints that were eventually published had a higher citation count as preprints when compared to unpublished preprints (p < 0.001). As well, we found that published preprints had a significantly higher citation count after publication in a scholarly journal compared to as a preprint (p < 0.001). Our results also show that medRxiv had the highest publication rate, while bioRxiv had the highest citation count and shortest time interval from posting on a preprint server to publication in a scholarly journal. CONCLUSIONS: We found a remarkably low publication rate for preprints within our sample, despite accelerated time to publication by multiple scholarly journals. These findings could be partially attributed to the unprecedented surge in scientific production observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might saturate reviewing and editing processes in scholarly journals. However, our findings show that preprints had a significantly lower scientific impact, which might suggest that some preprints have lower quality and will not be able to endure peer-reviewing processes to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.","output":"Publication rate and citation counts for preprints released during the COVID-19 pandemic: the good, the bad and the ugly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the recent pandemic, scientists and clinicians are engaged in seeking new technology to stop or slow down the COVID-19 pandemic. The benefit of machine learning, as an essential aspect of artificial intelligence, on past epidemics offers a new line to tackle the novel Coronavirus outbreak. Accurate short-term forecasting of COVID-19 spread plays an essential role in improving the management of the overcrowding problem in hospitals and enables appropriate optimization of the available resources (i.e., materials and staff).This paper presents a comparative study of machine learning methods for COVID-19 transmission forecasting. We investigated the performances of deep learning methods, including the hybrid convolutional neural networks-Long short-term memory (LSTM-CNN), the hybrid gated recurrent unit-convolutional neural networks (GAN-GRU), GAN, CNN, LSTM, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), as well as baseline machine learning methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR). The employment of hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU) is expected to eventually improve the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 future trends. The performance of the investigated deep learning and machine learning models was tested using confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data from seven impacted countries: Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. The results reveal that hybrid deep learning models can efficiently forecast COVID-19 cases. Also, results confirmed the superior performance of deep learning models compared to the two considered baseline machine learning models. Furthermore, results showed that LSTM-CNN achieved improved performances with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of 3.718%, among others.","output":"Comparative study of machine learning methods for COVID-19 transmission forecasting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even though any new insurance policies issued after January have a COVID\\\\19 exclusion, you can still take steps to help your athletics department manage the insurance and liability issues likely to arise with your pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 insurance policies as college sports get back into full swing.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the perceptions of COVID-19 among individuals coming to, returning to, or living in Jiangsu Province, China, and determine the impact of the pandemic on the perceptions of the public. METHODS: In this study, an online questionnaire was distributed to participants between February 15 and April 21, 2020. The questionnaire comprised items on personal information (eg, sex, age, educational level, and occupation); protection knowledge, skills, and behaviors related to COVID-19; access to COVID-19Crelated information; and current information needs. Factors influencing the knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score for COVID-19 were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. The time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) and its 95% credible interval were calculated and compared with the daily participation number and protection scores. RESULTS: In total, 52,066 participants were included in the study; their average knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score were 25.58 (SD 4.22), 24.05 (SD 4.02), 31.51 (SD 2.84), and 90.02 (SD 8.87), respectively, and 65.91% (34,315/52,066) had a total protection score above 90 points. For the knowledge and skill sections, correct rates of answers to questions on medical observation days, infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals, cough or sneeze treatment, and precautions were higher than 95%, while those of questions on initial symptoms (32,286/52,066, 62.01%), transmission routes (37,134/52,066, 71.32%), selection of disinfection products (37,390/52,066, 71.81%), and measures of home quarantine (40,037/52,066, 76.90%) were relatively low. For the actual behavior section, 97.93% (50,989/52,066) of participants could wear masks properly when going out. However, 19.76% (10,290/52,066) could not disinfect their homes each week, and 18.42% (9589/52,066) could not distinguish differences in initial symptoms between the common cold and COVID-19. The regression analyses showed that the knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score were influenced by sex, age, educational level, occupation, and place of residence at different degrees (P<.001). The government, television shows, and news outlets were the main sources of protection knowledge, and the information released by the government and authoritative medical experts was considered the most reliable. The current information needs included the latest epidemic developments, disease treatment progress, and daily protection knowledge. The R(t) in the Jiangsu Province and mainland China dropped below 1, while the global R(t) remained at around 1. The maximal information coefficients ranged from 0.76 to 1.00, which indicated that the publics perceptions were significantly associated with the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of the participants had sufficient COVID-19 protection knowledge and skills and were able to avoid risky behaviors. Thus, it is necessary to apply different health education measures tailored to work and study resumption for specific populations to improve their self-protection and, ultimately, to prevent a possible rebound of COVID-19.","output":"Chinese Residents Perceptions of COVID-19 During the Pandemic: Online Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the keys to overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic is the development of the vaccine in order to immunize the population.

The death of visitors remains an important indicator of safety. The aim of this study was to provide updated figures on deaths of overseas travelers in Australia. METHODS Data were sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics concerning deaths of overseas visitors for the years 2001 to 2003. RESULTS There were 1,068 overseas visitor deaths (701 males, 66%) during the study period 2001 to 2003. Death by natural causes increased with age, while deaths associated with accidents were more frequent among younger age groups. The majority of deaths were from natural causes (782, 73%), particularly ischemic heart diseases (26%). There were a total of 247 accidental deaths (23% of all deaths) with the main causes being transportation accidents (14% of all deaths) and accidental drowning/submersion (5% of all deaths). The countries contributing the most deaths were the UK (247, 23%), New Zealand (108, 10%) Melanesia/Micronesia (95, 9%), and the United States (57, 5%). CONCLUSIONS Australia remains a relatively safe destination for international travelers, at least in terms of fatalities, which appear to be declining. Most deaths of overseas tourists in Australia are due to natural causes with cardiovascular disease being the predominant cause of death in this group. Accidents remain the most common preventable cause of death of travelers, with road and water safety being the major issues.

People living with cancer have increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19. There are limited data regarding vaccine efficacy in people with cancer, with lack of empirical evidence to guide vaccine strategy in cancer patients fostering uncertainty. Vulnerable groups, for whom vaccination protection may be attenuated, now carry the greatest burden of risk amongst the population. The cancer community needs to reconsider the potential on-going impact of COVID-19 and develop and plan new programs of work to mitigate it. Multiple potential future scenarios now exist, ranging from full protection from COVID-19 for cancer patients via herd immunity to viral evolution for vaccine resistance and increased virulence. Defining those most vulnerable to COVID-19 post-vaccination will require large-scale data and evidence to comprehensively identify factors that reduce vaccine efficacy. Once identified, protecting these groups through transmission and mortality risk reduction will become paramount. As the pandemic progresses, protecting the vulnerable may enable a return to normal for the majority, whilst still protecting individuals living with and beyond cancer who already live with the challenges of having a cancer diagnosis.","output":"As COVID-19 cases surge despite mass vaccination, its time to focus on the vulnerable"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telework has become a very popular arrangement that is growing rapidly worldwide, most recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as millions of people around the world were forced to work from home, due to the mandatory quarantines. It is important to deepen our knowledge about the performance of companies and employees in the context of telework because the results of previous studies are contradictory. The present study was to examine the impact of telework on work-life balance (WLB) and job performance, the relationship between WLB and Family Supportive Supervisor Behaviour (FSSB) with job performance, and the impact of FSSB on WLB in the context of COVID-19. The data (N = 519), which were collected from large private service companies in Colombia during the COVID-19 pandemic, were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The results identified a positive effect of both FSSB and WLB on teleworkers' job performance. Just as well, FSSB have been found to positively impact WLB. Therefore, WLB mediates the relationship between FSSB and job performance. However, telework was not observed to have a significant effect on job performance or WLB in the context of COVID-19, thus the mediating role of WLB was not found in the relationship for telework and job performance. Finally, we have used five control variables, but only supervisor's gender had a significant effect on job performance;however, the value of the effect size is very low, thus it cannot be concluded that supervisor's gender greatly affects job performance. The findings help us to understand both the importance of WLB and FSSB for teleworkers and the way these factors impact job performance.

Barrett oesophagus, the replacement of the normal squamous epithelia with glandular cells, is the first step in the pathway towards OAC. Although most patients with OAC present de novo, the presence of the easily detectable OAC precursor lesion, Barrett oesophagus, enables the possibility of early detection of high-risk patients who are more likely to progress. Currently, identification of high-risk patients depends on histopathological assessment of dysplasia with no regards to molecular pathogenesis. In the future, screening and risk stratification initiatives for Barrett oesophagus that incorporate molecular profiles might permit improved early diagnosis and intervention strategies with the possibility of preventing OAC. For the majority of patients presenting de novo at an advanced stage, combining so-called -omics datasets with current clinical staging algorithms might enable OACs to be better classified according to distinct molecular programmes, thereby leading to better targeted treatment strategies as well as cancer monitoring regimes.

The primary focus is on the regions of recirculating flow that can harbor infectious aerosol for much longer than the well-ventilated parts of the room. Computational fluid dynamics is used to obtain the steady state air flow field, and Lagrangian tracking of particles gives the spatial and temporal distribution of infectious aerosol in the domain. It is found that the washbasin located next to the door is in a prominent recirculation zone, and particles injected in this region take much longer to be evacuated. The ventilation rate is found to be governed by the air residence time in the recirculation zone, and it is much higher than the timescale based on fully mixed reactor model of the room.

Despite evidence that advance care planning (ACP), including completion of an advance directive (AD), enhances decision-making quality and patient experience, completion rates remain low. ACP decision aids have been shown to improve the quality of decisions in other chronic illnesses, yet few have been tested in the HF population. Purpose This pilot study was designed to test the feasibility and acceptability of an Advance Directive Decision Aid (ADDA) in hospitalized patients with HF and their designated caregivers. The secondary aim was to describe the levels of decisional conflict (DC) and decisional regret (DR) associated with participating in ACP discussions and consideration of completing an AD. Methods Convenience sampling was used to recruit 30 dyads (patients with HF and their designated caregivers) from an academic medical center. Feasibility was assessed by tracking the enrolled, ineligible, and refusal rates, in addition to the time to deliver the intervention. Acceptability was assessed via completion of a follow-up survey and participation in an exit interview. The dyads were evaluated for DC and DR following delivery of the ADDA. Results For enrolled patients, mean age was 56.5 years (SD = 12.17), 73% were Caucasian, most were male (66.6%), 54% were diagnosed with HF <1 year, and 70% were NYHA IV. Patients that were ineligible or refused participation were similar in sociodemographic data to the enrolled sample, though the refusal sample was significantly younger (56.5 years vs 49.47 years; p = 0.011). The ADDA took 2-5 minutes to complete. 80% of dyads found the ADDA to be acceptable and would recommend the ADDA to others. Dyads also reported that the ADDA assisted decision making to complete an AD. Dyads expressed similar amounts of DC; however, caregivers were found to have significantly more DR compared to patients (p = 0.008). In qualitative analysis, both patients and caregivers reported decreased anxiety and gratitude about ACP discussions. Enrolled patients expressed a sense of relief in participating in ACP discussions, though continued to endorse a sense of impending death if they completed an AD. Only 8 of 30 patients completed an AD at the conclusion of the study. Conclusions This pilot study revealed that the ADDA was feasible in clinical practice and acceptable to patients and caregivers. Younger patients were more likely to refuse the ADDA and caregiver regret was higher among caregivers than patients after viewing the ADDA. Patients remain fearful that completing an AD means death is imminent. Future research needs to be directed at breaking down the barrier to completing an AD and increasing completion rates, engaging the younger aged HF population, and understanding and decreasing caregiver regret.","output":"Enhancing Shared Decision Making in a Chronic Population.

Methods: This study was a multi-center retrospective cohort study. Patients confirmed with COVID-19 were recruited in three medical centers located in Beijing, Wuhan and Nanchang from January 27, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Demographics, clinical data, and CT images were collected. CT were analyzed by two emergency physicians of more than ten years' work experience independently through a modified scoring system. Final score was determined by average score from the two reviewers if consensus was not reached. The lung was divided into 6 zones (upper, middle, and lower on both sides) by the level of trachea carina and the level of lower pulmonary veins. The target lesion types included ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, overall lung involvement, and crazy-paving pattern. Bronchiectasis, cavity, pleural effusion, etc., were not included in CT reading and analysis because of low incidence. The reviewers evaluated the extent of the targeted patterns (GGO, consolidation) and overall affected lung parenchyma for each zone, using Likert scale, ranging from 0-4 (0=absent; 1=1%-25%; 2=26%-50%; 3=51%-75%; 4=76%-100%). Thus, GGO score, consolidation score, and overall lung involvement score were sum of 6 zones ranging from 0-24. For crazy-paving pattern, it was only coded as absent or present (0 or 1) for each zone and therefore ranging from 0-6. Results: A total of 197 patients from 3 medical centers and 522 CT scans entered final analysis. The median age of the patients was 64 years, and 54.8% were male. There were 76(38.8%) patients had hypertension and 30(15.3%) patients had diabetes mellitus. There were 75 of the patients classified as moderate cases, as well as 95 severe cases and 27 critical cases. As initial symptom, dry cough occurred in 170 patients, 134 patients had fever, and 125 patients had dyspnea. Reparatory rate, oxygen saturation, lymphocyte count and CURB 65 score on admission day varied among patients with different disease severity scale. There were 50 of the patients suffered from deterioration during hospital stay. The median time consumed for each CT by clinicians was 86.5 seconds. Cronbach's alpha for GGO, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and overall lung involvement between two clinicians were 0.809, 0.712, 0.678, and 0.906, respectively, showing good or excellent inter-rater correlation. There were 193 (98.0%) patients had GGO, 147 (74.6%) had consolidation, and 126(64.0%) had crazy-paving pattern throughout clinical course. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 183(92.9%) patients. Median time of interval for CT scan in our study was 7 days so that the whole clinical course was divided into stages by week for further analysis. From the second week on, the CT scores of various types of lesions in severe or critically patients were higher than those of moderate cases. After the fifth week, the course of disease entered the recovery period. The CT score of the upper lung zones was lower than that of other zones in moderate and severe cases. Similar distribution was not observed in critical patients. For moderate cases, the ground glass opacity score at the second week had predictive value for the escalation of the severity classification during hospitalization. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.849, the best cut-off value was 5 points, with sensitivity of 84.2% and specificity of 75.0%. Conclusions: It is feasible for clinicians to use the modified semi-quantitative CT scoring system to evaluate patients with COVID-19. Severe/critical patients had higher scores for ground glass opacity, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and overall lung involvement than moderate cases. The ground glass opacity score in the second week had an optimal predictive value for escalation of disease severity during hospitalization in moderate patients on admission. The frequency of CT scan should be reduced after entering the recovery stage.","output":"[Spatial and temporal distribution and predictive value of chest CT scoring in patients with COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peptide- and protein-nanoparticle conjugates have emerged as powerful tools for biomedical applications, enabling the treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of disease.

These strategies include seeking social support, self-care, and optimism. We asked parents about their experiences receiving treatment services for their autistic child and how they reduce parenting stress. Twenty-two parents completed a coping survey and participated in individual interviews. Few studies have explored the experiences of Black families raising autistic children, and it's important for healthcare and other systems of care to understand the role culture, race, and ethnicity play in the use of coping strategies. In our study, the majority of parents relied on social support to relieve stress and identified partners, family, and community members, as their most useful sources of support. Connecting with other parents of autistic children, through support groups and social media, also helped parents relieve stress. Parents discussed using self-care activities (e.g. church, exercising, listening to music) to cope with stressors. Several parents described how prayer and meditation helped them reframe stressful situations and gain more patience and appreciation for \\"what's important.\\" The findings of this work demonstrate the need for professionals to have ongoing and deeper conversations about the ways in which parents deal with stressors.

For that purpose, clinical trials have to be carried out as per international ethical standards. The current study was undertaken to examine the willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and to determine factors that might affect their decision to participate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study was carried out among the public in Jordan. During the study period, a convenience sample of adults (aged 18 years or above) were asked to participate via an online self-administered survey that was designed to evaluate the willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and to determine factors affecting their decision to participate. RESULTS: Results showed that, among participants (n=1,287), 36.1% reported to be willing to participate in clinical trials of the vaccine. Additionally, a lower percentage (18.1%) were willing to allow their children to participate. Motivators that encourage participation were the desire to return to normal life (73.2%), followed by the desire to help in finding a treatment for COVID-19 infection (68.1%). Barriers towards the participation were not wanting to be challenged by the virus (54.7%), fear (40.7%), lack of time (40.4%), and mistrust in pharmaceutical companies (38.9%). Finally, results showed that higher educational level was associated with lower willingness to participate (P=0.001), whereas having a previous participation in clinical studies is associated with a significantly higher willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: A good portion of Jordanians are positive regarding participation in clinical studies of COVID-19 vaccine.

The text revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5-TR) is scheduled to include a similar but distinct diagnosis, also termed PGD. Concerns have been raised that these new diagnoses are qualitatively different from both prior proposed diagnoses for pathological grief and each other, which may affect the generalizability of findings obtained with different criteria sets. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a content overlap analysis of PGD(ICD-11), PGD(DSM-5-TR), and previous proposals for pathological grief diagnoses (i.e. PGD 2009; complicated grief (CG), PGD ICD-11 beta draft, persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD) per DSM-5). METHODS: Using the Jaccards Index, we established the degree of content overlap between core and accessory symptoms of PGD(ICD-11), PGD(DSM-5-TR), and prior proposals for pathological grief diagnoses. RESULTS: Main findings are that PGD(ICD-11) and PGD(DSM-5-TR) showed moderate content overlap with each other and with most prior proposed diagnoses for pathological grief. PGD(ICD-11) and PGD(DSM-5-TR) showed the strongest content overlap with their direct predecessors, PGD(ICD-11 beta draft) and PCBD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Limited content overlap between PGD(ICD-11) and PGD(DSM-5-TR) and preceding criteria sets may threaten generalizability of past research on phenomenological characteristics of pathological grief to current criteria sets. Similarly, findings obtained with instruments to assess PGD(ICD-11) may not generalize to PGD(DSM-5-TR) and vice versa.

All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions.

The available studies often include small surgical populations, and there are important variations in the inclusion criteria and pre- and post-operative treatment. The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of the literature of the last 15 years, to evaluate the efficacy and the clinical safety of this procedure. This could help physicians in the choice of a multidisciplinary targeted therapeutical plan for patients. The combination of neoadjuvant chemo/radiochemotherapy and demolitive surgeries such as DP-CAR could have a role in changing the survival outcomes of patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. ABSTRACT: Background: Major vascular invasion represents one of the most frequent reasons to consider pancreatic adenocarcinomas unresectable, although in the last decades, demolitive surgeries such as distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) have become a therapeutical option. Methods: A meta-analysis of studies comparing DP-CAR and standard DP in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma was conducted. Moreover, a systematic review of studies analyzing oncological, postoperative and survival outcomes of DP-CAR was conducted. Results: Twenty-four articles were selected for the systematic review, whereas eleven were selected for the meta-analysis, for a total of 1077 patients. Survival outcomes between the two groups were similar in terms of 1 year overall survival (OS) (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.31, p = 0.24). Patients who received DP-CAR were more likely to have T4 tumors (OR 28.45, 95% CI 10.46 to 77.37, p < 0.00001) and positive margins (R+) (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.17, p = 0.008). Overall complications (OR, 1.72, 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.58, p = 0.008) were more frequent in the DP-CAR group, whereas rates of pancreatic fistula (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.65, p = 0.41) were similar. Conclusions: DP-CAR was not associated with higher mortality compared to standard DP; however, overall morbidity was higher. Celiac axis involvement should no longer be considered a strict contraindication to surgery in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Considering the different baseline tumor characteristics, DP-CAR may need to be compared with palliative therapies instead of standard DP.","output":"Distal Pancreatectomy with Celiac Axis Resection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ejection fraction (EF) provides critical information about heart failure (HF) and its management. Electrocardiography (ECG) is a noninvasive screening tool for cardiac electrophysiological activities that has been used to detect patients with low EF based on a deep learning model (DLM) trained via large amounts of data. However, no studies have widely investigated its clinical impacts. OBJECTIVE: This study developed a DLM to estimate EF via ECG (ECG-EF). We further investigated the relationship between ECG-EF and echo-based EF (ECHO-EF) and explored their contributions to future cardiovascular adverse events. METHODS: There were 57,206 ECGs with corresponding echocardiograms used to train our DLM. We compared a series of training strategies and selected the best DLM. The architecture of the DLM was based on ECG12Net, developed previously. Next, 10,762 ECGs were used for validation, and another 20,629 ECGs were employed to conduct the accuracy test. The changes between ECG-EF and ECHO-EF were evaluated. The primary follow-up adverse events included future ECHO-EF changes and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). RESULTS: The sex-/age-matching strategy-trained DLM achieved the best area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9472 with a sensitivity of 86.9% and specificity of 89.6% in the follow-up cohort, with a correlation of 0.603 and a mean absolute error of 7.436. In patients with accurate prediction (initial difference < 10%), the change traces of ECG-EF and ECHO-EF were more consistent (R-square = 0.351) than in all patients (R-square = 0.115). Patients with lower ECG-EF (35%) exhibited a greater risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications, delayed ECHO-EF recovery, and earlier ECHO-EF deterioration than patients with normal ECG-EF (>50%). Importantly, ECG-EF demonstrated an independent impact on MACEs and all CV adverse outcomes, with better prediction of CV outcomes than ECHO-EF. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG-EF could be used to initially screen asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and it could also independently contribute to the predictions of future CV adverse events. Although further large-scale studies are warranted, DLM-based ECG-EF could serve as a promising diagnostic supportive and management-guided tool for CV disease prediction and the care of patients with LVD.","output":"Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Electrocardiography Predicts Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Future Cardiovascular Outcomes: A Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Brain imaging is logistically the most difficult step before thrombolysis.

METHODS Prospectively collected data in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-EAST (SITS-EAST) registry from Central/Eastern European countries between 2008 and 2011 were analyzed. Hospital characteristics were obtained by questionnaire from each center. Patient- and hospital-level predictors of DIT of 25 minutes or less were identified by the method of generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Altogether 6 of 9 SITS-EAST countries participated with 4212 patients entered into the database of which 3631 (86%) had all required variables. DIT of 25 minutes or less was achieved in 2464 (68%) patients (range, 3%-93%; median, 65%; and interquartile range, 50%-80% between centers). Patients with DIT of 25 minutes or less had shorter DNT (median, 60 minutes) than patients with DIT of more than 25 minutes (median, 86 minutes; P < .001). Four variables independently predicted DIT of 25 minutes or less: longer time from stroke onset to admission (91-180 versus 0-90 minutes; odds ratio [OR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.8), transport time of 5 minutes or less (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7-4.7) between the place of admission and a computed tomography (CT) scanner, no or minimal neurologic deficit before stroke (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.02-1.5), and diabetes mellitus (OR, .8; 95% CI, .7-.97).

The elimination of populations of O. moubata would contribute to the prevention and control of these two serious diseases. Anti-tick vaccines are an eco-friendly and sustainable means of eliminating tick populations. Tick saliva forms part of the tick-host interface, and knowledge of its composition is key to the identification and selection of vaccine candidate antigens. The aim of the present work is to increase the body of data on the composition of the saliva proteome of adult O. moubata ticks, particularly of females, since in-depth knowledge of the O. moubata sialome will allow the identification and selection of novel salivary antigens as targets for tick vaccines. METHODS: We analysed samples of female and male saliva using two different mass spectrometry (MS) approaches: data-dependent acquisition liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LCCMS/MS) and sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectraCMS (SWATH-MS). To maximise the number of proteins identified, a proteomics informed by transcriptomics analysis was applied using the O. moubata salivary transcriptomic dataset previously obtained by RNA-Seq. RESULTS: SWATH-MS proved to be superior to LCCMS/MS for the study of female saliva, since it identified 61.2% more proteins than the latter, the reproducibility of results was enhanced with its use, and it provided a quantitative picture of salivary components. In total, we identified 299 non-redundant proteins in the saliva of O. moubata, and quantified the expression of 165 of these in both male and female saliva, among which 13 were significantly overexpressed in females and 40 in males. These results indicate important quantitative differences in the saliva proteome between the sexes. CONCLUSIONS: This work expands our knowledge of the O. moubata sialome, particularly that of females, by increasing the number of identified novel salivary proteins, which have different functions at the tickChost feeding interface. This new knowledge taken together with information on the O. moubata sialotranscriptome will allow a more rational selection of salivary candidates as antigen targets for tick vaccine development.

Single-port VATS thymectomy using a flexible port and CO2 has been described. However, VATS thymectomy is possible by a single incision of 3 cm without CO2 insufflation or special port device avoiding objections related to CO2 insufflation and allowing instruments to move more freely making procedure easier and cheaper. Our institutional experience in open and CO2-less VATS single-port thymectomy was retrospectively reviewed to evaluate compared to sternotomy, the clinical and oncological outcomes with this novel approach. METHODS A retrospective review consisting of 84 patients who underwent thymectomy because different thymic disorders especially thymoma was performed. Eighteen patients underwent CO2-less VATS single port thymectomy, while 66 underwent thymectomy through open sternotomy. Many clinical factors associated with the surgical and clinical outcomes, including tumor recurrence and clinical remission, were recorded. RESULTS Non major postoperative complications were observed in any group. The median operative time and postoperative hospital stay of CO2-less VATS single port thymectomy were 95 min and 1 day, respectively and 120 min and 7 days for open sternotomy. The thymoma was the most common thymic disorder with 7 patients (38%) in VATS group and 28 patients (42.4%) for the open approach. The median lesion size was 2.6 cm in the VATS group and 3.2 cm in the open approach. No thymoma recurrence in patients undergoing VATS was observed during the follow-up time, while in the open surgery group 14.28% recurrence was observed, distributed as follows: loco-regional 75% and 25% at distance; free disease period of these patients was 8.3 months. Thymectomy associated with myasthenia gravis (MG) was observed in 6 (33%) patients in the VATS group and 32 (48%) patients for sternotomy; our results regarding thymectomy for the treatment of MG were established by the MG post-intervention status [complete stable remission (CSR), pharmacologic remission, minimal manifestations, improved, unchanged and worse exacerbation, and died of MG] and reflected similar results in both approaches. CONCLUSIONS CO2-less VATS single-port thymectomy is a feasible and safe procedure. Oncologic outcomes are similar to open approaches. Complications, surgical time and hospital stay are shorter compared with sternotomy. This is an initial experience, further work is required to evaluate long-term results.","output":"Clinical outcomes of CO2-less single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy versus open thymectomy: comparative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O Informe Dirio de Evidncias  uma produo do Ministrio da Sade que tem como objetivo acompanhar diariamente as publicaes cientficas sobre tratamento farmacolgico e vacinas para a COVID-19 Dessa forma, s?o realizadas buscas estruturadas em bases de dados biomdicas, referente ao dia anterior desse informe N?o s?o includos estudos pr-clnicos (in vitro, in vivo, in silico) A frequncia dos estudos  demonstrada de acordo com a sua classificao metodolgica (revis?es sistemticas, ensaios clnicos randomizados, coortes, entre outros) Para cada estudo  apresentado um resumo com avaliao da qualidade metodolgica Essa avaliao tem por finalidade identificar o grau de certeza/confian?a ou o risco de vis de cada estudo Para tal, s?o utilizadas ferramentas j validadas e consagradas na literatura cientfica, na rea de sade baseada em evidncias Cabe ressaltar que o documento tem carter informativo e n?o representa uma recomendao oficial do Ministrio da Sade sobre a temtica Foram encontrados 14 artigos e 6 protocolos","output":"Informe dirio de evidncias COVID-19: busca realizada em 1o de julho de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Vaccination against COVID-19 in immunocompetent individuals has demonstrated high efficacy in disease prevention while significantly reducing severe infections and hospitalizations. COVID-19 vaccination is endorsed in immunosuppressed recipients of solid organ transplant. Trials have examined safety data in this population, with no published reports of increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). We present a case of probable mRNA vaccine induced AMR in a previously stable lung transplant recipient. Case Report A 27-year-old bilateral lung transplant recipient for cystic fibrosis related lung had grade 2 rejection with class II antibodies 2 months post-transplant that was treated with methylprednisolone with good response. He was then event free for over two years. He developed acute onset of dyspnea, dry cough, non-pleuritic chest pain, and general malaise 24 hours after receiving his second dose of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine. Over the subsequent 3 weeks, he deteriorated with worsening exertional dyspnea and desaturation. He was admitted to hospital with rapidly progressive type 1 respiratory failure. A CT angiogram of the chest demonstrated findings consistent with organizing pneumonia versus opportunistic infection. Bronchoscopy was negative for infectious etiology. He was treated with a methylprednisolone pulse to treat the organizing pneumonia seen on imaging and potential AMR. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation on post admission day (PAD) 4. Human leukocyte antigen testing demonstrated de novo class II donor specific antibody (DR12) and possible weak class I reactivity. With declining status and refractory hypoxemia, 5 cycles plasma exchange (PLEX) alternating with thymoglobulin were administered. He became dependent on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with poor lung compliance. Antibody levels decreased but remained elevated. Subsequent therapy included thymoglobulin (total dose 7mg/kg), 5 additional cycles of PLEX, and intravenous immunoglobulin and Dartinumab on PAD 38. He died PAD 47 when life sustaining measures were removed due complications from Clostridium difficile infection. Summary This case of probable AMR post mRNA vaccination in a lung transplant recipient raises clinical suspicion for a serious adverse event and contributes to safety data for this select population.","output":"Fulminant Antibody-Mediated Rejection in a Stable Lung Transplant Recipient Post COVID-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the advent of COVID-19, accelerated adoption of systems that reduce face-to-face encounters has outpaced training and best practices. Electronic consultations (eConsults), structured communications between PCPs and specialists regarding a case, have been effective in reducing face-to-face specialist encounters. As the health system rapidly adapts to multiple new practices and communication tools, new mechanisms to measure and improve performance in this context are needed. OBJECTIVE: To test whether feedback comparing physicians to top performing peers using co-specialists ratings improves performance. DESIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial PARTICIPANTS: Eighty facility-specialty clusters and 214 clinicians INTERVENTION: Providers in the feedback arms were sent messages that announced their membership in an elite group of Top Performers or provided actionable recommendations with feedback for providers that were Not Top Performers. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcomes were changes in peer ratings in the following performance dimensions after feedback was received: (1) elicitation of information from primary care practitioners; (2) adherence to institutional clinical guidelines; (3) agreement with peers medical decision-making; (4) educational value; (5) relationship building. KEY RESULTS: Specialists showed significant improvements on 3 of the 5 consultation performance dimensions: medical decision-making (odds ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.08C2.14, p<.05), educational value (1.86, 1.17C2.96) and relationship building (1.63, 1.13C2.35) (both p<.01). CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has shed light on clinicians commitment to professionalism and service as we rapidly adapt to changing paradigms. Interventions that appeal to professional norms can help improve the efficacy of new systems of practice. We show that specialists performance can be measured and improved with feedback using aspirational norms.

METHODS: A mixed methods design was utilized. Qualitative methods, such as reviewing existing questionnaires that measured caregiver work productivity losses and performing one-on-one interviews with caregivers, were used for VOLP adaptation and online conversion. Quantitative methods were used to evaluate feasibility and validity of the online VOLP. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire for caregivers was included to compare its absenteeism and presenteeism outcomes and their correlations with VOLP outcomes. RESULTS: When adapting the VOLP for caregivers, our qualitative analysis showed the importance of adding three major components: caregiving time, work productivity loss related to volunteer activities and caregivers lost job opportunities. A total of 383 caregivers who completed online survey were included in our final quantitative analysis. We found small Spearman rank correlations between VOLP and WPAI, observing a larger correlation between their absenteeism [r = 0.49 (95% confidence interval: 0.37C0.60)] than their presenteeism [r = 0.36 (0.24C0.47)]. Correlations between VOLP outcomes and total caregiving hours were larger for absenteeism [r = 0.38 (0.27C0.47)] than presenteeism [r = 0.22 (0.10C0.34)]. Correlations between WPAI outcomes and total caregiving hours were smaller for absenteeism [r = 0.27 (0.15C0.38)] than presenteeism [r = 0.35 (0.23C0.46)]. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence of the feasibility and preliminary validity evidence of the adapted VOLP caregiver questionnaire in measuring productivity losses due to caregiving responsibilities, when compared with the results for WPAI and the results from the previous patient-VOLP validation study.","output":"Valuation of Lost Productivity in Caregivers: A Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) In Malaysia, first few cases of COVID-19 were detected in January 2020, among Chinese nationals and the cases keep increasing day by day Methods: This self-administered web based cross sectional study using Google forms was conducted among 400 Malaysian adults to explore their level of knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19, as well as factors associated with the variables Descriptive and binary logistic regression were performed using SPSS version 22 Results: Knowledge and practice among Malaysian adults towards COVID-19 were low Gender (p = 0 030, OR:0 616, 95% CI 0 398-0 955) and occupation (p = 0 002, OR:2 489, 95% CI 1 485-4 172) were found as significant predictors of practice towards COVID-19 Conclusions: In conclusion, proper mass public health messages should be conducted by the higher authorities to improve knowledge and practice towards COVID-19","output":"Knowledge and Practices among Selected Malaysian Adults towards COVID-19: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The departure of the UK from the EU has been a kaleidoscope of surprisesthe initial shock of the 2016 referendum, two unexpected elections, the revolving door at 10 Downing Street and the succession of missed promised deadlines from 29 March 2019 until the final severance of British EU membership on 31 January 2020.

PATIENTS AND METHODS We compared two independent cohorts of COVID-19 pneumonia (n=405) and H1N1 influenza pneumonia (n=78), retrospectively. All patients were confirmed by RT-PCR. Four hundred and five cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were confirmed in nine hospitals of Zhejiang province, China from January 21 to February 20, 2020. Seventy-eight cases of H1N1 influenza pneumonia were confirmed in our hospital from January 1, 2017 to February 29, 2020. Their clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, and CT imaging characteristics were compared. RESULTS COVID-19 pneumonia patients showed less proportions of underlying diseases, fever and respiratory symptoms than those of H1N1 pneumonia patients (p<0.01). White blood cell count, neutrophilic granulocyte percentage, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-Dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase in H1N1 pneumonia patients were higher than those of COVID-19 pneumonia patients (p<0.05). H1N1 pneumonia was often symmetrically located in the dorsal part of inferior lung lobes, while COVID-19 pneumonia was unusually showed as a peripheral but non-specific lobe distribution. Ground glass opacity was more common in COVID-19 pneumonia and consolidation lesions were more common in H1N1 pneumonia (p<0.01).

Changes in the connectivity strength of these networks upon acute stress may predict vulnerability to long-term stress effects, which can only be tested in prospective longitudinal studies. Using such longitudinal design, we investigated whether the magnitude of acute-stress-induced functional connectivity changes (delta-FC) predicts the development of post-traumatic stress-disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a relatively resilient group of young police students that are known to be at high risk for trauma exposure. Using resting-state fMRI, we measured acute-stress-induced delta-FC in 190 police recruits before (baseline) and after trauma exposure during repeated emergency-aid services (16-month follow-up). Delta-FC was then linked to the changes in perceived stress levels (PSS) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PCL and CAPS). Weakened connectivity between the SN and DMN core regions upon acute-stress induction at baseline predicted longitudinal increases in perceived-stress level but not of post-traumatic stress symptoms, whereas increased coupling between the overall SN and anterior cerebellum was observed in participants with higher clinician-rated PTSD symptoms, particularly intrusion levels. All the effects remained significant when controlling for trauma-exposure levels and cortisol-stress reactivity. Neither hormonal nor subjective measures exerted similar predictive or acquired effects. The reconfiguration of large-scale neural networks upon acute-stress induction is relevant for assessing and detecting risk and resilience factors for PTSD.

In surgical patients, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but no reliable evidence exists about its effectiveness in patients who have had a stroke. We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke. METHODS The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicentre parallel group randomised trial assessing IPC in immobile patients (ie, who cannot walk to the toilet without the help of another person) with acute stroke. We enrolled patients from day 0 to day 3 of admission and allocated them via a central randomisation system (ratio 1:1) to receive either IPC or no IPC. A technician who was masked to treatment allocation did a compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) of both legs at 7-10 days and, wherever practical, at 25-30 days after enrolment. Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment. Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The primary outcome was a DVT in the proximal veins detected on a screening CDU or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins, confirmed on imaging, within 30 days of randomisation. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN93529999. FINDINGS Between Dec 8, 2008, and Sept 6, 2012, 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK. The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years (IQR 67-84). The primary outcome occurred in 122 (85%) of 1438 patients allocated IPC and 174 (121%) of 1438 patients allocated no IPC; an absolute reduction in risk of 36% (95% CI 14-58). Excluding the 323 patients who died before any primary outcome and 41 without any screening CDU, the adjusted OR for the comparison of 122 of 1267 patients vs 174 of 1245 patients was 065 (95% CI 051-084; p=0001). Deaths in the treatment period occurred in 156 (11%) patients allocated IPC and 189 (13%) patients allocated no IPC died within the 30 days of treatment period (p=0057); skin breaks on the legs were reported in 44 (3%) patients allocated IPC and in 20 (1%) patients allocated no IPC (p=0002); falls with injury were reported in 33 (2%) patients in the IPC group and in 24 (2%) patients in the no-IPC group (p=0221).

We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV E proteins reduced HIV-1 yields by approximately 100-fold while MERS-CoV or HCoV-OC43 E proteins restricted HIV-1 infectivity to a lesser extent. This was also reflected in the levels of HIV-1 protein synthesis in cells. Mechanistically, we show that that the E protein neither affected reverse transcription nor genome integration. However, SARS-CoV-2 E protein activated the ER-stress pathway associated with the phosphorylation of eIF-2, which is known to attenuate protein synthesis in cells. Finally, we show that these four E proteins and the SARS-CoV-2 N protein did not significantly down-regulate bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST-2) while the spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and HIV-1 Vpu efficiently down-regulated cell surface BST-2 expression. The results of this study show for the first time that viroporins from a heterologous virus can suppress HIV-1 infection. IMPORTANCEThe E protein of coronaviruses is a viroporin that is required for efficient release of infectious virus and for viral pathogenicity. We determined if the E protein from four {beta}-coronaviruses could restrict virus particle infectivity of HIV-1 infection. Our results indicate that the E proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV potently restricted HIV-1 while those from MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 were less restrictive. Substitution of the highly conserved proline in the cytoplasmic domain of SARS-CoV-2 E abrogated the restriction on HIV-1 infection. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 E protein did not interfere with viral integration or RNA synthesis but rather reduced viral protein synthesis. We show that the E protein-initiated ER stress causing phosphorylation of eIF-2, which is known to attenuate protein synthesis. Companion studies suggest that the E protein also triggers autophagy. These results show for the first time that a viroporin from a coronavirus can restrict infection of another virus.","output":"The Envelope Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Inhibits Viral Protein Synthesis and Infectivity of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been ravaging Nigeria and the world with increasing morbidity and mortality. Despite efforts by the Nigerian government implemented through the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to reduce the scourge of the disease through public enlightenment and regular updates, the number of new cases and mortalities from COVID-19 are still increasing. Family physicians (FPs) who are the first contact of care for most patients accessing private and public health facilities in Nigeria have been working tirelessly to reduce the scourge of the pandemic in Nigeria. They continuously update themselves through regular webinars and online resources and guidelines provided by the Society of Family Physicians of Nigeria (SOFPON). Measures adopted by FPs across the country in the fight against the scourge include triaging patients as they present to the family medicine clinics; health education and enlightenment of the populace; and ensuring social distancing, regular handwashing and compulsory use of face mask by both physicians and patients during clinical consultations. Other measures include incorporating family-focused behavioural interventions in their practice, home-based care to reduce the number of persons visiting the hospital, telemedicine and Hospice and palliative care services to the elderly and terminally ill.

To understand how offer acceptance varies by center, we studied 1,113 eventually-transplanted OLD grafts from 2009-2017 using SRTR data and random-intercept multi-level logistic regression. To understand how center-level acceptance of OLD graft offers might be associated with waitlist and post-transplant outcomes, we studied all adult, actively-listed, liver-only candidates and recipients during the study period using Poisson regression (transplant rate), competing risks regression (waitlist mortality), and Cox regression (post-transplant mortality). Among 117 centers, OLD offer acceptance ranged from 0 (23 centers) to 95 acceptances, with a median odds ratio of 2.88. Thus, a candidate may be three times as likely to receive an OLD graft simply by listing at a different center. Centers in the highest quartile (Q4) of OLD acceptance (accepted 39% of OLD offers) accepted more nationally shared organs (Q4 vs Q1: 14.1% vs. 0.0%, p<0.001) and had higher annual liver transplant volume (Q4 vs Q1: 80 vs. 21,p<0.001). After adjustment, nationally shared OLD offers (adjusted odds ratio[aOR]:0.16, 95%CI:0.13-0.20) and offers to centers with higher median MELD at transplant (aOR:0.74, 95%CI:0.62-0.87) were less likely to be accepted.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide concern that has created major issues with many aspects. It is important to identify the risk factors for severe outcomes of this disease. To date, no association between viral hepatitis and severe COVID-19 has not been established. Methods: Through November 5th, 2020, the databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, and medRxiv were systematically searched using specific keywords related to the focus of the study. All articles published on COVID-19 and viral hepatitis were retrieved. The Mantel- Haenszel formula with random-effects models was used to obtain the risk ratio (RR) along with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous variables. The two-tailed p-value was set with a value 0.05 considered statistically significant. Restricted-maximum likelihood meta-regression was done for several variables, such as age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, and other liver disease. Results Analysis results included a total of 16 studies with a total of 14,682 patients. Meta-analysis showed that viral hepatitis increases the risk of developing severe COVID-19 (RR 1.68 (95% CI 1.26 - 2.22), p = 0.0003, I2 = 21%, random-effect modeling). According to the meta-regression analysis, the association between viral hepatitis and severe COVID-19 was not influenced by age (p = 0.067), diabetes (p = 0.057), or other liver disease (p = 0.646).

However, little is known about caesarean section rates following antepartum stillbirth in Australia. AIMS: We aimed to describe the onset of labour, mode of birth, and use of analgesia and anaesthesia following antepartum stillbirth and to identify factors associated with caesarean section. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used a population-based dataset of all singleton antepartum stillbirths 20 weeks gestation in Western Australia between 2010-2015. The overall, primary and repeat caesarean section rates for antepartum stillbirths were calculated and multivariable Poisson regression analyses were performed to identify associated factors, and to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: This study included 634 antepartum stillbirths. Labour was spontaneous for 134 (21.1%), induced for 457 (72.1%), and 43 (6.8%) had a prelabour caesarean section. The overall, primary and repeat caesarean section rates were 8.5%, 4.6% and 23.0% respectively and increased with gestation (P trends all <0.01). Other factors associated with an increased caesarean section risk included: any placenta praevia or placental abruption, birth at a metropolitan private hospital, large-for-gestational-age birthweight, and any maternal chronic condition. During labour, the most frequently used types of analgesia were systemic narcotics (46.0%) and regional blocks (34.7%) while among those who had a caesarean section, 40.7% had a general anaesthetic. CONCLUSIONS: In Western Australia between 2010-2015, the caesarean section rates among women with antepartum stillbirths were low, in line with current guidelines.","output":"Caesarean section following antepartum stillbirth in Western Australia 2010-2015: A population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using ethnographic data from Providence County, Rhode Island, this paper explores yoga as a bodywork practice that is part of everyday health and wellbeing routines in middle class households.

Along with other bodywork activities, yoga emerges as a shared social practice that links participants to their partners, children, and other intimates, facilitating a sense of togetherness by allowing time and space for autonomy. By giving atmospheric and sensory attention to the ethnographic data, the paper further reveals how domestic intimacy is cultivated via the generation of bodily heat and positive energies and that yoga may tacitly facilitate such atmospheres. In this way, yoga can help households meet an American need for self-development and autonomy while still facilitating a far more enduring human need for intimate connection.

Patients with COVID-19 infection present with neurological signs and symptoms aside from the usual respiratory affectation. Moreover, COVID-19 is associated with several neurological diseases and complications, which may eventually affect clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The Philippine COVID-19 Outcomes: a Retrospective study Of Neurological manifestations and Associated symptoms (The Philippine CORONA) study investigators will conduct a nationwide, multicentre study involving 37 institutions that aims to determine the neurological manifestations and factors associated with clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infection. METHODOLOGY AND ANALYSIS: This is a retrospective cohort study (comparative between patients with and without neurological manifestations) via medical chart review involving adult patients with COVID-19 infection. Sample size was determined at 1342 patients. Demographic, clinical and neurological profiles will be obtained and summarised using descriptive statistics. Students t-test for two independent samples and (2) test will be used to determine differences between distributions. HRs and 95% CI will be used as an outcome measure. Kaplan-Meier curves will be constructed to plot the time to onset of mortality (survival), respiratory failure, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, duration of ventilator dependence, length of ICU stay and length of hospital stay. The log-rank test will be employed to compare the Kaplan-Meier curves. Stratified analysis will be performed to identify confounders and effects modifiers. To compute for adjusted HR with 95% CI, crude HR of outcomes will be adjusted according to the prespecified possible confounders. Cox proportional regression models will be used to determine significant factors of outcomes. Testing for goodness of fit will also be done using Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Subgroup analysis will be performed for proven prespecified effect modifiers. The effects of missing data and outliers will also be evaluated in this study.

The analysis covers 380 counties, including 66 cities. This study used daily reports on the progress of the pandemic in Poland published by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland and unique, detailed data on 24 types of land use available in the Statistics Poland database. Statistical relationships were determined between the above-mentioned environmental variables and the variables characterizing COVID-19 (cases and deaths). Various basic types of regression models were analysed. The optimal model was selected, and the determination coefficient, significance level and the values of the parameters of these relationships, together with the estimation error, were calculated. The obtained results indicated that the higher the number of green-blue spaces in individual counties, the lower the total number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. These relationships were described by logarithmic and homographic models. In turn, an increase in the population density caused an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths, according to the power model. These results can be used in the current analysis of the spread of the pandemic, including the location of potential outbreaks. In turn, the developed models can be used as a tool in forecasting the development of the pandemic and making decisions about the implementation of preventive measures.","output":"Green-Blue Spaces and Population Density versus COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Esophageal pressure measurement is a minimally invasive monitoring process that assesses respiratory mechanics in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Airway pressure release ventilation is a relatively new positive pressure ventilation modality, characterized by a series of advantages in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 55-year-old chilean female, with preexisting hypertension and recurrent renal colic who entered the cardiosurgical intensive care unit with signs and symptoms of urinary sepsis secondary to a right-sided obstructive urolithiasis. At the time of admission, the patient showed signs of urinary sepsis, a poor overall condition, hemodynamic instability, tachycardia, hypotension, and needed vasoactive drugs. Initially the patient was treated with volume control ventilation. Then, ventilation was with conventional ventilation parameters described by the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network. However, hemodynamic complications led to reduced airway pressure. Later she presented intraabdominal hypertension that compromised the oxygen supply and her ventilation management. Considering these records, an esophageal manometry was used to measure distending lung pressure, that is, transpulmonary pressure, to protect lungs. Initial use of the esophageal balloon was in a volume-controlled modality (deep sedation), which allowed the medical team to perform inspiratory and expiratory pause maneuvers to monitor transpulmonary plateau pressure as a substitute for pulmonary distension and expiratory pause and determine transpulmonary positive end-expiratory pressure. On the third day of mechanical respiration, the modality was switched to airway pressure release ventilation. The use of airway pressure release ventilation was associated with reduced hemodynamic complications and kept transpulmonary pressure between 0 and 20 cmH(2)O despite a sustained high positive end-expiratory pressure of 20 cmH(2)O. CONCLUSION: The application of this technique is shown in airway pressure release ventilation with spontaneous ventilation, which is then compared with a controlled modality that requires a lesser number of sedative doses and vasoactive drugs, without altering the criteria for lung protection as guided by esophageal manometry.","output":"An assessment of esophageal balloon use for the titration of airway pressure release ventilation and controlled mechanical ventilation in a patient with extrapulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alpha investments private limited was set up in 1988 as a small sub broking unit, with just 3 people running the concern.

This model was developed to predict the risk of lung metastasis (L.M.) in patients with E.S. to provide a practical tool and help in clinical diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Data of all patients diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma between 2010 and 2016 were retrospectively retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A training dataset from the enrolled cohorts was built (n = 929). Predictive factors for L.M. were identified based on the results of multivariable logistic regression analyses. A nomogram model and a web calculator were constructed based on those key predictors. A multicenter dataset from four medical institutions was established for model validation (n = 51). The predictive ability of the nomogram model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration plot. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was applied to explain the accuracy of the nomogram model in clinical practice. RESULTS: Five independent factors, including survival time, surgery, tumor (T) stage, node (N) stage, and bone metastasis, were identified to develop a nomogram model.

Presumably, this might have had an impact on the efficacy in the management of the COVID-19 diffusion. In particular, the high availability of beds in the majority of the France regions paired with the low occupancy rate and high turnover interval led these regions to have a high number of available beds. Consider also that this country generally manages complex cases. A similar structural component is present in the German regions where the number of available beds is significantly higher than in the other countries. The impact of the COVID-19 was completely different in Italy and Spain that had to deal with a relevant large number of patients relying on a reduced number of both hospital beds and professionals. A further critical factor compared to France and Germany concerns the dissimilar distribution of cases across regions. Even if in these countries the hospital beds were efficiently managed, the concentration of hospitalized patients and the scarcity of beds have put pressure on the hospital systems.","output":"The efficiency in the ordinary hospital bed management: A comparative analysis in four European countries before the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic requires an understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. However, throughout the development of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assays during the past year, cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses remained a question. To address these issues, we evaluated IgG in COVID-19 convalescent plasma samples for reactivity against three SARS-CoV-2 antigens including full-length spike, receptor binding domain, and the proximal extracellular fusion domain, and spike antigens from other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E and hCoV-NL63) using the VaxArray Coronavirus SeroAssay which is a multiplexed antigen assay developed by InDevR Inc. These results were compared to two commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISAs targeting either the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or spike antigens and a live virus focus reduction neutralizing antibody test (FRNT). The VaxArray platform showed high specificity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, evident from lack of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens despite significant reactivity to endemic coronavirus antigens in pre-pandemic samples. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive samples reacted weakly to SARS-CoV spike but not to MERS-CoV. While the VaxArray platform had overall comparable results to the spike and nucleocapsid IgG ELISAs, results were more similar to the spike antigen ELISA and the platform displayed a higher sensitivity and specificity than both ELISAs. Samples with FRNT titers below 1/23 reported negative on VaxArray, while positive samples on VaxArray had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers. These results suggest that the VaxArray Coronavirus SeroAssay performs with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and positive results on the platform indicate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity.","output":"Evaluation of a multiplexed coronavirus antigen array for detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in COVID-19 convalescent plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease caused by a highly contagious virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and this disease has affected millions of people across the world and led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Nutrition is a key factor related to this disease, and nutritional status may determine the risk and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Selenium is one of the major trace elements required for redox functions and has significant roles in viral infections. The purpose of this review was to examine the current evidence on the role of selenium in COVID-19. We reviewed studies on selenium and COVID-19, and other relevant studies to understand how selenium status can modify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how selenium status might affect a person post-infection. RECENT FINDINGS: We found that oxidative stress is a characteristic feature of COVID-19 disease, which is linked with the immunopathological disorder observed in individuals with severe COVID-19. Selenium plays a key role in strengthening immunity, reducing oxidative stress, preventing viral infections and supporting critical illness. Moreover, selenium deficiency is related to oxidative stress and hyperinflammation seen in critical illness, and selenium deficiency is found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. SUMMARY: Selenium supplementation at an appropriate dose may act as supportive therapy in COVID-19. Future studies in large cohorts of COVID-19 are warranted to verify the benefits of selenium supplementation for reducing risk and severity of COVID-19.","output":"A Mechanistic Link Between Selenium and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreaks of infectious diseases are occurring with increasing frequency and unpredictability.

Methods Patients presenting with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) due to ruptured BBAs and subsequently treated with FDs were retrospectively selected from June 2010 to January 2017. Treatment techniques, angiographic data on occlusion rates and procedural success as well as clinical outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were collated. Cross-reference of results were made with available literature. Results Thirteen patients harbouring 14 BBAs were recruited. Of the 14 aneurysms, five (35.7%) showed immediate complete occlusion after the procedure (four of these five patients had adjunctive coiling). All of the aneurysms showed complete occlusion by the six- to nine-month control diagnostic angiogram. No rebleed or retreatment was experienced. Twelve of 13 (92%) patients had an mRS score of 0-1 at the last clinical follow-up. From the pooled data of the literature review, eventual aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 48/56 patients, with five patients requiring further endovascular treatment. In the clinical follow-up period, an mRS of 0-2 was recorded for 83.3% (45/54) of patients. Conclusion Endovascular reconstruction of BBAs using FD treatment is an effective method with good final clinical outcomes.

Additionally, insult may manifest as slight neurocognitive dysfunction rather than overt neurological deficits. Characterisation of the incidence and underlying aetiology of these neurological events may lead to identification of currently unrecognised neuroprotective strategies.

Aims To evaluate the entity and type of nursing management for frail pts followed by DHCU during the first year of Covid-19 pandemia. Methods All nursing activities from 3/2020 to 3/2021 in the lockdown framework were analysed. On the whole, 107 pts in 43 municipalities of Viterbo province were followed by DHCU nurses in the study period. Results Main features of the pts at baseline of domiciliary assistance are reported in the Table. At beginning of the study period (08/03/2020), 37 pts (34.5%) were already followed by DHCU, while 70 pts (65.5%) entered domiciliary assistance during the year of study. Median distance from DHCU central site to pts house was 25 Km [Interquartile range (IQR) 16 - 34]: distance from DHCU was < 20 Km in 32 cases (29.9%),  20 < 40 Km in 57 (53.2%) and  40 Km in 18 (16.9%). A total number of 2609 nursing accesses was done in the whole period. According to different procedures, 1152 blood samples were performed, with a median number of 7 (IQR 3 - 15) for each pts: in addition, there were 1040 accesses for chemotherapy (CHT) administration (108 cycles of azacytidine in 15 pts, 87 bortezomib-based cycles in 30 pts, 16 administrations of other CHTs in 2 pts) and 417 accesses for other procedures (260 venous catheter medications, 125 therapy other than CHT, 32 nursing assistances of transfusions or marrow aspirates). Finally, 20 pts were vaccinated at home with respective caregivers. During the entire study period, 2 pts (1.8%) developed Covid-19 infection while in home care. At the last follow-up (31/03/2021), 59 pts (55.1%) were alive and still followed by DHCU, 20 pts (18.6%) were alive and returned to sDay-Hospital (DH) setting due to improvement of clinical conditions and 28 pts (26.3%) died while in domiciliary assistance.

IFITM3 prevents endocytosed virus particles from accessing the host cytoplasm although little is known regarding its regulatory mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that IFITM3 localization to and antiviral remodeling of endolysosomes is differentially regulated by S-palmitoylation and lysine ubiquitination. Although S-palmitoylation enhances IFITM3 membrane affinity and antiviral activity, ubiquitination decreases localization with endolysosomes and decreases antiviral activity. Interestingly, autophagy reportedly induced by IFITM3 expression is also negatively regulated by ubiquitination. However, the canonical ATG5-dependent autophagy pathway is not required for IFITM3 activity, indicating that virus trafficking from endolysosomes to autophagosomes is not a prerequisite for influenza virus restriction. Our characterization of IFITM3 ubiquitination sites also challenges the dual-pass membrane topology predicted for this protein family. We thus evaluated topology by N-linked glycosylation site insertion and protein lipidation mapping in conjunction with cellular fractionation and fluorescence imaging. Based on these studies, we propose that IFITM3 is predominantly an intramembrane protein where both the N and C termini face the cytoplasm. In sum, by characterizing S-palmitoylation and ubiquitination of IFITM3, we have gained a better understanding of the trafficking, activity, and intramembrane topology of this important IFN-induced effector protein.","output":"S-palmitoylation and ubiquitination differentially regulate interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3)-mediated resistance to influenza virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Los coronavirus son una familia de virus que causan enfermedades que van desde el resfriado comn hasta enfermedades respiratorias ms graves, circulan entre humanos y animales A veces, los coronavirus que infectan a los animales pueden evolucionar, transmitirse a las personas y convertirse en una nueva cepa de coronavirus capaz de provocar enfermedades en los seres humanos, tal y como sucedi con el Sndrome Respiratorio Agudo Severo (SARS), en Asia en febrero de 2003 y, el Sndrome Respiratorio de Oriente Medio (MERS-CoV), que fue detectado por primera vez en Arabia Saudita en 2012","output":"Informacin general sobre el Nuevo Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, the world approaches the 2 million declared infected cases and death toll rises well above the 100 thousand.

Whether this action may lead to further epidemic recrudescence, to a following second wave of cases or conversely, help return to previous normality, is a subject of great debate and interest to all other countries affected by COVID-19. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we had also incorporated effects of social confinement. We now modify this previous model configuration to mimic potential post-confinement scenarios, by simulating from instant massive liberation of different portions of the confined population, up to a more gradual incorporation of people to work. Results show how current lockdown conditions should be extended at least two weeks more to prevent a new escalation in cases and deaths, as well as a larger second wave occurring in just a few months. Conversely, best-case scenario in terms of lower COVID-19 incidence and casualties should gradually incorporate workers back in a daily proportion at most 30 percent higher than that of previous confinement. The former should begin not earlier than by the end of April and it would represent approximately 600 thousand people or a 3.75% rate for the whole of Spain.","output":"The end of the social confinement in Spain and the COVID-19 re-emergence risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study was conducted to investigate mental health levels in Korean adults during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and determine their predictors.

The absence of P. medius genome sequence presents an important obstacle for further studies of virusChost interactions and better understanding of mechanisms of zoonotic viral emergence. Generation of the high-quality genome sequence is often linked to a considerable effort associated to elevated costs. Although secondary scaffolding methods have reduced sequencing expenses, they imply the development of new tools for the integration of different data sources to achieve more reliable sequencing results. We initially sequenced the P. medius genome using the combination of Illumina paired-end and Nanopore sequencing, with a depth of 57.4x and 6.1x, respectively. Then, we introduced the novel scaff2link software to integrate multiple sources of information for secondary scaffolding, allowing to remove the association with discordant information among two sources. Different quality metrics were next produced to validate the benefits from secondary scaffolding. The P. medius genome, assembled by this method, has a length of 1,985 Mb and consists of 33,613 contigs and 16,113 scaffolds with an NG50 of 19 Mb. At least 22.5% of the assembled sequences is covered by interspersed repeats already described in other species and 19,823 coding genes are annotated. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the clustering of P. medius genome with two other Pteropus bat species, P. alecto and P. vampyrus, for which genome sequences are currently available. SARS-CoV entry receptor ACE2 sequence of P. medius was 82.7% identical with ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus bats, thought to be the natural host of SARS-CoV. Altogether, our results confirm that a lower depth of sequencing is enough to obtain a valuable genome sequence, using secondary scaffolding approaches and demonstrate the benefits of the scaff2link application. The genome sequence is now available to the scientific community to (i) proceed with further genomic analysis of P. medius, (ii) to characterize the underlying mechanism allowing Nipah virus maintenance and perpetuation in its bat host, and (iii) to monitor their evolutionary pathways toward a better understanding of bats ability to control viral infections.","output":"Sequencing the Genome of Indian Flying Fox, Natural Reservoir of Nipah Virus, Using Hybrid Assembly and Conservative Secondary Scaffolding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food insecurity is an important contributor to health and a factor in both underweight and malnutrition, and overweight and obesity.

This current research employed a mixed methods approach to begin to fill this gap by exploring the dietary intake, anthropometric characteristics, and food security status of rural Indian women. In total, 78 household were surveyed. The average waist measurement, waist to hip ratio, and BMI were all above WHO recommendations, with two thirds of participants categorized as obese. Contributing to these findings was a very limited diet, high in energy, and low in protein and iron.

Evidence indicates deleterious impact of this disease upon male reproductive health. It is concerning that COVID-19 may contribute to the already global declining trend of male fertility. The adverse impacts of COVID-19 on male reproduction may primarily be attributed to the induction of systemic inflammatory responses and oxidative stress (OS), which operate as a vicious loop. Bringing the systemic inflammation to a halt is critical for putting out the cytokine storm induced by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The possibility of OS playing a prime role in COVID-19-mediated male reproductive dysfunctions has led to the advocacy of antioxidant therapy. An array of antioxidant defense medications has shown to be effective in experimental and clinical studies of COVID-19.

The goal of this study was to better understand the regulation of innate IFN-lambda responses in vitro in primary human infant airway epithelial cells (AECs) and in vivo using nasal aspirates during viral respiratory infections. METHODS IFN-lambda protein levels were quantified: I) in human infant AECs exposed to (poly(I:C) dsRNA) under different experimental conditions (n=8 donors); and II) in nasal aspirates of young children (3 years) hospitalized with viral respiratory infection (n=138) and in uninfected controls (n= 74). In vivo IFN-lambda airway levels during viral infections were correlated with individual characteristics and respiratory disease parameters. RESULTS Our in vitro experiments showed that the poly(I:C)-induced innate production of IFN-lambda in human infant AECs is regulated by: I) p38-MAPK/NF-kB dependent mechanism; and II) exposure to pro-inflammatory signals such as IL1. Our in vivo studies demonstrated that: I) infants (<18 months) had higher virus-induced IFN-lambda airway secretion; II) subjects with RSV infection showed the highest IFN-lambda airway levels; and III) individuals with the highest virus-induced IFN-lambda levels (>90th percentile) had higher viral loads and were more likely to have respiratory sick visits within 12-months of discharge (OR= 5.8). CONCLUSION IFN-lambda responses to dsRNA in the human infant airway epithelium are regulated by p38-MAPK and NF-kB signaling.

Overall, in both datasets, we observe a moral framing that is congruent with the public perception of the political parties. In the US dataset, democrats have a tendency to frame tweets in terms of care, while loyalty is a characteristic frame for republicans. In the Austrian dataset, we find that the followers of the governing conservative party emphasize care, which is a key message and moral frame in the party's COVID-19 campaign slogan.

Building on the job demands-resources (JD-R) model applied to safety at work, in this study we proposed that the perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19 at work can be conceptualized as a job demand (i.e., a risk factor for work-related stress), whereas those characteristics of the job (physical and psychosocial) that help workers to reduce or manage this risk can be conceived as job resources (i.e., protective factors). We hypothesized that the perceived risk of being infected at work is positively associated with emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, we hypothesized that job resources, in terms of safety systems, communication, decision-making, situational awareness, fatigue management, and participation in decision-making, are negatively associated with emotional exhaustion. We also hypothesized that job resources buffer the association between perceived risk and emotional exhaustion. Overall, 358 workers (mean(age) = 36.312.2 years) completed a self-report questionnaire, and the hypothesized relationships were tested using moderated multiple regression. Results largely supported our predictions. The perceived risk of being infected at work was positively associated with emotional exhaustion, whereas all the job resources were negatively associated with it. Furthermore, safety systems, communication, decision-making, and participation in decision-making buffered the relationship between the perceived risk of being infected at work and emotional exhaustion. In a perspective of prevention and health promotion, this study suggested that organizations should reduce the potential risk of being infected at work, whenever possible.

The pool of natural compounds proves to be a promising avenue for the discovery of groundbreaking cancer therapeutics. Elaeocarpus ganitrus (Rudraksha) is known to possess antioxidant properties and after a thorough review of literature, it was speculated to possess significant biomedical potential. Green synthesis of nanoparticles is an environmentally friendly approach intended to eliminate toxic waste and reduce energy consumption. This approach was reported for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles from two different solvent extracts: aqueous and methanolic. These were characterized by biophysical and spectroscopic techniques, namely, UV-Visible Spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, EDX, DLS, SEM, and GC-MS. The results showed that the nanoconjugates were spherical in geometry. Further, the assessment of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiproliferative activities was conducted which yielded results that were qualitatively positive at the nanoscale. The nanoconjugates were also evaluated for their anticancer properties using a standard MTT Assay.

MiR-125a-5p, expressed in astrocyte derived extracellular vesicles, could mediate astrocyte function to regulate neuron communication. However, the role of miR-125a-5p in DPN (diabetic peripheral neuropathy) remains elusive. MATERIALS AND METHODS Type 2 diabetic mouse (db/db) was used as DPN model, which was confirmed by detection of body weight, blood glucose, mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Astrocyte was isolated from db/db mouse and then subjected to high glucose treatment. The expression of miR-125a-5p in db/db mice and high glucose-induced astrocytes was examined by qRT-PCR analysis. Downstream target of miR-125a-5p was clarified by luciferase reporter assay. Tail vein injection of miR-125a-5p mimic into db/db mice was then performed to investigate role of miR-125a-5p on DPN. RESULTS Type 2 diabetic mice showed higher body weight and blood glucose than normal db/m mice. Thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were decreased in db/db mouse compared with db/m mouse, while GFAP and MCP-1 were increased in db/db mouse. High glucose treatment enhanced the protein expression of GFAP and MCP-1 in astrocytes. Sciatic nerve tissues in db/db mice and high glucose-induced astrocytes exhibited a decrease in miR-125a-5p. Systemic administration of miR-125a-5p mimic increased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, whereas it decreased GFAP and MCP-1. TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6) was validated as target of miR-125a-5p. CONCLUSION MiR-125a-5p in astrocytes attenuated DPN in db/db mice by up-regulation of TRAF6, which indicated the potential therapeutic effect.","output":"miR-125a-5p in astrocytes attenuates peripheral neuropathy in type 2 diabetic mice through targeting TRAF6."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ureteral obstruction secondary to ureterolithiasis in cats is a challenging situation.

The purpose of this study is to describe the stenting technique and perioperative difficulties, as well as long-term outcome and complications with ureteral stenting in 12 cats with ureteroliths. Fifteen 2.5 Fr soft double pigtail multi-fenestrated ureteral stents were placed in an anterograde fashion under open surgical approaches and with fluoroscopic guidance in 12 cats. Nine cats received a unilateral stent and three received bilateral stents. Ureterotomy or ureteral resection and end-to-end anastomosis were performed in three and four cases, respectively. In six cats, papillotomy was performed to facilitate dilatator and stent placement. All cats recovered well from the surgical procedure, except one cat, which died during the anaesthesia recovery period. Postoperative complications included dysuria (three cases, diagnosed at 15 days, 1 month and 3 months, respectively), urinary tract infection (one case, 1 month after surgery), stent migration requiring stent replacement (one case, 19 months after surgery) and stent obstruction requiring stent removal (three cases with previously end-to-end anastomosis between 2 and 8 months after surgery). Nine cats (75%) were alive at a mean follow-up of 453  194 (123-720) days. The median survival time was >415 days.

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, routine SARS-CoV-2 testing in long-term care facilities in the Province of Salzburg and centralized hospitalization in the COVID-19 unit of the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg (Austria) irrespective of symptoms was implemented. Baseline characteristics and the course of COVID-19 disease were assessed among hospitalized long-term care facility residents within the COVID-19 Registry of the Austrian Group Medical Tumor Therapy (AGMT; NCT04351529). Between the 24(th) of March and the 20(th) of April 2020, 50 COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized. The median age was 84.5 years (range: 79C88) and the median number of comorbidities and baseline medication classes was 6 (IQR: 4C7) and 5 (IQR: 3C6), respectively. At admission, 31 residents (62%) were symptomatic, nine residents (18%) pre-symptomatic whereas ten residents (20%) remained asymptomatic. The 30-day mortality rate from hospitalization was 32% and significantly higher in symptomatic residents at admission when compared to asymptomatic residents including pre-symptomatic residents (48% [95% CI: 27C63%] versus 5% [95% CI: 0C15%], p=0.006).

The WHO has classified the epidemic as a \\"public health emergency of international concern\\". A dramatic situation has unfolded with thousands of deaths, occurring mainly in the aged and very ill people. Epidemiological studies suggest that immune system function is impaired in elderly individuals and these subjects often present a deficiency in fat-soluble and hydrosoluble vitamins. METHODS: We searched for reviews describing the characteristics of autoimmune diseases and the available therapeutic protocols for their treatment. We set them as a paradigm with the purpose to uncover common pathogenetic mechanisms between these pathological conditions and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we searched for studies describing the possible efficacy of vitamins A, D, E, and C in improving the immune system function. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces strong immune system dysfunction characterized by the development of an intense proinflammatory response in the host, and the development of a life-threatening condition defined as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). This leads to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), mainly in aged people. High mortality and lethality rates have been observed in elderly subjects with CoV-2-related infection. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamins may shift the proinflammatory Th17-mediated immune response arising in autoimmune diseases towards a T-cell regulatory phenotype. This review discusses the possible activity of vitamins A, D, E, and C in restoring normal antiviral immune system function and the potential therapeutic role of these micronutrients as part of a therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Cytokine storm in aged people with CoV-2: possible role of vitamins as therapy or preventive strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We provide the readers with a review of cardiac complications in children with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and its short-term outcomes.

Accordingly, the EU Emission Trading System (ETS) will be revised to maintain economic growth against possible losses in competitiveness, leading to carbon leakage. Carbon border adjustment (CBA) is one of the mechanisms proposed to tackle the carbon leakage problem. In this paper, we provide a first-order estimate of the potential impacts of a possible CBA across production sectors and build a dynamic, multi-sectoral applied general equilibrium (AGE) model to study the overall macroeconomic impact of the EGD on the Turkish economy. Then, we extend our analysis to document the potential benefits of a more active climate policy. The model is in the Walrasian tradition wherein aggregate supply and demand actions are simulated with the interplay of relative prices to bring equilibrium in the markets for goods, for labor, and for foreign exchange. Constructed around 24 production sectors, the model accommodates flexible, multi-level functional forms to link production activities with gaseous emissions, a government entity to maintain taxation, and public expenditures, as well as administration of environmental policy instruments, all within an open-economy macroeconomic environment. Our results suggest that the potential adverse impact of the CBA on the Turkish economy would range between 2.7 and 3.6% loss of the GDP by 2030 over the business-as-(un)usual base path. We also document that under an alternative scenario through which Turkey is modeled as an active agent in the international climate policy arena embedding decarbonization into her official macroeconomic policy agenda, she can achieve a superior pathway for national income and a reduced carbon burden.","output":"Potential effects of the EUs carbon border adjustment mechanism on the Turkish economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Allogeneic solid organ transplantation is currently the only treatment option for end stage organ disease. The shortage of available donor organs has driven efforts to utilize xenogeneic organs for transplantation. In vitro methods for evaluating immune-compatibility are a quick and low cost means of screening novel tissue products prior to more involved, expensive, and invasive live animal studies. Recently, a new analog of the DNA base thymidine, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), was developed. It may be used in a fast, efficient and specific means of evaluating cell proliferation via flow cytometry. This study was designed to test and optimize this platform for assessing equine xenogeneic one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) to porcine stimulator cells. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that an enriched T-lymphocyte (T-cell) population would generate a stronger proliferative response to stimulation, and higher levels of cytokine production when compared to unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs and T-cells were isolated from 3 horses and 4 pigs. Equine xenogeneic MLRs were set up using porcine allogeneic MLRs as a reference for clinically acceptable levels of cell proliferation. Equine T-cells showed significantly greater EdU incorporation in one-way xenogeneic MLRs than equine PBMCs. However, there was no significant difference in cell proliferation between porcine T-cell and PBMC as responders in allogenic one-way MLRs. Given the results of this study, we consider that enriched equine T-cells should be used in preference to unfractionated PBMCs when attempting to evaluate the equine xenogeneic response using the EdU assay as an indicator of suitability for transplant in vivo.","output":"Evaluation of equine xenogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, some ophthalmologists across the United Kingdom (UK) have been redeployed to areas of need across the National Health Service (NHS).

METHOD: Online anonymous survey around the existing guidance on safe redeployment of secondary care NHS staff and PPE use by NHS England and Public Health England respectively. The survey was open to all ophthalmologists across the UK irrespective of their redeployment status. FINDINGS: 145 surveys were completed and returned during a 2-week period between 17th April 2020 and 1st May 2020, when 52% of ophthalmologists were redeployed. The majority of this group consisted of ophthalmologists in training (79%). 81% of those redeployed were assigned to areas of the hospital where patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease were being treated as inpatients. There was a statistically significant improvement in anxiety level following redeployment which was mainly attributed to the support received by staff within the redeployed area. 71% of the redeployed group were found to have sufficient PPE was provided for the area they worked in. INTERPRETATION: This is the first national survey performed on redeployment of ophthalmologists in the UK.

Among numerous immune signatures, low in vivo numbers of naive CD4(+) recent thymic emigrants and peripheral dendritic cells correlated well with reduced acute responsiveness and altered long-term persistence of human cellular immunity to YF vaccination.

Using a hypertension-induced model, we confirm that IGF-1 deficient mice exhibited worsened microhemorrhages than controls. The retinas of IGF-1 deficient animals do not exhibit microhemorrhages but do exhibit signs of vascular damage and retinal stress such as patterns of vascular constriction and Mller cell activation. These signs of retinal stress are not accompanied by retinal degeneration or impaired neuronal function.

Newly developed neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 were investigated. The frequency and clinical features of the neurological manifestations were analyzed according to disease severity, which was classified according to World Health Organization interim guidance. RESULTS: Of the 306 symptomatic patients, 186 (60.8%) developed at least one neurological manifestation during hospitalization. The most common neurological symptom was headache (n=102, 33.3%), followed by myalgia (n=96, 31.4%) and anosmia/ageusia (n=54, 17.6%). Acute stroke (all ischemic stroke) occurred in three (1.0%) patients, and new-onset seizures occurred in two (0.7%). Neurological manifestation was a presenting symptom of COVID-19 in 72 (23.5%) patients, and was the only symptom of COVID-19 in 12 (3.9%).

During the current pandemic, when patients present with new-onset neurological symptoms, COVID-19 may be considered as part of the differential diagnosis. Attention to severe neurological complications is needed, especially in patients with severe or critical COVID-19.","output":"Neurological Manifestations in Patients with COVID-19: Experiences from the Central Infectious Diseases Hospital in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a promising substitution for streamlining COVID-19 diagnoses. However, concerns surrounding security and trustworthiness impede the collection of large-scale representative medical data, posing a considerable challenge for training a well-generalised model in clinical practices. To address this, we launch the Unified CT-COVID AI Diagnostic Initiative (UCADI), where the AI model can be distributedly trained and independently executed at each host institution under a federated learning framework (FL) without data sharing. Here we show that our FL model outperformed all the local models by a large yield (test sensitivity /specificity in China: 0.973/0.951, in the UK: 0.730/0.942), achieving comparable performance with a panel of professional radiologists. We further evaluated the model on the hold-out (collected from another two hospitals leaving out the FL) and heterogeneous (acquired with contrast materials) data, provided visual explanations for decisions made by the model, and analysed the trade-offs between the model performance and the communication costs in the federated training process. Our study is based on 9,573 chest computed tomography scans (CTs) from 3,336 patients collected from 23 hospitals located in China and the UK. Collectively, our work advanced the prospects of utilising federated learning for privacy-preserving AI in digital health.","output":"Advancing COVID-19 Diagnosis with Privacy-Preserving Collaboration in Artificial Intelligence (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to identify the main risk groups according to their significance on imports of agricultural products.

These schemes have routinely been used to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in countries across the world. The number of positive tests in a given region can provide local insights into important epidemiological parameters, such as prevalence and effective reproduction number. Moreover, targeted testing data has been used inform the deployment of localised non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, surveillance schemes typically suffer from ascertainment bias; the individuals who are tested are not necessarily representative of the wider population of interest. Here, we show that data from randomised testing schemes, such as the REACT study in the UK, can be used to debias fine-scale targeted testing data in order to provide accurate localised estimates of the number of infectious individuals. We develop a novel, integrative causal framework that explicitly models the process underlying the selection of individuals for targeted testing. The output from our model can readily be incorporated into longitudinal analyses to provide local estimates of the reproduction number. We apply our model to characterise the size of the infectious population in England between June 2020 and January 2021. Our local estimates of the effective reproduction number are predictive of future changes in positive case numbers. We also capture local increases in both prevalence and effective reproductive number in the South East from November 2020 to December 2020, reflecting the spread of the Kent variant.

In January 2021, Major League Baseball legend and Hall of Famer, Hank Aaron, passed away at the age of 86 years from natural causes, just 2 weeks after he received the COVID-19 vaccine. Antivaccination groups attempted to link his death to the Moderna vaccine, similar to other attempts misrepresenting data from the VAERS to spread COVID-19 misinformation. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the spread of misinformation linked to erroneous claims about Hank Aarons death on Twitter and then characterized different vaccine misinformation and hesitancy themes generated from users who interacted with this misinformation discourse. METHODS: An initial sample of tweets from January 31, 2021, to February 6, 2021, was queried from the Twitter Search Application Programming Interface using the keywords Hank Aaron and vaccine. The sample was manually annotated for misinformation, reporting or news media, and public reaction. Nonmedia user accounts were also classified if they were verified by Twitter. A second sample of tweets, representing direct comments or retweets to misinformation-labeled content, was also collected. User sentiment toward misinformation, positive (agree) or negative (disagree), was recorded. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix from the World Health Organization was used to code the second sample of tweets for factors influencing vaccine confidence. RESULTS: A total of 436 tweets were initially sampled from the Twitter Search Application Programming Interface. Misinformation was the most prominent content type (n=244, 56%) detected, followed by public reaction (n=122, 28%) and media reporting (n=69, 16%). No misinformation-related content reviewed was labeled as misleading by Twitter at the time of the study. An additional 1243 comments on misinformation-labeled tweets from 973 unique users were also collected, with 779 comments deemed relevant to study aims. Most of these comments expressed positive sentiment (n=612, 78.6%) to misinformation and did not refute it. Based on the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts framework, the most common vaccine hesitancy theme was individual or group influences (n=508, 65%), followed by vaccine or vaccination-specific influences (n=110, 14%) and contextual influences (n=93, 12%). Common misinformation themes observed included linking the death of Hank Aaron to suspicious elderly deaths following vaccination, claims about vaccines being used for depopulation, death panels, federal officials targeting Black Americans, and misinterpretation of VAERS reports. Four users engaging with or posting misinformation were verified on Twitter at the time of data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that the death of a high-profile ethnic minority celebrity led to the spread of misinformation on Twitter. This misinformation directly challenged the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines at a time when ensuring vaccine coverage among minority populations was paramount. Misinformation targeted at minority groups and echoed by other verified Twitter users has the potential to generate unwarranted vaccine hesitancy at the expense of people such as Hank Aaron who sought to promote public health and community immunity.","output":"Spread of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation in the Ninth Inning: Retrospective Observational Infodemic Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted higher education across the globe.

Previous authors have suggested the use of color-flow duplex monitoring, magnetic resonance angiography and segmental pressure monitoring as objective steps to ascertain blood flow following adequate internal fixation. We examine the use of the waveform of the pulse oximeter in objectively determining a perfused limb and in predicting the need for surgical exploration in patients who present with a pulseless perfused hand after operative stabilisation for supracondylar fracture of the humerus. METHODS A retrospective review of all supracondylar fractures over a 60 month duration (2005-2009) in our instituition was performed. Each electronic record was reviewed and limbs which had absent radial pulse following admission were identified. X-ray films of each of the patients were reviewed. A search using the Pubmed database was performed with the following keywords, supracondylar humerus fracture, pediatric, pulseless, vascular injury, arterial repair. RESULTS In this series of pulseless perfused hands following operative fixation of supracondylar fracture, a total of 26 patients were reviewed. All were Gartland grade III extension type fractures. Postoperative pulse oximeter waveforms were present in all but 4 patients. These patients subsequently had exploration of the brachial artery with significant findings. In the remaining 22 patients, waveforms were present and the child had return of the radial pulse soon after operative fixation without any further need for surgical exploration. At 24 months follow-up, all children were well with no neurovascular compromise. CONCLUSIONS The presence of a waveform on a pulse oximeter is a sensitive and easily available modality in determining vascular perfusion as compared to other more complex investigations.

Because the MERS-CoV risk-standardized mortality rates are currently unavailable in the literature, the author concentrated on developing a method to estimate the risk-standardized mortality rates using MERS-CoV 3- and 30-day mortality measures. METHODS: MERS-CoV data in Saudi Arabia is publicly reported and made available through the Saudi Ministry of Health (SMOH) website. The author studied 660 MERS-CoV patients who were reported by the SMOH between December 2, 2014 and November 12, 2016. The data gathered contained basic demographic information (age, gender, and nationality), healthcare worker, source of infection, pre-existing illness, symptomatic, severity of illness, and regions in Saudi Arabia. The status and date of mortality were also reported. Cox-proportional hazard (CPH) models were applied to estimate the hazard ratios for the predictors of 3- and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: 3-day, 30-day, and overall mortality were found to be 13.8%, 28.3%, and 29.8%, respectively. According to CPH, multivariate predictors of 3-day mortality were elderly, non-healthcare workers, illness severity, and hospital-acquired infections (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) =1.7; 8.8; 6.5; and 2.8, respectively). Multivariate predictors of 30-day mortality were elderly, non-healthcare workers, pre-existing illness, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections (aHR =1.7; 19.2; 2.1; 3.7; and 2.9, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Several factors were identified that could influence mortality outcomes at 3 days and 30 days, including age (elderly), non-healthcare workers, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections.

The analyzed outcome variables were as follows: (a) clinical improvement (O2 saturation and O2 supply); (b) biochemical improvement (fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, ferritin, LDH, IL-6, and CRP); (c) radiological improvement. The treatment protocol consisted of 5 sessions (1 session/day) of intra-rectal ozone, applied in a volume of 100 mL and a concentration of 35 g/mL. The Protocol was previously approved by the Hospital's Health Care Ethics Committee (CEAS) (Report 15/4/2020) for compassionate use in the face of this exceptional pandemic situation, and prior informed consent was obtained from the patient/legal representative. The patients improved oxygen saturation, as observed by the lower number of desaturations and the lower supply of O2.

Interventions at the patient, clinician, and health care system levels used to address these gaps are described, and promising approaches from around the world are highlighted. RESULTS: Of 102 potential studies identified in the search, 27 (including five non-U.S. studies) were included. The studies revealed that lack of clinician and patient knowledge about OCD and misdiagnosis contributes to its underdetection. Suboptimal prescribing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications and limited use of exposure and response prevention, as a first-line psychotherapy, contribute to OCD undertreatment.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a commercially available sterile surgical helmet system (SSHS) can be considered protective against COVID-19 and therefore safe for use. METHODS: A double-blinded randomized controlled study was performed to investigate the efficacy of the ViVi? SSHS with a high-efficiency particulate air filter called HFD Hood (THI, Total Healthcare Innovation GmbH, Feistritz im Rosental, Austria) to protect against respiratory droplets. Forty recruited participants were divided into two different groups. The SSHS was tested using a validated qualitative test for respirator masks through saccharin or placebo solutions based on random allocation into two cohorts. Saccharin droplets are a validated surrogated marker for any elements of viral size, such as coronaviruses. A positive report of sweet taste after saccharin exposure was suggestive of ViVi? SSHS inefficacy in protection against droplets. RESULTS: One participant out of 21 (4.8%) reported positive for taste within the placebo cohort, while five out of 19 (26.3%) reported positive for taste within the saccharin cohort upon testing. Two out of 21 (9.5%) participants reported positive for taste within the placebo cohort, and two out of 19 (10.5%) reported positive for taste within the saccharin cohort upon retesting.

METHODS: We analyzed pooled patient data from 2 hospital-based respiratory virus surveillance cohorts in 2 regions of Canada during 3 consecutive seasons (2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18; n = 2119). We included patients aged  18 years who developed influenza-like illness or pneumonia and were hospitalized for management. We included patients confirmed positive for  1 virus by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], human rhinovirus/enterovirus (hRV), human coronavirus (hCoV), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza viruses). We compared patient characteristics, clinical severity conventional outcomes (e.g., hospital length-of stay, 30-day mortality) and ordinal outcomes (5 levels: discharged, receiving convalescent care, acute ward or intensive care unit [ICU] care and death) for patients with NIRV infections and those with influenza. RESULTS: Among 2119 adults who were admitted to hospital, 1156 patients (54.6%) had NIRV infections (hRV 14.9%, RSV 12.9%, hCoV 8.2%) and 963 patients (45.4%) had influenza (n = 963). Patients with NIRVs were younger (mean 66.4 [standard deviation 20.4] yr), and more commonly had immunocompromising conditions (30.3%) and delay in diagnosis (median 4.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 2.0C7.0] days). Overall, 14.6% (12.4%C19.5%) of NIRV infections were acquired in hospital. Admission to ICU (18.2%, median 6.0 [IQR 3.0C13.0] d), hospital length-of-stay (median 5.0 [IQR 2.0C10.0] d) and 30-day mortality (8.4%; RSV 9.5%, hRV 6.6%, hCoV 9.2%) and the ordinal outcomes were similar for patients with NIRV infection and those with influenza. Age > 60 years, immunocompromised state and hospital-acquired viral infection were associated with worse outcomes. The estimated median cost per acute care admission was $6000 (IQR $2000C$16 000). INTERPRETATION: The burden of NIRV infection is substantial in adults admitted to hospital and associated outcomes may be as severe as for influenza, suggesting a need to prioritize therapeutics and vaccines for at-risk people.","output":"Burden of noninfluenza respiratory viral infections in adults admitted to hospital: analysis of a multiyear Canadian surveillance cohort from 2 centres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"South African municipal service delivery has been an area of highly debated concern, with many citizens lacking access to basic service delivery, such as water and electricity. Fast forward to the Covid-19 Pandemic, bombarding itself into every state, home and workplace and concerns over municipal service delivery has amplified. Much like Covid-19, the fourth industrial revolution too erupted into every facet of public and private life but more optimistically, so as it promises to fast track economic development, ease mundane daily tasks and improve services and systems. This article explores municipal service delivery in South Africa and its intersection with emerging technologies, further providing prospects for future application. The article relies on a qualitative approach, reviewing primary and secondary literature, such as statistics, reports and journal articles to explore how advanced and emerging technologies have been applied at a local level to improve municipal service delivery, further attempting to understand future prospects. From the findings of the study, it is evident, that protest action against municipal service delivery has escalated in the last few years, signifying possible worsening service delivery and little adaptation of new methods and technologies.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory condition of the urinary bladder characterized by the hallmark symptoms of pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction. To facilitate IC/BPS research, we used transgenic technology to develop a novel urothelial MCP-1 secretion mouse model (URO-MCP-1). A transgene consisting of the uroplakin II gene promoter and the mouse MCP-1 coding sequence with a secretory element was constructed and microinjected. URO-MCP-1 mice were found to express MCP-1 mRNA in the bladder epithelium and MCP-1 protein in the urine, and developed bladder inflammation 24 hours after intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The inflamed bladders of URO-MCP-1 mice exhibited elevated mRNAs for interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, substance P precursor, and nerve growth factor as well as increased macrophage infiltration. In parallel with these phenotypic changes, URO-MCP-1 mice manifested significant functional changes at days 1 and 3 after cystitis induction. These functional changes included pelvic pain as measured by von Frey filament stimulation and voiding dysfunction (increased urinary frequency, reduced average volume voided per micturition, and reduced maximum volume voided per micturition) as measured by micturition cages. Micturition changes remained evident at day 7 after cystitis induction, although these changes were not statistically significant. Control wild-type C57BL/6 mice manifested no clear changes in histological, biochemical and behavioral features after similar cystitis induction with LPS.

In addition to describing the demographic attributes of these two groups and comparing them to others vulnerable to COVID-19 disease, using logistic and multivariate regression models, characteristics, travel behaviors, and transport modes are examined. Traveler spreaders are likely to be male, younger, and likely to be returning students (not classified as employed) while community spreaders are also more likely to be male, essential workers, first responders, and medical personnel at the highest risk of exposure. A risk of infection score is also derived and analyzed to identify and assess attributes of individuals most likely to contract the disease.

Patients with an aggressive course are the bottleneck of COVID-19 pandemic management, and there is urgent need of understanding the underlying mechanisms to guide clinical decisions. Myeloid cell activation is likely a key player in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Here, we longitudinally evaluated COVID-19 patients with respiratory insufficiency admitted to Hospital Santa Maria (Lisbon, Portugal), comparing those that did not require intensive care admission (NO-ICU) with those requiring high flux oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation (ICU). At each time point, an ex-vivo immune-phenotype by flow cytometry was analysed with both supervised and unsupervised approaches and clustering analysis of circulating cell subsets of monocytes (Mo) and dendritic cells (DCs), in parallel with specific antibody responses and a wide array of inflammatory mediators. Results: Contrarily to other systemic viral infections, we found that COVID-19 patients with respiratory insufficiency featured systemic immune-suppressive/ regulatory myeloid cell responses. Specifically, we observed a global reduction of CD14lowCD16+ Mo, and reduced expression of CD80, CD86, and SLAN. Contemporaneously, both Mo and DC showed increased expression of CD163, CD204, CD206 and PD-L1 immune-regulatory markers. Moreover, cDC2s, pDCs and basophils were significantly reduced. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with myeloid cell chemotaxis correlated with the phenotype changes. In NO-ICU patients (n=9) we observed a peak of these alterations at admission and a progressive regression to healthy phenotype at hospital discharge (as compared to age-matched controls, n=11). On the other hand, in ICU patients (n=11), the expression of immuno-suppressive markers progressively increased until discharge. Notably, they featured significant reduction of HLA-DRhighPD-L1- and expansion of CD80-CD86- classical Mo and an increase of HLA-DRhighPD-L1+ cells in Mo and in all DC subsets at recovery. Conclusion: Altogether, these data favour an alternative view of a beneficial role of suppressive/regulatory myeloid responses in coping with COVID-19 pathogenesis. To further support our hypothesis, we are currently collecting data on lung injury and SARS-CoV-2 viremia to correlate with the kinetics of myeloid responses.","output":"Timely acquisition of myeloid-cell immune-regulatory phenotype and COVID-19 outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A pandemic is the worst-case scenario in the field of infectious diseases.

We explored whether harmonic frequency relations, a signature property of many communication sounds, aid hearing in noise for normal hearing listeners. We measured detection thresholds in noise for tones and speech synthesized to have harmonic or inharmonic spectra. Harmonic signals were consistently easier to detect than otherwise identical inharmonic signals. Harmonicity also improved discrimination of sounds in noise. The largest benefits were observed for two-note up-down pitch discrimination and melodic contour discrimination, both of which could be performed equally well with harmonic and inharmonic tones in quiet, but which showed large harmonic advantages in noise. The results show that harmonicity facilitates hearing in noise, plausibly by providing a noise-robust pitch cue that aids detection and discrimination. Significance statement Noise is ubiquitous, and being able to hear in noise is critical to real-world behavior. We report that hearing in noise is aided by sensitivity to the harmonic frequency relations that occur in vocal communication signals and music: harmonic sounds are easier to hear in noise than inharmonic sounds. This effect was present in both musicians and non-musicians and for synthetic as well as natural sounds, suggesting a role in everyday hearing.","output":"Harmonicity aids hearing in noise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spectroscopic observations of the emission lines formed in the solar transition region (TR) commonly show persistent downflows of the order of 10--15 km/s.

To provide theoretical support, we use an already existing 2.5D MHD simulation of spicules performed with the Bifrost code. We find ample occurrences of downflowing RREs and show several examples of their spatio-temporal evolution, sampling multiple wavelength channels ranging from the cooler chromospheric to hotter coronal channels. These downflowing features are thought to be likely associated with the returning components of the previously heated spicular plasma. Furthermore, the TR Doppler shifts associated with them are close to the average red shifts observed in this region which further implies that these flows could (partly) be responsible for the persistent downflows observed in the TR. We also propose two mechanisms (a typical upflow followed by a downflow and downflows along a loop), from the perspective of numerical simulation, that could explain the ubiquitous occurrence of such downflows. A detailed comparison between the synthetic and observed spectral characteristics, reveals a distinctive match, and further suggests an impact on the heating of the solar atmosphere. We present evidence that suggests that at least some of the downflowing RREs are the chromospheric counterparts of the TR and lower coronal downflows.","output":"Evidence of multithermal nature of spicular downflows.

This limits not only the ability to fit PPE to medical practitioners, but also the ability to rapidly prototype and produce alternative sources of PPE as it is difficult to validate fit. At the George Washington University, we evaluated an easily sourced method of qualitative fit testing using a nebulizer or atomizer and a sodium saccharin solution in water. If aerosolized saccharin entered candidate masks due to poor fit or inadequate filtration, then a sweet taste was detected in the mouth of the user. This method was tested against previously fit tested Milwaukee N95 and 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator as a positive control. A Chinese sourced KN95, cotton cloth material, and surgical mask were tested as other masks of interest. Sensitivity testing was done with no mask prior to fit test. A sweet taste was detected for both the surgical mask and cotton cloth, demonstrating a lack of seal. However, there was no sweet taste detected for the Milwaukee N95, 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator, or Chinese KN95. These results demonstrate this could be a valuable methodology for rapid prototyping, evaluation, and validation of fit in a non-clinical environment for use in creation of PPE. This method should be not be used without confirmation in a formal qualitative or quantitative fit test but can be used to preserve those resources until developers are confident that potential new N95 comparable respirators will pass.

Over the past few decades, an increasing number of studies about bronchoscopy have been published. However, little is known about their qualities and characteristics. METHODS: All of the databases in Web of Science (including the Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Citation Index, KCI-Korean Journal Database, MEDLINE, Russian Science Citation Index, and SciELO Citation Index) were utilized to identify articles published from 1990 to 2020. The top 100 most cited articles about bronchoscopy were selected for degree centrality analysis and analyses regarding publication time, total citation number, the citation density, time-related flux, first author, published journal, geographic origin, and research theme. RESULTS: The selected articles were published mainly in the 2000s and 1990s. Citations per article ranged from 731 to 196. The leading country was the USA, followed by the United Kingdom. The most frequently studied themes were bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and biopsy. The degree centrality analysis connoted that BAL, inflammation, diagnosis had a high degree of centrality in the 1990s, while diagnosis, BAL, biopsy, prospective took centre stage in the 2000s.

Understanding South Asians awareness, attitudes and experiences of early measures for the prevention of COVID-19 is key to improving the effectiveness and mitigating the social and economic impacts of pandemic responses at a critical time for the Region. METHODS: We assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of 29,809 adult men and women, at 93 locations across four South Asian countries. Data were collected during the national lockdowns implemented from March to July 2020, and compared with data collected prior to the pandemic as part of an ongoing prospective surveillance initiative. RESULTS: Participants were 61% female, mean age 45.1 years. Almost half had one or more chronic disease, including diabetes (16%), hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%). Knowledge of the primary COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes was high, but access to hygiene and personal protection resources was low (running water 63%, hand sanitisers 53%, paper tissues 48%). Key preventive measures were not widely adopted. Knowledge, access to, and uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures were low amongst people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Fifteen percent of people receiving treatment for chronic diseases reported loss of access to long-term medications; 40% reported symptoms suggestive of anxiety or depression. The prevalence of unemployment rose from 9.3% to 39.4% (P < 0.001), and household income fell by 52% (P < 0.001) during the lockdown.

Scandals arising out of sharing data during medical research have pointed out that going beyond the requirements of law may be necessary for sustaining trust in data-intensive health research. We propose building upon the use of a social licence for achieving such ethical governance. MAIN TEXT: We performed a narrative review of the social licence as presented in the biomedical literature. We used a systematic search and selection process, followed by a critical conceptual analysis. The systematic search resulted in nine publications. Our conceptual analysis aims to clarify how societal permission can be granted to health research projects which rely upon the reuse and/or linkage of health data. These activities may be morally demanding. For these types of activities, a moral legitimation, beyond the limits of law, may need to be sought in order to preserve trust. Our analysis indicates that a social licence encourages us to recognise a broad range of stakeholder interests and perspectives in data-intensive health research. This is especially true for patients contributing data. Incorporating such a practice paves the way towards an ethical governance, based upon trust. Public engagement that involves patients from the start is called for to strengthen this social licence. CONCLUSIONS: There are several merits to using the concept of social licence as a guideline for ethical governance.

As health care professionals dedicated to understanding and alleviating disease, many radiation oncologists have failed to acknowledge how structural racism affects the health and well-being of the patients we aim to serve. The literature is full of descriptive statistics showing the higher incidence and mortality experienced by the Black population for health conditions ranging from infant mortality to infectious disease, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acknowledgment that the root of health disparities experienced by Black people in this country are based in racism is essential to moving the nation and the field of radiation oncology forward. With this lens, a brief overview of structural and institutional racism shapes a discussion of what radiation oncologists and the organizations that represent them can do to address this scourge. As members of a technological field, we often harness the power of data to advance human health and approach challenging diseases with optimism that multidisciplinary effort can produce cure. A few principles to mitigate the longstanding issues of Black marginalization within the field have been recommended via the ATIP (Acknowledgment, Transparency, Intentionality, and rePresentation) and LEADS (Learn, Engage, Advocate, Defend, Support) approaches.

However, the interaction mechanisms at the material-bio interface, and further understandings on physicochemical property-dependent modulation of the immune responses still remain uncertain. Herein, a library of AlOOH nanorods with well-defined aspect ratios is designed to explore the mechanisms of adjuvanticity. The aspect ratios of AlOOH nanorods were demonstrated to be intrinsically modulated by the hydroxide supersaturation level during crystal growth, leading to the differences in surface free energy (SFE). As a result, higher aspect ratio AlOOH nanoadjuvants with lower SFE exhibited more hydrophobic surface, resulting in more membrane depolarization, cellular uptake and dendritic cell (DC) activation. By using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) virus-like particles (VLPs) or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) as model antigens, AlOOH nanorods with higher aspect ratio were determined to elicit more potent humoral immune responses, which could be attributed to the enhanced DC activation and the efficient antigen trafficking to the draining lymph nodes. Our findings highlight the critical role of aspect ratio of AlOOH nanorods in modulating adjuvanticity, and further provide a design strategy for engineered nanoadjuvants for prophylactic vaccines.","output":"Mechanistic understanding of the aspect ratio-dependent adjuvanticity of engineered aluminum oxyhydroxide nanorods in prophylactic vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tobacco and alcohol use are major behavioural risks in developing countries like Nepal, which are contributing to a rapid increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This causal relationship is further complicated by the multi-level social determinants such as socio-political context, socio-economic factors and health systems. The systems approach has potential to facilitate understanding of such complex causal mechanisms. The objective of this paper is to describe the role of tobacco and alcohol use in the interaction of social determinants of NCDs in Nepal. METHOD: The study adopted a qualitative study design guided by the Systemic Intervention methodology. The study involved key informant interviews (n = 63) and focus group discussions (n = 12) at different levels (national, district and/or community) and was informed by the adapted Social Determinants of Health Framework. The data analysis involved case study-based thematic analysis using framework approach and development of causal loop diagrams. The study also involved three sense-making sessions with key stakeholders. RESULTS: Three key themes and causal loop diagrams emerged from the data analysis. Widespread availability of tobacco and alcohol products contributed to the use and addiction of tobacco and alcohol. Low focus on primary prevention by health systems and political influence of tobacco and alcohol industries were the major contributors to the problem. Gender and socio-economic status of families/communities were identified as key social determinants of tobacco and alcohol use. CONCLUSION: Tobacco and alcohol use facilitated interaction of the social determinants of NCDs in the context of Nepal. Socio-economic status of families was both driver and outcome of tobacco and alcohol use. Health system actions to prevent NCDs were delayed mainly due to lack of system insights and commercial influence. A multi-sectoral response led by the health system is urgently needed.","output":"The role of tobacco and alcohol use in the interaction of social determinants of non-communicable diseases in Nepal: a systems perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a cosmopolitan pest of stored cereal grains and other commodities globally. Infestations caused by S. oryzae makes grains unsuitable for consumption, processing, and export. Deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used in major grain storages in India as a prophylactic treatment to control this pest. However, recurrent use of this insecticide had led to genetic resistance in S. oryzae, questioning its ongoing use at the current recommended concentration. RESULTS: Dose response analysis of resistant (Delta-R) and susceptible (Lab-S) strains of S. oryzae collected from grain storages across southern India, revealed that Delta-R was 134-fold more resistant than the Lab-S at LC50 . A concentration of 180 ppm over 48 h effectively discriminated 16 resistant field populations from Lab-S with per cent resistance ranging from 8.72 to 75.86%. Exposing all the resistant populations to 1000 ppm over 48 h identified twelve populations with strongly resistant individuals and confirmed the existence of two distinct resistance phenotypes, 'weak' and 'strong' in S. oryzae. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the vgsc gene in Delta-R identified a single target site mutation, T929I conferring resistance in S. oryzae. CAPS marker analysis of this allele confirmed that frequency of resistance is high (up to 0.96) supporting the results of phenotypic analysis. CONCLUSION: Both phenotype and molecular marker analyses clearly demonstrated that deltamethrin at 180 and 1000 ppm can be used to discriminate weakly and strongly resistant populations in S. oryzae, respectively. Resistance diagnostics based on the mutation, T929I, supports our phenotypic data and indicates that resistance to deltamethrin in S. oryzae is prevalent in southern parts of India, stressing the need to identify a synergist or suitable alternatives.

A convenient small mammalian model for basic research and antiviral testing is still greatly needed. Although a small rodent, the Mongolian gerbil, was reported to be susceptible to swine genotype-4 HEV infection, whether the previous results were reliable and consistent needs to be validated by using biologically pure HEV stocks or infectious RNA. In this study, we revisited this gerbil infection model for human HEV of genotype 1, 3, or 4 (G1, G3, or G4) by HEV reverse genetics. Gerbils inoculated intrahepatically with capped G3 HEV RNA transcripts or intraperitoneally with infectious G3 cloned HEV produced robust infection, as evidenced by presence of HEV in livers, spleens, and feces for up to 7 weeks post inoculation, seroconversion, and pathological liver lesions. Furthermore, the value of the gerbil model in antiviral testing and type I IFN in host defense was assessed. We demonstrated the effectiveness of peg-IFN-2a and ribavirin in inhibiting HEV replication in gerbils. By treatment with two molecule inhibitors of TBK1, we also revealed a role of RIG-I like receptor-interferon regulatory factor 3 in host anti-HEV innate immune sensing in this in vivo model. Finally, susceptibility of G4 HEV was demonstrated in intrahepatically inoculated gerbils with infectious HEV RNA transcripts, whereas no evidence for G1 HEV susceptibility was found. The availability of the convenient gerbil model will greatly facilitate HEV-specific antiviral development and assess the mechanism of host immune response during HEV infection. IMPORTANCE HEV infects >20 million people annually, causing acute viral hepatitis as well as chronic hepatitis, neurological diseases, and pregnancy-associated high mortality, which require therapeutic intervention. The HEV antiviral research is largely limited by the lack of a convenient small animal model. Here we revisit the Mongolian gerbil model for three genotypes of human HEV by infectious HEV clones and recognized standards of experimental procedures. Fecal virus shedding, seroconversion, and pathological liver lesions could be detected in HEV-inoculated gerbils. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of this model in testing antiviral drugs, and in assessing the mechanism of host innate immune response upon HEV infection. This conventional rodent model will aid in future antiviral development and delineating mechanism of host immune response.","output":"Revisiting the Mongolian Gerbil Model for Hepatitis E Virus by Reverse Genetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: MVA-BN-brachyury-TRICOM is a recombinant vector-based therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to induce an immune response against brachyury. Brachyury, a transcription factor overexpressed in advanced cancers, has been associated with treatment resistance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and metastatic potential. MVA-BN-brachyury-TRICOM has demonstrated immunogenicity and safety in previous clinical trials of subcutaneously administered vaccine. Preclinical studies have suggested that intravenous administration of therapeutic vaccines can induce superior CD8(+) T cell responses, higher levels of systemic cytokine release, and stronger natural killer cell activation and proliferation. This is the first-in-human study of the intravenous administration of MVA-BN-brachyury-TRICOM. METHODS: Between January 2020 and March 2021, 13 patients were treated on a phase 1, open-label, 3+3 design, dose-escalation study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. The study population was adults with advanced solid tumors and was enriched for chordoma, a rare sarcoma of the notochord that overexpresses brachyury. Vaccine was administered intravenously at three DLs on days 1, 22, and 43. Blood samples were taken to assess drug pharmacokinetics and immune activation. Imaging was conducted at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months post-treatment. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability as determined by the frequency of dose-limiting toxicities; a secondary endpoint was determination of the recommended phase 2 dose. RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and no serious adverse events were attributed to the vaccine. Vaccine-related toxicities were consistent with class profile (ie, influenza-like symptoms). Cytokine release syndrome up to grade 2 was observed with no adverse outcomes. Dose-effect trend was observed for fever, chills/rigor, and hypotension. Efficacy analysis of objective response rate per RECIST 1.1 at the end of study showed one patient with a partial response, four with stable disease, and eight with progressive disease. Three patients with stable disease experienced clinical benefit in the form of improvement in pain. Immune correlatives showed T cell activation against brachyury and other tumor-associated cascade antigens. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous administration of MVA-BN-brachyury-TRICOM vaccine was safe and tolerable. Maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The maximum administered dose was 10(9) infectious units every 3 weeks for three doses. This dose was selected as the recommended phase 2 dose.

The latter are extracted from the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Virus repository. The computed LCS lengths are used to measure the dissimilarities between RNA sequences in order to work out existing clusters.

Outbreaks were recorded from different regions of the world, especially South Korea and the Middle East, and were correlated with a 35% mortality rate. MERS-COV is a single-stranded, positive RNA virus that reaches the host by binding to the receptor of dipeptidyl-peptides. Because of the unavailability of the vaccine available for the protection from MERS-COV infection, the rapid case detection, isolation, infection prevention has been recommended to combat MERS-COV infection. So, vaccines for the treatment of MERS-COV infection need to be developed urgently. A possible antiviral mechanism for preventing MERS-CoV infection has been considered to be MERS-CoV vaccines that elicit unique T-cell responses. In the present study, we incorporated both molecular docking and immunoinformatic approach to introduce a multiepitope vaccine (MEP) against MERS-CoV by selecting 15 conserved epitopes from seven viral proteins such as three structural proteins (envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein) and four non-structural proteins (ORF1a, ORF8, ORF3, ORF4a). The epitopes, which were examined for non-homologous to host and antigenicity, were selected on the basis of conservation between T-cell, B-cell, and IFN- epitopes. The selected epitopes were then connected to the adjuvant (-defensin) at the N-terminal through an AAY linker to increase the immunogenic potential. Structural modelling and physiochemical characteristic were applied to the vaccine construct developed. Afterwards the structure has been successfully docked with antigenic receptor, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) and in-silico cloning ensures that its expression efficiency is legitimate.

The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of Precipitating Hydrophobic Injectable Liquid (PHIL), a new nonadhesive liquid embolic agent, in the treatment of patients with cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. The primary end point was the rate of complete occlusion of dural arteriovenous fistulas. Secondary end points included the incidence of adverse events and clinical status at 3-month follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective multicenter study. Twenty-six consecutive patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas (de novo or previously treated) treated by injection of PHIL only or with PHIL in combination with other embolization products (such as Onyx or detachable coils) were included in the study. Recruitment started in August 2014 and ended in September 2015. RESULTS Twenty-two (85%) patients were treated with PHIL only, with 3 patients treated with both PHIL and Onyx, and 1, with both PHIL and coils. Immediate complete angiographic occlusion was achieved in 20 (77%) patients. Of the 6 patients with residual fistulas, 3 were retreated with PHIL and 1 achieved angiographic cure. An adverse event was seen in 1 patient who developed worsening of preexisting ataxia due to acute thrombosis of the draining vein. CONCLUSIONS PHIL appears to be safe and effective for endovascular treatment of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Short-term angiographic and clinical results are comparable with those of Onyx, with the added advantage of easier preparation and improved homogeneous cast visualization. The use of iodine as a radio-opacifier also produces considerably less artifacts on CT compared with tantalum-based embolic materials.","output":"Embolization of Intracranial Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas Using PHIL Liquid Embolic Agent in 26 Patients: A Multicenter Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution is a universal concern.

This paper shows that the proposed algorithm, alongside using solar energy harvesting technology, increases the energy efficiency by more than 40% while maintaining the e-Health QoS requirements. We believe this research will open new opportunities in IoT energy harvesting integration, especially in QoS-restricted environments.","output":"Enabling Energy Harvesting-Based Wi-Fi System for an e-Health Application: A MAC Layer Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Male patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fare much worse than female patients in COVID-19 severity and mortality according to data from several studies. Because of this sex disparity, researchers hypothesize that the use of exogenous sex hormone therapy and sex hormone receptor modulators might provide therapeutic potential for patients with COVID-19. Repurposing approved drugs or drug candidates at late-stage clinical development could expedite COVID-19 therapy development because their clinical formulation, routes of administration, dosing regimen, clinical pharmacology, and potential adverse events have already been established or characterized in humans. A number of exogenous sex hormones and sex hormone receptor modulators are currently or will be under clinical investigation for COVID-19 therapy. In this review, we discuss the rationale for exogenous sex hormones and sex hormone receptor modulators in COVID-19 treatment, summarize ongoing and planned clinical trials, and discuss some of the clinical pharmacology considerations on clinical study design. To inform clinical study design and facilitate the clinical development of exogenous sex hormones and sex hormone receptor modulators for COVID-19 therapy, clinical investigators should pay attention to clinical pharmacology factors such as dosing regimen, special populations (i.e. geriatrics, pregnancy, lactation, renal/hepatic impairment), and drug interactions.","output":"Exogenous sex hormones and sex hormone receptor modulators in COVID-19 - rationale and clinical pharmacology considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mounting evidence shows that physical activity, social interaction, and sensorimotor stimulation provided by environmental enrichment (EE) exert several neurobehavioral effects traditionally interpreted as enhancements relative to standard housing (SH) conditions. However, this evidence rather indicates that SH induces many deficits, which could be ameliorated by exposing animals to an environment vaguely mimicking some features of their wild habitat. Rearing rodents in social isolation (SI) can aggravate such deficits, which can be restored by SH or EE. It is not surprising, therefore, that most preclinical stress models have included severe and unnatural stressors to produce a stress response prominent enough to be distinguishable from SH or SI -frequently used as control groups. Although current stress models induce a stress-related phenotype, they may fail to represent the stress of our urban lifestyle characterized by SI, poor housing, and working environments, sedentarism, obesity, and limited access to recreational activities and exercise. In the following review, we discuss the stress of living in urban areas and how exposures to and performing activities in green environments are stress-relievers. Based on the commonalities between human and animal EE, we discuss how models of housing conditions (e.g., SI-SH-EE) could be adapted to study the stress of our modern lifestyle. The housing-conditions model might be easy to implement and replicate leading to more translational results. It may also contribute to accomplishing some ethical commitments by promoting the refinement of procedures to model stress, diminishing animal suffering, enhancing animal welfare, and eventually reducing the number of experimental animals needed.","output":"The environmental enrichment model revisited: a translatable paradigm to study the stress of our modern lifestyle."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Work from home (or remote working) has become the new normal ever since the pandemic hit the world.

We describe the evaluation of Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (TM)-Ontario Addiction Medicine and Psychosocial Interventions (ECHO-AMPI), a Canadian virtual tele-mentoring program focused on building capacity in community-based addiction care during COVID-19. Methods: We used Moore's multi-level evaluation framework for continuing education. Participants rated their satisfaction on a five-point Likert scale. A pre-post 10-item scale was used to measure self-efficacy. Participants used a binary scale to self-report post-participation whether ECHO changed their practice. Participants also responded to an open-text question around how participation in ECHO has impacted challenges experienced during the pandemic. Results: Seventy-nine healthcare professionals from 62 organizations across Ontario participated in ECHO-AMPI. Mean satisfaction ratings were high (>4.27/5), and a 12% improvement in participants' addictions care mean self-efficacy scores was observed (P < 0.001). Post-ECHO participation, 77% of participants reported practice change. Analysis of open-text responses highlighted participants felt ECHO fostered an open and supportive community, improved knowledge and skills via the acquisition of new resources, enhanced participants' interaction with their clients, and reduced professional isolation. Conclusions: ECHO-AMPI demonstrated the ability to engage providers and build addictions care capacity during COVID-19, specifically by improving learning outcomes and supporting practice change.

For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic that changed the lives of people all over the world, one observes regions with different incidences of cases. One can speculate that population density might be one of the variables that affect the incidence of cases. In populous areas, such as big cities or congested urban areas, higher COVID-19 incidences could be observed than in rural regions. It is natural to think that if population density is such an important factor, then a gradient or difference in population density might lead to a diffusion process that will proceed until equilibrium is reached. The aim of this paper consists of the inclusion of a diffusion concept into the COVID-19 modeling. With this concept, one covers a gradient-driven transfer of the infection next to epidemic growth models (SIR-type models). This is discussed for a certain period of the German situation based on the quite different incidence data for the different federal states of Germany. With this ansatz, some phenomena of the actual development of the pandemic are found to be confirmed. The model provides a possibility to investigate certain scenarios, such as border-crossings or local spreading events, and their influence on the COVID-19 propagation.

However, few studies have examined how these messages affects attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions of people who smoke. These are critical variables that can inform public health campaigns to motivate quitting smoking during the COVID-19 crisis. Methods In August 2020, we conducted an online experiment in the U.S. with 1,004 adults who smoke. Participants were randomized to one of four message conditions: COVID-19 risk, smoking risk, combined risk of smoking for COVID-19 severity, or a non-risk control. Outcomes were message reactions (emotions and reactance), attitudes and beliefs (severity, susceptibility, self-efficacy, response efficacy for smoking and COVID-19, and conspiracy beliefs), and behavioral intentions (smoking intentions, COVID-protective intentions, and information-seeking). Results Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) showed that combined risk messages elicited higher perceived severity of smoking-related disease than control messages. Similarly, the combined risk condition resulted in greater intentions to quit smoking in the next month (vs. COVID-19 risk condition) and intentions to reduce smoking in the next 6 months (vs. smoking risk and control;ps < .05). Multivariate logistic regression found that exposure to the combined risk messages (vs. control as referent) was associated with higher odds of mask-wearing intentions in the next 2 weeks (AOR = 1.97). Conclusions Health agencies can possibly use messages that communicate about the combined risk of smoking and COVID-19 as a novel strategy to motivate people who smoke to quit and take protective action for COVID-19.","output":"Examining Reactions to Smoking and COVID-19 Risk Messages: An Experimental Study with People Who Smoke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article summarizes the broad messages from pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies on the collaborations required to support companion diagnostics.

DESIGN: An inductive, descriptive design applying the critical incident technique was used to collect qualitative data between July 2020 and December 2020. SETTING: A strategic selection was made from diabetes specialist outpatient clinics at three different hospitals in eastern Norway. The hospitals, two community hospitals and one university hospital, were situated in both rural and urban areas. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria were people with T1DM aged 18C65 years. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, people with chronic pulmonary disorders, people with active cancer diseases and people diagnosed with a myocardial infarction or stroke during the previous 6 months. Semistructured individual interviews with 19 people with T1DM were conducted. RESULTS: Experiences were categorised into two main areas: increased psychosocial burden of T1DM during the COVID-19 pandemic and changed conditions for T1DM treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Uncertainty distress and social consequences from infection control measures contributed to the burden of T1DM. Disrupted T1DM follow-up and altered daily routines created challenges. However, having increased time to focus on T1DM self-management during lockdown represented an improvement. Actions to handle the situation were categorised into two main areas: actions to handle psychosocial strain related to T1DM and COVID-19 and actions to handle changed conditions for T1DM treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Patients experienced an increased psychosocial burden of T1DM and difficulties from a disrupted daily life affecting T1DM self-management routines. Uncertainty-reducing behaviours and actions to adapt to the situation provided a general sense of coping despite these difficulties.

Using the model virus liquid formulation, the stability of multiple enveloped and nonenveloped RNA and DNA viruses, including parainfluenza virus, reovirus (RV), BHV, and adenovirus (AdV), was monitored over up to a 30-week storage period. RESULTS: The BHV model virus was considered stable after 3 weeks in hydrolyzed gelatin (MW: 4000) with a 0.8 LRV (log10 reduction value) at 25 C or a 0.2 LRV at 4 C, compared to the stabilities observed in higher MW gelatin (60,000 and 160,000) with an LRV above 1.

It is therefore important to evaluate associated cognitive factors. We aimed to obtain first endorsement rate estimates of coronavirus-related conspiracy beliefs in a German-speaking general population sample and investigate whether delusion-related reasoning biases and paranoid ideation are associated with such beliefs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional non-probability online study, quota-sampled for age and gender, with 1684 adults from Germany and German-speaking Switzerland. We assessed general and specific coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, reasoning biases [jumping-to-conclusions bias (JTC), liberal acceptance bias (LA), bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE), possibility of being mistaken (PM)], and paranoid ideation, using established experimental paradigms and self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Around 10% of our sample endorsed coronavirus-related CT beliefs at least strongly, and another 20% to some degree. Overall endorsement was similar to levels observed in a UK-based study (Freeman et al., 2020b). Higher levels of conspiracy belief endorsement were associated with greater JTC, greater LA, greater BADE, higher PM, and greater paranoid ideation. Associations were mostly small to moderate and best described by non-linear relationships. CONCLUSIONS: A noticeable proportion of our sample recruited in Germany and German-speaking Switzerland endorsed coronavirus conspiracy beliefs strongly or to some degree. These beliefs are associated with reasoning biases studied in delusion research. The non-probability sampling approach limits the generalizability of findings.

The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behaviour, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multi-route transmitted respiratory infection. The following transmission routes are considered: long-range airborne transmission, short-range airborne transmission, direction inhalation of medium droplets or droplet nuclei, direct deposition of droplets of all sizes, direct and indirect contact route. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include the dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines pathogen content in droplets, exposure distance, and pathogen dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provided a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the probability of respiratory diseases transmission via different routes. It also established a basis for predicting the impact of individual-level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks.","output":"Multi-route respiratory infection: When a transmission route may dominate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infective disease generated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Given the pandemic urgency and lack of an effective cure for this disease, drug repurposing could open the way for finding a solution. Lots of investigations are ongoing to test the compounds already identified as antivirals. On the other hand, induction of type I interferons are found to play an important role in the generation of immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it was opined that the antivirals capable of triggering the interferons and their signaling pathway, could rationally be beneficial for treating COVID-19. On this basis, using a database of antivirals, called drugvirus, some antiviral agents were derived, followed by searches on their relevance to interferon induction. The examined list included drugs from different categories such as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anti-cancers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), calcium channel blocker compounds, and some others. The results as briefed here, could help in finding potential drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment. However, their advantages and risks should be taken into account through precise studies, considering a systemic approach. Even though the adverse effects of some of these drugs may overweight their benefits, considering their mechanisms and structures may give a clue for designing novel drugs in the future. Furthermore, the antiviral effect and IFN-modifying mechanisms possessed by some of these drugs might lead to a synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2, which deserve to be evaluated in further investigations.","output":"Interferon-inducer antivirals: Potential candidates to combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization declares coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and The World Economic Forum argues that the COVID-19-induced global lockdown is the biggest psychological experiment. This study is an attempt to empirically evaluate the possible adverse psychosocial effects caused by COVID-19-related lockdown, if any. To do so, a cross-sectional study is conducted based on a comprehensive online survey using snowball sampling to analyze the level of social and psychological impacts (i.e., stress, belief in stakeholders, fear of losing job, and life satisfaction) during the early stage of the outbreak in Pakistan. The questionnaire is filled out by the residents in Pakistan including working professionals and students (sample size is 428). We find that the development of stress due to COVID-19-induced lockdown is particularly because of mood swings. Additionally, a higher prevalence of stress in the children of highly educated mothers is evident (95% confidence). To assess the belief in stakeholders, we focus gender, demographics, and education. It is observed that parental education and age significantly affect the belief in several stakeholders (i.e., government, media, religious clerics, and family). The lockdown-induced fear of losing job is lower in female and male children whose fathers are graduates. Lastly, we observe that food storage and no fear of losing job significantly increases the odds of life satisfaction. These findings have important implications in the context of social insurance, parental education, and policy related to COVID-19 at various levels.

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to understand gender differences in mental health outcomes in relation to the components of gendered working environments. METHODS The review followed a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search approach and focused on studies published in 2008-2018. The protocol for the review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019124066). FINDINGS Across the 27 cohort studies included in the review, we found that (1) there was inconclusive evidence on the effect of occupational gender composition on the mental health of men and women, (2) women's mental health was more likely to be affected by long working hours than men's; however, precarious employment was more likely to be negatively associated with men's mental health, (3) exposure to traditional constructs of psychosocial job stressors negatively affected the mental health of both women and men, and (4) unemployment and retirement are associated with poorer mental health in both genders. INTERPRETATION The findings from this review indicate that gendered working environments may affect the mental health of both men and women, but the association is dependent on the specific exposure examined. There is still much to be understood about gendered working environments, and future research into work and health should be considered with a gender lens.","output":"Gendered working environments as a determinant of mental health inequalities: a systematic review of 27 studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Owing to the pandemic issue of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is imperative to keep up more than 1-m of social distancing and 37 5 C temperature to stop the transmission of COVID-19 from human to human Therefore, it is utmost requirement to make the smart belt installed with ultrasonic and LM35 sensors for distance and temperature measurements to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, respectively The embedded sensors with NodeMCU show that once anything come in the proximity of 1-m near to the smart belt or helmet fixed to human body, it automatically makes an alarm for distance contact as well as temperature of incoming/outgoing body and sends an email to the controller with the help of Blynk application through Internet of things (IoT) These data can be stored in the cloud for the future purpose However, the distance sensor has detected the movement of a person from 3 cm up to around 240 cm The LM35 temperature sensor measures the actual temperature of the host body, i e , 35 4 C with time With the help of this research, it is possible to interface a camera module which can detect the suspects It could be interfaced with global positioning system (GPS) which can give location-wise data and help us to obtain the probability of suspects at a particular region It is cost effective, i e , $14/belt which can help to control the transmission of coronavirus from human to human ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Sensor and IoT-Based Belt to Detect Distance and Temperature of COVID-19 Suspect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases caused by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and HPV have greatly endangered human health.

Many adolescents have experienced disruptions to daily life, including changes in their school routine and familys financial or emotional security, potentially impacting their emotional wellbeing. In low COVID-19 prevalence settings, the impact of isolation has been mitigated for most young people through continued face-to-face schooling, yet there may still be significant impacts on their wellbeing that could be attributed to the pandemic. METHODS: We report on data from 32,849 surveys from Year 7C12 students in 40 schools over two 2020 survey cycles (June/July: 19,240; October: 13,609), drawn from a study of 79 primary and secondary schools across Western Australia, Australia. The Child Health Utility Index (CHU9D) was used to measure difficulties and distress in responding secondary school students only. Using comparable Australian data collected six years prior to the pandemic, the CHU9D was calibrated against the Kessler-10 to establish a reliable threshold for CHU9D-rated distress. RESULTS: Compared to 14% of responding 12C18-year-olds in 2013/2014, in both 2020 survey cycles almost 40% of secondary students returned a CHU9D score above a threshold indicative of elevated difficulties and distress. Student distress increased significantly between June and October 2020. Female students, those in older Grades, those with few friendships or perceived poor quality friendships, and those with poor connectedness to school were more likely to score above the threshold. CONCLUSIONS: In a large dataset collected during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of secondary school students with scores indicative of difficulties and distress was substantially higher than a 2013/2014 benchmark, and distress increased as the pandemic progressed, despite the low local prevalence of COVID-19.

Many healthcare institutions observed significant improvements in HH performance during wave one of the COVID-19 pandemic but the sustainability of this change is unknown. Our aim was to evaluate long-term HH performance throughout subsequent waves of the pandemic across acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: HH adherence was measured using a previously validated group electronic monitoring system which was installed on all alcohol handrub and sink soap dispensers inside and outside each patient room across 56 inpatient units (35 wards and 21 critical care units) spanning 13 acute care hospitals (6 university and 7 community teaching hospitals) from 1 November 2019 to 31 May 2021. Daily HH adherence was compared with daily COVID-19 case count across Ontario. During this period, weekly performance continued to be reported to units but unit-based quality improvement discussions were inconsistent due to the COVID-19 response. RESULTS: Figure 1 depicts daily aggregate HH adherence plotted against the new daily COVID-19 case count across Ontario. An elevation in HH adherence was seen prior to the start of the first wave, rising almost to 80% and then remained above 70% for the peak of wave one. During waves two and three, peak COVID-19 case counts were associated with a maximum HH adherence of 51%, only marginally above the pre-pandemic baseline. After the end of wave one (from 1 July 2020 to 31 May 2021) the median HH performance was only 49% (interquartile range 47%-50%). Figure 1. Hand hygiene adherence across 13 acute care hospitals in comparison to overall new daily COVID-19 cases in Ontario [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Initial improvements in HH adherence preceding the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were not sustained, possibly due to increasing comfort and reduced anxiety associated with providing care to COVID-19 patients leading to a perception of reduced COVID-19 transmission risk. These findings highlight the need for HH monitoring to be tied to longitudinal unit-led quality improvement in order to achieve durable changes in practice. DISCLOSURES: Susy S.

Given the established relationship between AKI and poor prognosis, whether AKI might be a prognostic indicator for patients admitted to the hospital for SARS-CoV-2 infection would allow for a straightforward risk stratification of these patients. METHODS: We analyzed data of 623 patients admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, IT) between February 25 and April 19, 2020, for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Incidence of AKI at hospital admission was calculated, with AKI defined according to the KDIGO criteria. Multivariable Cox regression models assessed the association between AKI and overall mortality and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Overall, 108 (17%) patients had AKI at hospital admission for SARS-CoV-2 infection. After a median follow-up for survivors of 14 days (interquartile range: 8, 23), 123 patients died, while 84 patients were admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for confounders, patients who had AKI at hospital admission were at increased risk of overall mortality compared to those who did not have AKI (hazards ratio [HR]: 2.00; p = 0.0004), whereas we did not find evidence of an association between AKI and ICU admission (HR: 0.95; p = 0.9).

METHODS: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. CINHAL, EMBASE, PubMed, PsychINFO and SCOPUS were searched (2000C2019). Included articles were reviewed for the modality used to health coach, the training provided, and the outcomes. RESULTS: Twelve papers met the eligibility criteria. A majority of studies included involved a combination of modalities of pharmacist health coaching. Four papers referred to face-to-face sessions, and one study used telephone coaching. In each paper, coaching led to an improvement in clinical and non-clinical health outcomes. CONCLUSION: The training provided to health coaches varied and in some cases was not reported. Inconsistencies in reports led to difficulties when comparing study outcomes. Therefore, conclusions about the modality providing the greatest improvement in patient outcomes and the most pragmatic health coaching modality are not possible.

The role of nature became more pronounced during the coronavirus outbreak in the spring of 2020. Countries all over the world implemented confinement measures to reduce the transmission of the virus. These included but were not limited to the cancelation of public events, schools, and non-essential businesses and the prohibition of non-essential travels. However, going outside to exercise was recommended by the Belgian government. During this period, we conducted an online survey to determine if people visit nature more frequently than before and to identify the factors that contribute to this. The results are based on data from 11,352 participants in Flanders, Belgium. With the use of a bivariate and multiple regression analysis, results indicate that people visit nature more frequently than before and that nature helped to maintain social relationships during the coronavirus period. Gardens were reported to be the most popular place, followed by parks. More than half of the people experienced nature in a more positive way, and the belief that nature visits are important for general health increased. In addition, we found a positive association between nature visits and home satisfaction, as well as a positive association with subjective mental and physical health. Lastly, we identified several demographic factors contributing to the frequency of nature visits such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status.

Recent studies demonstrated that a target-controlled infusion of remifentanil effectively suppresses coughing induced by the endotracheal tube. We investigated the EC95 of remifentanil for smooth emergence without coughing from propofol anesthesia in patients undergoing transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 41 patients undergoing transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, aged 20 to 65 years, with an ASA physical status of I or II, were enrolled. For all participants, anesthesia was induced and maintained with a target-controlled infusion of remifentanil and propofol using predicted effect-site concentration (Ce). A biased coin design up-and-down sequential allocation and isotonic regression method were used to determine the remifentanil EC95 to prevent emergence coughing. In addition, we observed recovery profiles after anesthesia. RESULTS According to the study design, 19 patients received remifentanil 2.6 ng/mL Ce and 22 patients received a lower Ce, ranging from 1.0 to 2.2 ng/mL. The EC95 of remifentanil to prevent coughing was estimated as 2.51 ng/mL (95% confidence interval, 2.28-2.57 ng/mL). Despite the exclusion of 1 case because of delayed emergence, 17 of 18 patients receiving 2.6 ng/mL of remifentanil had bradypnea (<10 breaths/min) until 3 minutes after extubation. However, end-tidal carbon dioxide was maintained below 55 mm Hg during anesthetic emergence and respiratory rate recovered within 20 minutes of admission to the postanesthetic care unit.

While reviews regarding the performance of those assays exist, a review focused on the real-life clinical performance and point-of-care feasibility of those platforms was missing. Therefore, the objective of this study is to help end users (clinicians, healthcare providers and organisations) to understand the real-life performance of point-of-care assays, aiding in their implementation in decentralised, true point-of-care facilities, or inside hospitals. 871 studies were screened in 3 major databases and 51 studies were included, evaluating 20 antigen tests and 10 nucleic-acid amplification platforms.

This paper outlines an evolution informed biopsychosocial, multicomponent model to caring behavior and its derivative compassion that underpins newer approaches to psychotherapy. The paper explores the origins of caring motives and the nature and biopsychosocial functions of caring-attachment behavior. These include providing a secure base (sources of protection, validation, encouragement and guidance) and safe haven (source of soothing and comfort) for offspring along with physiological regulating functions, which are also central for compassion focused therapy. Second, it suggests that it is the way recent human cognitive competencies give rise to different types of mind awareness and knowing intentionality that transform basic caring motives into potentials for compassion. While we can care for our gardens and treasured objects, the concept of compassion is only used for sentient beings who can suffer.

High age, several comorbidities as well as poor physical fitness can negatively influence the outcome within COVID-19 infection. We investigated whether the ratio of fat to muscle area, measured in initial LDCT, can predict severe progression of COVID-19 in the follow-up period. METHOD: We analyzed 58 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection that underwent an initial LDCT in one of two included centers due to COVID-19 infection. Using the ratio of waist circumference per paravertebral muscle circumference (FMR), the body composition was estimated. Patient outcomes were rated on an ordinal scale with higher numbers representing more severe progression or disease associated complications (hospitalization/ intensive care unit (ICU)/ tracheal intubation/ death) within a follow-up period of 22 days after initial LDCT. RESULTS: In the initial LDCT a significantly higher FMR was found in patients requiring intensive care treatment within the follow-up period. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, FMR (p < .001) in addition to age (p < .01), was found to be a significant predictor of the necessity for ICU treatment of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: FMR as potential surrogate of body composition and obesity can be easily determined in initial LDCT of COVID-19 patients. Within the multivariate analysis, in addition to patient age, low muscle area in proportion to high fat area represents an additional prognostic information for the patient outcome and the need of an ICU treatment during the follow-up period within the next 22 days. This multicentric pilot study presents a method using an initial LDCT to screen opportunistically for obese patients who have an increased risk for the need of ICU treatment.

These conditions are associated to increase in the level of the pulmonary epithelium expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), which is a recognized receptor of the S protein of the causative agent SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). Severe cases are manifested by parenchymal lung involvement with a significant inflammatory response and the development of microvascular thrombosis. Several factors have been involved in developing this prothrombotic state, including the inflammatory reaction itself with the participation of proinflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction/endotheliitis, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, and possibly the tissue factor (TF) overexpression. ARS-Cov-19 ACE-2 down-regulation has been associated with an increase in angiotensin 2 (AT2). The action of proinflammatory cytokines, the increase in AT2 and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies are known factors for TF activation and overexpression. It is very likely that the overexpression of TF in COVID-19 may be related to the pathogenesis of the disease, hence the importance of knowing the aspects related to this protein and the therapeutic strategies that can be derived. Different therapeutic strategies are being built to curb the expression of TF as a therapeutic target for various prothrombotic events; therefore, analyzing this treatment strategy for COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is rational. Medications such as celecoxib, cyclosporine or colchicine can impact on COVID-19, in addition to its anti-inflammatory effect, through inhibition of TF.","output":"Role of Tissue Factor in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the Possible Ways to Inhibit It"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Because of potent immunosuppression, impaired wound healing and complications are frequent features after kidney transplantation (KTx).

RESULTS The study revealed a high rate of wound complications (200-250/y) in a high-volume center. Fifty-four patients (27%) experienced prolonged wound healing, defined as gaps, secretions, or wound complications, at 3 to 5 weeks posttransplantation, and 41 patients (21%) had impaired wound healing, defined as gaps, secretions, or wound complications after 5 weeks posttransplantation. In total, 50 patients (25%) required surgical or radiologic reintervention. Complications included lymphocele in 29 patients (14.6%), wound dehiscence in 16 (8.0%), bleeding or hematoma in 10 (5.0%), and infection in 9 (4.5%). Risk factors associated with wound complications included recipient older than 60 years, body mass index greater than 30, hemoglobin concentration less than 10 g/dL, albumin concentration less than 36 g/dL, duration of surgery more than 200 minutes, no subcutaneous sutures, and sirolimus or everolimus therapy.

We utilized a placebo literature database on various aspects of the genuine placebo/nocebo response. In 2015, we had extracted 75 systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and meta-regressions performed in major medical areas (neurology, psychiatry, internal medicine). These meta-analyses were screened for whether sex/gender differences had been noted to contribute to the placebo/nocebo effect: in only 3 such analyses female sex was associated with a higher placebo effect, indicating poor evidence for a contribution of sex to it in RCTs. This was updated with another set of meta-analyses for the current review, but did not change the overall conclusion. The same holds true for 18 meta-analyses investigating adverse event (nocebo) reporting in RCT in the placebo arm of trials. We also screened our database for papers referring to sex/gender and the placebo effect in experimental studies, and identified 28 papers reporting 29 experiments. Their results can be summarized as follows: (a) Despite higher sensitivity of pain in females, placebo analgesia is easier to elicit in males; (b) It appears that conditioning is effective specifically eliciting nocebo effects; (c) Conditioning works specifically well to elicit placebo and nocebo effects in females and with nausea; (d) Verbal suggestions are not sufficient to induce analgesia in women, but work in men. These results will be discussed with respect to the question why nausea and pain may be prone to be responsive to sex/gender differences, while other symptoms are less. Lastly, we will discuss the apparent discrepancy between RCT with low relevance of sex, and higher relevance of sex in specific experimental settings. We argue that the placebo response is predominantly the result of a conditioning (learning) response in females, while in males it predominantly may be generated via (verbal) manipulating of expectancies. In RCT therefore, the net outcome of the intervention may be the same despite different mechanisms generating the placebo effect between the sexes, while in experimental work when both pathways are separated and explicitly explored, such differences may surface.","output":"Does Sex/Gender Play a Role in Placebo and Nocebo Effects?

The protocol is used to stimulate clients to engage in positive imagery while being discouraged to actively recollect the targeted disturbing memory. Previous research into the Flash techniques efficacy shows promising results, yet controlled studies are lacking. Objectives: To test the efficacy of the Flash technique, it was compared to an abbreviated eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy protocol in a controlled experimental setting. We hypothesized that the Flash technique would lead to a larger decrease in the emotionality and vividness of an aversive autobiographical memory when compared to EMDR therapy. Our second hypothesis was that the procedure of the Flash technique would be evaluated more pleasant by its receiver. Method: The sample consisted of 60 non-clinical participants (mean age = 25.28 years; 73.33% female) who were able to recall an aversive autobiographical memory. They were randomized to either the Flash technique or the EMDR therapy condition. Measurements consisted of emotionality and vividness-ratings pre and post intervention, and at 1-week follow-up. Results: Bayesian analyses showed no differences between Flash and EMDR to the extent to which the emotionality and vividness of their memory was reduced. Afterward, the Flash technique was rated more pleasant than EMDR. Conclusion: The results support the claim that the Flash technique might be used as a brief and efficacious intervention for individuals suffering from disturbing memories. Although the results suggest that its efficacy does not differ from EMDR, the Flash technique seems to yield similar outcomes in a more pleasant way.

Ulcers mainly affect the elderly and recurrences are not uncommon. There is knowledge about life with venous leg ulcers, but the situation after healing is unexplored. This paper explores and describes meanings of experiences of daily life after healing of a hard-to-heal venous leg ulcer. METHODS: Lived experiences of 15 individuals with healed hard-to-heal venous leg ulcers generated data for this study. Interviews were recorded for analysis using a reflective lifeworld research approach. An essence emerged, further described by its constituents. RESULTS: Memories of a difficult time with leg ulcer were ever present, in a way becoming part of the self. A striving for control in daily life entailed a struggle to do what was best for the own body. After healing, a new normal emerged in daily life, a reality that encompassed the risk for a new ulcer. The body had changed physically, with marks alongside those from ageing, in a life that still went on. CONCLUSIONS: For those who had healed from a venous leg ulcer, life had changed. Even if they referred to life as normal, it was not the same normal as before.","output":"Daily life after healing of a venous leg ulcer: A lifeworld phenomenological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Usaha mikro dan kecil (UMK) paling rentan terhadap dampak pandemi COVID-19. Banyak UMK di Kabupaten Sumedang yang kurang adaptif ketika terjadi pembatasan sosial sehingga mengalami penurunan omzet bahkan sebagian lainnya menutup usaha. Diperlukan kebijakan yang tepat dari pemerintah Kabupaten Sumedang untuk mengatasi masalah tersebut, salah satunya melalui analisis kerentanan sehingga dapat diketahui daerah mana yang paling rawan pandemi COVID-19, terutama dari aspek sosial ekonomi terkait UMK. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode deskriptif kuantitatif berbasis spasial dengan teknik skoring pada setiap variabel penentu dalam analisis kerentanan yang diadopsi dari Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). Data yang digunakan adalah Potensi Desa (potensi desa) tahun 2018 dan 2019 serta beberapa data pendukung dari instansi terkait. Hasil analisis kerentanan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat satu kecamatan dengan tingkat kerentanan yang sangat tinggi yaitu Kecamatan Jatinangor, dikarenakan banyaknya UMK dan sebagian besar mata pencaharian penduduknya dari sektor-sektor yang terkena dampak restriksi sosial akibat pandemi COVID-19 seperti industri, perdagangan dan jasa. Upaya yang dapat dilakukan untuk meningkatkan ketahanan terhadap pandemi COVID-19 di tingkat daerah adalah dengan meningkatkan kapasitas adaptif, terutama mendorong kegiatan perekonomian di tingkat desa melalui peningkatan unit usaha dan skala usaha Badan Usaha Milik Desa, perluasan jangkauan sinyal internet, dan mendorong perluasan dari jaringan layanan pengiriman barang. Kata kunci: kerentanan, usaha mikro dan kecil, pandemi COVID-19 Micro and small enterprises (MSEs) are most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many MSEs in Sumedang Regency are less adaptive when there are social restrictions so that their turnover decreases and some even close their businesses. A proper policy from the Sumedang Regency government is needed to overcome this problem one of which is through a vulnerability analysis so that it can be seen which areas are most prone to the COVID-19 pandemic especially from the socio-economic aspects related to MSEs. This study uses a spatial-based quantitative descriptive method with scoring techniques on each determining variable in the vulnerability analysis adopted from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). The data used is Potensi Desa (village potential) in 2018 and 2019 as well as some supporting data from related agencies. The results of the vulnerability analysis show that there is one sub-district with a very high level of vulnerability namely Jatinangor District due to the large number of MSEs and most of the livelihoods of its population from sectors affected by social restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic such as industry trade and services. Efforts that can be made to increase resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic at the regional level are by increasing adaptive capacity especially encouraging economic activity at the village level through increasing Village-owned enterprises (BUMDES) business units and business scale expanding internet signal coverage and encouraging the expansion of the goods delivery service network.

The use of face masks in public may not protect the general public from contracting the virus, however, presumptively decreases the viral load and contributes to a favourable clinical outcome in COVID-19 disease. A certain time is required for antigen-specific T cells and B cells to fully develop. Obligatory face mask wearing in public favours the virus transmission through oral mucosa and/or conjunctival epithelium, which enables the adaptive immune responses to evolve.

Population had previously completed bladder diary, OAB-Q symptom, OAB HRQL scale, SF-36 and PGI-I questionnaires. Four weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail for new evaluation during Covid-19 outbreak. Primary endpoint was changes in number of voids/24h, urgent micturitions/24h, urinary incontinence events/24h, nocturia events. Secondary endpoints were the assessment of the change in the OAB-SF, SF-36 questionnaires and PGI-I satisfaction. RESULTS: Six hundred seventy-three patients were considered. The mean age was 63.21  10.24 years. Four weeks after the start of the social distancing measures, the increase in mean number of voids/24h (7.13  1.08 vs 9.76  2.12, p < 0.0001), urgent micturition episodes/24h (2.65  1.11 vs 4.57  1.28, p < 0.0001), nocturia episodes (1.19  1.21 vs 2.83  0.94, p < 0.0001) was observed.

However, the standardization of manufacturing myoblasts is still not established. Here we report a flask and animal-free medium-based method of manufacturing clinical-grade myoblast together with establishing releasing criteria for myoblast products under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). METHODS Quadriceps muscle biopsy samples were donated from three patients with myogenic ptosis. After biopsy samples were digested through enzymatic dissociation, the cells were grown in T175 flasks (passage 0) and hyperflasks (passage 1) in the animal-free SkGMTM-2 skeletal muscle cell growth medium containing 5% human platelet lysate for 15-17 days. The harvested cells were released based on cell morphology, cell dose, viability, sterility, endotoxin, mycoplasma and immunophenotype. Myotube differentiation was also evaluated. RESULTS 400 to 500 million myoblast cells were manufactured within 15 to 17 days by the end of passage 1, which met pre-determined releasing criteria. The manufactured myoblast cells could differentiate and fuse into myotubes in vitro, with the possible trend that the donor age may impact the differentiation ability of myoblasts. CONCLUSIONS The present study establishes a flask-based method of manufacturing myoblast in the animal-free medium together with releasing criteria, which is simple, robust, inexpensive and easily reproducible.

Thus, receptor expression patterns can define viral tissue tropism and might to some extent predict the susceptibility of a host to a particular virus. Previously, others and we have shown that respiratory pathogens of the genus Gammacoronavirus, including chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), require specific 2,3-linked sialylated glycans for attachment and entry. Here, we studied determinants of binding of enterotropic avian gammacoronaviruses, including turkey coronavirus (TCoV), guineafowl coronavirus (GfCoV), and quail coronavirus (QCoV), which are evolutionarily distant from respiratory avian coronaviruses based on the viral attachment protein spike (S1). We profiled the binding of recombinantly expressed S1 proteins of TCoV, GfCoV, and QCoV to tissues of their respective hosts. Protein histochemistry showed that the tissue binding specificity of S1 proteins of turkey, quail, and guineafowl CoVs was limited to intestinal tissues of each particular host, in accordance with the reported pathogenicity of these viruses in vivo. Glycan array analyses revealed that, in contrast to the S1 protein of IBV, S1 proteins of enteric gammacoronaviruses recognize a unique set of nonsialylated type 2 poly-N-acetyl-lactosamines. Lectin histochemistry as well as tissue binding patterns of TCoV S1 further indicated that these complex N-glycans are prominently expressed on the intestinal tract of various avian species. In conclusion, our data demonstrate not only that enteric gammacoronaviruses recognize a novel glycan receptor but also that enterotropism may be correlated with the high specificity of spike proteins for such glycans expressed in the intestines of the avian host. IMPORTANCE Avian coronaviruses are economically important viruses for the poultry industry. While infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a respiratory pathogen of chickens, is rather well known, other viruses of the genus Gammacoronavirus, including those causing enteric disease, are hardly studied. In turkey, guineafowl, and quail, coronaviruses have been reported to be the major causative agent of enteric diseases. Specifically, turkey coronavirus outbreaks have been reported in North America, Europe, and Australia for several decades. Recently, a gammacoronavirus was isolated from guineafowl with fulminating disease. To date, it is not clear why these avian coronaviruses are enteropathogenic, whereas other closely related avian coronaviruses like IBV cause respiratory disease. A comprehensive understanding of the tropism and pathogenicity of these viruses explained by their receptor specificity and receptor expression on tissues was therefore needed. Here, we identify a novel glycan receptor for enteric avian coronaviruses, which will further support the development of vaccines.","output":"Novel Receptor Specificity of Avian Gammacoronaviruses That Cause Enteritis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To address coronavirus disease (COVID-19), currently, no effective drug or vaccine is available.

BACKGROUND Due to increasing ED visits annually, an efficient work environment has become one of the main concerns in designing EDs. According to the literature, an efficient work environment and teamwork improve healthcare outcomes and positively impact staff satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, EDs faced various changes such as workflow and space usage. Few studies explored staff perceptions about the influence of design features on efficiency, teamwork, and the COVID-19 spread. METHOD An online survey with 14 open- and closed-ended questions was distributed among ED staff members to collect data about unit design features that impact efficiency, teamwork, and the COVID-19 spread. RESULTS The central nursing station was one of the preferred configurations that increased efficiency and teamwork in EDs. Decentralizing disposal rooms in small-size EDs and decentralizing the medication room in large-size EDs with more than 65 exam rooms can decrease staff walking steps. Flexibility to expand treatment spaces on demand, one-way track circulation path, and changing the air pressure in COVID-19 treatment areas were some of the staff suggestions for future EDs.

COVID-19 has been characterized by elevated mortality (over 100 thousand people have already died in the US alone), mostly due to thromboinflammatory complications that impair lung perfusion and systemic oxygenation in the most severe cases. While the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with the severity of the disease, little is known about the impact of IL-6 levels on the proteome of COVID-19 patients. The present study provides the first proteomics analysis of sera from COVID-19 patients, stratified by circulating levels of IL-6, and correlated to markers of inflammation and renal function. As a function of IL-6 levels, we identified significant dysregulation in serum levels of various coagulation factors, accompanied by increased levels of antifibrinolytic components, including several serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs). These were accompanied by up-regulation of the complement cascade and antimicrobial enzymes, especially in subjects with the highest levels of IL-6, which is consistent with an exacerbation of the acute phase response in these subjects.

Unfortunately, increasing numbers of nations are ruled by autocratic regimes which have characteristically failed to adopt investments in public health infrastructure, education, and prevention measures to keep pace with population growth and density. Autocratic leaders have a direct impact on health security, a direct negative impact on health, and create adverse political and economic conditions that only complicate the crisis further.

In 1519, the year of the arrival of the Spaniards, the population in Mexico was estimated to be between 15 and 30 million inhabitants. Eighty-one years later, in 1600, only two million remained. Epidemics (smallpox, measles, mumps), together with war, and famine have been considered to be the main causes of this enormous population loss. However, re-evaluation of historical data suggests that approximately 60C70% of the death toll was caused by a series of epidemics of hemorrhagic fevers of unknown origin. In order to estimate the impact of the 1576 epidemic of hemorrhagic fevers on the population we analyzed the historical record and data from the 1570 and 1580 censuses of 157 districts. The results identified several remarkable aspects of this epidemic: First, overall, the population loss for these 157 districts was 51.36%. Second, there was a clear ethnic preference of the disease, the Spanish population was minimally affected whereas native population had high mortality rate. Third, the outbreak originated in the valleys of central Mexico whence it evolved as an expansive wave. Fourth, a positive correlation between altitude and mortality in central Mexico was found. Fifth, a specific climatic sequence of events was associated with the initiation and dissemination of the hemorrhagic fevers.

Focusing on social distancing of individuals susceptible to an infection we theoretically characterize the gap between private and social cost of contacts.

The optimal policy is to drastically reduce contacts at the beginning to almost eradicate the epidemic and keep them at levels that contain the pandemic at a low prevalence level. We find that also in laissez faire, private protection efforts by forward-looking, risk averse individuals would have stabilized the epidemic, but at a much higher prevalence of infection than optimal.

Here we review possible life-threating immune events that can occur during disease progression to uncover key factors behind COVID-19 severity and provide suggestions for interventions with repurposed drugs in well-controlled and randomized clinical trials. These drugs include therapeutics with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells such as serine protease inhibitors of the cellular protease TMPS2 and drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system; antivirals with potential to block SARS-CoV-2 replication or factors that could boost the antiviral response; monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive the hyperinflammatory response during COVID-19 progression toward the severe stage and therapeutics that could ameliorate the function of the lungs. Furthermore, in order to help make more informed decisions on the timing of the intervention with the drugs listed in this review, we have grouped these therapeutics according to the stage of COVID-19 progression that we considered most appropriate for their mechanism of action.","output":"Lessons Learned to Date on COVID-19 Hyperinflammatory Syndrome: Considerations for Interventions to Mitigate SARS-CoV-2 Viral Infection and Detrimental Hyperinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Monitoring COVID-19 infection risk among health care workers (HCWs) is a public health priority. We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs following the fall infection surge in Minnesota, and before and after COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, we assessed demographic and occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted two rounds of seroprevalence testing among a cohort of HCWs: samples in round 1 were collected from 11/22/20C02/21/21 and in round 2 from 12/18/20C02/15/21. Demographic and occupational exposures assessed with logistic regression were age, sex, healthcare role and setting, and number of children in the household. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity. A secondary outcome, SARS-CoV-2 infection, included both seropositivity and self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. RESULTS: In total, 459 HCWs were tested. 43/454 (9.47%) had a seropositive sample 1 and 75/423 (17.7%) had a seropositive sample 2. By time of sample 2 collection, 54% of participants had received at least one vaccine dose and seroprevalence was 13% among unvaccinated individuals.

However, HCT-related factors, such as total body irradiation used for conditioning, graft-versus-host disease, and prolonged exposure to immunosuppressive therapy, result in very high risk for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). In fact, skin cancer is the most common subsequent neoplasm in HCT survivors, tending to develop at a time when survivors' follow-up care has largely transitioned to the primary care setting. The goal of this study is to increase skin cancer screening rates among HCT survivors through patient-directed activation alone or in combination with physician-directed activation. The proposed intervention will identify facilitators of and barriers to risk-based screening in this population and help reduce the burden of cancer-related morbidity after HCT. METHODS/DESIGN: 720 HCT survivors will be enrolled in this 12-month randomized controlled trial. This study uses a comparative effectiveness design comparing (1) patient activation and education (PAE, N = 360) including text messaging and print materials to encourage and motivate skin examinations; (2) PAE plus primary care physician activation (PAE + Phys, N = 360) adding print materials for the physician on the HCT survivors' increased risk of skin cancer and importance of conducting a full-body skin exam.

METHODS: January 2015-June 2019: data on multimodal PTA for <3 cm HCC were extracted from a prospective database. Local tumor progression (LTP), intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), time-to-LTP, time-to-IDR, recurrence-free (RFS) and overall (OS) survival were evaluated. RESULTS: 238 patients underwent 317 PTA sessions to treat 412 HCCs. During follow-up (median: 27.1 months), 47.1% patients had IDR and 18.5% died. LTP occurred after 13.3% of PTA. Tumor size (OR = 1.108, p < 0.001; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.075, p = 0.002) and ultrasound guidance (OR = 0.294, p = 0.017; HR = 0.429, p = 0.009) independently predicted LTP and time-to-LTP, respectively.

Participants were 189 graduate students (96% female, 60% first-year graduate students) currently enrolled in speech-language pathology graduate programs. Statistical analyses on students' responses, including independent-samples t tests and correlations, were conducted. Results: Only 20% of respondents stated they had provided services via telepractice. Most participants reported slightly more confidence in their perceived skills related to telepractice as compared to their perceived knowledge of telepractice. Students who had prior experience with telepractice were more likely to provide higher ratings compared to those with no experience.

It has been estimated that antenatal care coverage has been decreased with workforce, supplies, demand, and access reductions during the outbreak in some countries. The study aimed to investigate the health care access and concerns of pregnant women during the pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 331 pregnant women in one district of Istanbul (skdar) and a random sampling method was applied. The data was collected between November 22nd and December 18th 2020 by telephone interview after verbal consents were taken from the participants. Chi-square and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. The study was approved by the Bahcesehir University Institutional Ethics Board. RESULTS: The median age of the participants was 30 years, the median gestational age was 24 weeks. Among the participants 9.6% were previously diagnosed with COVID-19, 15.8% had a chronic disease, 48.2% were nulliparous and 18.6% had a high-risk pregnancy. The frequency of having concern for their own health was 70.7%, for their children's health was 73,0%, for going to visits in healthcare facilities was 81.0% and for giving birth during the pandemic was 83.0%. Also, 17.1% did not go to antenatal visits because of the COVID-19 concerns. According to the logistic regression analysis, women who had chronic disease had higher concerns about their own health; women who had chosen to go to hospitals for antenatal care visits had higher concerns about children's health and giving birth, and women who had concerns about going to health facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to go to family health centers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the concerns related to the pandemic among pregnant women are at significant levels.

The World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) requires Member States to implement minimum standards of intellectual property protection including patents for pharmaceutical products, but also contains 'flexibilities' designed to address barriers to access to medicines. National intellectual property laws can also include TRIPS-plus rules that go beyond what is required by TRIPS. We aimed to systematically review literature that measures the impact of intellectual property rules on access to medicines, whether implemented as a result of TRIPS, TRIPS-plus provisions in other trade agreements, or unilateral policy decisions. METHODS We searched Proquest, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PubMed, JSTOR, Westlaw and Lexis Nexis. Peer reviewed articles, government reports and other grey literature were included. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they were quantitative, in English, included a measure of cost, price, availability of or access to medicines, were about intellectual property or data exclusivity rules and published between January 1995 and October 2020. Ninety-one studies met our inclusion criteria. We systematically reviewed the studies' findings and evaluated their quality using a modified quality assessment template. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Five broad overarching themes and 11 subthemes were identified based on the articles' foci. They were: trade agreements (divided into EU FTAs and those that include the USA); use of TRIPS flexibilities (divided into compulsory licencing and parallel importation); patent expiry/generic entry/generic pathway (divided into comparative studies and single country studies); patent policies (also divided into comparative studies and single country studies) and TRIPS-plus rules (divided into data exclusivity, patent term extensions and secondary patenting). Most studies focused not on specific trade agreements, but on TRIPS-plus provisions, which can also be found within some trade agreements. The main finding of this review is that the stronger pharmaceutical monopolies created by TRIPs-plus intellectual property rules are generally associated with increased drug prices, delayed availability and increased costs to consumers and governments. There is evidence that TRIPS flexibilities can facilitate access to medicines although their use is limited to date. There were few studies that included resource poor settings, signalling a need for greater research in such settings where the impact on access to medicines is likely to be more damaging.","output":"What is the impact of intellectual property rules on access to medicines?

Yet, relatively few studies have analyzed the impacts of codon usage on tissue-specific mRNA and protein expression. Here, we use codon-modified reporters to perform an organism-wide screen in Drosophila melanogaster for distinct tissue responses to codon usage bias. These reporters reveal a cliff-like decline of protein expression near the limit of rare codon usage in endogenously expressed Drosophila genes. Near the edge of this limit, however, we find the testis and brain are uniquely capable of expressing rare codon-enriched reporters. We define a new metric of tissue-specific codon usage, the tissue-apparent Codon Adaptation Index (taCAI), to reveal a conserved enrichment for rare codon usage in the endogenously expressed genes of both Drosophila and human testis. We further demonstrate a role for rare codons in an evolutionarily young testis-specific gene, RpL10Aa. Optimizing RpL10Aa codons disrupts female fertility. Our work highlights distinct responses to rarely used codons in select tissues, revealing a critical role for codon bias in tissue biology.","output":"Distinct responses to rare codons in select Drosophila tissues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teleorthodontics represents the orthodontic care system involving remote management of orthodontic treatment.

In addition to the well-known factors such as age structure, detection efficiency, and race, there was also a possibility that medical resource shortage caused the increase of the case fatality rate in some regions. Methods: : Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, CBM, CNKI, and Wan fang of identified articles were searched through 29 June 2020. Cohort studies and case series with duration information on COVID-19 patients were included. Two independent reviewers extracted the data using a standardized data collection form and assessed the risk of bias. Data were synthesized through description and analysis methods including a meta-analysis. Results: : A total of 109 articles were retrieved. The time interval from onset to the first medical visit of COVID-19 patients in China was 3.381.55 days (corresponding intervals in Hubei province, non-Hubei provinces, Wuhan, Hubei provinces without Wuhan were 4.221.13 days, 3.101.57 days, 4.200.97 days, and 4.341.72 days, respectively). The time interval from onset to the hospitalization of COVID-19 patients in China was 8.356.83 days (same corresponding intervals were 12.947.43 days, 4.171.45 days, 14.867.12 days, and 5.361.19 days, respectively), and when it was outside China, this interval was 5.271.19 days. Conclusion: In the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, patients with COVID-19 did not receive timely treatment, resulting in a higher case fatality rate in Hubei province, partly due to the relatively insufficient and unequal medical resources. This research suggested that additional deaths caused by the out-of-control epidemic can be avoided if prevention and control work is carried out at the early stage of the epidemic.

An organ procurement service in South Australia, to procure heart and lungs of local donors, was commenced to mitigate the impact of the travel restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. The purpose of this review was to examine the initial data and feasibility of the service. METHODS A single unit, multi-site retrospective review from April 2020-August 2021 of all organ retrievals undertaken by the Flinders Medical Centre cardiothoracic service across Adelaide metropolitan area. Data was prospectively collected and analysed from the DonateLife South Australian centralized database. All data was de identified. RESULTS A total of 25 organ procurements had been undertaken across 17 months since commencing the program. Total of 9 hearts and 16 bilateral lungs were procured with median age of donor of hearts 49 years (IQR 35.5-51. 5) and 60 years (IQR 44-72) for lung donation. Six organs were donated after determination of circulatory death and 19 after neurological determination of death. Median ischaemic time for heart donation was 4.4 h (IQR 3.0-5.8) and lung donation 4.4 h (IQR 3.4-6.1). All organs procured by the local South Australian team were successfully transplanted at the recipient site. Recipient sites included 8 in Victoria, 10 in New South Wales, 4 in Western Australia and 3 in Queensland. CONCLUSIONS The necessity of flexibility within the field of cardiothoracic surgery is evident during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been widely used for diabetic wound healing due to its high content of growth factors. However, its application is limited due to the rapid degradation of growth factors. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combined adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) and PRP therapy in promoting diabetic wound healing in relation to the Notch signaling pathway. METHODS: Albino rats were allocated into 6 groups [control (unwounded), sham (wounded but non-diabetic), diabetic, PRP-treated, ADSC-treated, and PRP+ADSCs-treated groups]. The effect of individual and combined therapy was evaluated by assessing wound closure rate, epidermal thickness, dermal collagen, and angiogenesis. Moreover, gene and protein expression of key elements of the Notch signaling pathway (Notch1, Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 4 (DLL4), Hairy Enhancer of Split-1 (Hes1), Hey1, Jagged-1), gene expression of angiogenic marker (vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor 1) and epidermal stem cells (EPSCs) related gene (?1 Integrin) were assessed. RESULTS: Our data showed better wound healing of PRP+ADSCs compared to their individual use after 7 and 14 days as the combined therapy caused reepithelialization and granulation tissue formation with a marked increase in area percentage of collagen, epidermal thickness, and angiogenesis. Moreover, Notch signaling was significantly downregulated, and EPSC proliferation and recruitment were enhanced compared to other treated groups and diabetic groups.

The elements of the underlying lifted analysis domain are tuples, which maintain one property per variant. Still, explicit property enumeration in tuples, one by one for all variants, immediately yields combinatorial explosion. This is particularly apparent in the case of program families that, apart from Boolean features, contain also numerical features with large domains, thus giving rise to astronomical configuration spaces. The key for an efficient lifted analysis is a proper handling of variability-specific constructs of the language (e.g., feature-based runtime tests and [Formula: see text] directives). In this work, we introduce a new symbolic representation of the lifted abstract domain that can efficiently analyze program families with numerical features. This makes sharing between property elements corresponding to different variants explicitly possible. The elements of the new lifted domain are constraint-based decision trees, where decision nodes are labeled with linear constraints defined over numerical features and the leaf nodes belong to an existing single-program analysis domain. To illustrate the potential of this representation, we have implemented an experimental lifted static analyzer, called SPLNum [Formula: see text] Analyzer, for inferring invariants of C programs. An empirical evaluation on BusyBox and on benchmarks from SV-COMP yields promising preliminary results indicating that our decision trees-based approach is effective and outperforms the baseline tuple-based approach.","output":"A Decision Tree Lifted Domain for Analyzing Program Families with Numerical Features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Workplace relationships that transcend formal role boundaries offer benefits and challenges to organizations and relational participants.

Methods We developed a stochastic compartmental model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within an English care home. We quantified the outbreak risk under the NPIs already in place, the role of community prevalence in driving outbreaks, and the relative contribution of all importation routes into the care home. We also considered the potential impact of additional control measures, namely: increasing staff and resident testing frequency, using lateral flow antigen testing (LFD) tests instead of PCR, enhancing infection prevention and control (IPC), increasing the proportion of residents isolated, shortening the delay to isolation, improving the effectiveness of isolation, restricting visitors and limiting staff to working in one care home. Findings The model suggests that importation of SARS-CoV-2 by staff, from the community, is the main driver of outbreaks, that importation by visitors or from hospitals is rare, and that the past testing strategy (monthly testing of residents and daily testing of staff by PCR) likely provides negligible benefit in preventing outbreaks. Daily staff testing by LFD was 39% (95% 18-55%) effective in preventing outbreaks at 30 days compared to no testing. Interpretation Increasing the frequency of testing in staff and enhancing IPC are important to preventing importations to the care home. Further work is needed to understand the impact of vaccination in this population, which is likely to be very effective in preventing outbreaks.

Transmission patterns suggest spread by respiratory droplet or close person-to-person contact. To elucidate the correlation of clinical presentation to the pathogenesis and course of the disease, we reviewed the pulmonary pathologic specimens of SARS patients taken at different stages of the disease. METHODS Four \\"probable\\" cases of SARS were studied. SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection was demonstrated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in all 4 patients. The pulmonary specimens were taken on day 7 after symptom onset in patient 1, day 11 in patient 2, day 17 in patient 3, and day 21 in patient 4. RESULTS The autopsy lung tissue from patient 1, who died 7 days after symptoms onset due to the complication of acute myocardial infarction, revealed mild histologic change in the lung. Only focal pulmonary edema or hemorrhage was seen. In the second patient, who died 11 days after symptom onset, severe acute alveolar damage was characterized by patchy or diffuse lung edema, hyaline membrane formation, and scarce lymphocytic infiltration. The lymphocytes were mostly CD3-positive and CD20-negative. In the third patient, biopsy specimen taken 17 days after symptom onset showed patches of organizing pneumonia with reactive fibroblastic proliferation, more abundant type II pneumocytes and clustering of CD68-positive macrophages within the alveolar spaces. Few CD68-positive syncytial multinucleated giant cells were also seen in the specimens but no viral inclusion body could be identified in these cells. The lung biopsy specimen from patient 4 taken 21 days after symptom onset showed characteristics of the fibrotic stage, with significant myofibroblastic proliferation in the alveolar space and interstitium resulting in loss of pulmonary architecture. The number of CD3-positive lymphocytes and of CD68-positive macrophages in this specimen from a patient in the fibrotic phase of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) whose condition deteriorated was less than in the specimen from case 3 who was in the early proliferative phase of DAD and eventually recovered. CONCLUSIONS The histologic evolution of SARS coincided with the different stages of DAD: acute, proliferative organizing, and fibrotic stages. SARS cannot be differentiated from the other etiologies of DAD by morphologic examination alone. The absence of DAD does not rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV infection, particularly in the early stage of the disease.","output":"Evolution of pulmonary pathology in severe acute respiratory syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Given that approximately one-third of individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD) remain severely fatigued after completion the cardiac rehabilitation, it is necessary to identify reliable intervention targets aimed at reducing fatigue. Perceived social support is closely linked to health outcomes and depressive symptoms in individuals with CAD. However, to our knowledge, the relationship between subjective fatigue levels and social support in those with CAD has not been analyzed. Objective: We aimed to examine the associations between perceived social support and subjective fatigue levels in individuals with CAD with and without depression symptoms. Methods: This cross-sectional study was comprised of 1,036 participants with CAD (579years, 77% men) 1C2weeks after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Results: In total, 12% (n=129) of study participants had elevated depression symptoms (HADS score8). In individuals with CAD and depressive symptoms, after adjustment for sex, age, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and anxiety, linear regression analyses showed significant inverse associations between higher social support from others and general, physical fatigue as well as reduced activity and motivation (p<0.001). Following the same method of statistical analysis and control in non-depressed individuals with CAD (88%), social support from family was inversely linked to mental fatigue (ps<0.05). Similarly, social support from friends was significantly associated with lower general, physical, and mental fatigue as well as reduced activity, while social support from others was significantly associated with lower general and mental fatigue (ps<0.001). The overall higher total support was linked with reduced motivation (p<0.05) in the depressed study participants, while there was lower general and mental fatigue (p<0.05) in non-depressed individuals. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that fatigue and its features could be associated by the perceived social support in individuals with CAD following ACSs. While in individuals with CAD and depressive symptoms, greater subjective fatigue is associated with less perceived social support from others, higher levels of subjective fatigue in non-depressed individuals with CAD are significantly associated with reduced perceived social support from friends.","output":"Fatigue, Social Support, and Depression in Individuals With Coronary Artery Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lack of exercise, which increases the risk of many serious physical and mental illness, has been a common health issue in Japan Recent studies confirm that financial literacy discourages irrational behavior like gambling and smoking We therefore investigate how financial literacy, as a rational decision-making instrument, relates to peoples exercise behavior in Japan We hypothesize that financial literacy encourages people to exercise regularly Using Osaka Universitys Preference Parameters Study (PPS) for 2010, we categorized respondents into two groups: those who exercise regularly or at least once a week and those who do not Our probit estimation results show that financial literacy is positively related with exercise behavior, meaning that financially literate people are more likely to exercise regularly As the COVID-19 health pandemic seems to exacerbate peoples physical inactivity, the results of our study show an alternative approach to encourage exercise We therefore recommend that governments implement a financial literacy improvement policy to alleviate the lack of exercise ? 2021 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Financial literacy and exercise behavior: Evidence from japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives: Evaluate the risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding and the impact of arbidol treatment on SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding.

Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the etiology (1). As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other countries, including 11 in the United States (2,3). On January 17, CDC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City (4). CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and contact-related risks. Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to identifying cases and preventing further transmission. Health care providers should remain vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection (6).

Often, preanalytical handling is nonideal, especially considering the COVID-19 pandemic; consequently, we compared the effects of different short-term storage and processing methods on urinary biomarker measurements. METHODS Spot urine samples were collected via a Foley catheter from 20 hospitalized patients from the Yale New Haven Hospital within 48 hours postcardiac surgery. The effects of 3 urine storage and processing methods on biomarkers were tested: (a) 48-hour temporary storage at 4 C prior to freezing at -80 C, (b) 48-hour temporary storage at 25 C prior to freezing at -80 C, and (c) no centrifugation and immediate storage at -80 C. Established Meso-Scale Device assay methods were used to measure the urine concentrations of 18 biomarkers: interferon gamma (IFN-?), interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), epidermal growth factor (EGF), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), osteopontin (OPN), uromodulin (UMOD), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40). RESULTS Measurements of most biomarkers investigated remained stable after temporary storage at 4 C. IL-6, IL-8, KIM-1, MCP-1, YKL-40, EGF, and NGAL were stable across all 3 processing conditions. IL-12p70 and IL-4 demonstrated significant differences in all tested conditions compared to the reference standard.

It has been applied to different technologies and, more recently, to artificial intelligence (AI).

First, humans may not understand how an AI system learns certain things. This requires paying attention to values such as transparency, explicability, and accountability. Second, ML may lead to AI systems adapting in ways that disembody the values embedded in them. To address this, we propose a threefold modified VSD approach: (1) integrating a known set of VSD principles (AI4SG) as design norms from which more specific design requirements can be derived; (2) distinguishing between values that are promoted and respected by the design to ensure outcomes that not only do no harm but also contribute to good, and (3) extending the VSD process to encompass the whole life cycle of an AI technology to monitor unintended value consequences and redesign as needed.

Results further allowed for analysis of different sectors with a view to determining which is riskiest. The study makes use of a multi-factor structural model, given that each sector is affected by a different systematic risk factor, with the assets of borrowers from the same sector thus correlated markedly, even as correlations between sectors are low. The research has in fact sought the further development of methodology proposed by Dllmann and Masschelein in 2006in the direction of improved accuracy of economic-capital estimates, thanks to alternate means of mapping out the sectoral factor correlation matrix. The empirical analysis was based on individual data from Prudential Reporting under the National Bank of Poland, as well as market data. Results reveal an increase in tail risk through the 2015C2017 period, as followed by the onset of a decline. Where the papers second aim is concerned, there is found to be support for the idea that economic capital may be increased where sector concentration in the portfolio of a bank is accounted for. Tail risk is found to be concentrated in the sectors of construction and real estate, with accommodation and food services becoming more volatile during the pandemic. A channel for risk transfer between the financial and corporate sectors is thus found to exist.

In this article, we aimed to describe the clinical and imaging features of acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and the imaging evolution during a short-term follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified and reviewed the clinical data, laboratory results, imaging findings, and outcomes for 8 critically ill patients with COVID-19 with acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy. RESULTS: All patients demonstrated multiple areas of white matter changes in both cerebral hemispheres; 87.5% (7/8) of patients had a posterior predilection. Four patients (50%) had short-term follow-up imaging within a median of 17 days after the first MR imaging; they developed brain atrophy, and their white matter lesions evolved into necrotizing cystic cavitations. All (8/8) patients had inflammatory cytokine release syndrome as demonstrated by elevated interleukin-6, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels. Most (7/8; 87.5%) patients were on prolonged ventilator support (median, 44.5 days; interquartile range, 20.5 days). These patients had poor functional outcomes (6/8 [75%] patients were discharged with mRS 5) and high mortality (2/8, 25%). CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 can develop acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy that evolves into cystic degeneration of white matter lesions with brain atrophy during a short period, which we dubbed virus-associated necrotizing disseminated acute leukoencephalopathy.

METHODS We used two panel datasets from 46 African countries between 1990 and 2018 among children, one is the disease prevalence from Global Burden of Disease, and another is on the measles vaccination coverage from WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form. We used panel regression to estimate the effect of measles prevalence or measles vaccination coverage on other disease prevalence (diarrhea, lower respiratory infection, malaria, meningitis, and tuberculosis). RESULTS We found the strong evidence that the increase in the measles prevalence led to an increase in other disease prevalence and mortality.

This review aims to describe the pattern of influenza B occurrence in Brazil to have a better understanding of its epidemiology and its relevance when considering seasonal influenza vaccine composition. A review of the data including analysis of international and local surveillance data as well as information from online search of databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in conjunction with screening of abstracts from scientific events was performed. Based on international epidemiologic surveillance data, moderate levels of influenza B disease (19%; 2006C2014) were observed. Of these nine years, it was possible to compare data from three years (2007, 2008 and 2013) which have information on the circulating influenza B lineage. Co-circulation of influenza B lineages was observed in all these three influenza seasons, of which, during one season, a high degree of mismatch between the vaccine lineage and the predominant circulating lineage (91.4% [2013]) was observed. Local surveillance data reveal a distinct and dynamic distribution of respiratory viruses over the years. Data from published literature and abstracts show that influenza B is a significant cause of disease with an unpredictable circulation pattern and showing trends indicating reemergence of the B/Victoria lineage. The abstracts report notable levels of co-circulation of both influenza B lineages (2000C2013). Mismatch between the Southern hemisphere vaccine and the most prevalent circulating viruses in Brazil were observed in five influenza seasons.

Evidenced-based psychotherapies, including Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), are effective in treating PTSD, although a fair proportion of individuals show limited benefit from such treatments. CPT requires cognitive demands such as encoding, recalling, and implementing new information, resulting in behavioral change that may improve PTSD symptoms. Individuals with PTSD show worse cognitive functioning than those without PTSD, particularly in acquisition of verbal memory. Therefore, memory dysfunction may limit treatment gains in CPT in some individuals with PTSD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Here, we present a protocol describing the Cognition and PsychoTherapy in PTSD (CPTPTSD) study, a prospective, observational study examining how cognitive functioning affects treatment response in CPT for PTSD (NCT# 03641924). The study aims to recruit 105 outpatient veterans with PTSD between the ages of 18 and 70 years. Prior to beginning 12 sessions of CPT, Veteran participants will have standardized assessments of mood and functioning and complete a comprehensive neurocognitive battery assessing episodic learning, attention and speed of processing, language ability, executive control, and emotional functioning. This study aims to fill gaps in the current literature by: (1) examining the specificity of memory effects on treatment response; (2) exploring how baseline cognitive functioning impacts functional outcomes; and (3) examining potential mechanisms, such as memory for treatment content, that might explain the effects of baseline memory functioning on PTSD symptom trajectory.

It appears to work in tandem with vitamin D, a secosteroid pro-hormone which reportedly acts as a negative regulatory factor of the RAS [3-6]. A dysfunction (e.g. over-reactivity) of RAS, together with hypovitaminosis D, is likely associated with some of the various renal, cardiac, vascular and immune outcomes that might be observed in COVID-19 patients, including the cytokine storm (i.e. unopposed hyperactive immune reaction generating both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines) and consequent lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome [1, 7]. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9], the causative agent of COVID-19, has been described to interfere with the RAS [2] by interacting -via its spike (S) glycoprotein- with the metallopeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [9, 10] that is expressed at the surface of epithelial cells from blood vessels, lung, kidney (renal tubules), intestine, and heart, as well as on cerebral neurons and immune monocytes/macrophages [11-13]. The main SARS-CoV-2-related COVID-19 symptoms/diseases reported hitherto are hypertension, atherosclerosis, thrombosis (coagulopathy), diarrhea, glaucoma, anosmia, ageusia, skin lesions (dermatitis), autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system, and damages to various organs such as the lung, heart, kidney, and testicle [1, 2, 14]. All these diffuse COVID-19 disorders are likely linked to an over-reaction of RAS in SARS-CoV-2-infected persons. Such a RAS imbalance would be also favored by hypovitaminosis D [2-7, 11]. Since RAS appears to be central in COVID-19 symptoms/diseases, selective targeting of key component(s) of this system might be appropriate to treat RAS-dependent disorders. COVID-19 Disorders: 'Renin-Angiotensin' System (RAS) & Counter-regulatory RAS In the RAS pathway [1, 15], Renin (kidney) cleaves Angiotensinogen (liver) to give Angiotensin I (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFHL). The latter is cleaved by the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) to produce Angiotensin II (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPF), which is the substrate of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and key player of the RAS. The cellular targets of Angiotensin II are the vasoconstrictor type 1 (AT1R) and vasodilatator type 2 (AT2R) Angiotensin II receptors (AT1R is expressed at the surface of monocytes/macrophages and T-cells indicating that RAS acts on innate immunity in host). When cleaved by ACE2, Angiotensin II gives Angiotensin 1-7 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHP), targeting the vasodilatator proto-oncogene Mas receptor (MasR). Angiotensin 1-7 can be further transformed to Alamandine (i.e. peptide ARVYIHP) by an aspartate decarboxylase. Alamandine would bind to the vasodilatator Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member D (MRGD) thus promoting most of the Angiotensin 1-7-like effects. Angiotensin II can produce Angiotensin A (i.e. peptide ARVYIHPF) via an aspartate decarboxylase, and Alamandine via an additional ACE2 cleavage. ACE2 can also cleave Angiotensin I to form Angiotensin 1-9 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFH), which targets AT2R. In the RAS pathway were finally evidenced the related Angiotensin III (i.e. peptide RVYIHPF) and Angiotensin IV (i.e. peptide VYIHPF) variants targeting the AT1R and vasodilatator AT4R, respectively. From the known molecular functioning of the RAS, Angiotensins I and II (aside Angiotensin III) are playing central roles in the activity of RAS and associated pathologies, including COVID-19 [2, 10]. Interestingly, it appears that a 'counter-regulatory' RAS does exist to modulate system homeostasis; it relies on Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A, and Angiotensin IV, which are targeting the MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R vasodilatator receptors, respectively. These peptides were found to exhibit cardioprotective, vasoactive (anti-hypertensive), anti-hypertrophic and/or anti-inflammatory potentials [15]. Such naturally-produced molecules of the RAS are expected to counteract the SARS-CoV-2-induced over-activation of RAS and reverse, to some extent, the associated COVID-19 diseases. CONCLUDING REMARKS A recent report suggests that RAS inhibitors may act on the severity of viral infection and mortality of COVID-19 patients [14]. Whether or not RAS blockers would be beneficial to COVID-19 cases is still controversial. The RAS inhibitors likely prevent the cytokine storm as RAS is reported to control the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [1, 7]. It appears that COVID-19 disorders of SARS-CoV-2-infected humans depend on the RAS over-reacted by the (ACE2-dependent) viral infection and vitamin D deficiency. The track for a possible COVID-19 treatment would be to target RAS using specific candidate chemotherapeutic drugs. The proposed molecules are (so far) ACE inhibitors (to prevent the production of Angiotensin II from Angiotensin I), and blockers/antagonists of AT1R such as Losartan and derivatives. Recombinant ACE2 (under clinical trials) is also considered as a decoy for the recognition and competitive binding to the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10]. We support the use of natural candidate peptide drugs that belong to the 'counter-regulatory' RAS, i.e. Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A and/or Angiotensin IV to treat COVID-19 disorders. The targeted receptors would thus be MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R.

Seroprevalence rate in recovered COVID-19 patients help us to identify individual with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and its protective nature. The objective of present study was to evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among potential convalescent plasma donors and analysis of their deferral reasons. Materials and Methods: A total 400 potential convalescent plasma donors were enrolled over five-month period for this prospective study. Inclusion criteria were lab confirmed COVID-19 recovered patients and 14 days of symptoms free period. All prospective plasmapheresis donors were tested for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody through chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay, CBC, serum protein, blood grouping along with other required test for normal blood donation as per Drugs & Cosmetics Act. After pre donation testing and medical examination if donor was found to be ineligible for plasmapheresis was deferred. Seroprevalence rate was calculated by positive IgG antibody test results among the potential plasma donors. Results: Seroprevalence rate was 87% for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in prospective convalescent plasma donors (recovered COVID-19 patients). There was no significant difference in seroprevalence rate between different sub-groups with respect to gender, age, blood groups, Rh factor, mode of treatment, day of Ab testing and repeat plasma donation. Most common reason for their deferral was absent IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (13%) followed by absenteeism of eligible screen donors (6.7%), low Hb (1.7%) and poor veins for plasmapheresis (1.7%). Till five-month study period none of the plasmapheresis develop symptoms of reinfection with COVID-19. Conclusion: 13% recovered patients did not develop IgG antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies persist for quite some time and are protective against reinfection. More long-term serology studies are needed to understand better antibody response kinetics and duration of persistence of IgG antibodies.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among potential convalescent plasma donors and analysis of their deferral pattern: Experience from tertiary care hospital in western India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During clinical follow\\\\up it can be difficult to identify those head and neck cancer (HNC) patients who are coping poorly and could benefit from additional support. Health\\\\related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires and prompt lists provide a means by which patients can express their perceived outcomes and raise concerns. The first aim of this secondary analysis following a randomized trial was to explore which patient characteristics, at around 3 months following treatment completion (baseline), best predict HRQOL 12 months later. The second aim was to attempt to ascertain which patients were most likely to benefit from using prompt list. METHODS: Cluster\\\\controlled pragmatic trial data were analyzed. HRQOL was measured by the University of Washington Quality of life questionnaire (UW\\\\QOLv4). The prompt list was the Patient Concerns Inventory (PCI\\\\HN). RESULTS: The trial involved 15 eligible consultants and a median (inter\\\\quartile range) of 16 (13C26) primary HNC patients per consultant, with 140 PCI patients and 148 controls.

In pediatric patients with respiratory infections, viral and bacterial etiologies are challenging to distinguish, leading to irrational antibiotic use. Rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic testing methods for respiratory pathogens has been shown to facilitate effective clinical decision-making and guide antibiotic stewardship interventions in the developed regions, but its impacts on pediatric patient care in the developing countries remain unclear. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective case-control study, we compared demographics, clinical characteristics, especially microbiological findings, and antibiotic usage between pediatric patients with respiratory infection receiving FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FilmArray RP) testing and a matched routine testing control group. Our primary outcome was the duration of intravenous antibiotics treatment (DOT) during hospitalization. RESULTS: Each group consisted of 346 children with a respiratory infection. In the FilmArray RP testing group, the DOT was shorter than that in the routine testing group (6.41  3.67 days versus 7.23  4.27 days; p = 0.006). More patients in the FilmArray RP testing group de-escalated antibiotic treatments within 72 hours of hospitalization (7.80%, 27/346 versus 2.60%, 9/346; p = 0.002). By contrast, fewer patients in the FilmArray RP testing group had escalated antibiotic treatments between 72 hours and seven days (7.80% versus 14.16%; p = 0.007). The cost of hospitalization was significantly lower in the FilmArray RP testing group ($ 1413.51  1438.01 versus $ 1759.37  1929.22; p = 0.008). Notably, the subgroup analyses revealed that the FilmArray RP test could shorten the DOT, improve early de-escalation of intravenous antibiotics within 72 hours of hospitalization, decline the escalation of intravenous antibiotics between 72 hours and seven days, and reduce the cost of hospitalization for both patient populations with or without underlying diseases.

Unlike blocking and indexing techniques that are used to reduce the number of record pairs to be compared, using recursive binning on a data dimension such as time or space, our approach removes likely non-matching record pairs in each bin after their comparison.

METHODS: We present the design of an evaluation study of Exit Doors Here which combines quantitative and qualitative methods to assess participant recruitment and retention into the program, program fidelity, and relationships with service providers (process evaluation), as well as progress made by participants in terms of strengthening their social support networks and moving closer to achieving their housing, pre-employment (i.e., educational, training and volunteering), and income-related goals, as well as their involvement in sex work (outcome evaluation).

In Kenya, there are no up-to-date and localised estimates of spatial access to urban centres. We estimate the travel time to urban centres and identify marginalised populations for prioritisation and targeting. METHODS: Urban centres were mapped from the 2019 Kenya population census and combined with spatial databases of road networks, elevation, land use and travel barriers within a cost-friction algorithm to compute travel time. Seven travel scenarios were considered: i) walking only (least optimistic), ii) bicycle only, iii) motorcycle only, iv) vehicle only (most optimistic), v) walking followed by motorcycle transport, vi) walking followed by vehicle transport, and vii) walking followed by motorcycle and then vehicle transport (most pragmatic). Mean travel time, and proportion of the population within 1-hour and 2-hours of the urban centres were summarized at sub-national units (counties) used for devolved planning. Inequities were explored and correlations between the proportion of the population within 1-hour of an urban centre and ten SDG indicators were computed. RESULTS: A total of 307 urban centres were digitised. Nationally, the mean travel time was 4.5-hours for the walking-only scenario, 1.0-hours for the vehicle only (most optimistic) scenario and 1.5-hours for the walking-motorcycle-vehicle (most pragmatic) scenario. Forty-five per cent (21.3 million people) and 87% (41.6 million people) of Kenyas population resided within 1-hour of the nearest urban centre for the least optimistic and most pragmatic scenarios respectively. Over 3.2 million people were considered marginalised or living outside the 2-hour threshold in the pragmatic scenario, 16.0 million Kenyans for walking only, and 2.2 million for the most optimistic scenario. County-level spatial access was highly heterogeneous ranging between 8%-100% and 32%-100% of people within the 1-hour threshold for the least and most optimistic scenarios, respectively. Counties in northern and eastern parts of Kenya were generally most marginalised. The correlation coefficients for nine SDG indicators ranged between 0.45 to 0.78 and were statistically significant.

However, in Germany, there is no such an evidence-based system to differentiate the complexity of patients needs in palliative care. Therefore, the study aims to develop a patient-oriented, nationally applicable complexity and casemix classification for adult palliative care patients in Germany. METHODS: COMPANION is a mixed-methods study with data derived from three subprojects. Subproject 1: Prospective, cross-sectional multi-centre study collecting data on patients needs which reflect the complexity of the respective patient situation, as well as data on resources that are required to meet these needs in specialist palliative care units, palliative care advisory teams, and specialist palliative home care. Subproject 2: Qualitative study including the development of a literature-based preliminary list of characteristics, expert interviews, and a focus group to develop a taxonomy for specialist palliative care models. Subproject 3: Multi-centre costing study based on resource data from subproject 1 and data of study centres. Data and results from the three subprojects will inform each other and form the basis for the development of the casemix classification. Ultimately, the casemix classification will be developed by applying Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analyses using patient and complexity data from subproject 1 and patient-related cost data from subproject 3. DISCUSSION: This is the first multi-centre costing study that integrates the structure and process characteristics of different palliative care settings in Germany with individual patient care. The mixed methods design and variety of included data allow for the development of a casemix classification that reflect on the complexity of the research subject. The consecutive inclusion of all patients cared for in participating study centres within the time of data collection allows for a comprehensive description of palliative care patients and their needs.

Cutaneous and interdigital swabs collected from 48 dogs and 15 cats owned by COVID-19 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR. The time elapsed between owner swab positivity and sample collection from pets ranged from 1 to 72 days, with a median time of 23 days for dogs and 39 days for cats. All samples tested negative, suggesting that pets do not passively carry SARS-CoV-2 on their hair and pads, and thus they likely do not play an important role in the virus transmission to humans. This data may contribute to confirming that the direct contact with the hair and pads of pets does not represent a route for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Do Dogs and Cats Passively Carry SARS-CoV-2 on Hair and Pads?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present short communication paper describes the methodological approach of applying the Health Belief Model to the use COVID-19 immunity certificates in the UK.

Ephedra sinica, one of the major constituent herbs of multi-component herbal formula, has been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. However, its active components are still unclear. The objectives of this study are to screen and evaluate active components from the traditional Chinese medicine Ephedra sinica for the treatment of COVID-19. In our study, we established an ACE2/CMC bioaffinity chromatography model, and then developed an ACE2/CMC-HPLC-IT-TOF-MS system for the active compounds screening and identification from Ephedra sinica extract. We performed molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays to assess the binding characteristics (binding mode and KD value). We used CCK-8 staining to assess the toxicity of screened compounds, and also used SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to observe the viropexis effect of screened compounds in ACE2h cells. In this current work, one fraction was fished out, separated and identified as ephedrine (EP), pseudoephedrine (PEP), and methylephedrine (MEP). Binding assays showed that the three compounds could bind with ACE2 in a special way to some amino acid residues, similar to the way SARS-CoV-2 bound with ACE2. Additionally, the three compounds, especially EP, can inhibit the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus into ACE2h cells because they can reduce the entrance ratio of pseudovirus in the pseudovirus model. Overall, the ACE2/CMC-HPLC-IT-TOF-MS system was established and verified to be suitable for ACE2-targeted bioactive compound screening. EP, PEP, and MEP with ACE2-binding features were screened out from Ephedra sinica, and acted as blockers inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus entering ACE2h cells.","output":"Screening and evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 components from Ephedra sinica by ACE2/CMC-HPLC-IT-TOF-MS approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To consider effective measures against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in medical institutions, this study estimated the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Tokyo, Japan, and determined the specific findings for mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Methods This study analyzed the results of serologic tests to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated the demographic and clinical characteristics of the faculty and HCWs at a Tokyo medical institution in August 2020. The demographic and clinical characteristics of participants with antibody-positive results were compared to those of participants with antibody-negative results. Patients or Materials This study recruited 2,341 faculty and HCWs at a Tokyo medical institution, 21 of whom had a COVID-19 history. Results Of the 2,320 participants without a COVID-19 history, 20 (0.862%) had positive serologic test results. A fever and dysgeusia or dysosmia occurred with greater frequency among the participants with positive test results than in those with negative results (odds ratio [OR], 5.475; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.960-15.293 and OR, 24.158; 95% CI, 2.693-216.720, respectively).

Elderly patients and those with concomitant conditions already being managed with multiple systemic drugs may be particularly susceptible to systemic toxicities with oral analgesic therapies. Topical agents offer an alternative to oral modalities and can effectively treat patients with acute pain while offering lower systemic absorption and conferring little risk of systemic toxicity. The objective of this article is to review the therapeutic usefulness of available topical therapies in their most thoroughly investigated applications, the treatment of patients with acute musculoskeletal and herpetic pain. For example, although heating pads/wraps and cold packs are widely used to alleviate pain associated with sprains, strains, and contusions, evidence of the effectiveness of these methods is lacking. However, there are sufficient data supporting the use of various topical formulations of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for these indications (ketoprofen gel or patch, ibuprofen gel or cream, and diclofenac gel or patch), and demonstrating markedly less patient risk of systemic toxicity than is associated with oral NSAID therapy. A ketoprofen patch was shown to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with tendinopathies. In the treatment of acute neck or low back pain, cold and heat therapies have demonstrated limited effectiveness for patients, and the efficacy of topical NSAIDs has not been established. Use of topical NSAID therapy has been useful in reducing acute-phase herpes zoster pain, and the lidocaine 5% patch has been shown to reduce acute herpetic pain intensity once lesions have healed (the patch cannot be applied to open skin lesions).

The response of unsure agents amid many uncertainties makes this game completely different from the previous studies. We construct a framework that combines SIS epidemic model with a variety of dynamic behavioral vaccination responses and demographic aspects. The response of each agent is influenced by the vaccination hesitancy and urgency, which arise due to their personal belief about efficacy and side-effects of the vaccine, disease characteristics, and relevant reported information (e.g., side-effects, disease statistics etc.). Based on such aspects, we identify the responses that are stable against static mutations. By analysing the attractors of the resulting ODEs, we observe interesting patterns in the limiting state of the system under evolutionary stable (ES) strategies, as a function of various defining parameters. There are responses for which the disease is eradicated completely (at limiting state), but none are stable against mutations. Also, vaccination abundance results in higher infected fractions at ES limiting state, irrespective of the disease death rate.","output":"Evolutionary Vaccination Games with premature vaccines to combat ongoing deadly pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The problem of computer security is as old as computers themselves and dates back decades [...].","output":"Cybersecurity and the Digital-Health: The Challenge of This Millennium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cirrhosis has a significant and growing impact on public health and patient reported outcomes.

However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance.

We show here that, based on both the rarity of these 13 mutations in intrapatient sequencing reads and patterns of selection at the codon sites where the mutations occur in SARS-CoV-2 and related sarbecoviruses, prior to the emergence of Omicron the mutations would have been predicted to decrease the fitness of any genomes within which they occurred. We further propose that the mutations in each of the three clusters therefore cooperatively interact to both mitigate their individual fitness costs, and adaptively alter the function of Spike. Given the evident epidemic growth advantages of Omicron over all previously known SARS-CoV-2 lineages, it is crucial to determine both how such complex and highly adaptive mutation constellations were assembled within the Omicron S-gene, and why, despite unprecedented global genomic surveillance efforts, the early stages of this assembly process went completely undetected.","output":"Selection analysis identifies unusual clustered mutational changes in Omicron lineage BA.1 that likely impact Spike function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the design and evaluation of a 3 5-year embedded sensing deployment at the Mithr?um of Circus Maximus, a UNESCO-protected underground archaeological site in Rome (Italy) Unique to our work is the use of energy harvesting through thermal and kinetic energy sources The extreme scarcity and erratic availability of energy, however, pose great challenges in system software, embedded hardware, and energy management We tackle them by testing, for the first time in a multi-year deployment, existing solutions in intermittent computing, low-power hardware, and energy harvesting Through three major design iterations, we find that these solutions operate as isolated silos and lack integration into a complete system, performing suboptimally In contrast, we demonstrate the efficient performance of a hardware/software co-design featuring accurate energy management and capturing the coupling between energy sources and sensed quantities Installing a battery-operated system alongside also allows us to perform a comparative study of energy harvesting in a demanding setting Albeit the latter reduces energy availability and thus lowers the data yield to about 22% of that provided by batteries, our system provides a comparable level of insight into environmental conditions and structural health of the site Further, unlike existing energy-harvesting deployments that are limited to a few months of operation in the best cases, our system runs with zero maintenance since almost 2 years, including 3 months of site inaccessibility due to a COVID19 lockdown ? 2020 ACM","output":"Battery-less zero-maintenance embedded sensing at the mithr?um of circus maximus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this research was to predict the epitope for coronavirus family spike protein.

There were 80 matched, 72 major mismatched, 72 minor mismatched, and 37 bidirectional mismatched transplants. Risk factors that could potentially influence the patients' outcomes were evaluated. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) isohaemagglutinin antibody (IHA) titres were determined 1 day before and 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after the transplant. RESULTS ABO mismatches did not influence engraftment, transfusion requirements, event-free survival or overall survival following CBT. The anti-donor IgM serum IHA titres fell to 1:8 at week 8 after CBT in all patients with ABO major and bidirectional mismatches. The percentages of patients requiring platelet and red blood cell transfusions in the period 31-61 days after CBT were markedly lower than in the period 0-30 days after CBT, being 15% vs 99% for platelets and 23% vs 78% for red blood cells, respectively. Of the 69 recipients of minor mismatched CBT tested, only three with AB blood type developed low titres of anti-recipient IHA after 5 months. DISCUSSION In this study ABO incompatibility did not affect clinical outcomes after CBT. A higher number of CD34+ cells infused was correlated with earlier engraftment.

In the Republic of Ireland and the UK, the provision of mathematics learning support (MLS) is the approach most commonly adopted by HEIs to deal with this problem, providing free one-to-one mathematical support and/or workshops for students. However, despite the availability of such supports and research that suggests that engagement with these supports can have a positive impact on student retention and progression, ensuring high levels of student engagement with these supports remains a significant challenge. In more recent years, some institutions have started to provide online MLS which takes many different forms but mainly provide links to websites, revision notes, past exam papers, etc. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for many to resort to remote teaching, it would appear the successful provision of online mathematics support is set to become increasingly important over the coming years. This paper will examine student interaction data with one such online MLS provision, hosted within a virtual learning environment.

Here, we construct spatially explicit Bayesian models that combine data on prevalence of endemic diseases and other socio-ecological characteristics to quantify patterns of confirmed deaths and cases across the globe before mass vaccination. We find that the prevalence of parasitic worms, human immunodeficiency virus and malaria play a surprisingly important role in predicting country-level SARS-CoV-2 patterns. When combined with factors such as population density, our models predict 63% (56-67) and 76% (69-81) of confirmed cases and deaths among countries, respectively. While our findings at this macro-scale are necessarily associative, they highlight a need for studies to consider factors, such as infection by other pathogens, on global SARS-CoV-2 dynamics.

This exploratory study examined speech-language pathologists' (SLPs) experiences using telepractice to provide services to children and youth aged 3-21 years who used aided AAC during the earlier months of the pandemic (May-June 2020). METHOD Three hundred thirty-one SLPs responded to an online survey. Closed- and open-ended survey items were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively and mixed at the point of interpretation to understand the experiences of SLPs related to the use of telepractice with children who use aided AAC, including how they perceived effectiveness. RESULTS Most SLPs were using telepractice to provide both direct and consultation/coaching services to children who used aided AAC. There was fairly wide variation in perceptions of effectiveness of both types of services, but SLPs were more likely to rate consultation/coaching services as being more effective than direct services. SLPs identified factors impacting effectiveness across five dimensions: broader factors, practice-based factors (i.e., technology, the type of services), the child, parents and family members, and professionals. School-based SLPs perceived telepractice as being less effective than non-school-based SLPs. CONCLUSIONS The use of telepractice during the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded quite differently for different SLPs and the children who use aided AAC that they serve. Although AAC telepractice offers promise for the future, particularly for partnering with families, further research is needed to know how to overcome challenges experienced by SLPs.

Additionally, we aim to generate insights into the drivers of cost variability within one medical domain. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a retrospective study at a breast clinic in Belgium. We used 14 anonymous patient files for conducting our analysis. RESULTS Significant cost variations within each molecular subtype and across molecular subtypes were found. For the luminal A classification, the cost differential amounts to roughly 166%, with the greatest treatment cost amounting to US$29 780 relative to US$11 208 for a patient requiring fewer medical activities. The major driver for these cost variations relates to disease characteristics. For the luminal B classification, a cost difference of roughly 242% exists due to both disease-related and patient-related factors. The average treatment cost for triple negative patients amounted to US$26 923, this is considered to be a more aggressive type of cancer. The overall cost for HER2-enriched is driven by the inclusion of Herceptin, thus this subtype is impacted by disease characteristics. Cost variability across molecular classifications is impacted by the severity of the disease, thus disease-related factors are the major drivers of cost. CONCLUSIONS Given the cost challenge in healthcare, the need for greater cost transparency has become imperative. Through our analysis, we generate initial insights into the drivers of cost variability for breast cancer. We found evidence that disease characteristics such as severity and more aggressive cancer forms such as HER2-enriched and triple negative have a significant impact on treatment cost across the different subtypes. Similarly, patient factors such as age and presence of gene mutation contribute to differences in treatment cost variability within molecular subtypes.","output":"Variability in hospital treatment costs: a time-driven activity-based costing approach for early-stage invasive breast cancer patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a high prevalence and mortality worldwide. Thousands of patients with acute respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 are daily hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) around the world. Many of these patients require full mechanical respiratory support and long-term ventilator use. Using different ventilators and calculating important variables can be helpful in meeting therapeutic needs of patients. Objectives The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of expiratory time constant (RCEXP) on the course of treatment and duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure hospitalized in ICU. Methods The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 60 patients with acute respiratory failure who were hospitalized in the ICU and underwent mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19 in the first six months of 2020. The variables of RCEXP, lung compliance and lung resistance in all patients were recorded daily and analyzed. Then, based on clinical outcome, the patients were divided into two groups: the patients with wean outcome (N = 40) and those with death outcome (N = 20). Results The mean  SD of lung compliance in patients who were separated from ventilator and patients with death outcome were 74.73 (18.58) mL/cm H2O and 36.92 (10.56) mL/cm H2O, respectively, which was statistically significant (P = 0.001). The mean  SD of lung resistance in patients who were separated from ventilator and patients with death outcome were calculated at 9.25 (4.62) and 14 (6.5), respectively, which was statistically significant (P = 0.015). Also, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of mean  SD of RCEXP (0.67 (0.23) vs. 0.49 (0.19), P = 0.010). Conclusions According to the results of this study, there was a significant difference between high resistance, low compliance, RCEXP, and weaning success of intubation in patients hospitalized in the ICU.","output":"Investigating the Effect of Expiratory Time Constant on Outcome in Intubated Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure Caused by COVID-19 in Critical Care Unit: A Research Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The importance of infectious disease in the survival and adaptation of animal populations is rapidly becoming apparent.

Transmission control according to official guidelines can be prevented by keeping a distance, wearing a mask and washing hands. Sharing a space with several members of the immediate or extended family increases the risk of transmission in all three ways. In Traditional Bosnian families two or three generations live in one household. The family doctor is informed with living conditions of the residents and has the opportunity to monitor the rate of secondary transmission from the index case, and then recommend additional preventative and treatment measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the first occurrence of the symptoms and to monitor possible intrafamilial transmission of the disease through clinical examinations and microbiological-serological tests. METHODS: The study was conducted in a family medicine clinic in the region of northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina from March to December 2020. Patients with symptoms that could indicate the presence of COVID-19 disease were registered. If COVID-19 was proven, the patient became an index case. The other members of the family would be monitored for the secondary transmission via laboratory (PCA SARS-CoV-2 and IgM and IgG antibodies) and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Characteristics of 25 index cases were analyzed. All 25 of them were middle-aged men that worked outside the home. In 25 households, there was a total of 123 members that shared a home with the index patient. Secondary transmission developed in 76 out of 123 family members (61.8%). Only one patient had a severe form of the disease and was hospitalized. 2 patients died. CONCLUSION: Intrafamiliar transmission of Covid-19 in households of Bosnia and Herzegovina is high. The secondary attack rate of SARS- CoV-2 in households is 61,8%. In the surveyed households, family members use common rooms with an infected patient, and the customs of family gatherings are maintained, without the implementation of protective measures.

JEV NS1-specific antibody responses could be a target in the differential diagnosis of different flavivirus infections. However, the epitopes on JEV NS1 are poorly characterized. The present study describes the full mapping of linear B-cell epitopes in JEV NS1. We generated eleven NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies from mice immunized with recombinant NS1. For epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies, a set of 51 partially-overlapping peptides covering the entire NS1 protein were expressed with a GST-tag and then screened using monoclonal antibodies. Through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), five linear epitope-containing peptides were identified. By sequentially removing amino acid residues from the carboxy and amino terminal of peptides, the minimal units of the five linear epitopes were identified and confirmed using monoclonal antibodies. Five linear epitopes are located in amino acids residues (5)AIDITRK(11), (72)RDELNVL(78), (251)KSKHNRREGY(260), (269)DENGIVLD(276), and (341)DETTLVRS(348). Furthermore, it was found that the epitopes are highly conserved among JEV strains through sequence alignment. Notably, none of the homologous regions on NS1 proteins from other flaviviruses reacted with the MAbs when they were tested for cross-reactivity, and all five epitope peptides were not recognized by sera against West Nile virus or Dengue virus.

We report on a demonstration case study of improvements made in the Family Health Center (FHC) of the JPS Health Network in a refugee patient population that illustrate features of QI in a CAS framework as opposed to a traditional QI approach. METHODS: We report on changes in health system utilization by new refugee patients of the FHC from 2016 to 2017. We review the literature and summarize relevant theoretical understandings of quality management in complex adaptive systems as it applies to this case example. RESULTS: Applying CAS principles in the FHC, utilization of the Emergency Department and Urgent Care Center by newly arrived refugee patients before their first clinic visit was reduced by more than half (total visits decreased from 31%-14% of the refugee patients). Our review of the literature demonstrates that traditional algorithmic top-down QI processes are most often unsuccessful in improving even a few single-disease metrics, and increases clinician burnout and penalizes clinicians who care for vulnerable patients. Improvement in a CAS occurs when front-line clinicians identify care gaps and are given the flexibility to learn and self-organize to enable new care processes to emerge, which are created from bottom-up leadership that utilize existing interdependencies and interact with the top levels of the organization through intelligent top-down causation. We give examples of early adapters who are better applying the principles of CAS change to their QI efforts.

We performed consistency analysis to quantify the impact of potential unmeasured confounding. Of 1 387 746 patients (60% receiving ACEi/ARB and 5.8% MRA), 7146 (0.51%) had incident hospitalization/death from COVID-19.

We assessed HCWs' willingness to be vaccinated and reasons underlying hesitancy. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey across 17 healthcare institutions. HCWs eligible for vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA) in December 2020 were invited to receive immunization. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of acceptance. Reasons for refusal among those who never intended to be vaccinated (ie, firm refusers) and those who preferred delaying vaccination (ie, vaccine hesitants) were assessed. RESULTS: Among 2,761 respondents (72% female, average age, 44), 2,233 (80.9%) accepted the vaccine. Physicians, environmental services workers and healthcare managers were more likely to accept vaccination compared to nurses. Male sex, age over 50, rehabilitation center workers, and occupational COVID-19 exposure were independently associated with vaccine acceptance by multivariate analysis. Factors for refusal included vaccine novelty, wanting others to receive it first, and insufficient time for decision-making. Among those who declined, 74% reported they may accept future vaccination. Vaccine firm refusers were more likely than vaccine hesitants to distrust pharmaceutical companies and to prefer developing a natural immunity by getting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy exists among HCWs. Our findings provide useful information to plan future interventions and improve acceptance.","output":"Covid-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal among Canadian healthcare workers: A multicenter survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] CRISPR-Cas12a is a genome-editing system, recently also harnessed for nucleic acid detection, which is promising for the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus through the DETECTR technology. Here, a collective ensemble of multimicrosecond molecular dynamics characterizes the key dynamic determinants allowing nucleic acid processing in CRISPR-Cas12a. We show that DNA binding induces a switch in the conformational dynamics of Cas12a, which results in the activation of the peripheral REC2 and Nuc domains to enable cleavage of nucleic acids. The simulations reveal that large-amplitude motions of the Nuc domain could favor the conformational activation of the system toward DNA cleavages. In this process, the REC lobe plays a critical role. Accordingly, the joint dynamics of REC and Nuc shows the tendency to prime the conformational transition of the DNA target strand toward the catalytic site. Most notably, the highly coupled dynamics of the REC2 region and Nuc domain suggests that REC2 could act as a regulator of the Nuc function, similar to what was observed previously for the HNH domain in the CRISPR-associated nuclease Cas9. These mutual domain dynamics could be critical for the nonspecific binding of DNA and thereby for the underlying mechanistic functioning of the DETECTR technology. Considering that REC is a key determinant in the systems specificity, our findings provide a rational basis for future biophysical studies aimed at characterizing its function in CRISPR-Cas12a. Overall, our outcomes advance our mechanistic understanding of CRISPR-Cas12a and provide grounds for novel engineering efforts to improve genome editing and viral detection.","output":"Molecular Dynamics Reveals a DNA-Induced Dynamic Switch Triggering Activation of CRISPR-Cas12a"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the clinical and imaging characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) patients with false\\\\negative nucleic acids.

There are many individuals and agencies, including policy makers, planners, administrators, and staff at the federal, state, and local level, involved in the process of planning for and executing policy in respect to a surge in the medical requirements of a population. They are responsible to ensure there is sufficient surge capacity within their own jurisdiction. PROBLEM The [US] federal government has required New York State to create a system of hospital bed surge capacity that provides for 500 adult and pediatric patients per 1 million population, which has been estimated to be an increase of 15-20% in bed availability. In response, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOH) has requested that area hospitals take an inventory of available beds and set a goal to provide for a 20% surge capacity to be available during a mass-casualty event or other conditions calling for increased inpatient bed availability. METHODS In 2003, under the auspices of the NYC DOH, the New York Institute of All Hazard Preparedness (NYIHP) was formed from four unaffiliated, healthcare facilities in Central Brooklyn to address this and other goals. RESULTS The NYIHP hospitals have developed a surge capacity plan to provide necessary space and utilities. As these plans have been applied, a bed surge capacity of approximately 25% was identified and created for Central Brooklyn to provide for the increased demand on the medical care system that may accompany a disaster. Through the process of developing an integrated plan that would engage a public health incident, the facilities of NYIHP demonstrate that a model of cooperation may be applied to an inherently fractioned medical system.","output":"Integrated plan to augment surge capacity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores potential non-linear and asymmetric interdependencies between oil price shocks and leading cryptocurrency returns.

METHODS This cross-sectional, hospital-based survey study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 502 HCW dealing with COVID-19. HCW were surveyed in 20 hospitals (Fever, Chest, and Quarantine hospitals) in different parts of Egypt, in April and May 2020. RESULTS Among the 502 HCW surveyed; 60.0% were physicians, 16.1% were specialized nurses, and 23.9% were non-specialized nurses. About 35.3% worked in chest hospitals, 17.5% in fever hospitals, and 47.2% in quarantine hospitals. A considerable proportion of HCW had symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, depression, and stress. Females were at higher risk of experiencing symptoms of severe anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.12-3.05; p = .016), severe depression (OR, 2.013; 95% CI, 1.17-3.4; p = .011), and severe stress (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; p < .001).

At our institution, we attempt treatment of nearly all closed, isolated tibial shaft fractures. The purpose of this study was to report the results of 10 years of experience to develop a tool to identify patients for whom non-operative treatment of tibial shaft fractures may be a viable option METHOD: This was a retrospective review of patients with tibial shaft fracture seen at a level 1 trauma center over 10 years. Patients with closed, isolated injuries underwent sedation, closed reduction, long-leg casting, and outpatient follow-up. Patients were converted to surgery for inability to obtain or maintain acceptable alignment or patient intolerance. Radiographic characteristics and patient demographics were extracted. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a model to predict which patient and injury characteristics determined success of nonoperative treatment. RESULTS: 334 patients were identified with isolated, closed tibial shaft fractures, who were reduced and treated in a long leg cast. 234 patients (70%) converted to surgical treatment due to inability to maintain alignment, patient intolerance, and nonunion. In a regression model, coronal/sagittal translation, sagittal angulation, fracture morphology, and smoking status were shown to be significant predictors of success of nonoperative treatment (p < 0.05). We developed a Tibial Operative Outcome Likelihood (TOOL) score designed to help predict success or failure of closed treatment. The TOOL score can be used to identify a subsegment of patients with injuries amenable to closed treatment (38% of injuries) with a nonoperative success rate over 60%. CONCLUSION: Non-operative treatment of tibial shaft fractures is feasible, although there is a relatively high conversion rate to operative treatment. However, it is possible to use injury characteristics to identify a cohort of patients with a higher chance of success with closed treatment, which is potentially useful in a resource-constrained setting or for patients who wish to avoid surgery.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between greenness exposure and COVID-19 cases at the district levels in South Korea. We also explored this association by considering several environmental indicators. Methods District-level data from across South Korea were used to model the cumulative count of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons between January 20, 2020, and February 25, 2021. Greenness exposure data were derived from the Environmental Geographic Information Service of the Korean Ministry of Environment. A negative binomial mixed model evaluated the association between greenness exposure and COVID-19 incidence rate at the district level. Furthermore, we assessed this association between demographic, socioeconomic, environmental statuses, and COVID-19 incidence. Results Data from 239 of 250 districts (95.6%) were included in the analyses, resulting in 127.89 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons between January 20, 2020 and February 25, 2021. Several demographic and socioeconomic variables, districts with a higher rate of natural greenness exposure, were significantly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence rates (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54C0.90; P-value = 0.008) after adjusting covariates, but no evidence for the association between built greenness and COVID-19 incidence rates was found.

Unknown nature of the virus, evidence of its adaptability and survival in new conditions, its widespread prevalence and also lengthy recovery period, along with daily notifications of new infection and fatality statistics, have created a wave of fear and anxiety among the public community and authorities. These factors have led to extreme changes in the social discourse in a rather short period of time. The analysis of this discourse is important to reconcile the society and restore ordinary conditions of mental peace and health. Although much research has been done on the disease since its international pandemic, the sociological analysis of the recent public phenomenon, especially in developing countries, still needs attention. We propose a framework for analyzing social media data and news stories oriented around COVID-19 disease. Our research is based on an extensive Persian data set gathered from different social media networks and news agencies in the period of January 21-April 29, 2020. We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and dynamic topic modeling to understand and capture the change of discourse in terms of temporal subjects. We scrutinize the reasons of subject alternations by exploring the related events and adopted practices and policies. The social discourse can highly affect the community morale and polarization. Therefore, we further analyze the polarization in online social media posts, and detect points of concept drift in the stream. Based on the analyzed content, effective guidelines are extracted to shift polarization towards positive.

In order to obtain the maximum benefit from these efforts, approaches to wastewater monitoring need to be rapid, sensitive, and relatable to relevant epidemiological parameters. In this study, we present an ultracentrifugation-based method for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater RNA and use crAssphage, a bacteriophage specific to the human gut, to help account for RNA loss during transit in the wastewater system and sample processing. With these methods, we were able to detect, and sometimes quantify, SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 20 mL wastewater samples within as little as 4.5 hours. Using known concentrations of bovine coronavirus RNA and deactivated SARS-CoV-2, we estimate recovery rates of approximately 7-12% of viral RNA using our method. Results from 24 sewersheds across Upstate New York during the spring and summer of 2020 suggested that stronger signals of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater may be indicative of greater COVID-19 incidence in the represented service area approximately one week in advance. SARS-CoV-2 wastewater RNA was quantifiable in some service areas with daily positives tests of less than 1 per 10,000 people or when weekly positive test rates within a sewershed were as low as 1.7%. crAssphage DNA concentrations were significantly lower during periods of high flow in almost all areas studied. After accounting for flow rate and population served, crAssphage levels per capita were estimated to be about 1.35a?a?1011 and 2.42a?a?108 genome copies per day for DNA and RNA, respectively. A negative relationship between per capita crAssphage RNA and service area size was also observed likely reflecting degradation of RNA over long transit times.

The low seroprevalence at the latest survey suggested that a large-scale epidemic had not yet occurred in Okinawa by February 2021. The case detection ratios imply that the cumulative number of incident cases in Okinawa should be 2-3 times higher than that reported by routine surveillance. The ratio was particularly high in young people probably due to a frequent asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 disease in this age group. To accurately measure the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is crucially important to conduct a sero-survey targeting the young.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence in the Okinawa Main Island and remote islands in Okinawa, Japan, 2020-2021."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The best minimally-invasive procedure for living-donor kidney retrieval remains debated. Our objective was to assess trans-peritoneal (TP) and retro-peritoneal (RP) hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (HALDN).

Donor and recipient outcomes were compared between TP-HALDN (n=235) and RP-HALDN (n=82). Conversion to open nephrectomy (0.4% vs 0%; P=1.000), intra-operative complications (1.7% vs 1.2%; P=1.000), and 1-year overall post-operative complications (11.9% vs 17.1%; P=0.258) rates were similar in TP-HALDN and RP-HALDN.

Q belongs to the family of Leviviridae and is found throughout the world (bacterial isolates and sewage). The genome of Q is about 4.2 kb, coding for four proteins. This genome is surrounded by 180 copies of coat proteins (capsomers) each comprised of 132 residues of amino acids. The other proteins, the subunit II () of a replicase, the maturation protein (A(2)) and the read-through or minor coat protein (A(1)), play a key role in phage infection. With the replicase protein, which lacks proofreading activity, as well as its short replication time, and high population size, Q phage has attractive features for in vitro evolution. The A(1) protein gene shares the same initiation codon with the coat protein gene and is produced during translation when the coat proteins UGA stop codon triplet (about 400 nucleotides from the initiation) is suppressed by a low level of ribosome misincorporation of tryptophan. Thus, A(1) is termed the read-through protein. This RNA phage platform technology not only serves to display foreign peptides but is also exceptionally suited to address questions about in vitro evolution. The C-terminus of A(1) protein confers to this RNA phage platform an exceptional feature of not only a linker for foreign peptide to be displayed also a model for evolution. This platform was used to present a peptide library of the G-H loop of the capsid region P1 of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) called VP1 protein. The library was exposed on the exterior surface of Q phages, evolved and selected with the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) SD6 of the FMDV. These hybrid phages could principally be good candidates for FMDV vaccine development. Separately, the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epitopes was fused with the A(1) proteins and exposed on the Q phage exterior surface. The engineered phages with MPER epitopes were recognized by anti-MPER specific antibodies. This system could be used to overcome the challenge of effective presentation of MPER to the immune system. A key portion of this linear epitope could be randomized and evolved with the Q system. Overall, antigens and epitopes of RNA viruses relevant to public health can be randomized, evolved and selected in pools using the proposed Q model to overcome their plasticity and the challenge of vaccine development. Major epitopes of a particular virus can be engineered or displayed on the Q phage surface and used for vaccine efficacy evaluation, thus avoiding the use of live viruses.","output":"Function of the RNA Coliphage Q Proteins in Medical In Vitro Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As elective surgery slowly re-opens across the country, it is paramount that surgeons recognize and take responsibility for their roles in protecting patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A primary stressor of SCs and their subsequent shocks derives from disruption propagation (i.e., the ripple effect) through related networks. In this paper, we conceptualize current state and future research directions on the ripple effect for pandemic context. We scrutinize the existing OR (Operational Research) studies published in international journals dealing with disruption propagation and structural dynamics in SCs. Our study pursues two major contributions in relation to two research questions. First, we collate state-of-the-art research on disruption propagation in SCs and identify a methodical taxonomy along with theories displaying their value and applications for coping with the impacts of pandemics on SCs. Second, we reveal and systemize managerial insights from theory used for operating (adapting) amid a pandemic and during times of recovery, along with becoming more resistant to future pandemics. Streamlining the literature allowed us to reveal several new research tensions and novel categorizations and classifications. The outcomes of our study show that methodical contributions and the resulting managerial insights can be categorized into three levels, i.e., network, process, and control. Our analysis reveals that adaptation capabilities play the most crucial role in managing the SCs under pandemic disruptions. Our findings depict how the existing OR methods can help coping with the ripple effect at five pandemic stages (i.e., Anticipation; Early Detection; Containment; Control and Mitigation; and Elimination) following the WHO classification. The outcomes and findings of our study can be used by industry and researchers alike to progress the decision-support systems guiding SCs amid the COVID-19 pandemic and toward recovery.

METHODS: Symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD (4-item PTSD Checklist-5), MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), burnout (Single-Item Mini-Z Burnout Assessment), and functional difficulties (Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning) were assessed. Relative importance analyses were conducted to identify PTSD, MDD, and GAD symptoms associated with burnout and functional difficulties. RESULTS: The total number of eligible participants included 6,026 presumed FHCWs, of which 3,360 (55.8%) completed the survey and 2,579 (76.8%) of whom endorsed directly treating patients with COVID-19 and provided sufficient responses to our outcome variables for analysis. Feeling tired/having little energy, being easily annoyed or irritable, and feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge were most strongly associated with burnout; feeling tired/having little energy accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 15%). Negative expectations of oneself or the world, trouble concentrating, and feeling easily annoyed or irritable were most strongly associated with work difficulties; negative expectations of oneself or the world accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 9%). Feeling easily annoyed or irritable, negative expectations about oneself or the world, and feeling bad about oneself were most strongly associated with relationship difficulties; feeling easily annoyed or irritable accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 10%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study underscore the importance of a transdiagnostic, symptom-based approach when examining associations between acute psychopathology and burnout and functional difficulties in FHCWs.

We aimed to assess the prevalence of long-term cardiac arrhythmias in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 infection with proved or suspected of cardiac involvement. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients with COVID-19 infection discharged from the cardiology department of our institution from the 1 March to the 30 April 2020 were considered eligible for this study. Patients were fitted out with an adhesive patch and a wireless single-lead 24-h electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor (Rooti Rx(?) System, Rooti Labs Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan). RootiRx(?) is a small device consisting of an integrated sensor system, a microelectronic board with memory storage, and an internal rechargeable battery. This system can provide continuous ECG and was set to monitor heart rhythm for 24 h. The Holter system provides also blood pressure measurements and sleep apnea data which are evaluated through chest wall motion/cyclic variation of heart rate and reported along with the sleep efficiency (percentage of time spent asleep while in bed). Arrhythmic findings, sleep apnea detections, and residual COVID-19 symptoms were reported. The study follow-up was performed 174 (range = 166C190) days after hospital discharge in a cohort of 63 (76% males, median age 66 years) patients. New diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) was performed in three sinus rhythm patients (4.8%). Eleven (18%) patients had asymptomatic bradycardia (<45 b.p.m.) with no pauses lasting more than 3 s. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (<30 s) episodes were recorded in two (3.2%) patients, while no sustained ventricular arrhythmia was documented. The Holter system indicated the presence of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea episodes in 33 (53%) patients without known history of sleep disorders. Some previously unrecognized long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms were also described: fatigue (10, 16%), myalgia (3, 4.8%), and impaired attention (1, 1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Six months after the infection, we performed new diagnoses of AF in patients who recovered from severe COVID-19 infection with proved or suspected cardiac involvement using 24-h Holter monitoring. No other arrhythmias were observed, but the Holter system identified obstructive sleep apnea episodes in half of the patients. A relevant percentage of patients also described persisting symptoms of COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest further prospective studies to better describe long-term arrhythmic manifestations and residual symptoms in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.","output":"460 Assessment of long-term arrhytmic sequelae in patients recovering from COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome encodes two envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2). These glycoproteins interact to form a noncovalent heterodimeric complex which in the cell accumulates in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like structures. The transmembrane domain of E2, at least, is involved in HCV glycoprotein complex localization in this compartment. In principle, ER localization of a protein can be the consequence of actual retention in this organelle or of retrieval from the Golgi. To determine which of these two mechanisms is responsible for HCV glycoprotein complex accumulation in the ER, the precise localization of these proteins was studied by immunofluorescence, and the processing of their glycans was analyzed. Immunolocalization of HCV glycoproteins after nocodazole treatment suggested an ER retention. In addition, HCV glycoprotein glycans were not modified by Golgi enzymes, indicating that the ER localization of these proteins is not because of their retrieval from the cis Golgi. Retention of HCV glycoprotein complexes in the ER without retrieval suggests that this compartment plays an important role for the acquisition of the envelope of HCV particles. A true retention in the ER was also observed for E2 expressed in the absence of E1 or for a chimeric protein containing the ectodomain of CD4 in fusion with the transmembrane domain of E2. These data indicate that, in HCV glycoprotein complex, the transmembrane domain of E2, at least, is responsible for true retention in the ER, without recycling through the Golgi.","output":"Hepatitis C virus glycoprotein complex localization in the endoplasmic reticulum involves a determinant for retention and not retrieval."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lecture videos have become a prevalent learning resource, due to the rising popularity of educational video platforms and the necessity for remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The infection was diagnosed in 136 individuals, and typing was confirmed by PCR and direct sequencing. The epidemiologic characteristics of the disease including the infection rate, incubation period, and basic reproductive number (R(0)), ie, number of cases directly infected by an infectious patient during the course of the disease, were investigated. The effectiveness of compartmentalization for infection control was determined by simulating the outbreak using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. RESULTS: The majority of the HAdV-54-infected individuals were the children of 3 nursery schools (A, B, and C) and their parents on Oki Island. The infection rates in the 3 schools were 13.2%, 16.9%, and 17.2%, respectively. The one class of school B without the index case was initially compartmentalized, and the infection rate in this compartment was 0%. The incubation period was calculated to be 9.3  3.5 days, and the disease duration, 13.0  5.4 days. The R(0) was 1.43. Using these parameters, a SEIR model was constructed. The SEIR model well predicted the daily incidence of infection and indicated that the compartmentalization method provides effective reduction in the incidence of the infection, with much earlier control.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the monoextract, diextracts, and triextracts of Quercus infectoria (QI), Citrus aurantifolia (CiA), and Coffea arabica (CoA) on infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental design consisted of three sets of ECEs at 11 days of age, and each set included seven groups (G1-G7). The extracts of QI, CiA, and CoA were inoculated to ECEs by the chorioallantoic membrane method before, in concomitant (mixed) with, and after IBDV infection to the first, second, and third sets, respectively. The monoextract, diextracts, and triextracts of QI, CiA, and CoA were given at 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% concentrations to G1-G3, G4-G6, and G7, respectively. Real-time polymerase chain reaction identified and confirmed the virus in accordance with the pathological changes. RESULTS: The monoextract (5-10% concentrations) inhibited IBDV and had no effect on viral infection preinoculation, whereas the monoextract (10% concentration) inhibited IBDV during mixed inoculation and post-inoculation. Diextracts (2-10% concentrations) inhibited IBDV and had no effect on viral infection preinoculation, whereas diextracts (5-10% concentrations) inhibited IBDV during mixed inoculation and post-inoculation. Triextracts (1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% concentrations) inhibited IBDV by ameliorating the pathological changes of the virus and preventing the death of ECEs. CONCLUSION: The inoculation of herbal extracts, particularly triextracts, alleviates the pathological changes in ECEs infected with IBDV.

Identifiability analysis is well-established for deterministic, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, but there are no commonly-adopted methods for analysing identifiability in stochastic models. We provide an accessible introduction to identifiability analysis and demonstrate how existing ideas for analysis of ODE models can be applied to stochastic differential equation (SDE) models through four practical case studies. To assess structural identifiability, we study ODEs that describe the statistical moments of the stochastic process using open-source software tools. Using practically-motivated synthetic data and Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we assess parameter identifiability in the context of available data. Our analysis shows that SDE models can often extract more information about parameters than deterministic descriptions.

Both processes are regulated by RNA sequences such as the 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs), and the transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) of the leader (TRS-L) and those preceding each gene (TRS-Bs). These distant RNA regulatory sequences interact with each other directly and probably through protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions involving viral and cellular proteins.1 By analogy to other plus-stranded RNA viruses, such as polioviruses, in which translation and replication switch involves a cellular factor (PCBP) and a viral protein (3CD),2 it is conceivable that in CoVs the switch between replication and transcription is also associated with the binding of proteins that are specifically recruited by the replication or transcription complexes. Complexes between RNA motifs such as TRS-L and the TRS-Bs located along the CoV genome are probably formed previously to the transcription start, and most likely promote template-switch of the nascent minus RNA to the TRS-L region.3 Many cellular proteins interacting with regulatory CoV RNA sequences4 are members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family of RNA-binding proteins, involved in mRNA processing and transport, which shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the context of CoV RNA synthesis, these cellular ribonucleoproteins might also participate in RNA-protein complexes to bring into physical proximity TRS-L and distant TRS-B, as proposed for CoV discontinuous transcription.5C7 In this review, we summarize RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions that represent modest examples of complex quaternary RNA-protein structures required for the fine-tuning of virus replication.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use has also declined. We aimed to quantify the potential effect of COVID-19 on HIV incidence and HIV-related mortality among US MSM. METHODS We used a calibrated, deterministic, compartmental HIV transmission model for MSM in Baltimore (MD, USA) and available data on COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV services to predict effects of reductions in sexual partners (0%, 25%, 50%), condom use (5%), HIV testing (20%), viral suppression (10%), PrEP initiations (72%), PrEP adherence (9%), and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiations (50%). In our main analysis, we modelled disruptions due to COVID-19 starting Jan 1, 2020, and lasting 6 months. We estimated the median change in cumulative new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths among MSM over 1 and 5 years, compared with a base case scenario without COVID-19-related disruptions. FINDINGS A 25% reduction in sexual partners for 6 months among MSM in Baltimore, without HIV service changes, could reduce new HIV infections by median 122% (95% credible interval 117 to 128) over 1 year and median 30% (26 to 34) over 5 years. In the absence of changes in sexual behaviour, the 6-month estimated reductions in condom use, HIV testing, viral suppression, PrEP initiations, PrEP adherence, and ART initiations combined are predicted to increase new HIV infections by median 105% (58 to 165) over 1 year, and by median 35% (21 to 54) over 5 years. Disruptions to ART initiations and viral suppression are estimated to substantially increase HIV-related deaths (ART initiations by median 17% [08 to 32], viral suppression by median 95% [52 to 159]) over 1 year, with smaller proportional increases over 5 years. The other individual disruptions (to HIV testing, PrEP and condom use, PrEP initiation, and partner numbers) were estimated to have little effect on HIV-related deaths (<1% change over 1 or 5 years). A 25% reduction in sexual partnerships is estimated to offset the effect of the combined service disruptions on new HIV infections (change over 1 year: median -39% [-74 to 10]; over 5 years: median 00% [-09 to 14]), but not on HIV deaths (change over 1 year: 110% [62 to 177]; over 5 years: 26% [15 to 43]).

The world has to battle with it until an effective solution is developed. Due to the advancement in mobile and sensor technology, it is possible to come up with Internet of things-based healthcare systems. These novel healthcare systems can be proactive and preventive rather than traditional reactive healthcare systems. This article proposes a real-time IoT-enabled framework for the detection and prediction of COVID-19 suspects in early stages, by collecting symptomatic data and analyzing the nature of the virus in a better manner. The framework computes the presence of COVID-19 virus by mining the health parameters collected in real time from sensors and other IoT devices. The framework is comprised of four main components: user system or data collection center, data analytic center, diagnostic system, and cloud system. To point out and detect the COVID-19 suspected in real time, this work proposes the five machine learning techniques, namely support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, na?ve Bayes, logistic regression, and neural network. In our proposed framework, the real and primary dataset collected from SKIMS, Srinagar, is used to validate our work. The experiment on the primary dataset was conducted using different machine learning techniques on selected symptoms. The efficiency of algorithms is calculated by computing the results of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, root-mean-square error, and area under the curve score. The employed machine learning techniques have shown the accuracy of above 95% on the primary symptomatic data. Based on the experiment conducted, the proposed framework would be effective in the early identification and prediction of COVID-19 suspect realizing the nature of the disease in better way.","output":"IoT-Enabled Framework for Early Detection and Prediction of COVID-19 Suspects by Leveraging Machine Learning in Cloud"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: India first detected SARS-CoV-2, causal agent of COVID-19 in late January 2020, imported from Wuhan, China. From March 2020 onwards, the importation of cases from countries in the rest of the world followed by seeding of local transmission triggered further outbreaks in India. Methods: We used ARTIC protocol-based tiling amplicon sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 (n=104) from different states of India using a combination of MinION and MinIT sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technology to understand how introduction and local transmission occurred. Results: The analyses revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, including the A2a cluster from Europe and the USA, A3 cluster from Middle East and A4 cluster (haplotype redefined) from Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia) and Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan). The local transmission and persistence of genomes A4, A2a and A3 was also observed in the studied locations. The most prevalent genomes with patterns of variance (confined in a cluster) remain unclassified, and are here proposed as A4-clade based on its divergence within the A cluster. Conclusions: The viral haplotypes may link their persistence to geo-climatic conditions and host response. Multipronged strategies including molecular surveillance based on real-time viral genomic data is of paramount importance for a timely management of the pandemic.","output":"Integrated genomic view of SARS-CoV-2 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this review, the challenges faced by woven kenaf thermoset polymer composites in Malaysia were addressed with respect to three major aspects: woven kenaf reinforcement quality, Malaysian citizen awareness of woven kenaf thermoset composite products, and government supports Kenaf plantations were introduced in Malaysia in the last two decades, but have generally not produced much kenaf composite product that has been widely accepted by the public However, woven kenaf fiber enhances the thermoset composites to a similar degree or better than other natural fibers, especially with respect to impact resistance Woven kenaf composites have been applied in automotive structural studies in Malaysia, yet they are still far from commercialization Hence, this review discusses the kenaf fiber woven in Malaysia, thermoset and bio-based thermoset polymers, thermoset composite processing methods and, most importantly, the challenges faced in Malaysia This review sets guidelines, provides an overview, and shares knowledge as to the potential challenges currently faced by woven kenaf reinforcements in thermoset polymer composites, allowing researchers to shift their interests and plans for conducting future studies on woven kenaf thermoset polymer composites","output":"The Challenges and Future Perspective of Woven Kenaf Reinforcement in Thermoset Polymer Composites in Malaysia: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Pensar la pandemia de SARS-CoV-2 implica el estudio de dimensiones generales y singulares para el devenir histrico de Amrica Latina y Caribe.

Aim of the study: to analyze the short-term treatment outcomes for patients with COVID-19 and hematomas of different localizations. Material and methods. The profile of hospital admissions of Sokolov North-West Regional Scientific and Clinical Center changed at November 6th, 2020. 1.878 patients with COVID-19 were admitted in the hospital from November 6th, 2020 and March 2nd, 2021. 25 people (1.1%) of admitted patients developed hematomas. The average age was 705.6 years. They were no mild forms of the disease. Anticoagulants were used in all cases from the 1st day of hospitalization. The volume of lung damage correspond-ed to CT-4 in 48% of patients, CT-3 in 2 (8%) patients and CT-2  in 11 (44%) patients. The methods of diagnostic imaging of he-matomas were CT, ultrasound, and laparoscopy. Results. Hematomas were represented by deep intramuscular hematomas in 96% (24 patients). The typical localization of the he-matomas was rectus muscle of the anterior abdominal wall (12 patients). Chest wall hematoma was detected less often (5 pa-tients) and limb hematomas (3 patients). Retroperitoneal hematoma was observed in 2 patients, gluteal hematoma  in 1 patient. There was a combination of hematomas of various anatomical areas in 2 patients: in one patient  in the anterior abdominal wall and hip, in the second  in the anterior abdominal wall and pelvis. Blood transfusion was performed in 12 patients (48%). Risk factors of hematomas formation were: initially critical or fast progression of lung lesion volume in patients with COVID-19, co-morbidity of patients, the presence of obesity and an increased level of D-dimer. These risk factors were associated with intensified anticoagulant therapy. Out of 25 patients, 8 (32%) people underwent surgical procedures, hematoma punctures were performed in 6 (24%) patients, and 11 (44%) patients received conservative therapy. The mortality rate was 40% (10 patients). The cause of death was progressive pneumonia (9 patients) and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome (1 patient). Conclusion. Hematomas of different sites can occur in COVID-19 patients upon anticoagulation treatment. The decision making process in such cases should be determined by the severity of the patients condition and lung damage, the localization of the he-matoma, the amount of blood loss, the dynamics of the volume of the hematoma, and the proportion of the fluid component in it according to ultrasound or CT.

Focus groups were conducted across multiple disability experiences, although one focus group was advertised explicitly as offering simultaneous American Sign Language interpretation to encourage people who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing to participate. Participants were asked about their perspectives on the management of COVID-19 public health measures and vaccination program rollout. Participants were also asked about barriers and facilitators of their vaccination experiences and if they had recommendations for improvement. RESULTS: The participants identified three areas where they encountered routine barriers in accessing the COVID-19 vaccines: (1) vaccine information and appointment booking, (2) physical access to vaccination clinics, and (3) vaccination experience. While participants identified specific recommendations to improve vaccine accessibility for people with disabilities, the single most crucial advice consistently identified was to involve people with disabilities in developing accessible immunization programs. CONCLUSION: Meaningful engagement with people living with disabilities in immunization program planning would help ensure that people with disabilities, who already face significant challenges due to COVID-19, are offered the same protections as the rest of the population.

The TPI engages different participant groups on programmatic topics and supports community dialogue to build girls agency, shift inequitable power relations, and change community norms sustaining CEFM. METHODS/ANALYSIS: The Nepal TPI impact evaluation has an integrated, mixed-methods design. The quantitative evaluation is a three-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial (control; Tipping Point Programme (TPP); TPP+ with emphasised social norms change). Fifty-four clusters of ~200 households were selected from two districts (27:27) with probability proportional to size and randomised. A household census ascertained eligible study participants, including unmarried girls and boys 12C16 years (1242:1242) and women and men 25+ years (270:270). Baseline participation was 1134 girls, 1154 boys, 270 women and 270 men. Questionnaires covered agency; social networks/norms; and discrimination/violence. Thirty in-depth interviews, 8 key-informant interviews and 32 focus group discussions were held across eight TPP/TPP+ clusters. Guides covered gender roles/aspirations; marriage decisions; girls safety/mobility; collective action; perceived shifts in child marriage; and norms about girls. Monitoring involves qualitative interviews, focus groups and session/event observations over two visits. Qualitative analyses follow a modified grounded theory approach. Quantitative analyses apply intention to treat, regression-based difference-in-difference strategies to assess impacts on primary (married, marriage hazard) and secondary outcomes, targeted endline tracing and regression-based methods to address potential selection bias.

METHODS: Participants were recruited using purposive sampling through patient clubs at primary health centres in Quito, Ecuador. The DHP-18 validation consisted in the linguistic validation made by two Ecuadorian doctors and eight patient interviews. And in the psychometric validation, where participants provided clinical and sociodemographic data and responded to the SF-12v2 health survey and the linguistically and culturally adapted version of the DHP-18. The original measurement model was evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Reliability was assessed through internal consistency using Cronbachs alpha and testCretest reproducibility by administering DHP-18 in a random subgroup of the participants two weeks after (n = 75) using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Convergent validity was assessed by establishing previous hypotheses of the expected correlations with the SF12v2 using Spearmans coefficient. RESULTS: Firstly, the DHP-18 was linguistically and culturally adapted. Secondly, in the psychometric validation, we included 146 participants, 58.2% female, the mean age was 56.8 and 31% had diabetes complications.

Therefore, contact tracing, based on reliable diagnostic tests, remains a crucial component of the epidemic response to help contain the spread of the virus. Such efforts are most effective when testing is rapid, widely available and low-cost. Here, a new biosensing platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 usable both at voltammetric and impedimetric mode is reported. The platform was constructed on a multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) screen-printed electrode (SPE) functionalized by methylene blue (MB) and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP). A bioactive layer of chitosan (CS) and protein A (PrA) was drop-casted on the electrode surface to synergistically improve the specific binding of the antibodies and their selectivity towards the target antigen. The binding of the immunosensor with the SP gives a change in both voltammetric and impedimetric signal, measured by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The voltammetric sensor showed better results in terms of linear range and LOD both in PBS and spiked-saliva samples, with LOD values of 5 and 30 ng/ml, compared to 20 and 50 ng/mL for the impedimetric sensor. Moreover, the voltammetric immunosensor was tested in real saliva, showing a 91.6% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity when compared to RT-PCR, and achieving 90% accuracy compared to 70% of a rapid antigen test. These findings provide a promising potential for the use of the proposed voltammetric immunosensor as point-of-care diagnostic test for COVID-19.","output":"A Comparative Study of Voltammetric vs Impedimetric Immunosensor for Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection at the Point-of-Care (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, the prevalence of obese individuals admitted with COVID-19 ranging between 30 and 60%. Herein we determined whether early changes in microRNAs (miRNAs) could be the underlying molecular mechanism increasing the risk of obese individuals to COVID-19 infection. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of plasma samples for circulating miRNAs showed a significant upregulation of miR-200c and a small increase in miR-let-7b obese individuals. This was associated with significant downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Both the miRNAs are the direct targets of ACE2, the specific functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Correlation analysis confirmed a significant negative correlation between ACE2 and both the miRNAs. Recent studies showed that despite being the functional receptor, inhibition/downregulation of ACE2 did not reduce the severity of COVID-19 infection. In contrast, increased angiotensin II following inhibition of ACE2 may increase the severity of the disease. Taken together, our novel results identify that upregulation of miR-200c may increase the susceptibility of obese individuals to COVID-19. Considering miRNA are the earliest molecular regulators, circulating miR-200c could be a potential biomarker in the early identification of those at the risk of severe COVID-19.","output":"Upregulated miR-200c may increase the risk of obese individuals to severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microcirculation is one of the basic functional processes where the main gas exchange between red blood cells (RBCs) and surrounding tissues occurs. It is greatly influenced by the shape and deformability of RBCs, which can be affected by oxidative stress induced by different drugs and diseases leading to anemia. Here we investigated how in vitro microfluidic characterization of RBCs transit velocity in microcapillaries can indicate cells damage and its correlation with clinical hematological analysis. For this purpose, we compared an SU-8 mold with an Si-etched mold for fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices and quantitatively figured out that oxidative stress induced by tert-Butyl hydroperoxide splits all RBCs into two subpopulations of normal and slow cells according to their transit velocity. Obtained results agree with the hematological analysis showing that such changes in RBCs velocities are due to violations of shape, volume, and increased heterogeneity of the cells. These data show that characterization of RBCs transport in microfluidic devices can directly reveal violations of microcirculation caused by oxidative stress. Therefore, it can be used for characterization of the ability of RBCs to move in microcapillaries, estimating possible side effects of cancer chemotherapy, and predicting the risk of anemia.","output":"Microfluidic Characterization of Red Blood Cells Microcirculation under Oxidative Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a pandemic of unprecedented scale.

To elucidate age-dependent effects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we inoculated two rhesus macaque monkey dam-infant pairs with SARS-CoV-2 and conducted virological and transcriptomic analysis of the respiratory tract and evaluated systemic cytokine and antibody responses. Viral RNA levels in all sampled mucosal secretions were comparable across dam-infant pairs in the respiratory tract. Despite comparable viral loads, adult macaques showed higher IL-6 in serum while CXCL10 was induced in all animals. Both groups mounted neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses, with infants showing a more rapid induction at day 7. Transcriptome analysis of tracheal tissue isolated at day 14 post-infection revealed significant upregulation of multiple interferon-stimulated genes in infants compared to adults. In contrast, a profibrotic transcriptomic signature with genes associated with cilia structure and function, extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and metabolism, coagulation, angiogenesis, and hypoxia was induced in adults compared to infants.

Antibody mediated responses are important for viral clearance but may also drive hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19. We present a case of an individual with a genetic inability to produce antibodies and severe COVID-19, receiving no other specific anti-viral treatment than convalescent COVID-19 plasma, illustrating that hyperinflammation can occur in the absence of a humoral anti-viral response. In addition, the case illustrates that the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses can facilitate clinical decision making in patients with COVID-19 and weak or absent humoral immune responses. CASE PRESENTATION: A male with X-linked agammaglobulinemia on regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy, hospitalized for 35 days due to severe COVID-19. Systemic inflammatory parameters were highly elevated. After treatment with convalescent COVID-19 plasma he became afebrile and the fatigue diminished. He was discharged on day 42 and nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR eventually was negative on day 49. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells prior to administration of plasma therapy suggested that antibodies were crucial for viral clearance.

This manuscript outlines the design, rationale, implementation, and challenges of the ISPY COVID trial during the first phase of trial activity from April 2020 until December 2021. Methods and analysis. The ISPY COVID Trial is a multi center open label phase 2 platform trial in the United States designed to evaluate therapeutics that may have a large effect on improving outcomes from severe COVID 19. The ISPY COVID Trial network includes academic and community hospitals with significant geographic diversity across the country. Enrolled patients are randomized to receive one of up to four investigational agents or a control and are evaluated for a family of two primary outcomes time to recovery and mortality. The statistical design uses a Bayesian model with stopping and graduation criteria designed to efficiently discard ineffective therapies and graduate promising agents for definitive efficacy trials. Each investigational agent arm enrolls to a maximum of 125 patients per arm and is compared to concurrent controls. As of December 2021, 11 investigational agent arms had been activated, and 8 arms were complete. Enrollment and adaptation of the trial design is ongoing. Ethics and dissemination.

SARS-CoV-2 previously accumulated mutations at a much slower rate, of 1-2 per month; the sudden appearance of a large cluster of mutations was thought to be unusual. We now suspect that VOC may have arisen from immunosuppressed individuals who shed virus for longer periods. Epidemiological analyses estimate VOC to be more infectious; this is of most concern because these estimates were calculated during periods where many regions of the UK were in high social distancing restrictions. Therefore, the previous 'tiered' system implemented in the UK was ineffective at containing VOC. The most likely reason for this is that previous restrictions, no matter how strict, still allowed for gatherings in certain places. VOC also has implications for the national vaccination programme - a higher proportion of people will need to be vaccinated with a more infectious virus. Prolongation of the second dose of vaccines to increase vaccine uptake has understandably caused concern, but is based on sound immunological principles.

A major bottleneck to this effort is the few species with available sequences for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, a key receptor required for viral cell entry. We overcome this bottleneck by combining species' ecological and biological traits with three-dimensional modelling of host-virus proteinCprotein interactions using machine learning. This approach enables predictions about the zoonotic capacity of SARS-CoV-2 for greater than 5000 mammalsan order of magnitude more species than previously possible.

PURPOSE: To synthesize evidence on the prevalence, levels, and durability of detectable antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confer natural immunity.

STUDY SELECTION: Primary studies characterizing the prevalence, levels, and duration of antibodies in adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); reinfection incidence; and unintended consequences of antibody testing. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators sequentially extracted study data and rated quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Moderate-strength evidence suggests that most adults develop detectable levels of IgM and IgG antibodies after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and that IgG levels peak approximately 25 days after symptom onset and may remain detectable for at least 120 days. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that IgM levels peak at approximately 20 days and then decline. Low-strength evidence suggests that most adults generate neutralizing antibodies, which may persist for several months like IgG. Low-strength evidence also suggests that older age, greater disease severity, and presence of symptoms may be associated with higher antibody levels. Some adults do not develop antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection for reasons that are unclear. LIMITATION: Most studies were small and had methodological limitations; studies used immunoassays of variable accuracy. CONCLUSION: Most adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR develop antibodies. Levels of IgM peak early in the disease course and then decline, whereas IgG peaks later and may remain detectable for at least 120 days.

Outcome was analysed according to primary intended therapy. RESULTS Among 185 patients (median age 67.4 years), 52.4% received primary conservative therapy (including 26.8% secondary reperfusion in case of secondary neurological deterioration), 12.4% IV thrombolysis (IVT) only and 35.1% primary endovascular therapy (EVT). 95 (51.4%) patients experienced neurological deterioration until 3 months. Primary-IVT-only and primary-EVT compared to conservative-therapy patients had better 3 months' outcome (54.5% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 6.02; adjustedp = 0.004 for mRS 0-1 and 54.7% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 5.09; adjustedp = 0.002, respectively). Also mRS shift analysis favored primary-IVT-only and primary-EVT patients (adjustedOR 6.25; adjustedp = 0.001 and adjustedOR 3.14; adjustedp = 0.003). Outcome in primary-IVT-only vs. primary-EVT patients did not differ significantly.

Like any graph, these curves have limitations: they are impractical for comparisons of large and small outbreaks or of asynchronous outbreaks, and they do not display the relative growth rate of the epidemic. Our aim was to propose two additional graphical displays for the monitoring of epidemic outbreaks that overcome these limitations. METHODS: The first graph shows the growth of the epidemic as a function of its size; specifically, the logarithm of new cases on a given day, N(t), is plotted against the logarithm of cumulative cases C(t). Logarithm transformations facilitate comparisons of outbreaks of different sizes, and the lack of a time scale overcomes the need to establish a starting time for each outbreak. Notably, on this graph, exponential growth corresponds to a straight line with a slope equal to one. The second graph represents the logarithm of the relative rate of growth of the epidemic over time; specifically, log(10)(N(t)/C(t-1)) is plotted against time (t) since the 25th event. We applied these methods to daily death counts attributed to COVID-19 in selected countries, reported up to June 5, 2020. RESULTS: In most countries, the log(N) over log(C) plots showed initially a near-linear increase in COVID-19 deaths, followed by a sharp downturn. They enabled comparisons of small and large outbreaks (e.g., Switzerland vs UK), and identified outbreaks that were still growing at near-exponential rates (e.g., Brazil or India). The plots of log(10)(N(t)/C(t-1)) over time showed a near-linear decrease (on a log scale) of the relative growth rate of most COVID-19 epidemics, and identified countries in which this decrease failed to set in in the early weeks (e.g., USA) or abated late in the outbreak (e.g., Portugal or Russia). CONCLUSIONS: The plot of log(N) over log(C) displays simultaneously the growth and size of an epidemic, and allows easy identification of exponential growth.

Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from mice immunized to MHV into RAG1(-/-) mice infected with an attenuated strain of the virus results in the rapid and progressive development of demyelination. Most striking, adoptive transfer resulted, within 5 to 6 days, in extensive recruitment of activated macrophages/microglia to sites of demyelination within the spinal cord.

Among STIs, Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common asymptomatic preventable bacterial STI. C. trachomatis can affect both sperm and the male reproductive tract.

We aimed to explore the underlying neural substrate of the different responses to antiseizure drugs between the seizure-free (SF) and non-seizure-free (NSF) patients with GTCS through the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method. METHODS: We calculated ALFF among the SF group, NSF group, and healthy controls (HCs) by collecting resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the ALFF of the three groups, and post-hoc analysis was done at the same time. Pearson's correlation analysis between ALFF in the discrepant brain areas and the clinical characteristics (disease course and age of onset of GTCS) was calculated after then. RESULTS: A significant group effect was found in the right fusiform gyrus (R.FG), left fusiform gyrus (L.FG), left middle occipital gyrus (L.MOG), right inferior frontal gyrus (R.IFG), right precentral gyrus (R.PreG), right postcentral gyrus (R.PostG), and left calcarine sulcus (L.CS). The SF and NSF groups both showed increased ALFF in all discrepant brain areas compared to HCs except the R.IFG in the NSF group. Significantly higher ALFF in the bilateral FG and lower ALFF in the R.IFG were found in the NSF group compared to the SF group. CONCLUSIONS: Higher ALFF in the bilateral FG were found in the NSF group compared to the SF and HC groups. Our findings indicate that abnormal brain activity in the FG may be one potential neural substrate to interpret the failure of seizure control in patients with GTCS.","output":"Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation With Different Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Generalized TonicCClonic Seizures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The evaluation of the available evidence on vertical transmission by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV)-2.

SELECTION OF STUDIES The electronic search resulted in a total of 2,073 records. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two authors (WPM, IDESB), who checked for duplicates using the pre-established criteria for screening (studies published in English without limitation regarding the date or the status of the publication). DATA COLLECTION Data extraction was performed in a standardized way, and the final eligibility was assessed by reading the full text of the articles. We retrieved data regarding the delivery of the potential cases of vertical transmission, as well as the main findings and conclusions of systematic reviews. DATA SYNTHESIS The 2,073 records were reviewed; 1,000 duplicates and 896 clearly not eligible records were excluded. We evaluated the full text of 177 records, and identified only 9 suspected cases of possible vertical transmission. The only case with sufficient evidence of vertical transmission was reported in France. CONCLUSION The risk of vertical transmission by SARS-CoV-2 is probably very low. Despite several thousands of affected pregnant women, we have identified only one case that has fulfilled sufficient criteria to be confirmed as a case of vertical transmission.

The survey was developed using procedures outlined by the commonly accepted stages of an instrument development process. Content validity was established using four approaches: (a) identification of the purpose of the survey, (b) creation of a blueprint of items, (c) cognitive interviews, and (d) expert panel review. A total of 1,053 early childhood educators began the survey, with 808 (77%) of the responses included because educators met the inclusion criteria of working in the United States and responding to at least one question related to remote instruction. The survey contained 37 closed-ended and six open-ended items covering eight domains: (a) demographic information; (b) preparation, guidelines, and materials for remote learning; (c) caregiver communication and engagement; (d) assessment; (e) instruction; (f) educators levels of confidence before and after remote learning; (g) access to services (i.e., wraparound and/or special education); and (h) planning for the return to face-to-face instruction. Both quantitative (descriptive, t-test, regression, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests) and consensual qualitative research analyses were applied to summarize the survey results. Findings from this survey indicated that even with limited or no guidance from administrators, educators successfully adapted to remote instruction and their levels of confidence increased over time. Ongoing improvements need to be made to sustain regular communication with all families, to offer access to technology (i.e., devices and internet), to administer assessments or universal screeners, and to provide cohesive guidelines and expectations.

Human coronaviruses HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63 co-circulated during each of the respiratory seasons but with significant year-to-year variability, and cumulatively accounted for 7.4-15.6 % of all samples tested during the months of peak activity. A total of 79 (0.5 % prevalence) specimens were positive for human betacoronavirus HKU1 RNA. Genotypes HKU1 A and B were both isolated from clinical specimens and propagated on primary human tracheal-bronchial epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface and were neutralized in vitro by human intravenous immunoglobulin and by polyclonal rabbit antibodies to the spike glycoprotein of HKU1. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of seven full-length genomes of Colorado HKU1 viruses and the spike glycoproteins from four additional HKU1 viruses from Colorado and three from Brazil demonstrated remarkable conservation of these sequences with genotypes circulating in Hong Kong and France. Within genotype A, all but one of the Colorado HKU1 sequences formed a unique subclade defined by three amino acid substitutions (W197F, F613Y and S752F) in the spike glycoprotein and exhibited a unique signature in the acidic tandem repeat in the N-terminal region of the nsp3 subdomain.

Legal scholars have hypothesized that the effects of the pandemic may contribute to more coercive plea bargains (Cannon, 2020; Johnson, 2020). In this study, we explored defense attorneys' perceptions of whether and how the plea process has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. HYPOTHESES: This study was exploratory, and we made no a priori hypotheses. METHOD: We surveyed 93 practicing United States defense attorneys about their perceptions of whether and how the pandemic has affected court procedures, plea-bargaining and prosecutorial behavior, and defendant decision-making. We conducted semistructured follow-up interviews with 13 defense attorneys to help contextualize the survey responses. RESULTS: The majority of defense attorneys (81%, n = 76) reported that the plea process had changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that they experienced difficulty contacting and communicating with their clients, especially those who were detained. Two thirds of defense attorneys (n = 42) who said the plea process had changed thought that prosecutors were offering more lenient deals. One third of defense attorneys with detained clients (n = 23) reported having had clients plead guilty due to COVID-19 related conditions who might not have under normal circumstances. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of defense attorneys reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their ability to access and advise clients, and they believed that leverage in plea negotiations had shifted further to individual prosecutors.

METHODS: Unstable bradycardic patients who failed to respond to a fluid bolus and up to 3 mg atropine were enrolled. The intervention was dopamine or TCP with crossover to dopamine if TCP failed. The primary outcome was survival to discharge or 30 days. Randomization compliance, safety, follow-up rates, primary outcome, and sample size requirements were assessed. RESULTS: Of 383 patients with unstable bradycardia, 151 (39%) failed to respond to atropine or fluid and were eligible for enrolment and 82 (55%) were correctly enrolled. Fifty-five (36%) of eligible patients could not be enrolled for practical reasons; 3 had advance directives, 32 met inclusion criteria on arrival at hospital and in 20 cases, paramedics chose not to enroll based on the circumstances of the case. The remaining 13 were missed cases; 8 were missing randomization envelopes and in 5, the paramedic forgot. Randomization compliance was 95% (78/82). Forty-two (51%) patients were randomized to TCP and seven of these crossed over to dopamine.

The operative and postoperative parameters were then compared with those of 30 consecutive patients who had previously undergone the same procedure but with the monofilament poliglecaprone suture Monocryl. All procedures were performed by the same experienced surgeon. RESULTS VUA time was significantly shorter in the V-Loc group (13.2  2.3 min) than in the Monocryl group (19.1  3.3 min) (P < 0.001). The V-Loc group required significantly more stitches than the Monocryl group (11.4  1.3 vs 10.6  1.6 stitches; P = 0.031).

In this study, we evaluate residency websites in detailing the response to COVID-19 as well as initiatives which help describe the resident experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Program websites for diagnostic radiology residencies listed in the 2022 Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) program list were evaluated for 31 criteria related to departmental response to COVID-19, online outreach, and resident wellness. RESULTS: Of 184 programs, 182 had functioning websites for review. One program was excluded from analysis as the website was almost entirely video-based. In response to COVID-19, 1% described resident redeployment, vaccination information, departmental response to ABR Core Exam changes, or regular administration updates. Six (3.3%) described revised read-out protocols, four (2.2%) mentioned supplementary non-clinical education, and 14 (7.7%) indicated changes to educational conferences. The majority of websites (122, 67.4%) offered an informational or tour video, while 44 (24.3%) described expectations for virtual interviewing, and 20 (11.0%) had virtual open-houses. Departmental social media, primarily Twitter, was linked for 60 (33.1%) programs. A total of 134 (74.0%) websites described community highlights. More than a quarter mentioned meal stipends (72, 39.8%), paid sick time (54, 29.8%) and healthcare resources (57, 31.5%).

The hospitals were asked to report upper GI endoscopies performed for recent hematemesis, melena, or both, and exhibiting endoscopically visible signs of bleeding. The study period was from 3 weeks before (calendar Week 9) to 3 weeks after (Week 14) initiation of the lockdown. Results 61 % of Austrian hospitals, and importantly all major state hospitals, responded. A total of 575 upper GI bleedings occurred during the 3 weeks before and 341 during the 3 weeks after initiation of lockdown (40.7 % reduction). There was a 54.6 % decline in nonvariceal bleeding events at Week 14 compared with Week 9 (89 vs. 196), whereas rates of variceal hemorrhage did not change (15 vs. 17).

In this literature review, we have focused on the known and postulated mechanisms of action of omega-3 PUFAs and their metabolites on various components of the haemostatic system, in particular on blood platelets and endothelium. We have also made an attempt to provide a comprehensive review of epidemiological studies with particular regard to clinical trials. Notably, the results of these studies are contradictory, and some of them failed to report the beneficial effects of taking or supplementing omega-3 PUFAs in the diet. A potential explanation, in our opinion, could be the need to use higher doses of omega-3 PUFAs and a proper ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs. An additional problem which is difficult to solve is the use of a proper neutral placebo for interventional studies. Despite some controversies regarding the beneficial effects of supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs in cardiovascular disease, our review suggests that a promising aspect of future studies and applications is to focus on the anti-thrombotic properties of these compounds. An argument supporting this assumption is the recent use of omega-3 PUFAs as a supporting tool for the treatment of COVID-19 complications.","output":"Effects of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Their Metabolites on Haemostasis-Current Perspectives in Cardiovascular Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using data from a national survey conducted in the United States during the Spring of 2020, the study investigates the differences between emergency managers, transportation planners, and others involved in disaster response regarding pandemic risk perceptions and protective actions.

Respondent attributes and the agencies and communities they work in are categorized in terms of personal, disciplinary, or professional backgrounds, including urban versus rural locations, coastal versus non-coastal communities, and other factors. Three different dependent variables are modeled, including: 1) risk tolerance, 2) level of preparedness (including support for training), and 3) implementation of protective measures for social distancing, quarantine, and isolation to ascertain the influences of personal, professional, and locational characteristics. A risk tolerance score is used by asking, What percentage of the population would need to be sick to execute voluntary and non-voluntary actions? Poisson regression and correspondence analysis are used to identify patterns, associations, and clustering of respondent characteristics to show the relationships between risk perceptions, preparedness, and professional backgrounds. In addition to determining which places and people are more inclined to support protective actions against the pandemic, this analysis also demonstrates the intersections and mutual interests across public health, transportation, and emergency management.

In this article we evaluate the current status of primary health care in the era of the Declaration of Astana, the sustainable development goals, universal health coverage and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We consider how best to guide greater application of the primary health care strategy, reflecting on tensions that remain between the political vision of primary health care and its implementation in countries. We also consider what is required to support countries to realize the aspirations of primary health care, arguing that national needs and action must dominate over global preoccupations. Changing contexts and realities need to be accommodated. A clear distinction is needed between primary health care as an inspirational vision and set of values for health development, and primary health care as policy and implementation space. To achieve this vision, political action is required. Stakeholders beyond the health sector will often need to lead, which is challenging because the concept of primary health care is poorly understood by other sectors. Efforts on primary health care as policy and implementation space might focus explicitly on primary care and the frontline of service delivery with clear links and support to complementary work on social determinants and building healthy societies.

ParticipantsTwo mutually exclusive vaccinated cohorts included people vaccinated with either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 between 8 December 2020 and 6 March 2021. A third cohort consisted of people newly infected with SARS-Cov-2 identified by a first positive RT-PCR test between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2021. The fourth general population cohort for background rates included those people with a visit between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019. In total, we included 1,868,767 ChAdOx1 and 1,661,139 BNT162b2 vaccinees, 299,311 people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 2,290,537 people from the general population. InterventionsFirst-dose of either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 Main outcome measuresOutcomes included venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Outcome rates were estimated for recipients of the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines, for people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and background rates in the general population. Indirectly standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were estimated. ResultsWe included 1,868,767 ChAdOx1 and 1,661,139 BNT162b2 vaccinees, 299,311 people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 2,290,537 people from the general population for background rates. The SIRs for pulmonary embolism were 1.23 [95% CI, 1.09-1.39] after vaccination with ChAdOx1, 1.21 [1.07-1.36] after vaccination with BNT162b2, and 15.31 [14.08 to 16.65] for infection with SARS-CoV-2. The SIRs for thrombocytopenia after vaccination were 1.25 [1.19 to 1.31] for ChAdOx1 and 0.99 (0.94 to 1.04) for BNT162b2. Rates of deep vein thrombosis and arterial thrombosis were similar among those vaccinated and the general population. ConclusionsChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 had broadly similar safety profiles.

Disruptions in the patterns of daily, routine activities of life caused by lockdowns have been linked to changes in opportunities for criminal events, and these opportunities may vary based on the type of crime. The purpose of this paper is to examine the rates of violent interpersonal crime and domestic violence in the State of Florida, USA from 1/1/2020 to 12/31/2020. Using counties as the unit of analysis, the rates for selected violent crimes was predicted based on the differential impact of the COVID-19 virus, controlling for various county-level social vulnerability and health-related factors. Comparisons between violent crime levels in 2019 and 2020 were also made. Under opportunity theory, it was predicted that the level of domestic violence would increase in counties that experienced higher infection rates and deaths from COVID-19. Conversely, it was predicted that interpersonal violence would decrease in counties with greater impacts and restrictions due to the COVID-19 virus. The results suggest that as the COVID-19 death rate increased, incidents of domestic violence decreased. Altruism was proposed as an alternative explanation for this atypical finding.

METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed and recruitment was done via personalized email sent to program coordinators of 113 ACGME-accredited otolaryngology training programs within the Unites States. The message requested a breakdown of the amount of time and specialty in which first year otolaryngologic residents rotated. Interval follow ups were sent at 3 and 6 months for coordinators who had not responded. RESULTS Response rate was 79.7% (90/113). General surgery and surgical intensive care unit were the two most common non-otolaryngologic rotations (92.2% and 96.6% respectively) while ophthalmology and radiation oncology were the least common at 7.8% each.

Pediatric hospitalists and intensivists had to rapidly prepare to care for medically-complex adults. We report on the creation of an interactive webinar on the care of the critically-ill adult patient to meet the emerging educational need for the pediatric intensivist. Methods: A 5-part webinar series was created by the Pediatric Overflow Contingency Response Network (POPCoRN), an ad hoc network dedicated to providing resources and collaboration for pediatricians caring for adults during the pandemic. The webinar highlighted key differences between pediatric and adult critical care on a variety of topics including anticoagulation, safety checklists, and ventilator management. A dual-boarded adult and pediatric intensivist served as the primary moderator for 3 panelists composed of pediatric and adult critical care physicians. A postwebinar survey was distributed to all attendees of at least one event to assess provider comfort and the efficacy of the series. Nonparametric analyses were used to assess quantitative metrics and free text narratives used to gather qualitative data. Results: Of 254 attendees, 41 (16%) completed the post-webinar survey.

Increasing life expectancy, outbreaks like COVID-19, and the endemic nature of diseases like dengue, malaria have underscored its importance. Therefore, this study was carried out with the aim to assess hesitancy and factors influencing the uptake of vaccines in adults. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among adults (age more than 20 years). Data collection was done by convenience sampling in January 2021. Information on awareness and perceptions regarding adult vaccination and immunization status of participants was collected. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 21. RESULTS: A total of 461 adults responded to the survey. Among those who had never received any vaccine in adulthood (n = 158), the reasons were lack of recommendation by healthcare providers (38.6%), lack of knowledge of vaccines (15.8%) and fear of adverse effects following vaccination (7.6%). Hesitancy for vaccines among those who were informed by healthcare workers was as follows: shingles (97.8%), human papillomavirus (92.1%), pneumococcal (91.1%), influenza (79.7%), varicella (79.4%) and tetanus (57.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced vaccine uptake due to vaccine hesitancy in adulthood is a major health concern. Hesitancy was highest for the shingles vaccine and least for the tetanus vaccine.

The mechanism of translation initiation on hepacivirus/pestivirus (HP) IRESs, which involves factor-independent binding to ribosomal 40S subunits, also differs fundamentally from initiation on these picornavirus IRESs. Ribosomal binding to HP IRESs requires conserved sequences that form a pseudoknot and the adjacent IIId and IIIe domains; analogous elements do not occur in the two principal groups of picornavirus IRESs. Here, comparative sequence analysis was used to identify a subset of picornaviruses from multiple genera that contain 5' UTR sequences with significant similarities to HP IRESs. They are avian encephalomyelitis virus, duck hepatitis virus 1, duck picornavirus, porcine teschovirus, porcine enterovirus 8, Seneca Valley virus, and simian picornavirus. Their 5' UTRs are predicted to form several structures, in some of which the peripheral elements differ from the corresponding HP IRES elements but in which the core pseudoknot, domain IIId, and domain IIIe elements are all closely related.

METHODS: From August 13, 2020, to May 31, 2021, 48 long-COVID patients with respiratory symptoms (27 men and 21 women; median age, 62.0 years; interquartile range: 54.0C69.0 years) underwent follow-up paired inspiration-expiration thin-section CT scans. Patient demographics, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission rate, and clinical and laboratory features of acute infection were also included. The scans were obtained on a median of 72.5 days after onset of symptoms (interquartile range: 58.5C86.5) and at least 30 days after hospital discharge. Thin-section CT findings included ground-glass opacity, mosaic attenuation pattern, consolidation, traction bronchiectasis, reticulation, parenchymal bands, bronchial wall thickening, and air trapping. We used a quantitative score to determine the degree of air trapping in the expiratory scans. RESULTS: Parenchymal abnormality was found in 50% (24/48) of patients and included air trapping (37/48, 77%), ground-glass opacities (19/48, 40%), reticulation (18/48, 38%), parenchymal bands (15/48, 31%), traction bronchiectasis (9/48, 19%), mosaic attenuation pattern (9/48, 19%), bronchial wall thickening (6/48, 13%), and consolidation (2/48, 4%). The absence of air trapping was observed in 11/48 (23%), mild air trapping in 20/48 (42%), moderate in 13/48 (27%), and severe in 4/48 (8%). Independent predictors of air trapping were, in decreasing order of importance, gender (p = 0.0085), and age (p = 0.0182). CONCLUSIONS: Our results, in a limited number of patients, suggest that follow-up with paired inspiratory/expiratory CT in long-COVID patients with persistent respiratory symptoms commonly displays air trapping.

Participants (N = 809, Mage = 15.67, SD = 1.37) identified as a girl (56.2%), boy (38.7%), or trans/nonbinary individuals (TNBI;5.1%) and were recruited via social media to complete an online survey. A high proportion of adolescents reported symptoms of clinical concern for depression (51%), anxiety (39%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (45%). Other mental health problems ranged from 9% to 20%. Adolescents were mainly concerned with the health of family members and vulnerable populations, as well as the increased family stress at home during COVID-19. Rates of substance use were higher than expected, with over 50% of youth engaging in some form of substance use in the past 90 days, and almost 20% engaging in substance use at least once a week. TNBI and girls reported higher rates of mental health problems compared to boys. Family stress due to confinement and violence at home predicted higher mental health symptoms, but not substance use problems.

However, due to complex feature behaviors and expensive annotations of US images, it is difficult to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisting approaches for lung's multi-symptom (multi-label) classification. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel semi-supervised Two-Stream Active Learning (TSAL) method to model complicated features and reduce labeling costs in an iterative procedure. The core component of TSAL is the multi-label learning mechanism, in which label correlations information is used to design multi-label margin (MLM) strategy and confidence validation for automatically selecting informative samples and confident labels. On this basis, a multi-symptom multi-label (MSML) classification network is proposed to learn discriminative features of lung symptoms, and a human-machine interaction is exploited to confirm the final annotations that are used to fine-tune MSML with progressively labeled data. Moreover, a novel lung US dataset named COVID19-LUSMS is built, currently containing 71 clinical patients with 6,836 images sampled from 678 videos. Experimental evaluations show that TSAL using only 20% data can achieve superior performance to the baseline and the state-of-the-art.

COVID-19 vaccination was crucial to preventing and eliminating the disease, so vaccine development for COVID-19 was fast-tracked worldwide. Despite the fact that vaccination is commonly recognized as the most effective approach, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccine hesitancy is a global health issue. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of nurses in four different regions in Italy between 20 and 28 December 2020 to obtain data on the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccination in order to plan specific interventions to increase the rate of vaccine coverage. Results: A total of 531 out of the 5000 nurses invited completed the online questionnaire. Most of the nurses enrolled in the study (73.4%) were female. Among the nurses, 91.5% intended to accept vaccination, whereas 2.3% were opposed and 6.2% were undecided. Female sex and confidence in vaccine efficacy represent the main predictors of vaccine intention among the study population using a logistic regression model, while other factors including vaccine safety concerns (side effects) were non-significant. Conclusions: Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, intention to be vaccinated was suboptimal among nurses in our sample. We also found a significant number of people undecided as to whether to accept the vaccine. Contrary to expectations, concerns about the safety of the vaccine were not found to affect the acceptance rate;nurses perception of vaccine efficacy and female sex were the main influencing factors on attitudes toward vaccination in our sample.

The reasons for these differences are complex and incompletely understood. Our aim was to use a contemporary real-world national cohort of patients presenting with their first MI to better understand the extent to which differences in the clinical presentation, cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors, comorbidity and in-hospital treatment explain the mortality outcomes for Mori and Pacific peoples. METHODS New Zealand residents (20 years old) hospitalised with their first MI (2014-2017), and who underwent coronary angiography, were identified from the All New Zealand Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement (ANZACS-QI) registry. All-cause mortality up to one year after the index admission date was obtained by linkage to the national mortality database. RESULTS There were 17,404 patients with a first ever MI. European/other comprised 76% of the population, Mori 11.5%, Pacific 5.1%, Indian 4.3% and Other Asian 2.9%. Over half (55%) of Mori, Pacific and Indian patients were admitted with their first MI before age 60 years, compared with 29% of European/other patients. Mori and Pacific patients had a higher burden of traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and despite being younger, were more likely to present with heart failure and, together with Indian peoples, advanced coronary disease at presentation with first MI. After adjustment for age and sex, Mori and Pacific, but not Indian or Other Asian patients had significantly higher all-cause mortality at one year compared with the European/other reference group (HR 2.55 (95% CI 2.12-3.07), HR 2.98 (95% CI 2.34-3.81) for Mori and Pacific respectively). When further adjusted for differences in clinical presentation, clinical history and cardiovascular risk factors, the excess mortality risk for Mori and Pacific patients was reduced substantially, but a differential persisted (HR 1.77 (95% CI 1.44-2.19), HR 1.42 (95% CI 1.07-1.83)) which was not further reduced by adjustment for differences in in-hospital management and discharge medications. CONCLUSION In New Zealand patients after their first MI there is a three-fold variation in one-year mortality based on ethnicity. At least half of the inequity in outcomes for Mori, and three-quarters for Pacific people, is associated with differences in preventable or modifiable clinical factors present at, or prior to, presentation.","output":"Inequity in one-year mortality after first myocardial infarction in Mori and Pacific patients: how much is associated with differences in modifiable clinical risk factors?

Since its generation in 1980, the NOD mouse, derived from the Cataract Shinogi strain, has represented the gold standard of spontaneous disease models, allowing to investigate autoimmune diabetes disease progression and susceptibility traits, as well as to test a wide array of potential treatments and therapies. Beyond autoimmune diabetes, NOD mice also exhibit polyautoimmunity, presenting with a low incidence of autoimmune thyroiditis and Sj?grens syndrome. Genetic manipulation of the NOD strain has led to the generation of new mouse models facilitating the study of these and other autoimmune pathologies. For instance, following deletion of specific genes or via insertion of resistance alleles at genetic loci, NOD mice can become fully resistant to autoimmune diabetes; yet the newly generated diabetes-resistant NOD strains often show a high incidence of other autoimmune diseases. This suggests that the NOD genetic background is highly autoimmune-prone and that genetic manipulations can shift the autoimmune response from the pancreas to other organs. Overall, multiple NOD variant strains have become invaluable tools for understanding the pathophysiology of and for dissecting the genetic susceptibility of organ-specific autoimmune diseases. An interesting commonality to all autoimmune diseases developing in variant strains of the NOD mice is the presence of autoantibodies.

Development of contingency plans for the different Pharmacy Service activities and providing fluent communication channels are key elements for crisis situations or health emergencies such as the current pandemic.","output":"El farmacutico frente a la logstica de dispensacin, almacenamiento y conservacin segura de medicamentos en unidades asistenciales./ The pharmacist facing the logistics of safely dispensing, storing and preserving drugs in healthcare units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims The aim of this project was to look at whether the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically lockdown, has impacted out-of-hours presentations to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in North Central and East London. Method Specialist Registrars (SpRs) on the Royal London/Great Ormond Street CAMHS Higher Training Scheme are contacted for advice regarding all CAMHS presentations in the North Central and East London area. Responsibilities includes provision of advice to 6 hospitals (including 4 emergency departments) and 4 child and adolescent inpatient units. A record of all phone calls and call-outs, including Mental Health Act and Section 136 (S136) assessments are maintained and this study compares pre- and post-COVID-19 data to see if there are any differences in number of presentations, on-site assessments (including Mental Health Act and S136 assessments over 2019 and 2020. Result Numbers of CAMHS presentations were lower in 2020 (mean 74 patients per month) compared with 2019 (60 patients per month). This was consistent across all months except October and December. The largest difference was seen in March: 109 patients presented in March 2019, compared with 55 in March 2020. This is also reflected in the number of assessments conducted on site. However, there do not appear to be differences in the numbers of Mental Health Act or S136 assessments undertaken over 2020, compared with 2019. Conclusion CAMHS out-of-hours presentations dropped off significantly at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, and in particular, with the first lockdown (March to July 2020). Specialist Registrars provided advice via telephone less frequently in 2020 compared with 2019, and were required to do fewer on-site assessments of children and young people presenting with mental health difficulties. There were no significant differences in Mental Health Act or S136 assessments between the two years, however, these numbers are too small to make any meaningful conclusions. It is likely that children and adolescents were less likely to present to emergency departments for assessment of their mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than this reflecting a true reduction in mental health difficulties. Recommendations: It is helpful to continue to monitor CAMHS out-of-hour presentations. Trusts may want to consider alternative settings for providing emergency CAMHS assessments, for example, mental health hubs. Limitations: This provision of data is subject to recall bias.","output":"Has the COVID-19 pandemic affected out-of-hours presentations in CAMHS?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There have been many major developments in the use of augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) technologies in the context of global surgical research, yet few reports on the trends in this field have been published to date. This study was therefore designed to explore these worldwide trends in this clinically important field. Relevant studies published from 1 January 2009 through 13 October 2020 were retrieved from the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) tool of the Web of Science database. Bibliometric techniques were then used to analyze the resultant data, with visual bibliographic coupling, co-authorship, co-citation, co-occurrence, and publication trend analyses subsequently being conducted with GraphPad Prism 8 and with the visualization of similarities (VOS) software tool. There is no patient and public involved. In total, 6221 relevant studies were incorporated into this analysis. At a high level, clear global annual increases in the number of publications in this field were observed. The USA made the greatest contributions to this field over the studied period, with the highest H-index value, the most citations, and the greatest total link strength for analyzed publications. The country with the highest number of average citations per publication was Scotland. The Surgical Endoscopy And Other Interventional Techniques journal contributed the greatest number of publications in this field. The University of London was the institution that produced the greatest volume of research in this field. Overall, studies could be broadly classified into five clusters: Neurological Research, Surgical Techniques, Technological Products, Rehabilitative Medicine, and Clinical Therapy. The trends detected in the present analysis suggest that the number of global publications pertaining to the use of AR, VR, and MR techniques in surgical research is likely to increase in the coming years. Particular attention should be paid to emerging trends in related fields including MR, extended reality, head-mounted displays, navigation, and holographic images.","output":"Trends in the Use of Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Mixed Reality in Surgical Research: a Global Bibliometric and Visualized Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Traditional cognitive behavioral interventions (CBIs) improve mood and gastrointestinal symptom severity in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) but face substantial barriers to implementation. Integrating behavioral health technology into medical clinic workflows could overcome these barriers. We evaluated the feasibility and impact of a coached digital CBI (dCBI) as a first-line intervention in a prospective cohort of emotionally distressed patients with FGID. METHODS: Patients with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms were offered a dCBI (an app called RxWell) during routine clinic visits. RxWell provides cognitive behavioral techniques enhanced by within-app text messaging with a health coach. Both gastroenterology and behavioral health-care providers electronically prescribed RxWell. We tracked patient interactions with RxWell, and patients completed anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and depression (Personal Health Questionniare Depression Scale) measures through the app. Our primary study outcome was the change in General Anxiety Disorder-7 and Personal Health Questionniare Depression Scale scores. RESULTS: Of 364 patients with FGID (mean age 43 years [SD 16 years]; 73.1% women) prescribed the dCBI, 48.4% enrolled (median use, 3 techniques [interquartile range 1C14]). About half of RxWell enrollees communicated with health coaches. The mean baseline anxiety score was 11.4 (SD 5.5), and the depression score was 11.5 (SD 6.1). RxWell users experienced improvements in anxiety (mean change 2.71 [t = 3.7, df = 58; P < 0.001]) and depression (mean change 2.9 [t = 4.2, df = 45; P < 0.001]) at 4 months. DISCUSSION: Patients with FGIDs and moderately severe anxiety and depressive symptoms are willing to use dCBI tools recommended by their providers. Our pilot data demonstrate that dCBI usage is associated with clinically and statistically significant mood symptom reductions.","output":"A Coached Digital Cognitive Behavioral Intervention Reduces Anxiety and Depression in Adults With Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of currently available vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) do not include pregnant participants.

Reviewing their shortcomings can provide elements to consider in light of the second wave that is currently underway in Europe. Here we estimate the rate of detection of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in France after lockdown through the use of virological3 and participatory syndromic4 surveillance data coupled with mathematical transmission models calibrated to regional hospitalizations2. Our findings indicate that around 90,000 symptomatic infections, corresponding to 9 out 10 cases, were not ascertained by the surveillance system in the first 7 weeks after lockdown from 11 May to 28 June 2020, although the test positivity rate did not exceed the 5% recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO)5. The median detection rate increased from 7% (95% confidence interval, 6-8%) to 38% (35-44%) over time, with large regional variations, owing to a strengthening of the system as well as a decrease in epidemic activity. According to participatory surveillance data, only 31% of individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms consulted a doctor in the study period. This suggests that large numbers of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 did not seek medical advice despite recommendations, as confirmed by serological studies6,7. Encouraging awareness and same-day healthcare-seeking behaviour of suspected cases of COVID-19 is critical to improve detection. However, the capacity of the system remained insufficient even at the low epidemic activity achieved after lockdown, and was predicted to deteriorate rapidly with increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. Substantially more aggressive, targeted and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a tool to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The testing strategy will be critical to enable partial lifting of the current restrictive measures in Europe and to avoid a third wave.","output":"Underdetection of cases of COVID-19 in France threatens epidemic control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our paper aims at describing the links between green finance and sustainable development in the light of the environmental threats and natural disasters represented by the recent coronavirus pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. The recent situation heavily impacted on the financial and banking system and transformed the way it has functioned before. Moreover, it demonstrated that the banking system is more vulnerable than it should be. The banking sector has shown little capacity to absorb unexpected risks, owing to far-reaching international financial reforms. There are indications that some banks are on the verge of collapse, while some non-bank financial institutions and markets need immediate support. A decade after the financial crisis, the world is still struggling with the problems posed by the events of 2007C2009. Moreover, decisions taken during the crisis increased the risk that pandemic financial stress would develop into a banking crisis over time. Our paper shows that now there is a need for the creation of healthy environment marked by the carbon-free and environmentally-friendly approaches, and the green finance might help us to achieve that goal. Our results make it clear that by promoting such instruments as green bonds, green loans and green mortgages stakeholders and policy-makers might help to create a more sustainable future for the people, their natural environment, and the economy as a whole. ? 2021.

At that time, there were no standard methods to detect pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms such as bacteria and protozoa in the supposed poisonous materials. Only animal experiments performed by Louis Pasteur at the end of the nineteenth century, in which no dilution of the poisonous properties was achieved even after several passages, suggested that the disease-causing agent was able to multiply in the organism. Therefore, there was talk of a reproducible virus (Latin for poison or slime) in living organisms, and later also in cells. In St. Petersburg in 1892, Dimitri I. Ivanovski demonstrated that tobacco mosaic disease is caused by an ultrafilterable agent, whose size is significantly smaller than that of bacteria: tobacco mosaic virus (bacteria filters have a pore size of approximately 0.2 m, however, most viruses are smaller than 0.1 m). Soon afterwards, Martinus Willem Beijerinck came to the same conclusion: he developed, for the first time, the notion of a self-replicating, liquid agent (contagium vivum fluidum).

The new approach was in response to emerging health risks from the pressures that development placed on the environment, climate change, and increasing vulnerabilities of local communities. The new approach heralded a change in perception and roles within environmental health. Twenty years on, it seems these changes have not been embraced by local government. Methods: To determine whether this was the case, we assessed the use of the term environmental health in local government annual reports, and where environmental health functions sit within the organisational structure of councils. Results: We found that the New Environmental Health has not been adopted by councils and environmental health relates solely to the delivery of statutory services and legislative compliance. Conclusions: One result of this is local environmental health practitioners, who constitute the major health protection capability of councils, are defined by the narrow legislative obligations imposed on councils. This represents a significant lost opportunity as public health is not protected in the way that was envisaged with the adoption of the New Environmental Health.","output":"The New Environmental Health in Australia: Failure to Launch?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study examined how students academic performance changed after undergoing a transition to online learning during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, based on the test results of 16 integrated courses conducted in 3 semesters at Hanyang University College of Medicine in Korea. METHODS: For the 16 required courses that formed an integrated system-based curriculum running for 3 semesters, the major examinations raw scores were collected for each student. Percent-correct scores were used in the subsequent analysis. We used the t-test to compare grades between 2019 and 2020, and the Cohen D was calculated as a measure of effect size. The correlation of scores between courses was calculated using Pearson correlation coefficients. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in scores in 2020 for 10 courses (62.5%). While most of the integrated system-based curriculum test scores showed strong correlations, with coefficients of 0.6 or higher in both 2019 and 2020, the correlation coefficients were generally higher in 2020. When students were divided into low, middle, and high achievement groups, low-achieving students consistently showed declining test scores in all 3 semesters. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the transition to online classes due to COVID-19 has led to an overall decline in academic performance. This overall decline, which may occur when the curriculum is centered on recorded lectures, needs to be addressed. Further, medical schools need to consider establishing a support system for the academic development of low-achieving students.","output":"Changes in academic performance in the online, integrated system-based curriculum implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a medical school in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Governments and health policymakers are now looking for strategies to lift the COVID-19 lockdown, while reducing risk to the public.

OBJECTIVES To compare the demographics, treatment pathways, and outcomes of patients with hip fractures during the COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown with the standard at routine times. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of all patients who were treated surgically for hip fracture in a tertiary center during the COVID-19 lockdown period between 01 March and 01 June 2020 and the equivalent period in 2019. Demographic characteristics, time to surgery, surgery type, hospitalization time, discharge destination, postoperative complications, and 30- and 90-day mortality rates were collected for all patients. RESULTS During the COVID-19 period, 105 patients were operated due to hip fractures compared to 136 in the equivalent period with no statistical difference in demographics. The rate of surgeries within 48 hours of admission was significantly higher in the COVID-19 period (92% vs. 76%, respectively; P = 0.0006).

METHODS: DOTW UK provides drop-in clinics to vulnerable migrants. Consultations switched to remote during the UK's first lockdown. We compared patient profile, well-being, healthcare access and reason for consultations of individuals attending the virtual clinic between March and September 2020 to those of the prepandemic periods between 2011 and 2018. RESULTS: During the pandemic, consultations dropped to under half of the prepandemic numbers, with the shift to remote consultations attracting more users outside of London. DOTW UK's user base changed to include a greater proportion of asylum seekers, younger adults (18C34) and individuals reporting good health. Socio-economic conditions and housing stability deteriorated for the majority of users. Those in the greatest need of healthcare appeared to be less able to access remote services. General practitioner (GP) registration remained the most common reason for contacting the virtual clinic with a lack of knowledge of the healthcare system being the main barrier to access.

There is currently no evidence of circulation of the original H7N7 strain of EIV worldwide; however, the EIV H3N8 strain, which was first isolated in the early 1960s, remains a major threat to most of the worlds horse populations. It can also infect dogs. The ability of EIV to constantly accumulate mutations in its antibody-binding sites enables it to evade host protective immunity, making it a successful viral pathogen. Clinical and virological protection against EIV is achieved by stimulation of strong cellular and humoral immunity in vaccinated horses. However, despite EI vaccine updates over the years, EIV remains relevant, because the protective effects of vaccines decay and permit subclinical infections that facilitate transmission into susceptible populations. In this review, we describe how the evolution of EIV drives repeated EI outbreaks even in horse populations with supposedly high vaccination coverage. Next, we discuss the approaches employed to develop efficacious EI vaccines for commercial use and the existing system for recommendations on updating vaccines based on available clinical and virological data to improve protective immunity in vaccinated horse populations. Understanding how EIV biology can be better harnessed to improve EI vaccines is central to controlling EI.","output":"Equine Influenza Virus and Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: A recent study has shown that the averaged time tabled teaching for a medical student across 5 years in the UK was 4629 hours. Radiology has been demonstrated to be an excellent teaching source, yet the number of hours allocated to this has never been calculated. The aims of this study were to evaluate and quantify the hours allocated to radiology teaching in Scottish Medical Schools and to evaluate if they can fulfil requirements expected from other Clinical disciplines and the upcoming General Medical Council Medical Licensing Assessment (GMC MLA). METHODS: Data pertaining to timetabled teaching for Radiology in Scottish Universities were obtained from the authors of the Analysis of Teaching of Medical Schools (AToMS) survey. In addition, University Lead Clinician Teachers were surveyed on the radiological investigations and skills medical students should have at graduation. RESULTS: Medical students in Scottish Universities were allocated 59 h in Radiology (0.3%) out of a total 19,325 h of timetabled teaching. Hospital-based teaching was variable and ranged from 0 to 31 h. Almost half (15 of 31) of Clinician Teachers felt that there was insufficient radiology teaching in their specialty. Thirteen of 30 conditions included in the GMC MLA were listed by Clinician Teachers, while 23 others not listed by the GMC were considered important and cited by them. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that medical students do not receive enough radiology teaching. This needs to be addressed by Universities in collaboration with the NHS in an effort to bring up this up to line with other developed countries and prepare students for the GMC MLA. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: (1) There is insufficient time allocated in Medical Students curriculum to Radiology.

METHODS: Twenty-five patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, at variable times since admission (from 1 to 3 weeks), underwent computed tomography (CT) lung scans, gas-exchange and lung-mechanics measurement in supine and prone positions at 5 cmH(2)O and during recruiting maneuver (supine, 35 cmH(2)O). Within the non-aerated tissue, we differentiated the atelectatic and consolidated tissue (recruitable and non-recruitable at 35 cmH(2)O of airway pressure). Positive/negative response to proning/recruitment was defined as increase/decrease of PaO(2)/FiO(2). Apparent perfusion ratio was computed as venous admixture/non aerated tissue fraction. RESULTS: The average values of venous admixture and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio were similar in supine-5 and prone-5. However, the PaO(2)/FiO(2) changes (increasing in 65% of the patients and decreasing in 35%, from supine to prone) correlated with the balance between resolution of dorsal atelectasis and formation of ventral atelectasis (p = 0.002). Dorsal consolidated tissue determined this balance, being inversely related with dorsal recruitment (p = 0.012). From supine-5 to supine-35, the apparent perfusion ratio increased from 1.38  0.71 to 2.15  1.15 (p = 0.004) while PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased in 52% and decreased in 48% of patients.

However, during acute viral lower respiratory infection, lung TCD8 are functionally impaired and do not optimally control viral replication. T cells also become unresponsive to Ag during chronic infections and cancer via signaling by inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). PD-1 also contributes to TCD8 impairment during viral lower respiratory infection, but how it regulates TCD8 impairment and the connection between this state and T cell exhaustion during chronic infections are unknown. In this study, we show that PD-1 operates in a cell-intrinsic manner to impair lung TCD8. In light of this, we compared global gene expression profiles of impaired epitope-specific lung TCD8 to functional spleen TCD8 in the same human metapneumovirus-infected mice. These two populations differentially regulate hundreds of genes, including the upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors by lung TCD8. We then compared the gene expression of TCD8 during human metapneumovirus infection to those in acute or chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. We find that the immunophenotype of lung TCD8 more closely resembles T cell exhaustion late into chronic infection than do functional effector T cells arising early in acute infection. Finally, we demonstrate that trafficking to the infected lung alone is insufficient for TCD8 impairment or inhibitory receptor upregulation, but that viral Ag-induced TCR signaling is also required. Our results indicate that viral Ag in infected lungs rapidly induces an exhaustion-like state in lung TCD8 characterized by progressive functional impairment and upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors.","output":"Acute Viral Respiratory Infection Rapidly Induces a CD8+ T Cell Exhaustion-like Phenotype."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two cases are presented with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related hiccups: one during initial presentation and one 10 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a descriptive, cross-sectional study. Serum melatonin levels and sleep parameters of children with the diagnosis of COVID-19 who had mild and moderate disease (i.e., COVID-19 group) were compared with those of children admitted with non-COVID-19 non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (i.e., control group). The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) questionnaire was applied to the participants' primary caregivers to analyze their sleep patterns at present and six months before symptom onset and to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on sleep patterns. RESULTS: The entire study cohort consisted of 106 patients. The COVID-19 group included 80 patients, while the control group consisted of 26 patients. The mean serum melatonin levels were 136.72 pg/mL and 172.63 pg/mL in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively (p=0.16).

It is intended to improve patient understanding of medicines and resolve adherence issues. Objective To explore MedsCheck from the community pharmacists' perspective, focusing on the perceived effectiveness of the program, barriers to its optimal delivery, and the integration with other services. Setting Individual interviews in one territory and a national online survey of Australian community pharmacists. Method Using a mixed-method triangulation design, the interviews and the survey were conducted concurrently. The interviews were semi-structured, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. The survey, comprising closed and open-ended questions, was quantitatively and thematically analysed. The findings were first analysed separately and finally integrated by searching for convergence, complementarity, and discrepancy. Main outcome measure Pharmacists' perceptions of the effectiveness and barriers of MedsCheck. Results Eight interviews were conducted, and 232 survey responses collected. In the interviews, themes related to perceived benefits (appreciation, reduced confusion, and strengthening relationships), barriers (lack of controls, lack of staff, lack of awareness, and lack of understanding of scope of services), and the integration with other services (strong link with dose administration aids) emerged, which mostly correlated with the survey's results. Ten percent of surveyed respondents did not provide the MedsCheck service; their main reason being insufficient staffing. Of the pharmacists offering the service, 76% strongly agreed that patients were benefitting. MedsCheck reviews were usually initiated by pharmacy staff. Fifty-three percent of respondent pharmacists never or only sometimes reported the review outcomes to the patient's general practitioner. Conclusion The pharmacists believed that MedsCheck is useful to improve patients' understanding and management of their medicines. However, there are currently barriers to the effective delivery of the service, including workload issues, lack of patient awareness, and the service's integration with the broader care of the patient. If these were appropriately addressed, the in-pharmacy medication review program could help pharmacists to better engage with patients and general practitioners and enhance understanding of medication and adherence.","output":"Exploring pharmacists' views on an in-pharmacy medication review program in Australia using a mixed-methods design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Defective viral RNA sensing linked to severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate target concentrations at the effect site of propofol and remifentanil when deep sedation was achieved by monitored anesthesia care (MAC) anesthesia and related respiratory depression during vein stripping surgery for varicose veins.

We evaluated the therapeutic benefits of quercetin in a SCD transgenic sickle mouse model. This disease model exhibited very mild disease pathophysiology in the steady state. The severity of the disease in the NY1DD mouse was amplified by subjecting mice to 18 h of hypoxia followed by 3 h of reoxygenation. Quercetin (200 mg/kg body weight) administered to hypoxia challenged NY1DD mice in a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose at the onset of reoxygenation completely ameliorated all hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R)-induced pathophysiology. Additionally, it ameliorated the mild intrinsic steady state pathophysiology. These results are comparable with those seen with semisynthetic supra plasma expanders. In control mice, C57BL/6J, hypoxia reoxygenation-induced vaso-occlusion was at significantly lower levels than in NY1DD mice, reflecting the role of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) in inducing vaso-occlusion; however, the therapeutic benefits from quercetin were significantly muted. We suggest that these findings represent a unique genotype of the NY1DD mice, i.e., the presence of high oxygen affinity red blood cells (RBCs) with chimeric HbS, composed of mouse -chain and human (S)-chain, as well as human -chain and mouse -chain (besides HbS). The anti-anemia therapeutic benefits from high oxygen affinity RBCs in these mice exert disease severity modifications that synergize with the therapeutic benefits of quercetin. Combining the therapeutic benefits of high oxygen affinity RBCs generated in situ by chemical or genetic manipulation with the therapeutic benefits of antiadhesive therapies is a novel approach to treat sickle cell patients with severe pathophysiology.","output":"Quercetin Completely Ameliorates HypoxiaCReoxygenation-Induced Pathophysiology Severity in NY1DD Transgenic Sickle Mice: Intrinsic Mild Steady State Pathophysiology of the Disease in NY1DD Is Also Reversed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fast and reliable tests for the new coronavirus are urgently needed. Current Polymerase Chain Reaction based virus detection approaches are typically time-consuming and expensive. Technologies capable of providing a fast, real-time and non-contact detection of virus contamination and real-time virus classification are not yet available. Here, we demonstrate the potential of a fluorescence detection technique along with machine-learning based classification for virus detection. The ultraviolet (UV) light irradiated virus emits a fluorescent signal with a characteristic spectrum, which is regarded as a fingerprint for the virus. We analyzed eight virus samples including a heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) and collected a number of emission spectra. Machine learning techniques are applied to discriminate among the candidate viruses via classifying a number of spectra data collected. First, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce spectra data dimensionality. Then support vector machine (SVM) with various kernel functions (kernel-SVM), k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods were used to classify these viruses with dimension-reduced data from PCA. We found that dimension-reduced data in 3 principal components (PCs) space performs better than that in 2 PCs space in the machine learning algorithms mentioned above. Variance ratio analysis is able to explain nearly 95% of variance which allows nearly 100% accuracy of predictions for 25% data test set randomly chosen from the whole dataset.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the phosphate tweezer CLR01, a carboxylate tweezer CLR05, and a phosphate clip PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.","output":"Supramolecular Mechanism of Viral Envelope Disruption by Molecular Tweezers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the spread of the coronavirus worldwide, nations have implemented policies restricting the movement of people to minimize the possibility of infection.

The genetically distinct Caenorhabditis elegans strains, Bristol N2 and Hawaiian CB4856, are differentially susceptible to the Orsay virus (OrV). Here we report the dissection of the genetic architecture of susceptibility to OrV infection. We compare OrV infection in the relatively resistant wild-type CB4856 strain to the more susceptible canonical N2 strain. To gain insight into the genetic architecture of viral susceptibility, 52 fully sequenced recombinant inbred lines (CB4856 x N2 RILs) were exposed to OrV. This led to the identification of two loci on chromosome IV associated with OrV resistance. To verify the two loci and gain additional insight into the genetic architecture controlling virus infection, introgression lines (ILs) that together cover chromosome IV, were exposed to OrV. Of the 27 ILs used, 17 had an CB4856 introgression in an N2 background and 10 had an N2 introgression in a CB4856 background. Infection of the ILs confirmed and fine-mapped the locus underlying variation in OrV susceptibility and we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in cul-6 contributes to the difference in OrV susceptibility between N2 and CB4856. An allele swap experiment showed the strain CB4856 became more susceptible by having an N2 cul-6 allele, although having the CB4856 cul-6 allele did not increase resistance in N2. Additionally, we found that multiple strains with non-overlapping introgressions showed a distinct infection phenotype from the parental strain, indicating that there are punctuated locations on chromosome IV determining OrV susceptibility. Thus, our findings reveal the genetic complexity of OrV susceptibility in C. elegans and suggest that viral susceptibility is governed by multiple genes.","output":"Punctuated loci on chromosome IV determine natural variation in Orsay virus susceptibility of Caenorhabditis elegans strains Bristol N2 and Hawaiian CB4856"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aims to understand Twitter users' discourse and psychological reactions to COVID-19 We use machine learning techniques to analyze about 1 9 million Tweets (written in English) related to coronavirus collected from January 23 to March 7, 2020 A total of salient 11 topics are identified and then categorized into ten themes, including \\"updates about confirmed cases,\\" \\"COVID-19 related death,\\" \\"cases outside China (worldwide),\\" \\"COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea,\\" \\"early signs of the outbreak in New York,\\" \\"Diamond Princess cruise,\\" \\"economic impact,\\" \\"Preventive measures,\\" \\"authorities,\\" and \\"supply chain \\" Results do not reveal treatments and symptoms related messages as prevalent topics on Twitter Sentiment analysis shows that fear for the unknown nature of the coronavirus is dominant in all topics Implications and limitations of the study are also discussed","output":"Public discourse and sentiment during the COVID 19 pandemic: Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although several innovations in techniques and implantable devices were reported over the last decades, a consensus on the best endovascular treatment for intracranial aneurysms originating from the posterior communicating artery is still missing.

We evaluated the impact of these initiatives on staff and resident COVID cases. Methods We conducted a quasi-experimental study of the impact of decolonization and COVID prevention training on staff and resident COVID cases during the CA winter surge (11/16/20-1/31/21), when compared to non-participating NHs. Decolonization NHs received weekly visits for encouraging adherence during the pandemic, and NHs in the COVID training program received 3 in-person training sessions for all work shifts plus weekly feedback about adherence to hand hygiene, masking, and breakroom safety using video monitoring. We calculated incident 1) staff COVID cases, 2) resident COVID cases, and 3) resident COVID deaths adjusting for NH average daily census. We assessed impact of initiatives on these outcomes using linear mixed effects models testing the interaction between any training participation and calendar date when clustering by NH. Because of the overlap of the two initiatives, we evaluated any training vs no training. Results 63 NHs had available data. 24 adopted universal decolonization, 12 received COVID training (11 of which participated in decolonization), and 38 were not enrolled in either. During the winter surge, the 63 NHs experienced 1867 staff COVID cases, 2186 resident COVID cases, and 251 resident deaths due to COVID, corresponding to 29.6, 34.7, and 4.0 events per NH, respectively. In NHs participating in either initiative, staff COVID cases were reduced by 31% (OR=0.69 (0.52, 0.92), P=0.01), resident COVID cases were reduced by 43% (OR=0.57 (0.39, 0.82), P=0.003), and resident deaths were reduced (non-significantly) by 26% (OR=0.74 (0.46, 1.21), P=0.23).

Many traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctors suggest that the treatment of HMG should be based on the left and right breast pain difference. However, these views are based on case reports, and an objective basis has not been established for treatment according to left-side and right-side differences. METHODS: We enrolled 150 patients who met the clinical diagnostic criteria of HMG. The incidence bias was determined according to the score difference between bilateral breast pain and mass in patients with HMG. A left group, right group, and bilateral group were included, and TCM constitution was investigated in each group. Blood biochemical indicators were measured for 120 fasting patients. We conducted a network pharmacology study of the key herb qingpi and chenpi, which are used by TCM doctors to treat different lateral HMG. RESULTS: In patients with biased onset of HMG, the results showed that the frequency and constitution score of stagnant blood in the L group were higher than those of the R group, and the frequency and constitution score of phlegm-dampness in the R group were higher than those of the L group. Both the L and R groups had high proportion of stagnant Qi. The results indicated that the concentration of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) was higher in the L group than that in the R group, and the concentration of lipoprotein a (Lp-) was higher in the R group than that in the L group. The results showed that sinensetin and neohesperidin contained in qingpi might interfere with platelet activation, thrombogenesis, prolactin signaling pathway, and atherosclerosis process, in removing blood stasis and eventually treating the left-leaning group of HMG patients. Sitosterol and citromitin contained in chenpi could regulate lipid metabolism by interfering with regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, salivary secretion, estrogen signaling pathway, and thyroid hormone signaling pathway. Chenpi could eliminate phlegm turbidity and treat HMG patients in the right-leaning group. CONCLUSIONS: We preliminarily confirmed that the clinical pathogenesis of HMG is not a left-right equilibrium and TCM constitution, coagulation function, and lipid metabolism may be used as the objective basis for the difference between the left and right in HMG pathogenesis. For left-sided HMG patients, the doctor can consider qingpi, herb of activating blood and removing stasis, to treat HMG. However, for right-sided HMG, we think doctors should apply herb of activating Qi and eliminating phlegm, such as chenpi.","output":"Comparison between Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution and Blood Biochemical Markers Associated with Left and Right Mammary Hyperplasia in Rural Areas of Southwest China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global public health is endangered due to COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

To identify potential changing needs in HIV prevention and care cascade, we aim to describe how the demographic profiles and exposure categories of newly diagnosed HIV positive individuals attending a large sexual health clinic in Montral (Canada) evolved since the beginning of the antiretroviral therapy era in the mid-1990s. METHODS: Using diagnosis data from participants of the Clinique mdicale lActuel cohort of HIV-positive patients, we examined the distribution of exposure categories (sexual orientation, sexual behaviours, injection drug use, being born in an HIV-endemic country) by gender and year of diagnosis. Time trends in mean age and in the proportion of patients with late (CD4 <350 cells/L) or advanced stage (CD4 <200 cells/L) of HIV infection at diagnosis were assessed through meta-regressions. RESULTS: A total of 2,612 patients diagnosed with HIV between January 1(st), 1995 and December 31(st), 2019 were included. Overall, mean age was 35 years (standard deviation: 10 years) and remained stable over time. The proportion of patients with advanced stage of HIV infection decreased from 16% in 1995 to 4% in 2019. Although men who have sex with men (MSM) consistently accounted for the highest proportion of new diagnoses (77%, 2,022/2,612 overall), their proportion decreased since 2013. There was also a concomitant decrease in the proportion of people who inject drugs, with none of the newly diagnosed participants reporting injection drug use since 2017, and an important increase in the proportion of patients born in an HIV-endemic country (24%, 7/29 in 2019), especially among women. Compared to patients from non-endemic countries, those from HIV-endemic countries were characterized by higher proportions of heterosexuals (88% vs 17%) and of women (52% vs 7%), and were twice likely to get diagnosed at an advanced stage of HIV infection (32% vs 15%). CONCLUSIONS: In absolute numbers, MSM continue to account for the largest exposure category. However, patients from HIV-endemic countries, who tend to be diagnosed at later stages of HIV infection, constitute an increasing proportion of newly diagnosed individuals. These persons could face distinct barriers to rapid diagnosis. Tailoring HIV testing strategies and other prevention interventions to the specific unmet prevention needs of these individuals is warranted.","output":"Characteristics of new HIV diagnoses over 1995C2019: A clinic-based study in Montral, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although rates of COVID-19 have remained low among US dentists, the authors aimed to determine the risk of there being COVID-19 in patients seeking oral health care. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of all emergency department consultations from June 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. They used Pearson correlation coefficients to compare rates with citywide prevalence (P < .05). RESULTS: The authors located 203 encounters with 149 tests and 10 cases of COVID-19.

Forty healthy subjects with similar age and sex served as controls. We measured: (a)perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (increased PBR indicates reduced glycocalyx thickness), (b)pulse wave velocity (PWV), (c)global LV longitudinal strain (GLS), (d)global work index (GWI) using speckle tracking echocardiography and e)C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls (PCs) as oxidative stress markers at baseline and post-treatment. Compared to controls, RA patients had impaired glycocalyx and myocardial deformation markers (P < 0.05). Compared with baseline, tocilizumab reduced PBR(2.14  0.2 versus 1.97  0.2 m; P < 0.05) while no significant differences were observed post-csDMARDs + GC(P > 0.05).

Some in-silico analyses have been performed to predict the impact of these proteins on viral entry, replication, and complications. These proteins have shown a high potency in sialic acid hydrolysis from the lung cells (WI-38) surface.

Moreover, MRJPs can exert an inhibitory influence, via different mechanisms, for SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (main and papain proteases, RNA replicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and methyltransferase). Also, they can bind to hemoglobin-binding sites on viral-nsps and prevent their hemoglobin attack.

The gender, age, body mass index (BMI), Fitzpatrick's skin-type, hair color, N-acetylcysteine use, presence and the intensity of fluorescent reflection under Wood's light in the lunulae of the fingernails, hair, and the face were recorded. RESULTS: There were 275 patients, 144 (52.4%) of whom were women. 165 (57.9%) had used treatment for a maximum of 5 days, 99 (34.7%) for 6-10 days, and 21 (7.4%) for more than ten days. Using more than 22 tablets of favipiravir increased the probability of detecting fluorescence in the lunulae by 6.72 (2.61-17.23) times. Using more than 28 tablets increased the risk of fluorescence in hair and the T-zone by 5.92 (2.43-14.71) and 2.88 (1.11-7.47) times, respectively. No relationship was found between the fluorescence intensity in any localization and the total dose. However, we determined a negative correlation between the elapsed time after the last dose and the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae and the T-zone (p=0.036; p=0.031; respectively). It was noted that BMI negatively correlated with the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae (p=0.001). Skin type was related to intensity for all localizations (p<0.001).

We perform a systematic review of SOT using SARS-CoV-2 positive donors. Methods The search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and Web of Science databases, including studies conducted till the 31th of December 2021 from SOT adult recipients from a donor with past or current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes were viral transmission, COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, hospital stay, and complications. PROSPERO Register Number: CRD42022303242 Findings Sixty-nine recipients received 48 kidneys, 18 livers and 3 hearts from 57 donors. Six additional transplants from positive lungs were identified. IgG + anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers were detected among 10/16 recipients; only 4% (3/69) recipients were vaccinated. Non-lung transplant recipients received organs from 10/57 (17.5%) donors with persistent COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected (median 32 Cycle threshold [Ct]) in 18/57, at procurement. Among non-lung transplant recipients, SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission was not documented. Four patients presented delayed graft dysfunction, two patients acute rejection, and two patients died of septic shock. The median (IQR) hospital stay was 18 (11-28) days in recipients from symptomatic donors. Viral transmission occurred from three lung donors to their recipients, who developed COVID-19 symptoms. One of the recipients subsequently died. Conclusion Use of non-lung (kidney, liver and heart) organs from SARS-CoV-2 positive donors seem to be a safe practice, with a low risk of transmission irrespective of the presence of symptoms at the time of procurement. Low viral replication (Ct > 30) was safe among non-lung donors, even if persistently symptomatic at procurement.","output":"Solid organ transplantation from donors with recent or current SARS-CoV-2 infection: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE A validated high fidelity simulation model would provide a safe environment to teach thoracoscopic EA/TEF repair to novices.

Participants evaluated the EA/TEF repair simulator using survey ratings that were analyzed for test content validity evidence. Additionally, deidentified operative performances were videotaped and independently rated by two surgeons using the Objective Structured Assessment for Technical Skills (OSATS) instrument. Novice and experienced OSATS were compared with p<.05 significant. RESULTS Participants had high overall simulator ratings.

A partially protective yellow fever chimeric tetravalent DENV vaccine sensitized seronegative children to ADE breakthrough infections. A live-attenuated tetravalent whole virus vaccine in phase III testing appears to avoid ADE by providing durable protection against the four DENV. VAH sensitization by viral vaccines occurred historically. Children given formalin-inactivated measles or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines experienced severe disease during breakthrough infections. Tissue responses demonstrated that VAH not ADE caused these vaccine safety problems. Subsequently, measles was successfully and safely contained by a live-attenuated virus vaccine.

The affected sites were the tibia (n = 22, 43%), femur (n = 13, 25%), pelvis (n = 5, 10%), anklebone (n = 3, 6%), humerus (n = 2, 4%), sacrum (n = 2, 4%), heel, radium, patella ,and rib (n = 1, 2%), respectively. Three patients had tibial intramedullary osteoid osteoma (14% of the tibial lesions, 6% of all cases). Cold mode RFTA was performed for these three patients to obtain a large ablation area without positioning two probes. The noncooled mode was used to treat cortical and subperiosteal lesions. RESULTS Following RFTA, all patients were pain-free and in good clinical condition. In the intramedullary osteoid osteoma group, no recurrences were observed during the 24-month follow-up period, but one patient, who was affected by cortical osteoid osteoma, required two RFTA treatments to heal completely. CONCLUSION Children less than 6 years of age with recurrent nocturnal pain and limb swelling should be investigated for intramedullary osteoid osteoma. Once confirmed, CT-guided RFTA should be the first treatment for intramedullary osteoid osteomas because of the high success rate and reduced invasivity, especially with cold mode RFTA.

We studied exhaled air and particle dispersion through an oronasal mask attached to a human-patient simulator (HPS) during noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV). METHODS: Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. Therapy with inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was started at 10 cm H(2)O and gradually increased to 18 cm H(2)O, whereas expiratory positive airway pressure was maintained at 4 cm H(2)O. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet and images captured by video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles. FINDINGS: A jet plume of air leaked through the mask exhaust holes to a radial distance of 0.25 m from the mask during the application of IPAP at 10 cm H(2)O with some leakage from the nasal bridge. The leakage plume exposure probability was highest about 60 to 80 mm lateral to the median sagittal plane of the HPS. Without nasal bridge leakage, the jet plume from the exhaust holes increased to a 0.40-m radius from the mask, whereas exposure probability was highest about 0.28 m above the patient. When IPAP was increased to 18 cm H(2)O, the vertical plume extended to 0.45 m above the patient with some horizontal spreading along the ward ceiling.

First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the models behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC.

The current concept of CKD is relatively young and uptake by the public, physicians and health authorities is not widespread. Physicians still confuse CKD with chronic kidney insufficiency or failure. For the wider public and health authorities, CKD evokes kidney replacement therapy (KRT). In Spain, the prevalence of KRT is 0.13%. Thus health authorities may consider CKD a non-issue: very few persons eventually need KRT and, for those in whom kidneys fail, the problem is solved by dialysis or kidney transplantation. However, KRT is the tip of the iceberg in the burden of CKD. The main burden of CKD is accelerated ageing and premature death. The cut-off points for kidney function and kidney damage indexes that define CKD also mark an increased risk for all-cause premature death. CKD is the most prevalent risk factor for lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the factor that most increases the risk of death in COVID-19, after old age. Men and women undergoing KRT still have an annual mortality that is 10- to 100-fold higher than similar-age peers, and life expectancy is shortened by ~40 years for young persons on dialysis and by 15 years for young persons with a functioning kidney graft. CKD is expected to become the fifth greatest global cause of death by 2040 and the second greatest cause of death in Spain before the end of the century, a time when one in four Spaniards will have CKD. However, by 2022, CKD will become the only top-15 global predicted cause of death that is not supported by a dedicated well-funded Centres for Biomedical Research (CIBER) network structure in Spain.

An anthropomorphic lung nodule phantom was scanned with standard (120kVp, 62mAs), low (120kVp, 11mAs), and ultra-low (80kVp, 3mAs) radiation doses. A human volunteer underwent standard (120kVp, 63mAs) and low (120kVp, 11mAs) dose scans after approval by the ethics committee. HR images were reconstructed with 1024 matrix, 300mm field of view and 0.25mm slice thickness using a filtered-back projection (FBP) and two levels of iterative reconstruction (iDose 5 and 9). The conspicuity and sharpness of various lung structures (distal airways, vessels, fissures and proximal bronchial wall), image noise, and overall image quality were independently analyzed by three radiologists and compared to a previous HR lung CT examination of the same volunteer performed with a conventional CT equipped with energy integrating detectors (120kVp, 10mAs, FBP). RESULTS Ten percent MTF was measured at 22.3lp/cm with a cut-off at 31lp/cm. Up to 28lp/cm were depicted. While mixed and solid nodules were easily depicted on standard and low-dose phantom images, higher iDose levels and slice thicknesses (1mm) were needed to visualize ground-glass components on ultra-low-dose images.

METHODS: Six hundred fifty-four patients (212 deceased, 442 alive, 5645 total CXRs) were identified across two institutions. Imaging and clinical data from one institution were used to train five longitudinal transformer-based networks applying five-fold cross-validation. The models were tested on data from the other institution, and pairwise comparisons were used to determine the best-performing models. RESULTS: A higher proportion of deceased patients had elevated white blood cell count, decreased absolute lymphocyte count, elevated creatine concentration, and incidence of cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease. A model based on pre-ICU CXRs achieved an AUC of 0.632 and an accuracy of 0.593, and a model based on ICU CXRs achieved an AUC of 0.697 and an accuracy of 0.657. A model based on all longitudinal CXRs (both pre-ICU and ICU) achieved an AUC of 0.702 and an accuracy of 0.694. A model based on clinical data alone achieved an AUC of 0.653 and an accuracy of 0.657.

The rise of new variants of concern (VOCs) represents a difficult challenge due to the loss vaccine and natural immunity, and increased transmissibility. All circulating VOCs contain mutations in the spike glycoprotein, which mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes, via its receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In an attempt to understand the effect of RBD mutations in circulating VOCs, a lot of attention has been given to the RBD-ACE2 interaction. However, this type of analysis is limited, since it ignores more indirect effects, such as the conformational dynamics of the RBD itself. Observing that some VOCs mutations occur in residues that are not in direct contact with ACE2, we hypothesized that they could affect RBD conformational dynamics. To test this, we performed long atomistic (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the structural dynamics of wt RBD, and that of three circulating VOCs (alpha, beta, and delta). Our results show that in solution, wt RBD presents two distinct conformations: an \\"open\\" conformation where it is free to bind ACE2; and a \\"closed\\" conformation, where the RBM ridge blocks the binding surface. The alpha and beta variants significantly impact the open/closed equilibrium, shifting it towards the open conformation by roughly 20%. This shift likely increases ACE2 binding affinity. Simulations of the currently predominant delta variant RBD were extreme in this regard, in that a closed conformation was never observed. Instead, the system alternated between the before mentioned open conformation and an alternative \\"reversed\\" one, with a significantly changed orientation of the RBM ridge flanking the RBD. This alternate conformation could potentially provide a fitness advantage not only due to increased availability for ACE2 binding, but also by aiding antibody escape through epitope occlusion. These results support the hypothesis that VOCs, and particularly the delta variant, impact RBD conformational dynamics in a direction that simultaneously promotes efficient binding to ACE2 and antibody escape.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variants impact RBD conformational dynamics and ACE2 accessibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For practical reasons, many forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death counts in the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are issued in the form of central predictive intervals at various levels.

To understand if this locus may affect infection-mediated acute lung injury in other contexts, we tested whether serum LDH and the chromosome-3 locus were associated with ARDS risk and severity in critically ill adults with non-COVID infections. METHODS: We studied 553 critically ill adults with sepsis enrolled in the Validating biomarkers in Acute Lung Injury for Diagnosis (VALID) study. All patients were prospectively phenotyped for ARDS (Berlin Definition) during the first 4 ICU days by two physician investigators. For genetic analyses, we used a convenience sample of 289 septic VALID patients with genomewide genotyping from prior studies. We extracted data on the lead single nucleotide polymorphism in chromosome-3 (rs35081325;wild-type: A;risk variant: T) identified in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative's analysis A2 (COVID-19 with severe respiratory failure). We assessed severity of illness by APACHE-II scores and oxygenation impairment by SpO2:FiO2 ratio. Between-group comparisons were performed using linear regression for continuous outcomes and logistic regression for categorical outcomes. We report effect odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). An inverse normal quantile transformation was applied to clinically ascertained LDH values to account for skewness and non-normality;associations are reported per normalized standard deviation (SD) of the transformed LDH value. RESULTS: Serum LDH was higher among patients with ARDS than without ARDS when controlling for age, gender, and APACHE-II (OR=1.20;95%CI: 1.01-1.43;P=0.04). Serum LDH was also associated with oxygenation impairment, particularly among patients with ARDS (FIGURE). Among genotyped patients, the rs35081325 T-allele was associated with higher serum LDH levels (0.62 normalized SD higher LDH;95%CI: 0.16-1.08;P=0.009), and exhibited trends for higher severity of illness (2.10 higher APACHE-II score per T-allele;95%CI:-0.56 to 4.77;P=0.19), increased ARDS risk (OR=1.55 per T-allele;95%CI 0.70-3.44;P=0.28;FIGURE) and increased in-hospital mortality (OR=2.24 per T-allele;95%CI: 1.00-5.05;P=0.05).

Therefore, blocking this interaction with antibodies are promising agents against SARS-CoV-2.

From two llama VHH libraries, unique humanized VHHs that bind to S protein and block the S/ACE2 interaction were identified. Furthermore, pairwise combination of VHHs showed synergistic blocking. Multi-specific antibodies with enhanced affinity and avidity, and improved S/ACE2 blocking are currently being developed using an in-silico approach that also fuses VHHs to Fc domains. Importantly, our current bi-specific antibody shows potent S/ACE2 blocking (KD C 0.25 nM, IC100  36.7 nM, IC95  12.2 nM, IC50  1 nM) which is significantly better than individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs.

Methods We analyzed the publicly available Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for years 2010-2014. Hospitalizations due to AML were identified by previously validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes as the primary diagnosis. VTE was identified by ICD-9-CM codes as secondary diagnosis. Hospitalizations with age less than 18 years of age were excluded. The trends and outcomes were determined using Chi-squared (&#967;2) test and multivariate regression models. Results From 2010 to 2014, there were 313,282 hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of AML and 1,633 hospitalizations (0.1%) had VTE as a concurrent diagnosis. There was a significant increase in the proportion of AML hospitalizations with VTE from 0.47% in 2010 to 0.56% in 2014 (P = 0.014). Multivariable regression analysis showed that the odds of in-hospital mortality were not higher in AML hospitalizations with VTE (odds ratio [OR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81 - 1.52; P = 0.5) than those without VTE. Age group above 84 years carried the highest risk of mortality (OR 3.20; 95% CI 2.77 - 3.70; P <0.0001) in AML-VTE patients.

RESULTS: One in three young people and 29 % of caregivers reported that the young person's seizures had increased during the pandemic (only 10 % of young people and 8% of caregivers reported a decrease). Half of young people reported that they were more reluctant to go to hospital. Thirty-one percent of young people and 20 % of parents reported difficulties getting epilepsy medication whilst a significant minority of young people (18 %) and caregivers (25 %) reported that the young person had investigations/assessments cancelled by their hospital. The majority of young people reported their sleep (72 %), mood (64 %) and levels of physical activity (53 %) had deteriorated. Caregivers experienced increases in stress (55 %) and anxiety (52 %). Epilepsy nurses were seen as the most helpful support CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the pandemic and associated restrictions have had a negative impact on young people with epilepsy. Perceived increases in seizures, reluctance to go to hospital and cancelled investigations are likely to impact on epilepsy management. The wider psychosocial impact is also likely to be significant with increases in child and caregiver mental health problems in an already vulnerable group.","output":"The perceived impact of COVID-19 and associated restrictions on young people with epilepsy in the UK: Young people and caregiver survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Approximately 80,000 patients each year are admitted to U.K. hospitals with an acute stroke and are immobile. At least 10% will develop a proximal deep vein thrombosis in the first month and 1.5% a pulmonary embolus. Although hydration, antiplatelet treatment and early mobilisation may reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis, there are currently no preventive strategies which have been clearly shown to be both effective and safe. Anticoagulation increases the risks of bleeding and compression stockings are ineffective. Systematic reviews of small randomized trials of intermittent pneumatic compression have shown that this reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing surgery, but that there are few data concerning its use after stroke. The CLOTS trial 3 aims to determine whether, compared with best medical care, best medical care plus intermittent pneumatic compression in immobile stroke patients reduces the risk of proximal deep vein thrombosis. METHODS/DESIGN CLOTS Trial 3 is a parallel group multicentre trial; with centralized randomisation (minimisation) to ensure allocation concealment. Over 80 centres in the U.K. will recruit 2800 immobile stroke patients within the first 3 days of their hospital admission. Patients will be allocated to best medical care or best medical care plus intermittent pneumatic compression. Ultrasonographers will perform a Compression Duplex Ultrasound Scan to detect deep vein thrombosis in each treatment group at about 7-10 days and 25-30 days. The primary outcome cluster includes symptomatic or asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis in the popliteal or femoral veins detected on either scan. Patients are then followed up by postal or telephone questionnaire at 6 months from randomisation to detect later symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli and to establish their functional outcome (Oxford handicap scale) and quality of life (EQ5D-3 L). The ultrasonographers performing the scans are blinded to treatment allocation, whereas the patients and caregivers are not. The trial has 90% power to detect a 4% absolute difference in risk of the primary outcome and includes a health economic analysis. DISCUSSION The trial started recruitment in Dec 2008 and will complete recruitment during 2012. It will report results in 2013.

This study aimed to simulate the optimal vaccination strategy to control the disease by developing an age-specific model based on the current transmission patterns of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China. METHODS: We collected two indicators of COVID-19, including illness onset data and age of confirmed case in Wuhan City, from December 2, 2019, to March 16, 2020. The reported cases were divided into four age groups: group 1,  14 years old; group 2, 15 to 44 years old; group 3, 44 to 64 years old; and group 4,  65 years old. An age-specific susceptible-exposed-symptomatic-asymptomatic-recovered/removed model was developed to estimate the transmissibility and simulate the optimal vaccination strategy. The effective reproduction number (R(eff)) was used to estimate the transmission interaction in different age groups. RESULTS: A total of 47 722 new cases were reported in Wuhan City from December 2, 2019, to March 16, 2020. Before the travel ban of Wuhan City, the highest transmissibility was observed among age group 2 (R(eff) = 4.28), followed by group 2 to 3 (R(eff) = 2.61), and group 2 to 4 (R(eff) = 1.69). China should vaccinate at least 85% of the total population to interrupt transmission. The priority for controlling transmission should be to vaccinate 5% to 8% of individuals in age group 2 per day (ultimately vaccinated 90% of age group 2), followed by 10% of age group 3 per day (ultimately vaccinated 90% age group 3). However, the optimal vaccination strategy for reducing the disease severity identified individuals  65 years old as a priority group, followed by those 45C64 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 85% of the total population (nearly 1.2 billion people) should be vaccinated to build an immune barrier in China to safely consider removing border restrictions. Based on these results, we concluded that 90% of adults aged 15C64 years should first be vaccinated to prevent transmission in China.

Many countries started to take different measures of precautions. The Kingdom of Bahrain COVID team (National Taskforce for Combating the Coronavirus) has introduced different protocols for different categories. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to; determine the efficiency of the recent National Taskforce for Combating the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Protocol 5-day nasopharyngeal swab from diagnosis; by evaluating the period of time needed for a patient to retain a negative polymerase chain reaction result and to determine the number of patients who failed to retain a negative result. In addition to, evaluating the cycle threshold values of persistent positive and its relation to current evidence in literature. This study also aims to determine the number of patients that needed urgent medical care [i.e. shifting to an intensive care unit (ICU) facility] in that time frame. MATERIALS & METHODS: Data were collected from the daily index master sheets present in the facility from medical database systems; ALCARE by Royal Medical Services and ORACLE Reports by iSEHA. Search engines used were PubMed/MEDLINE, Oxford Academic Database, Cochrane Database system. The duration of study was from 1-July 2020 to 31-August 2020. RESULTS: The sample included 7196 male patients from ages 18-65 years. Median age was 36.

In recent years, applications of big data and AI in education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of cold technology and warm humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning.","output":"Challenges and Future Directions of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Individuals taking immunosuppressants are at increased susceptibility to viral infections in general.

This systematic review aims to summarize the current international clinical guidelines to highlight areas where research is needed through critical appraisal of the evidence base of these guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines about the usage of immunosuppressants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electronic databases including MEDLINE and the websites of relevant professional bodies were searched for English language guidelines that were published or updated between March 2020 and May 2020 in this area. We assessed the quality and consistency of guidelines. The evidence base underpinning these guidelines was critically appraised using GRADE criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-three guidelines were included. Most guidelines (n = 15, 65.2%) informed and updated evidence based on expert opinion. The methodological quality of the guidelines varied, ranging from very low to moderate. Guidelines consistently recommended that high-risk patients, including those who are taking high doses of steroids for more than a month, or a combination of two or more immunosuppressants, should be shielding during the outbreak. Most guidelines stated that steroids usage should not be stopped abruptly and advised on individualized riskCbenefit analysis considering the risk of the effect of COVID-19 infection and the relapse of the autoimmune condition in patients. DISCUSSION: Clinical practice guidelines on taking immunosuppressants during the COVID-19 outbreak vary in quality. The level of evidence informing the available guidelines was generally low.

This paper examines two potential associations between inclusion in PMC on types of outpatient health service utilization by dependent older people. The first is that being in PMC is associated with a higher frequency of outpatient visits for physical rehabilitation. The second is that being in PMC is associated with a higher frequency of planned versus unplanned outpatient visits. METHODS: We apply a quasi-experimental design to a unique set of health administrative data recording visits to outpatient health services. We focus on comparisons of the universe of visits, transformed to ratios of planned/unplanned visits and rehabilitation/other reasons for visiting the outpatient service. First, we preprocess our sample through different matching techniques such as coarsened exact matching (CEM), nearest neighbor based on logit scores (NN), optimal pair (OP) and optimal full (OF) methods. Second, we estimate marginal effects of being in PMC on our outcomes of interest. We use Poisson regressions controlling for individual and community factors and use robust standard errors. Our results are presented as the comparative incidence ratio of PMC on rehabilitation and planned visits. RESULTS: We find significant positive incidence rates for belonging to PMC for both outcomes of interest under all matching specifications. Poisson models using CEM shows a higher incidence rate for planned visits in comparison to unplanned visits, 1.3 (95% CI 1.1C1.4), by PMC patients compared to the non-PMC controls, and a higher proportion of visits for rehabilitation, 3.4 (95% CI 1.7C6.8). Similar positive results are found across other matching methods and models. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis reveals significant positive associations between older people included in PMC and a matched set of controls for a greater ratio of making outpatient visits that were planned, rather than unplanned. We find similar associations for the proportion of visits made for rehabilitation, as opposed to other reasons. These findings indicate that PMC influences some elements of outpatient health service utilization by dependent older people.

Unmitigated neuro-inflammation has been noted to underlie not only the severe respiratory complications of the disease but is also present in a range of neuro-psychiatric illnesses. Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by immune-inflammatory states, while treatments for these disorders have distinct anti-inflammatory properties and effects.

Provincial Geriatrics Leadership Ontario, in collaboration with interRAI and the International Federation on Aging, hosted a virtual Town Hall on September 25, 2020. The purpose of this event was to bring together international perspectives from researchers, clinicians, and policy experts to address important themes potentially amenable to timely policy interventions. This article summarizes these themes and the ensuing discussions among 130 attendees from 5 continents. The disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on frail residents of LTC homes reflects a systematic lack of equitable prioritization by health system decision makers around the world. The primary risk factors for an outbreak in an LTC home were outbreaks in the surrounding community, high staff and visitor traffic in large facilities, and crowding of residents in ageing buildings. Infection control measures must be prioritized in LTC homes, though care must be taken to protect frail and vulnerable residents from their overly blunt application that deprives residents from appropriate physical and psychosocial support. Staffing, in terms of overall numbers, training, and leadership skills, was inadequate. The built environment of LTC homes can be configured for both optimal resident well-being and infection control. Infection control and resident wellness need not be mutually exclusive. Improving outcomes for LTC residents requires more staffing with proper training and interprofessional leadership. All these initiatives must be underpinned by an effective quality assurance system based on standardized, comprehensive, accessible, and clinically relevant data, and which can support broad communities of practice capable of effecting real and meaningful change for frail older persons, wherever they chose to reside.","output":"Proceedings from an International Virtual Townhall: Reflecting on the COVID-19 Pandemic: Themes from Long-Term Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Big data holds great potential for research and for society, large volumes of varied data can be produced and made available to researchers much faster compared to 'traditional' data.

For comparison, a propensity score matched historical cohort of patients treated with IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab (TCZ) was used. Patients had previously received combinations of azithromycin, hydroxy-chloroquine, and methyl-prednisolone. Laboratory findings, respiratory function and adverse effects were monitored. Resolution of ARDS within the first 7 days of treatment was considered a favorable outcome. RESULTS: Subcutaneous ANK (100 mg every 6 h) was given to 9 COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients (77.8% males). Median age was 62 years (range, 42 to 87). A TCZ cohort of 18 patients was selected by propensity score matching and treated with intravenous single dose of 600 mg for patients weighing >75 Kg, or 400 mg if < 75 Kg. Prior to treatment, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of the ANK and TCZ cohorts were 193 and 249, respectively (p = 0.131). After 7 days of treatment, PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved in both groups to 279 (104-335) and 331 (140-476, p = 0.099) respectively. On day 7, there was significant reduction of ferritin (p = 0.046), CRP (p = 0.043), and IL-6 (p = 0.043) levels in the ANK cohort but only of CRP (p = 0.001) in the TCZ group. Favorable outcome was achieved in 55.6% and 88.9% of the ANK and TCZ cohorts, respectively (p = 0.281). Two patients that failed to respond to TCZ improved after ANK treatment. Aminotransferase levels significantly increased between day 1 and day 7 (p = 0.004) in the TCZ group. Mortality was the same in both groups (11%). There were not any opportunistic infection in the groups nor other adverse effects attributable to treatment. CONCLUSION: Overall, 55.6% of COVID-19 ARDS CSS patients treated with ANK exhibited favorable outcome, not inferior to a TCZ treated matched cohort. ANK may be a potential alternative to TCZ for patients with elevated aminotransferases, and may be useful in non-responders to TCZ.","output":"High dose subcutaneous Anakinra to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to cytokine storm syndrome among severely ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the relationship between the ownership structure of hospitals and the possibility of their being positioned on the frontier of technical efficiency in the economic crisis period 2010-2012, adjusting for hospital variables and regional characteristics in the areas where the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) hospitals are located. Methods: 230 National Health System hospitals were studied over the two-year period 2010-2012 according to their ownership structure-public hospitals, private hospitals and public-private partnership (PPP)-data envelopment analysis orientated to inputs was used to measure the overall technical efficiency, pure efficiency and efficiency of scale. A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) with binomial distribution and logit link function was used to analyse the hospital and regional variables associated with positioning on the frontier. Results: There are substantial differences between the average pure technical efficiency of public, private and PPP hospitals, as well as a greater number of PPP models being positioned on the efficiency frontier (91.67% in 2012). The odds of being positioned on the frontier are 41.7 times higher in PPP models than in public hospitals. The average annual household income per region is related to the greater odds of hospitals being positioned on the frontier of efficiency. Conclusions: During the most acute period of recession in the Spanish economy, PPP formulas favoured hospital efficiency, by increasing the odds of being positioned on the frontier of efficiency when compared to private and public hospitals. The position on the frontier of efficiency of a hospital is related to the wealth of its region.","output":"Multilevel Analysis of the Relationship between Ownership Structure and Technical Efficiency Frontier in the Spanish National Health System Hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Latest international directives indicate the need for sustainable development, linking socio-economic and environmental aspects, to reach the goals set by Agenda 2030.

Replication of the CoV genome takes place in membrane compartments formed by rearrangement of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane network. Budding of these viruses occurs from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). The relationship between proteins and various membranes is crucial for the replication cycle of CoVs. The role of transmembrane domains (TMDs) and pre-transmembrane domains (pre-TMD) of viral proteins in this process is gaining more recognition. Here we present a thorough analysis of physico-chemical parameters, such as accessible surface area (ASA), average hydrophobicity (H(av)), and contribution of specific amino acids in TMDs and pre-TMDs of single-span membrane proteins of human viruses. We focus on unique properties of these elements in CoV and postulate their role in adaptation to diverse host membranes and regulation of retention of membrane proteins during replication.","output":"Unique properties of Coronaviridae single-pass transmembrane domain regions as an adaptation to diverse membrane systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), a member of the Closteroviridae, has a positive-sense RNA genome of about 20 kb organized into 12 open reading frames (ORFs). The last 10 ORFs are expressed through 3'-coterminal subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) regulated in both amounts and timing. Additionally, relatively large amounts of complementary sgRNAs are produced. We have been unable to determine whether these sgRNAs are produced by internal promotion from the full-length template minus strand or by transcription from the minus-stranded sgRNAs. Understanding the regulation of 10 sgRNAs is a conceptual challenge. In analyzing commonalities of a replicase complex in producing so many sgRNAs, we examined initiating nucleotides of the sgRNAs. We mapped the 5' termini of intermediate- (CP and p13) and low- (p18) produced sgRNAs that, like the two highly abundant sgRNAs (p20 and p23) previously mapped, all initiate with an adenylate. We then examined modifications of the initiation site, which has been shown to be useful in defining mechanisms of sgRNA synthesis. Surprisingly, mutation of the initiating nucleotide of the CTV sgRNAs did not prevent sgRNA accumulation. Based on our results, the CTV replication complex appears to initiate sgRNA synthesis with purines, preferably with adenylates, and is able to initiate synthesis using a nucleotide a few positions 5' or 3' of the native initiation nucleotide. Furthermore, the context of the initiation site appears to be a regulatory mechanism for levels of sgRNA production. These data do not support either of the established mechanisms for synthesis of sgRNAs, suggesting that CTV sgRNA production utilizes a different mechanism.","output":"Effects of modification of the transcription initiation site context on citrus tristeza virus subgenomic RNA synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by the novel enveloped single-stranded RNA virus quickly declared a pandemic.

Despite the extensive studies aiming to understand the pathology of COVID-19, the clinicopathological characteristics and risk factors associated with COVID-19 remain mostly unclear. In this study, we assessed the clinical course and features of COVID-19 patients. FINDINGS: There were 59 patients (54.1%) that had no fever. One-hundred(91.7%) patients required oxygen therapy, which improved percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2). Seventy-two (66.1%) patients aged over 60; these patients were more likely to develop respiratory symptoms. Only 13(11.9%) patients were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, and computed tomography (CT) findings. We found significant differences in age, respiratory symptoms, and heart rates between patients with and without underlying conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that oxygen plays an important role in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and that age and underlying diseases are significant risk factors for COVID-19. Most COVID-19 patients have no fever, and CT provides higher detection rates than antibody- and nucleic acid-based detection methods. METHODS: We analyzed data from 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases.

In the present study, we explored inflammation-promoting activity of HMGB1 and blockade of extracellular release of HMGB1 by glycyrrhizin (GL) in LPS/GalN-triggered mouse liver injury. At 1 to 10 h after LPS/GalN-treatment, mice were anesthetized to collect blood from heart puncture, and serum transaminase and HMGB1 were evaluated. Administration of LPS/GalN precipitated tissue injury associated with time-dependent alteration in HMGB1 serum levels. At 8 h nuclear immunoreactive products were remarkably reduced and extracellular HMGB1 expression was found exclusively in the pericentral foci. The treatment with GL significantly down-regulated the serum levels of ALT, AST, and HMGB1 in addition to the strong inhibition of tissue injury and extracellular immunoreactivity to HMGB1 and to acetylated-lysine. Furthermore, GL brought about a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic hepatocytes labeled with TUNEL-method. On the basis of these results, three apoptosis-associated genes were identified with microarray analysis and real-time PCR. The ChIP-assay revealed the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter sequence in LPS/GalN-treated mice and the remarkable decrease in combined HMGB1 protein by GL. The current findings claim that a single injection of LPS/GalN might stimulate apoptosis of hepatocytes through the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter region and that GL-treatment might prevent the apoptosis and inflammatory infiltrates caused with LPS/GalN-injection by disturbing the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter sequence.","output":"Apoptotic Response through a High Mobility Box 1 Protein-Dependent Mechanism in LPS/GalN-Induced Mouse Liver Failure and Glycyrrhizin-Mediated Inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the coronavirus outbreak, new and strengthened norms of plastic dependency emerged in the Middle East and North Africa region through the desperate demand for products like face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), highlighting the tradeoffs between health and the environment.

Attendance at the Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) supported indigenous health checks are crucial to improve prevention and management of chronic health conditions. However, in conjunction with lifestyle and environmental factors, attendance rates at primary healthcare services for screening and treatment have fallen in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to explore the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on preventive health behaviours of indigenous Australians and the associated barriers to, and enablers of, engagement with health services to formulate a targeted intervention strategy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A concurrent mixed-methods study (comprising quantitative and qualitative data collection methods) will be employed. Descriptive analysis of MBS data about the characteristics of indigenous peoples of Australia claiming health assessment services will be performed. Generalised estimating equation regression models will be used to examine the use of health assessment services over time. Qualitative interviews informed by indigenous research methods will be conducted. Interviews will investigate barriers to, and enablers of, engagement with health services. Thematic approach guided by the principles of indigenist praxis, storytelling and collaborative research will be used to analyse the interview data.

Worldwide, little is known about the effectiveness of trauma care system at different stages of development, from establishing a trauma centre, to implementing a trauma system and as trauma systems mature. The objective of this study is to extract and analyse data from research that evaluates mortality rates according to different stages of trauma system development globally. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The proposed review will comply with the checklist of the 'Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis'. In this review, only peer-reviewed articles written in English, human-related studies and published between January 2000 and December 2020 will be included. Articles will be retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. Additional articles will be identified from other sources such as references of included articles and author lists. Two independent authors will assess the eligibility of studies as well as critically appraise and assess the methodological quality of all included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias for Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool. Two independent authors will extract the data to minimise errors and bias during the process of data extraction using an extraction tool developed by the authors. For analysis calculation, effect sizes will be expressed as risk ratios or ORs for dichotomous data or weighted (or standardised) mean differences and 95% CIs for continuous data in this systematic review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review will use secondary data only, therefore, research ethics approval is not required. The results from this study will be submitted to a peer-review journal for publication and we will present our findings at national and international conferences.

Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibodies that can inhibit virus-ACE2 interaction to prevent viral entry. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophage cultures.

METHODS ASV was compared to a fixed tidal volume of 6 ml/kg. ASV determined the respiratory rate and tidal volume based on its algorithms. Maximum airway pressure limit was 28 cm H2O in ASV. Six sets of lung mechanics were simulated for two ideal body weights: 60 kg, Group I; 80 kg, Group II. Positive end expiratory pressure was 8, 12, and 16 cm H2O, and target minute volume 120%, 150%, and 200% of predicted minute volume. RESULTS ASV \\"sacrificed\\" tidal volume and minute ventilation to maintain PP in 9 (17%) of 54 scenarios in Group I and 20 (37%) of 54 scenarios in Group II. In Group I, the number of scenarios with PP of 28 cm H2O or more was 14 for ASV (26%) and 19 for 6 ml/kg (35%). In these scenarios, mean PP were ASV 28.8 +/- 0.86 cm H2O (min 28, max 30.3) and 6 ml/kg 33.01 +/- 3.48 cm H2O (min 28, max 37.8) (P = 0.000). In group II, the number of scenarios PP of 28 cm H2O or more was 10 for ASV (19%) and 21 for 6 ml/kg (39%). In these cases, mean PP values were ASV 28.78 +/- 0.54 cm H2O (min 28, max 29.6) and 6 ml/kg 32.66 +/- 3.37 cm H2O (min 28.2, max 38.2) (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION In a lung model with varying mechanics, ASV is better able to prevent the potential damaging effects of excessive PP (greater than 28 cm H2O) than a fixed tidal volume of 6 ml/kg by automatically adjusting airway pressure, resulting in a decreased tidal volume.","output":"Adaptive support ventilation: an appropriate mechanical ventilation strategy for acute respiratory distress syndrome?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an uncommon phenomenon with increasing incidence. This study aims to present a rare case of post COVID-19 CVST. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old female presented with headache, nausea, left sided weakness, and slurred speech. She recently recovered from COVID-19 who had severe presentations. On examination, mild left central facial palsy, high grade left sided hemiparesis (Grade 2/5), positive Babinski on left side, left side hypoesthesia, and inability to walk were observed. Laboratory and ultrasound findings were not significant, however magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed CVST. The patient was prescribed Clexane 6000 IU twice daily, and after 14 days, it was changed to warfarin with an INR between 2 and 3. After 3 weeks of treatment, the patient was able to walk, and after 3 months her warfarin medication was discontinued. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has been reported to be linked with CVST, however there is limited information about it. The exact figures regarding the affected groups and incidence rates are highly controversial. The diagnosis of CVST poses a challenge to physicians as their symptoms are highly unspecific, hence MRI is required for definitive diagnosis. Anticoagulant is commonly used in their treatment; however, the ideal anticoagulant of choice and the management duration are yet to be known. CONCLUSION: Active or recently resolved COVID-19 can be considered as an independent risk factor for developing CVST and it rises the mortality rate of the disease.","output":"Post COVID-19 cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel corona virus is a rapidly spreading viral infection that has became a pandemic causing destructive effects on public health and global economy So, early detection and Covid-19 patient early quarantine is having the significant impact on curtailing its transmission rate But it has become a major challenge due to critical shortage of test kits A new promising method that overcomes this challenge by predicting Covid-19 from patient X-rays using transfer learning, a deep learning technique is proposed in this paper For this we used a dataset consisting of chest x-rays of Covid-19 infected and normal people we used VGG, GoogleNet-Inception v1, ResNet, CheXNet models of transfer learning which is a deep learning technique for its benefit of decreasing the training time for a neural network model Using these we show accuracies of 99 49%, 99%, 98 63%, 99 93% respectively in Covid-19 prediction from x-ray of suspected patient ? 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Covid Prediction from Chest X-Rays Using Transfer Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Optimization of biophysical properties is a critical success factor for the developability of monoclonal antibodies with potential therapeutic applications. The inter-domain disulfide bond between light chain (Lc) and heavy chain (Hc) in human IgG1 lends structural support for antibody scaffold stability, optimal antigen binding, and normal Fc function. Recently, human IgG1 has been suggested to exhibit significantly greater susceptibility to reduction of the inter Lc-Hc disulfide bond relative to the same disulfide bond in human IgG1. To understand the molecular basis for this observed difference in stability, the sequence and structure of human IgG1 and human IgG1 were compared. Based on this Lc comparison, three single mutations were made in the  Lc proximal to the cysteine residue, which forms a disulfide bond with the Hc. We determined that deletion of S214 (dS) improved resistance of the association between Lc and Hc to thermal stress. In addition, deletion of this terminal serine from the Lc of IgG1 provided further benefit, including an increase in stability at elevated pH, increased yield from transient transfection, and improved in vitro antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). These observations support the conclusion that the presence of the terminal serine of the  Lc creates a weaker inter-chain disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc, leading to slightly reduced stability and a potential compromise in IgG1 function. Our data from a human IgG1 provide a basis for further investigation of the effects of deleting terminal serine from Lc on the stability and function of other human IgG1 antibodies.","output":"Removal of a C-terminal serine residue proximal to the inter-chain disulfide bond of a human IgG1 lambda light chain mediates enhanced antibody stability and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Learning through a 360 virtual reality (VR) or 2D video represents an alternative way to learn a complex medical education task. However, there is currently no consensus on how best to assess the effects of different learning materials on cognitive load estimates, heart rate variability (HRV), outcomes, and experience in learning history taking and physical examination (H&P) skills. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate how learning materials (ie, VR or 2D video) impact learning outcomes and experience through changes in cognitive load estimates and HRV for learning H&P skills. METHODS: This pilot systemCdesign study included 32 undergraduate medical students at an academic teaching hospital. The students were randomly assigned, with a 1:1 allocation, to a 360 VR video group or a 2D video group, matched by age, sex, and cognitive style. The contents of both videos were different with regard to visual angle and self-determination. Learning outcomes were evaluated using the Milestone reporting form. Subjective and objective cognitive loads were estimated using the Paas Cognitive Load Scale, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index, and secondary-task reaction time. Cardiac autonomic function was assessed using HRV measurements. Learning experience was assessed using the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire and qualitative feedback. Statistical significance was accepted at a two-sided P value of <.01. RESULTS: All 32 participants received the intended intervention. The sample consisted of 20 (63%) males and 12 (38%) females, with a median age of 24 (IQR 23-25) years. The 360 VR video group seemed to have a higher Milestone level than the 2D video group (P=.04). The reaction time at the 10th minute in the 360 VR video group was significantly higher than that in the 2D video group (P<.001). Multiple logistic regression models of the overall cohort showed that the 360 VR video module was independently and positively associated with a reaction time at the 10th minute of 3.6 seconds (exp B=18.8, 95% CI 3.2-110.8; P=.001) and a Milestone level of 3 (exp B=15.0, 95% CI 2.3-99.6; P=.005). However, a reaction time at the 10th minute of 3.6 seconds was not related to a Milestone level of 3. A low-frequency to high-frequency ratio between the 5th and 10th minute of 1.43 seemed to be inversely associated with a hedonic stimulation score of 2.0 (exp B=0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.68; P=.015) after adjusting for video module. The main qualitative feedback indicated that the 360 VR video module was fun but caused mild dizziness, whereas the 2D video module was easy to follow but tedious. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results showed that 360 VR video learning may be associated with a better Milestone level than 2D video learning, and that this did not seem to be related to cognitive load estimates or HRV indexes in the novice learners. Of note, an increase in sympathovagal balance may have been associated with a lower hedonic stimulation score, which may have met the learners needs and prompted learning through the different video modules.

Given the chemical interaction between calcium and phosphate (Pi), the increased serum Pi in chronic kidney disease may cause changes in the composition and structure of the prCa fraction. Here, we report the phosphate binding on the protein-bound calcium in uremic rat serum. Using adenine-fed rats as a uremic model, we separated the calcium and phosphate fractions in rat serum by ultrafiltration, and found that the level of protein-bound phosphate (prPi) in the uremic serum was markedly higher than in control. The elevated prPi level was comparable to the prCa level, consistent with the presence of protein-bound calcium phosphate pr(Ca)j-m(CaPi)m. We then confirmed its presence by ex vivo X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, revealing the discrete state of the calcium phosphate clusters associated with protein. Finally, in a quantitative investigation using Ca- and Pi-boosted serum, we discovered the threshold concentration for the Pi binding on prCa, and determined the binding constant. The threshold, while preventing Pi from binding to prCa in normal condition, allows the reaction to take place in hyperphosphatemia conditions. The protein-bound calcium phosphate could act as a link between the metabolism of serum proteins and the homeostasis of phosphate and calcium, and it deserves further investigation whether the molar ratio of (prPi/prCa)a? 100% may serve as a serum index of the vascular calcification status in chronic kidney disease.","output":"Protein-bound calcium phosphate in uremic rat serum: a quantitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oncological care was largely derailed due to the reprioritisation of health care services to handle the initial surge of COVID-19 patients adequately. Cancer screening programmes were no exception in this reprioritisation. They were temporarily halted in the Netherlands (1) to alleviate the pressure on health care services overwhelmed by the upsurge of COVID-19 patients, (2) to reallocate staff and personal protective equipment to support critical COVID-19 care, and (3) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Utilising data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry on provisional cancer diagnoses between 6 January 2020 and 4 October 2020, we assessed the impact of the temporary halt of national population screening programmes on the diagnosis of breast and colorectal cancer in the Netherlands. A dynamic harmonic regression model with ARIMA error components was applied to assess the observed versus expected number of cancer diagnoses per calendar week. Fewer diagnoses of breast and colorectal cancer were objectified amid the early stages of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands. This effect was most pronounced among the age groups eligible for cancer screening programmes, especially in breast cancer (age group 50C74 years). Encouragingly enough, the observed number of diagnoses ultimately reached and virtually remained at the level of the expected values. This finding, which emerged earlier in age groups not invited for cancer screening programmes, comes on account of the decreased demand for critical COVID-19 care since early April 2020, which, in turn, paved the way forward to resume screening programmes and a broad range of non-critical health care services, albeit with limited operating and workforce capacity. Collectively, transient changes in health-seeking behaviour, referral practices, and cancer screening programmes amid the early stages of the initial COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands conjointly acted as an accelerant for fewer breast and colorectal cancer diagnoses in age groups eligible for cancer screening programmes. Forthcoming research is warranted to assess whether the decreased diagnostic scrutiny of cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in stage migration and altered clinical management, as well as poorer outcomes.","output":"The impact of the temporary suspension of national cancer screening programmes due to the COVID-19 epidemic on the diagnosis of breast and colorectal cancer in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Students in the Frontiers in Human Aging course at UCLA participate in service-learning (SL) with older adults In 2020, completion of SL coincided with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic We evaluated the impact of SL on student attitudes on aging and community service in the context of the pandemic Methods: Students were assigned to senior residential and daycare programs for 18-20 hours of SL A retrospective pretest-posttest survey asked about attitudes and interests before and after SL and how the COVID-19 pandemic affected these perceptions;73 (of 103) students responded Mean differences before and after SL were tested and differences were assessed within groups reporting COVID-19 effects Results: SL improved students attitudes and ability to engage with older adults, knowledge about aging concepts, interest in future work with older adults, attitudes on community service, social well-being and feelings of usefulness (p&amp;lt;0 001) There was no significant change in overall anxiety about aging (p=0 1), however, students showed increased anxiety about losing independence and finances when older (p&amp;lt;0 05) At least 50% of students reported that the COVID-19 pandemic increased their awareness of needs of older adults (81 9%) and decreased connection to their peers (50 7%);the impact of SL remained unchanged by these effects Conclusion: Despite the overall benefits of SL, increased anxiety about aspects of aging suggests the need to address these concerns While the COVID-19 pandemic did not seem to affect the impact of SL, this event did seem to influence perceptions about aging and social integration","output":"Evaluating Service-Learning with Older Adults on Undergraduate College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics are a significant stress test for a country's economic, political and health systems An effective pandemic response demands a multi-pronged and multi-layered approach, comprising surveillance, containment, border control, as well as various social and community measures In the wake of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has now infected more than 7 million people worldwide, strict quarantine measures are a commonplace, and a third of the world's population have now gone into some form of lockdown With the exception of border control, all these response measures involve the contributions of family physicians and general practitioners (GPs) in one way or another Primary care physicians form and lead the primary care network, which in turn forms the backbone of any healthcare system Being the first point of contact for a significant proportion of patients, primary care physicians play an essential strategic function in the fight against disease, both during peacetime and in the event of a public health crisis In this commentary, we examine and propose some of the key roles that they play in a pandemic, drawing examples from the current COVID-19 pandemic and past experiences COVID-19 has showed us that the world is grossly unprepared for a pandemic, both in terms of our global management and the structure of our current primary health care systems, and this should provide the impetus for us to improve","output":"The Role of Family Physicians in a Pandemic: A Blueprint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary: Nutritional status has been indicated as a contributing factor to age\\\\related dysregulation of the immune response.

Inflammation is an important contributor to this ongoing risk. Recent studies have shown that the broad-acting anti-inflammatory agent, colchicine, may reduce adverse cardiovascular events in patients post-MI, although the mechanistic basis for this remains unclear. Advances in endovascular arterial wall imaging have allowed detailed characterization of the burden and compositional phenotype of coronary plaque, along with its natural history and responsiveness to treatment. One such example has been the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to demonstrate the plaque-stabilizing effects of statins on both fibrous cap thickness and the size of lipid pools within plaque. METHODS: The Phase 2, multi-centre, double-blind colchicine for coronary plaque modification in acute coronary syndrome (COCOMO-ACS) study will evaluate the effect of colchicine 0.5 mg daily on coronary plaque features using serial OCT imaging in patients following MI. Recruitment for the trial has been completed with 64 participants with non-ST elevation MI randomized 1:1 to colchicine or placebo in addition to guideline recommended therapies, including high-intensity statins. The primary endpoint is the effect of colchicine on the minimal fibrous cap thickness of non-culprit plaque over an 18-month period. SUMMARY: The COCOMO-ACS study will determine whether addition of colchicine 0.5 mg daily to standard post-MI treatment has incremental benefits on high-risk features of coronary artery plaques. If confirmed, this will provide new mechanistic insights into how colchicine may confer clinical benefits in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

In addition to this diversity of consensus genomes across patients, RNA viruses can also display genetic diversity within individual hosts, and co-existing viral variants may affect disease progression and the success of medical interventions. To systematically examine the intra-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we processed a large cohort of 3939 publicly-available deeply sequenced genomes with specialised bioinformatics software, along with 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We found that the distribution of diversity across patients and across genomic loci is very unbalanced with a minority of hosts and positions accounting for much of the diversity. For example, the D614G variant in the Spike gene, which is present in the consensus sequences of 67.4% of patients, is also highly diverse within hosts, with 29.7% of the public cohort being affected by this coexistence and exhibiting different variants. We also investigated the impact of several technical and epidemiological parameters on genetic heterogeneity and found that age, which is known to be correlated with poor disease outcomes, is a significant predictor of viral genetic diversity. Author Summary Since it arose in late 2019, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) behind the COVID-19 pandemic has mutated and evolved during its global spread. Individual patients may host different versions, or variants, of the virus, hallmarked by different mutations. We examine the diversity of genetic variants coexisting within patients across a cohort of 3939 publicly accessible samples and 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We find that a small number of patients carry most of the diversity, and that patients with more diversity tend to be older. We also find that most of the diversity is concentrated in certain regions and positions of the virus genome. In particular, we find that a variant reported to increase infectivity is among the most diverse positions. Our study provides a large-scale survey of within-patient diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.","output":"Within-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The multiple modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission including airborne, droplet, contact, and fecal-oral transmissions that cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contribute to a public threat to the lives of people worldwide.

Droplet transmission was commonly reported to occur in particles with diameter >5 m that can quickly settle gravitationally on surfaces (1-2 m). Instead, fine and ultrafine particles (airborne transmission) can stay suspended for an extended period of time (&#8805;2 h) and be transported further, e.g., up to 8 m through simple diffusion and convection mechanisms. Droplet and airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can be limited indoors with adequate ventilation of rooms, by routine disinfection of toilets, using negative pressure rooms, using face masks, and maintaining social distancing. Other preventive measures recommended include increasing the number of screening tests of suspected carriers of SARS-CoV-2, reducing the number of persons in a room to minimize sharing indoor air, and monitoring people's temperature before accessing a building.

A growing body of literature raises the issue of Vitamin C and Vitamin D as a risk-assessment tool, and therapeutic option, in COVID-19. Objective: The objective of this pilot study was to measure serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels in a cohort of patients with critical COVID-19 illness in our community hospital ICU, correlate with other illness risk factors (age, BMI, HgbA1c, smoking status), generate hypotheses, and suggest further therapeutic intervention studies. Method: This pilot study included all 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized in May 2020 in the ICU of North Suburban Medical Center, Thornton, Colorado, in whose care the principal investigator (C.A.) was involved. We measured patients' serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and standard risk factors like age, BMI, HbA1c, and smoking status. Variables in this study were gauged using descriptive statistics. Results: Of 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients (15 males and 6 females, 17 Hispanic and 4 Caucasian, of median age 61a?years, range 20-94), there were 11 survivors.Serum levels of Vitamin C and Vitamin D were low in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients.Older age and low Vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality from COVID-19 in our sample.Insulin resistance and obesity were prevalent in our small cohort, but smoking was not. Conclusion: Our pilot study found low serum levels of Vitamin C and Vitamin D in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients. Older age and low Vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality. Many were also insulin-resistant or diabetic, overweight or obese, known as independent risk factors for low Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and for COVID-19.These findings suggest the need to further explore whether caring for COVID-19 patients ought to routinely include measuring and correcting serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and whether treating critically ill COVID-19 warrants acute parenteral Vitamin C and Vitamin D replacement.","output":"Serum levels of vitamin C and vitamin D in a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients of a north American community hospital intensive care unit in may 2020.

However, it is unclear how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies across different surfaces. To address these questions, we conduct systematic experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer and human-exhaled gas on surfaces. We found that these droplets do not disappear with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers (referred to as residues), persist for more than 24 hours, and are highly durable against changes of environmental conditions. The characteristics of these residues change significantly across surface types. Specifically, surfaces with high thermal conductivity like copper do not leave any resolvable residues, while stainless steel, plastic, and glass surfaces form residues from a varying fraction of all deposited droplets at 40% relative humidity. Lowering humidity level suppresses the formation of residues while increasing humidity level enhances it. Our results suggest that these microscale residues can potentially insulate the virus against environmental changes, allowing them to survive inhospitable environments and remain infectious for prolonged durations after deposition. Our findings can also be extended to other viruses transmitted through respiratory droplets (e.g., SARS-CoV, flu viruses, etc.), and can thus lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces and other prevention measures (e.g., humidity control) for limiting viral transmission.","output":"Droplet evaporation residue indicating SARS-COV-2 survivability on surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Developing prognostic markers can be useful for clinical decision\\\\making.

The virus has an approximate 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 74.5% to 99% identical to that of SARS-CoV, CoV-pangolin, and the coronavirus the from horseshoe bat.

The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, and its subsequent cleavage by serine protease and fusion, are the main events in the pathophysiology. The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future. At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19.

The SARS-CoV-2 first emerged from China and transformed to a global pandemic within a short time. The virus was further observed to be spreading rapidly and mutating at a fast pace, with over 5,775 distinct variations of the virus observed globally (at the time of submitting this paper). Extensive research has been ongoing worldwide in order to get a better understanding of its behaviour, influence and more importantly, ways for reducing its impact. Data analytics has been playing a pivotal role in this research to obtain valuable insights into understanding and fighting against the spread of infection. However, this is time and resource intensive, making it difficult to observe and quickly identify the impact of mutations. Factors such as the spread or virulence could explain the three months delay in revealing the new virus variant in the UK. This paper presents an extensive correlation analysis of the effect caused by the different SARS-CoV-2 strains, and their influence on the population across diverse factors, such as propagation and fatality rates, during the peak of the pandemic, with a focus on two major countries in theMiddle East, the United Arab Emirate (UAE) and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). This research aims to investigate the epidemiological behaviour of the Coronavirus' genomic variants over time in the UAE, compared with the KSA, where correlation analysis is carried out for a number of cases, deaths and their statistical deviations. The results of the analysis highlight very interesting insights into the epidemiological impact of the Covid-19 genomic behaviour in both countries, which could lead to important actions taken to minimize the impact on wider public health, possibly saving lives, and the economy. For instance, our method identifies a potential correlation between a spike in the number of deaths per case of 5.5 observed in the UAE by March 24th, with the emergence of new genomic variants of the Coronavirus (G0_c, G0_e1 and G0_e2). Our proposed methodology can be instrumental in identifying and classifying new variations of the virus earlier, and possibly predicting foreseeable mutations through pattern analysis, hence creating proactivemeasures to control its spread, such as the recent case of the new virus variant, recently discovered in the UK. ? 2021 Tech Science Press.

Despite pulmonary impairments being the most prevalent, extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are abundant. Confirmed COVID-19 cases have now surpassed 57.8 million worldwide as of 22 November 2020. With estimated case fatality rates (number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by number of confirmed COVID-19 cases) varying between 1 and 7%, there will be a large population of recovered COVID-19 patients that may acquire a multitude of long-term health consequences. While the multi-organ manifestations of COVID-19 are now well-documented, the potential long-term implications of these manifestations remain to be uncovered. In this review, we turn to previous similar coronaviruses (i.e. SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) in combination with known health implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection to predict potential long-term effects of COVID-19, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematologic, renal, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and psychosocial manifestations, in addition to the well-known post-intensive care syndrome. It is necessary to monitor COVID-19 patients after discharge to understand the breadth and severity of long-term effects. This can be accomplished by repurposing or initiating large cohort studies to not only focus on the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also on acquired immune function as well as ethno-racial group and household income disparities in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.

We employed human and plant defensins, a class of small and highly stable proteins, and engineered the amino acid residues on its conformationally constrained alpha-helices to mimic the critical residues on the ACE2 helix 1 that interacts with the Spike-protein.

METHODS: We created a 1-week virtual urology course utilizing interactive lectures, case-based exercises, and faculty-proctored surgical video reviews. Students were assigned self-study modules and participated in case-based discussions and presentations on a topic of their choice. Students' perceptions of urology as a specialty and the utility of the course was evaluated through pre- and postcourse surveys. Understanding of urologic content was evaluated with a multiple-choice exam. RESULTS: A total of nine students were enrolled in the course. All students reported increased understanding of the common urologic diagnoses and of urology as a specialty by an average of 2.5 points on a 10-point Likert scale (Cohen's measure of effect size: 3.2). Additionally, 56% of students reported increased interest, 22% reported no change and 22% reported a decreased interest in pursuing urology as a specialty following the course. Students self-reported increased knowledge of a variety of urologic topics on a 10-point Likert scale.

They responded that the use of masks, sanitisers, handwashing and proper lockdown would help to prevent the disease. The respondents acknowledged the vital role of media in increasing awareness. Participants also expressed concerns over the misleading news spread by some media. The lack of social interaction, isolation and loss of income were raised as pertinent issues by the participants as potentially leading to psychological consequences. Health workers and public both raised concerns over inadequate Personal Protective Equipment, under-prepared health system, unorganised public quarantine centres, and public violation of lockdown CONCLUSIONS: This study reports participants' views on disease prevention measures such as maintaining personal hygiene, adhering to physical distancing, and using personal protective equipments. Additionally, it illuminates the confusion among public due to conflicting public health messages from different sources of information which was deemed as misleading by the participants. This research sheds light on people's perspectives and experiences that can inform population-targeted policies in the future.","output":"Perceptions and experiences of the public regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal: a qualitative study using phenomenological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Given the lack of economic evaluation study of molecular testing in Thailand, this study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of molecular testing algorithms including Xpert MTB/RIF and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (TB-LAMP) in the general population suspected of having pulmonary TB based on a societal perspective. METHODS: A hybrid decision tree Markov model using a 1-month cycle length was used to evaluate costs and outcomes of five TB diagnostic algorithms: 1) sputum smear microscopy (SSM) with culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST), 2) Xpert MTB/RIF add-on, 3) Xpert MTB/RIF initial, 4) TB-LAMP add-on, and 5) TB-LAMP initial during a lifetime period. All costs were calculated in 2021 Baht, and results were presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for molecular testing compared with SSM with culture. One-way sensitivity and probability analyses were used to evaluate uncertainty input parameters. RESULTS: TB-LAMP was less expensive overall (6565 Baht) than Xpert MTB/RIF (7010 Baht) and SSM with culture (6845 Baht). Molecular testing was projected to improve quality adjusted life year (QALY) by 0.53 to 0.94 years. In comparison to SSM with culture and DST, providing an initial TB-LAMP test was the most preferred choice. Xpert MTB/RIF Initial had the lowest ICER (197 Baht per QALY gained), followed by TB-LAMP Add-on (993 Baht per QALY gained) and Xpert MTB/RIF Add-on (3940 Baht per QALY gained). One-way sensitivity analysis uncovered that sensitivity of TB-LAMP was greater than that of other parameters. CONCLUSION: Providing molecular testing including Xpert MTB/RIF and TB-LAMP as either initial or add-on test for TB diagnosis was more cost-effective than SSM with culture and DST in the general population with suspected pulmonary TB in Thailand. Our study could provide useful evidence to policymakers advocating for inclusion of molecular testing in the universal health coverage benefit package in Thailand.","output":"Cost-Utility Analysis of Molecular Testing for Tuberculosis Diagnosis in Suspected Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Thailand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case study shows how allegories are a means to express the inexpressible and how Allegory Analysis can be a method to reveal it and bring out the subjective meaning making, life script ideology, and capability to deal with the ambivalent in critical life situations From a cultural psychological perspective, the research is based on feelings during the quasi-quarantine period of the COVID-19 pandemic The study tries to understand the coping strategies with which people deal with a psychological crisis in general concerning for the COVID-19 lockdown It discusses further ways to deal with the ambivalences and subjective meaning making arousing through such a crisis The case study analysis of Miss K not only showed her meaning making processes and attitude of life but also showed how to deal with the uncertainty during the critical lockdown period Through her allegories, she utters her current life script ideology that living nowadays means to function like a machine while being creative, self-reflective at the same time Her meaning making process counterbalanced between the voice of being delivered to withdrawal or depression versus the voice of being able to learn, connect, and relax Her coping strategy was bearing the ambivalence in a psychological crisis with faith","output":"Feelings of Quarantine: Allegories for the Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to explore the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of infant patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection.

We therefore hypothesized that increased biological age, beyond chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Using the UK Biobank England data, we tested whether a biological age estimate (PhenoAge) measured more than a decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was predictive of two COVID-19 severity outcomes (inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality with inpatient test-confirmed COVID-19). Logistic regression models were used with adjustment for age at the pandemic, sex, ethnicity, baseline assessment centers, and pre-existing diseases/conditions. RESULTS: 613 participants tested positive at inpatient settings between March 16 and April 27, 2020, 154 of whom succumbed to COVID-19. PhenoAge was associated with increased risks of inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality (ORMortality=1.63 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.43-1.86, p=4.710 -13) adjusting for demographics including age at the pandemic. Further adjustment for pre-existing disease s/conditions at baseline (ORM=1.50, 95% CI: 1.30-1.73 per 5 years, p=3.110 -8) and at the early pandemic (ORM=1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40 per 5 years, p=0.011) decreased the association. CONCLUSIONS: PhenoAge measured in 2006-2010 was associated with COVID-19 severity outcomes more than 10 years later. These associations were partly accounted for by prevalent chronic diseases proximate to COVID-19 infection. Overall, our results suggest that aging biomarkers, like PhenoAge may capture long-term vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, even before the accumulation of age-related comorbid conditions.","output":"Biological Aging Predicts Vulnerability to COVID-19 Severity in UK Biobank Participants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper offers the first empirical evidence of the impact of COVID\\\\19 on dietary diversity among children and adolescents in urban and rural families by using panel data collected in 2019 (before COVID\\\\19) and 2020 (during COVID\\\\19) in northern China.

Accordingly, polluted drinking water from physical, chemical and heavy metals can result in serious health problems, like anemia, kidney failure, immunosuppression, neurological impairments, gastrointestinal as well as respiratory irritation, skeletal system abnormalities, liver inflammation, liver cancer, cardiovascular diseases after chronic exposure and other cancer diseases with negative health effects. These diseases types remain associated to high amounts of heavy metal elements such as lead, chromium, zinc, copper, cadmium, manganese as well as nickel etc. Objectives Compare differences in water quality parameters in the study area (determine the level of pollutions in the different sites). Methodology: The investigation made use of standard analytical procedures. All sampling, conservation, transportation and analysis followed standard procedures described in APHA (2012). To prevent degradation of the organic substances, all obtained samples were transferred to the laboratory, while keeping in an icebox. Results: Result shows that during wet season, the mean values obtained for water quality parameters were significantly lower in site 9 compared with that obtained in other sites (p<0.05) with the exemptions of temperature, DO, BOD, COD, acidity, TH, TDS, K, Mg, Zn, Mn, Cd, Pb, Cu, Cr, NH3, NO2, NO3, Ni though slightly lower in most cases in site 9 were not significantly different (p>0.05) and both alkalinity and SO4 which were significantly higher in site 9 than site 1 (p<0.05). Result obtained during dry season reveals that there is no remarkable difference in pH, acidity, Pb and Ni between the nine sites (p>0.05) while other water quality parameters were significantly lower in site 9 than other sites excluding Cl and Mg which were both significantly higher in site 9 than site 8 (p<0.05).

We have used this principle as a molecular tool, and produced artificial circular RNA sponges in a cell-free system by in vitro transcription and ligation. Formerly, we were able to inhibit hepatitis C virus propagation by applying a circular RNA decoy strategy against microRNA-122, which is essential for the viral life cycle. In another proof-of-principle study, we used circular RNAs to sequester microRNA-21, an oncogenic and pro-proliferative microRNA. This strategy slowed tumor growth in a 3D cell culture model system, as well as in xenograft mice upon systemic delivery. In the wake of the global use of an in vitro transcribed RNA in Covid-19 vaccines, the question arose if therapeutic circular RNAs trigger cellular antiviral defense mechanisms when delivered systemically. In this study, we present data on the cellular innate immune response as a consequence of liposome-based transfection of the circular RNA sponges we previously used to inhibit microRNA function.

The virus has since caused a worldwide pandemic that highlights the need to quickly identify potential prophylactic or therapeutic treatments that can reduce the signs, symptoms, and/or spread of disease when dealing with a novel infectious agent. To combat this problem, we constructed a computational pipeline that uniquely combines existing tools to predict drugs and biologics that could be repurposed to combat an emerging pathogen. Methods: Our workflow analyzes RNA-sequencing data to determine differentially expressed genes, enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and dysregulated pathways in infected cells, which can then be used to identify US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs that target human proteins within these pathways. We used this pipeline to perform a meta-analysis of RNA-seq data from cells infected with three Betacoronavirus species including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; MERS), and SARS-CoV-2, as well as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus to identify therapeutics that could be used to treat COVID-19. Results: This analysis identified twelve existing drugs, most of which already have FDA-approval, that are predicted to counter the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results were cross-referenced with interventional clinical trials and other studies in the literature to identify drugs on our list that had previously been identified or used as treatments for COIVD-19 including canakinumab, anakinra, tocilizumab, sarilumab, and baricitinib.

We isolated one miRNA candidate and characterized its role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in lung macrophages. We further evaluated its functional role in ARDS model by assessing histological change, neutrophil activation, tissue permeability and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) production. We also characterized its downstream target using luciferase assay, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell inflammation assay. RESULTS: Microarray profiling revealed miR-802 was significantly downregulated in ARDS mouse model. LPS-induced miR-802 downregulation was confirmed in lung macrophages. Overexpression of miR-802 significantly suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury in vivo.

We aimed to provide robust estimates of incidence rates and relative risks of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses in patients in the 6 months following a COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we used data obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (with over 81 million patients). Our primary cohort comprised patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis; one matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with influenza, and the other matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with any respiratory tract infection including influenza in the same period. Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the control cohorts. All cohorts included patients older than 10 years who had an index event on or after Jan 20, 2020, and who were still alive on Dec 13, 2020. We estimated the incidence of 14 neurological and psychiatric outcomes in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; parkinsonism; Guillain-Barr syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders; myoneural junction and muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders (grouped and separately); substance use disorder; and insomnia. Using a Cox model, we compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory tract infections. We investigated how these estimates were affected by COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalisation, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, and encephalopathy (delirium and related disorders). We assessed the robustness of the differences in outcomes between cohorts by repeating the analysis in different scenarios. To provide benchmarking for the incidence and risk of neurological and psychiatric sequelae, we compared our primary cohort with four cohorts of patients diagnosed in the same period with additional index events: skin infection, urolithiasis, fracture of a large bone, and pulmonary embolism. FINDINGS: Among 236 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months was 3362% (95% CI 3317C3407), with 1284% (1236C1333) receiving their first such diagnosis. For patients who had been admitted to an ITU, the estimated incidence of a diagnosis was 4642% (4478C4809) and for a first diagnosis was 2579% (2350C2825). Regarding individual diagnoses of the study outcomes, the whole COVID-19 cohort had estimated incidences of 056% (050C063) for intracranial haemorrhage, 210% (197C223) for ischaemic stroke, 011% (008C014) for parkinsonism, 067% (059C075) for dementia, 1739% (1704C1774) for anxiety disorder, and 140% (130C151) for psychotic disorder, among others. In the group with ITU admission, estimated incidences were 266% (224C316) for intracranial haemorrhage, 692% (617C776) for ischaemic stroke, 026% (015C045) for parkinsonism, 174% (131C230) for dementia, 1915% (1790C2048) for anxiety disorder, and 277% (231C333) for psychotic disorder. Most diagnostic categories were more common in patients who had COVID-19 than in those who had influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 144, 95% CI 140C147, for any diagnosis; 178, 168C189, for any first diagnosis) and those who had other respiratory tract infections (116, 114C117, for any diagnosis; 132, 127C136, for any first diagnosis). As with incidences, HRs were higher in patients who had more severe COVID-19 (eg, those admitted to ITU compared with those who were not: 158, 150C167, for any diagnosis; 287, 245C335, for any first diagnosis). Results were robust to various sensitivity analyses and benchmarking against the four additional index health events. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, patients who had severe COVID-19. This information could help in service planning and identification of research priorities. Complementary study designs, including prospective cohorts, are needed to corroborate and explain these findings.

We argue that the nature of the relation changes over time, and this variation is largely driven by shocks, with a change in risk associated with each variable shifting the pattern of behaviour. We show a change in the correlation between each of the three variables with stock returns. Notably, a predominantly negative correlation with bond yields and inflation becomes positive, while the opposite is true for money supply growth. The shift begins with the bursting of the dotcom bubble but is exacerbated by the financial crisis. Results of predictive regressions for stock returns also indicate a switch in behaviour. Predominantly negative predictive power switches temporarily to positive around economic shocks. This suggests that higher yields, inflation and money growth typically depress returns but support the market during periods of stress. However, after the financial crisis, higher inflation and money growth exhibit persistent positive predictive power and suggest a change in the risk perception of higher values.","output":"The Time-Varying Relation between Stock Returns and Monetary Variables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intensivists are confronted with a broad spectrum of specific clinical problems while caring for critically ill cancer patients. These include defining proper goals of intensive care treatment, managing acute respiratory failure with diverse differential considerations, treating immunologic side-effects of ever new and innovative cancer therapies, as well as numerous clinical scenarios which may exclusively arise in cancer patients. To help clinicians handle such challenges, the initiative Intensive Care in Hematologic and Oncologic Patients (iCHOP) has been dealing with these topics for several years. Supported by several Austrian and German medical societies of intensive care medicine, hematology and oncology, the first Consensus statement for cancer patients requiring intensive care support has only recently been released. Acute respiratory failure and its management continues to be a major focus in critically ill cancer patients due to its frequency and its prognostic impact. While noninvasive oxygenation strategies were considered the gold standard of therapy, more recent high-quality data do not show clinical benefits of such techniques including high flow nasal oxygen. On the contrary, several studies revealed an unidentified etiology of an acute respiratory failure as the only potentially modifiable risk factor for adverse outcome. Consequently, evidence-based and rigorously applied diagnostic algorithms are of utmost importance in these patients.

Validation studies of WOBANN,LC/min were performed. Using a dedicated and popular noninvasive ventilation ventilator (V60, Philips), in vitro studies using PS (5 and 10 cm H2O) at various inspiratory flow rate demands were simulated with a lung model. WOBANN,LC/min was compared with the actual work of breathing, determined under conditions of no facemask leaks and estimated using an ANN (WOBANN/min). Using the same ventilator, an in vivo study of healthy adults (n = 8) receiving combinations of PS (3-10 cm H2O) and expiratory positive airway pressure was done. WOBANN,LC/min was compared with physiologic work of breathing/min (WOBPHYS/min), determined from changes in esophageal pressure and VT applied to a Campbell diagram. For the in vitro studies, WOBANN,LC/min and WOBANN/min ranged from 2.4 to 11.9 J/min and there was an excellent relationship between WOBANN,LC/breath and WOBANN/breath, r = 0.99, r(2) = 0.98 (p < 0.01). There were essentially no differences between WOBANN,LC/min and WOBANN/min. For the in vivo study, WOBANN,LC/min and WOBPHYS/min ranged from 3 to 12 J/min and there was an excellent relationship between WOBANN,LC/breath and WOBPHYS/breath, r = 0.93, r(2) = 0.86 (p < 0.01). An ANN combined with a facemask LC algorithm provides noninvasive and valid estimates of work of breathing during noninvasive PS.

Those whose postpartum health screening was performed in 2019 (March-June 2019) were considered the pre-pandemic group, and those whose screening was performed between March and June 2020 were considered the pandemic group. Adjustments were made for maternal background, pregnancy, and delivery outcomes, including a history of psychiatric disorders, complications, preterm delivery, NICU admission, and maternal postpartum complications, and the data were analyzed using a logistic regression analysis.

However, less is known about the social patterning of such advertisements. The main aim of this study was to explore the socioeconomic patterning of food and drink advertising at bus stops in Scotland's capital city, Edinburgh. DESIGN Bus stop advertisements were audited to identify food/drink adverts and classify them by food/drink category (i.e. 'advert category'). This data was then linked to area-based deprivation and proximity measures. Neighbourhood deprivation was measured using the bus stop x/y co-ordinates, which were converted to postcodes to identify the matching 2012 deprivation level via the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). Distance to schools and leisure centres were also collected using location data. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between the promotion of advert categories and deprivation and proximity to schools/leisure centres, respectively. SETTING Edinburgh city, United Kingdom. RESULTS 561 food/drink advertisements were identified across 349 bus stops, with eight advertisement categories noted and included in the final analysis, including alcohol, fast food outlets and confectionary. The majority of adverts were for 'unhealthy' food and drink categories, however there was no evidence for any socioeconomic patterning of these advertisements.

One of the most well-known, theoretically optimal, and easy to implement testing procedures is the non-adaptive Bernoulli group testing problem, where all tests are conducted in parallel, and each item is chosen to be part of any certain test independently with some fixed probability. In this setting, there is an observed gap between the number of tests above which recovery is information theoretically (IT) possible, and the number of tests required by the currently best known efficient algorithms to succeed. Often times such gaps are explained by a phase transition in the landscape of the solution space of the problem (an Overlap Gap Property phase transition). In this paper we seek to understand whether such a phenomenon takes place for Bernoulli group testing as well. Our main contributions are the following: (1) We provide first moment evidence that, perhaps surprisingly, such a phase transition does not take place throughout the regime for which recovery is IT possible.

Pulse-chase imaging revealed that newly synthesized NS5A foci are small and distinct from aged foci, while further studies using a unique dual fluorescently tagged infectious HCV chimera showed a relatively stable association of NS5A foci with core-capped LDs. These results reveal new details about the dynamics and maturation of NS5A and the nature of potential sites of convergence of HCV replication and assembly pathways.

Gene regulation is widely assumed to resolve these conflicting sex-specific selection pressures, and although there has been considerable focus on elucidating the role of gene expression level in sex-specific adaptation, other regulatory mechanisms have been overlooked. Alternative splicing enables different transcripts to be generated from the same gene, meaning that exons which have sex-specific beneficial effects can in theory be retained in the gene product, while exons with detrimental effects can be skipped. However, at present, little is known about how sex-specific selection acts on broad patterns of alternative splicing. Here we investigate alternative splicing across males and females of multiple bird species. We identify hundreds of genes that have sex-specific patterns of splicing, and establish that sex differences in splicing are correlated with phenotypic sex differences. Additionally, we find that alternatively spliced genes have evolved rapidly as a result of sex-specific selection, and suggest that sex differences in splicing offer another route to sex-specific adaptation when gene expression level changes are limited by functional constraints. Overall, our results shed light on how a diverse transcriptional framework can give rise to the evolution of phenotypic sexual dimorphism.","output":"Sex-specific selection drives the evolution of alternative splicing in birds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies demonstrate that air quality improved during the coronavirus pandemic due to the imposition of social lockdowns.

Using a difference-in-differences approach and real-time data on air quality and transportation, we estimate that anthropogenic air pollution from local sources increased during working days and decreased during non-working days during the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to a 3C7 percent increase in CO, O(3), SO(2), PM(10) and PM(2.5). We demonstrate that the increase in air pollution resulted from a shift in preferred mode of travel away from public transportation and towards personal motor vehicles during working days. In particular, metro and shared bicycle usage decreased between 8 and 18 percent, on average, while automobile and scooter use increased between 11 and 21 percent during working days. Similar COVID-19 prevention behaviors in regions or countries emerging from lockdowns could likewise result in an increase in air pollution.

The aim of this study was to describe time use in the execution of vaccine trials, to identify steps that could be accelerated to improve preparedness and planning for future emerging infectious diseases vaccine trials. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods approach to map time use and process steps that could be accelerated during vaccine trials. Trials for vaccines against infectious diseases registered in three global trial databases reported in the period 2011-2017 were eligible to join the survey. We invited sponsors to contribute data through a predefined structured questionnaire for clinical trial process metrics. Data were stratified by trial phase, disease type (i.e. emerging infectious diseases or not emerging infectious diseases), sponsor type, and continent. Qualitative interviews were conducted with purposively selected sponsors, and thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was performed. RESULTS: Based on data from 155 vaccine trials including 29,071 subjects, 52% were phase I, 23% phase II, and 25% phase III. We found that the regulatory approval, subject enrollment, study execution, and study close-out accounted for most of the cycle time of the vaccine trial process. Cycle times for the regulatory and ethical approvals, contract agreement, site initiation, and study execution were shorter in trials conducted during outbreaks. Qualitative interviews indicated that early engagement of the regulatory and independent ethical committee authorities in planning the vaccine trials was critical for saving time in trial approval. Furthermore, adapting the trial implementation to the reality of the study sites and active involvement of the local investigators during the planning of the trial and protocol writing were stated to be of paramount importance to successful completion of trials at an accelerated pace. CONCLUSION: The regulatory approval, subject recruitment, study execution, and close-out cycle times accounted for most of the vaccine trial time use and are activities that could be accelerated during a vaccine trial planning and implementation. We encourage tracking of key cycle time metrics and facilitating sharing of knowledge across industry and academia, as this may serve to reduce the time from index case detection to access of a vaccine during emerging infectious diseases epidemics.","output":"Mapping time use in clinical trials for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human pathogenic coronavirus NL63 (hCoV-NL63) is a group 1 (alpha) coronavirus commonly associated with respiratory tract infections.

Subcellular localization studies using recombinant ORF 3 protein transfected in Huh-7 cells revealed occurrence in ERGIC, Golgi- and lysosomal compartments. By fluorescence microscopy of differently tagged envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins it was shown that ORF 3 protein colocalizes extensively with E and M within the ERGIC. Using N-terminally FLAG-tagged ORF 3 protein and an antiserum specific to the C-terminus we verified the proposed topology of an extracellular N-terminus and a cytosolic C-terminus. By in-vitro translation analysis and subsequent endoglycosidase H digestion we showed that ORF 3 protein is N-glycosylated at the N-terminus. Analysis of purified viral particles revealed that ORF 3 protein is incorporated into virions and is therefore an additional structural protein. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first extensive expression analysis of a group 1 hCoV-ORF 3 protein. We give evidence that ORF 3 protein is a structural N-glycosylated and virion-incorporated protein.","output":"Human Coronavirus NL63 Open Reading Frame 3 encodes a virion-incorporated N-glycosylated membrane protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immune responses in control dogs [1 to 4 years of age, body condition score (BCS): 4 to 5 out of 9] were compared to those of aging dogs (based on breed and body size) either categorized as lean (BCS: 4 to 5 out of 9) or obese (BCS: 8 to 9 out of 9).

An ENT emergency simulation programme was-established in order to improve the skills, knowledge and confidence of the new doctors, with the course being subsequently incorporated into departmental induction for the new first-on-call-ENT-doctors. METHOD: Five FiY1 doctors attended a simulation study day, comprised of a skills and drills workshop followed by two interactive scenarios. An interactive SimMan3G-mannequin, technician utilizing a Mask-Ed?, trained confederate nurse and a video flexible laryngoscope trainer were used to provide high-fidelity simulation. Participants rated how prepared-they felt in managing the relevant condition before and after on a Likert scale (1Cstrongly disagree, 5Cstrongly agree). The session was repeated for the new nine first-on-call ENT doctors. RESULTS: Participants in the pilot session felt more prepared in managing both tracheostomy emergencies (1.2vs4.2)-and-epistaxis (2.0vs5.8). Participants in the subsequent session also felt-more-prepared in managing stridor (2.1vs4.6) -and-epistaxis-(3.1vs4.7). All-14-attendants stated that they would recommend the session to others.

DATA SOURCES We searched MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to April 23, 2020. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION We included articles reporting case-level data on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women. Course of illness, indicators of severe illness, maternal health outcomes, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from included articles. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS We identified 1,328 unique articles, and 1,253 articles were excluded by title and abstract review. We completed full-text review on 75, and 29 articles were excluded by full-text review. Among 46 publications reporting case-level data, eight described 12 cases of MERS-CoV infection, seven described 17 cases of SARS-CoV infection, and 31 described 98 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical presentation and course of illness ranged from asymptomatic to severe fatal disease, similar to the general population of patients. Severe morbidity and mortality among women with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, and laboratory evidence of vertical transmission, were reported. CONCLUSION Understanding whether pregnant women may be at risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes from severe coronavirus infections is imperative. Data from case reports of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SAR-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy are limited, but they may guide early public health actions and clinical decision-making for COVID-19 until more rigorous and systematically collected data are available.

Disease clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe multiple organ damage. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine, allowing viral replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients and viable viruses had been isolated in some of these samples. Thus, a putative role of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission has been argued. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in human excreta and further disposed in the sewerage or in the environment, in poor basic sanitation settings. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable population level approach for monitoring viral pathogens and has been successfully used in different contexts. This review summarizes the current global experience on SARS-CoV-2 WBE in distinct continents and viral detection in polluted surface water. The advantages and concerns of this strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance are discussed. Outcomes suggest that WBE is a valuable early warning alert and a helpful complementary surveillance tool to subside public health response, to tailor containment and mitigation measures and to determine target populations for testing. In poor sanitation settings, contaminated rivers could be alternatively used as a source for environmental surveillance.","output":"Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) and Viral Detection in Polluted Surface Water: A Valuable Tool for COVID-19 SurveillanceA Brief Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluate potential temperature and humidity impact on the infection rate of COVID-19 with a data up to June 10th 2020, which comprises a large geographical footprint.

The degree of severity of NPIs is found to be a good gauge of the stage of the pandemic for individual countries. Data points are classified according to the stringency index of the NPIs in order to ensure that comparisons between countries are made on equal footing. We find that temperature and relative humidity gradients do not significantly deviate from the zero-gradient hypothesis. Upper limits on the absolute value of the gradients are set.

A total of 519 fecal samples from humans (n = 99), livestock (n = 179), poultry (n = 69), and water (n = 172) were collected. Samples were cultured for viable Campylobacter spp. and multiplex PCR utilized for the identification and confirmation. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was assessed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Campylobacter spp. was detected in 67/519 (13.0%) of the total tested samples, and the household level prevalence of Campylobacter was 42.4%. The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. was: humans (10.1%), cattle (18.5%), poultry (13.0%), sheep (13.3%), goats (7.1%), and water (10.5%). Campylobacter jejuni and C. fetus were the most frequently isolated species, followed by C. coli. The majority of isolates obtained from human samples had co-occurrence with isolates from cattle, poultry or water samples from the same household. The use of stored water, the practice of indoor and outdoor manure collecting, and animal species Campylobacter positivity were significantly associated with greater odds of human Campylobacter spp. positivity. All Campylobacter isolates from humans, poultry, sheep, goats and water, and 96.0% of isolates from cattle were resistant to at least one or more of the tested antimicrobials, with 95.5% of isolates resistant to three or more classes of antimicrobials.

The prevalence of co-infection and secondary infection in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. AIMS: To investigate the role of co-infections and secondary infections in disease severity of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out between 11 January 2020 and 1 March 2020 among 408 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients in China. These patients were divided into three groups based on disease severity: mild or moderate, severe, or critically ill. Microbiological pathogens in blood, urine, and respiratory tract specimens were detected by the combination of culture, serology, polymerase chain reaction, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). RESULTS: The median age of participants was 48 years (IQR 34-60 years). Fifty-two patients (12.7%) had at least one additional pathogen, 8.1% were co-infected, and 5.1% had a secondary infection. There were 13 Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, 8 Haemophilus influenzae cases, 8 respiratory viruses, and 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae cases, primarily detected in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. Hospital-acquired infection pathogens were more common in critically ill patients. Compared to those without additional pathogens, patients with co-infections and/or secondary infections were more likely to receive antibiotics (p < 0.001) and have elevated levels of d-dimer (p = 0.0012), interleukin-6 (p = 0.0027), and procalcitonin (p = 0.0002). The performance of conventional culture was comparable with that of mNGS in diagnosis of secondary infections. CONCLUSION: Co-infections and secondary infections existed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and were relevant to the disease severity.

Our objective was to examine the impact of Government ban on the sales of antimicrobial FDCs. METHODS: The sales patterns of 14 of the 26 banned antimicrobial FDCs were analyzed using monthly private sector drug sales data from IQVIA (a comprehensive and nationally representative drug sales database) between January 2018 and December 2019. We carried out descriptive analyses to evaluate the trend in sales over time for banned and non-banned antimicrobial FDCs using cumulative sales volumes. RESULTS: Overall, the cumulative sales volume of banned antimicrobial FDCs declined by 75% between January and September 2018 and the same months of 2019, although some banned FDCs continued to be available in significant volumes. The effectiveness of the ban was offset by several pathways. First, the sales of combinations containing moieties belonging to the same drug-classes as the antimicrobials in the banned FDCs increased after the ban. Second, while certain formulations of particular combinations were banned, the sales of other non-banned formulation of these combinations increased. Third, in some cases, products containing new non-antimicrobial components added to the banned combinations remained available. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: While sales of the banned antimicrobial FDCs decreased in 2019, we identified several mechanisms that counterbalanced the ban, including implementation failure, rising sales of congeners, and products with additional non-antimicrobial components.

METHODS: We obtained weekly mortality data for all-cause and four underlying causes of death (circulatory and respiratory disease (CRD), pneumonia and influenza (P&I), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischemic heart disease (IDH)), and influenza surveillance data, from 2012 to 2018. A negative-binomial regression model was used to estimate influenza-associated EMRs in two age groups (<65 years and &#8805;65 years). RESULTS: It was estimated that an annual average of 10025 influenza-associated deaths occurred in Chongqing, corresponding to 5.2% of all deaths. The average EMR for all-cause death associated with influenza was 33.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 31.5-35.6) per 100 000 persons, and in separate cause-specific models we attributed 24.7 (95% CI: 23.3-26.0), 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-0.8), 8.5 (95% CI: 8.1-9.0) and 5.0 (95% CI: 4.7-5.3) per 100 000 persons EMRs to CRD, P&I, COPD and IDH, respectively. The estimated EMR for influenza B virus was 20.6 (95% CI: 20.3-21.0), which was significantly higher than the rates of 5.3 (95% CI: 4.5-6.1) and 7.5 (95% CI: 6.7-8.3) for A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, respectively.

Attitudes toward the body are thought to work in conjunction with other established risk factors for dietary pathology, which include body dissatisfaction, dieting, and negative effects. Negative appearance evaluation may be valuable for extending our understanding of measuring factors and potential causal relationships associated with body image and eating problems. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association between negative appearance evaluation and a combination of eating attitudes and sociocultural attitudes toward appearance and the mediating effect of negative appearance evaluation on the relationship between eating attitudes and sociocultural attitudes toward appearance. METHODS: We invited 339 Chinese adults to undergo the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26), the Fear of Negative Appearance Evaluation Scale (FNAES), and the Sociocultural Attitudes toward Appearance (SATAQ-3) scale, and used AMOS 24.0 for model construction and mediating effects testing. RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between EAT-26 scores and FNAES (p < 0.001) and SATAQ-3 scores (p < 0.001), and all dimensions except internalization general were significantly positively correlated (p < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between FNAES and SATAQ-3 scores for all dimensions (p < 0. 01). There was no significant direct effect of eating attitude on sociocultural attitude toward appearance; however, there was a significant mediating effect of fear of negative appearance evaluation. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that negative appearance evaluation fully mediates the relationship between eating attitudes and sociocultural attitudes toward appearance. An individuals attitude toward eating affects negative body perceptions and thus their perception of their own body shape.

Due to the global lockdown, work, employment, businesses and the economic climate have been severely affected. It has generated stress among people from all sections of society, especially to workers who have been assigned to cater to healthcare service or those constrained to secure daily essential items. It is widely perceived that elderly or those affected by diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases are prone to COVID-19. As per an ongoing survey, the initial data shows that the above-mentioned anxiety and stress cause insomnia, and has the considerable potential to weaken the immune system, the sole protection against the virus. OBJECTIVE This study focuses on the need of Yoga practice at work places and at home during the global lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY Literature was searched using PubMed and Google Scholar for COVID-19-related stress and anxiety at work and society due to the worldwide lockdown. The predisposing comorbidities, viral mechanism of action and treatment regimen were also searched. Yoga-based intervention studies and online programs were also searched. RESULTS As the lockdown cannot last forever and workplaces will have to be functional soon, there is an increased possibility of recurrent infection. Therefore, Yoga can provide the necessary tool for risk reduction, amelioration of stress and anxiety and strengthening of the immune function. The online platforms provide a good media for Yoga training at work places and homes. CONCLUSION Due to social distancing norms, the availability of Yoga trainers has become restricted. Yoga practice is actively sought to achieve reduced anxiety and stress so that improved sleep may positively impact immunity. As a consequence, there is a spurt in social media, catering to daily online Yoga sessions which apparently prove useful in providing accessible means to achieve mental as well as physical well-being.","output":"The role of Yoga in working from home during the COVID-19 global lockdown."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne virus causing serious infectious disease with a high case-fatality of up to 50% in severe cases.

METHODS: This retrospective study from a University tertiary care hospital in northern Italy, included hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between 25 February 2020 and 25 March 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 317 individuals were enrolled. Their median age was 71 years and 67.2% were male (213/317). The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (149/317; 47.0%), cardiovascular disease (63/317; 19.9%) and diabetes (49/317; 15.5%). Common symptoms at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis included fever (285/317; 89.9%), shortness of breath (167/317; 52.7%) and dry cough (156/317; 49.2%). An 'atypical' presentation including at least one among mental confusion, diarrhoea or nausea and vomiting was observed in 53/317 patients (16.7%). Hypokalaemia occurred in 25.8% (78/302) and 18.5% (56/303) had acute kidney injury. During hospitalization, 111/317 patients (35.0%) received non-invasive respiratory support, 65/317 (20.5%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 60/317 (18.5%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. All-cause in-hospital mortality, assessed in 275 patients, was 43.6% (120/275). On multivariable analysis, age (per-year increase OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10; p < 0.001), cardiovascular disease (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.07-6.25; p 0.03), and C-reactive protein levels (per-point increase OR 1.009; 95% CI 1.004-1.014; p 0.001) were independent risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mainly affected elderly patients with predisposing conditions and caused severe illness, frequently requiring non-invasive respiratory support or ICU admission.

DESIGN: Observational cohort SETTING: Data were analysed from 11 primary healthcare clinics in northern KZN. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 46 523 individuals made 89 476 clinic visits during the observation period. EXPOSURE OF INTEREST: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis to estimate changes in clinic visitation with a focus on transitions from the prelockdown to the level 5, 4 and 3 lockdown periods. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily clinic visitation at ambulatory clinics. In stratified analyses, we assessed visitation for the following subcategories: child health, perinatal care and family planning, HIV services, non-communicable diseases and by age and sex strata. RESULTS: We found no change in total clinic visits/clinic/day at the time of implementation of the level 5 lockdown (change from 90.3 to 84.6 mean visits/clinic/day, 95% CI ?16.5 to 3.1), or at the transitions to less stringent level 4 and 3 lockdown levels. We did detect a >50% reduction in child healthcare visits at the start of the level 5 lockdown from 11.9 to 4.7 visits/day (?7.1 visits/clinic/day, 95% CI ?8.9 to 5.3), both for children aged <1 year and 1C5 years, with a gradual return to prelockdown within 3 months after the first lockdown measure. In contrast, we found no drop in clinic visitation in adults at the start of the level 5 lockdown, or related to HIV care (from 37.5 to 45.6, 8.0 visits/clinic/day, 95% CI 2.1 to 13.8). CONCLUSIONS: In rural KZN, we identified a significant, although temporary, reduction in child healthcare visitation but general resilience of adult ambulatory care provision during the first 4 months of the lockdown. Future work should explore the impacts of the circulating epidemic on primary care provision and long-term impacts of reduced child visitation on outcomes in the region.","output":"Access to primary healthcare during lockdown measures for COVID-19 in rural South Africa: an interrupted time series analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A high level of physical fitness, especially cardiorespiratory fitness, is associated with lower incidence of hypertension. However, the relationship between flexibility, which is a component of physical fitness, and the incidence of hypertension is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between flexibility and the incidence of hypertension in a cohort study. A total of 22,972 (14,805 men and 8167 women; median age 49 years) normotensive participants were included in this study. Between April 2001 and March 2002, flexibility (standing forward bending) was measured using a standing trunk flexion meter. The participants were divided into quartiles of flexibility by sex and age group. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure &#8805; 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure &#8805; 90 mm Hg, or a self-reported history of previously diagnosed hypertension or current medication for hypertension at a health examination between April 2002 and March 2008. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the incidence of hypertension were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, exercise habits, smoking status, and drinking status. During 102,948 person years of follow-up (median 5.6 years), 4235 participants developed hypertension. Compared with the lowest flexibility (quartile 1), hazard ratios and 95% CI were 0.96 (0.88 - 1.04) for quartile 2, 0.94 (0.86 - 1.03) for quartile 3, and 0.83 (0.76 - 0.91) for quartile 4.

Recent work has shown that highly correlated ionic systems behave differently than dilute electrolyte solutions, and interest is focused upon characterizing the electrical and structural properties of the dense electrical double layers (EDLs) formed at internal interfaces. It has been a challenge for experiments to characterize the progressive development of the EDL on the nanoscale as the interfacial electric potential is varied over a range of positive and negative values. Here we address this challenge by measuring X-ray reflectivity from the interface between an ionic liquid (IL) and a dilute aqueous electrolyte solution over a range of interfacial potentials from -450 to 350 mV. The growth of alternately charged cation-rich and anion-rich layers was observed along with a polarity reversal of the layers as the potential changed sign. These data show that the structural development of an ionic multilayer-like EDL with increasing potential is similar to that suggested by phenomenological theories and MD simulations, although our data also reveal that the excess charge beyond the first ionic layer decays more rapidly than predicted.","output":"Evolution and Reversible Polarity of Multilayering at the Ionic Liquid/Water Interface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and its management are placing significant new strains on people's well-being, particularly those with pre-existing mental health conditions.

Promoting physical activity has not traditionally been the remit of psychologists. Yet psychological theory and therapeutic techniques can be readily applied to address physical inactivity. We present theoretical perspectives and therapy techniques relating to (1) beliefs about physical activity, (2) motivation to be physically active, and (3) the sense of reward achieved through being physically active. We outline strategies to initiate and maintain physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby benefitting mental and physical health. COVID-19 is demanding rapid and substantial change across the whole health care system. Psychological therapists can respond creatively by addressing physical activity, a treatable clinical target which delivers both mental and physical health benefits.

The question arises if the host genetic variation may (partly) affect the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. We postulated that the geographical variation of human polymorphisms might partly explain the variable prevalence of the infection. We investigated some candidate genes that have the potential to play a role in the immune defense against COVID-19: complement component 3 (C3), galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2), haptoglobin (Hp), vitamin D binding protein (DBP), human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1). In a univariate approach, ACE1 D/I, C3, CFTR, and HFE polymorphisms correlated significantly with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality, whereas Hp and FUT2 polymorphism did not show any significant correlations. In a multivariate analysis, only ACE1 D/I and C3 polymorphisms were determinants for COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. The other polymorphisms (CFTR, DBP, FUT2, HFE, and Hp) did not correlate with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. Whereas ACE1 D/I polymorphism shows functional links with ACE2 (which is the receptor for the virus) in COVID-19, C3 can act as a critical step in the virus-induced inflammation. Our findings plead against a bystander role of the polymorphisms as a marker for historical migrations, which comigrate with causal genes involved in COVID-19 infection.

The IL-23/IL-17A inflammatory axis appears to be a potential mechanism for development of iSGS. Additionally, as anticipated in an inflammatory milieu, PD-1/PD-L1 expression is upregulated. If the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is important in SGS pathogenesis, then it may represent a potential target for immunotherapeutic inhibition, given its success in cancer treatment. In terms of surgical management, prospective studies show that endoscopic approaches have more frequent recurrence compared to open techniques. SUMMARY: SGS arises from various etiologies, and further understanding of its pathogenesis can aid in the development of novel therapies. It is imperative to obtain a thorough history for each patient presenting with respiratory complaints, as misdiagnosis can delay proper treatment. Endoscopic and open surgical techniques continue to be investigated in a growing number of prospective clinical trials to determine optimal treatment protocols.

Scarce and low-quality public health facilities are common problems in these communities. Costs and prevalence of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) have also been reported as high in studies conducted in slums in developing countries and those suffering from chronic conditions and the poorest households seem to be more vulnerable to financial hardship. The COVID-19 pandemic may be aggravating the economic impact on the extremely vulnerable population living in slums due to the long-term consequences of the disease. The objective of this review is to report the economic impact of seeking healthcare on slum-dwellers in terms of costs and CHE. We will compare the economic impact on slum-dwellers with other city residents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review adopts the framework suggested by Arksey and OMalley. The review is part of the accountability and responsiveness of slum-dwellers (ARISE) research consortium, which aims to enhance accountability to improve the health and well-being of marginalised populations living in slums in India, Bangladesh, Sierra Leone and Kenya. Costs of accessing healthcare will be updated to 2020 prices using the inflation rates reported by the International Monetary Fund. Costs will be presented in International Dollars by using purchase power parity. The prevalence of CHE will also be reported.

A significant correlation between the C alleles of insulator rs4364254 and rs4426765 and CMV seropositivity was found in healthy donors and patients with hematological malignancies. The risk of developing acute GVHD after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was identified only in CMV-seropositive patients. A significant correlation between the enhancer rs4693608 and insulator rs28649799 and CD34(+) cell mobilization was demonstrated in the CMV-seropositive donors.

It is used to facilitate artificial insemination and helps to maintain genetic diversity by utilizing storage in cryobanks. Boar sperm are extremely sensitive to the conditions present during cryopreservation. Glycerol is the most used permeable cryoprotectant, showing both protective activity and some level of sperm toxicity. To improve the insemination rates, it is necessary to develop new cryoprotective agents. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the effect of the highly biocompatible, non-toxic polysaccharides dextran and pentaisomaltose on the cryopreservation of boar sperm. Additionally, we used computational modeling for the prediction of their cryoprotective action through interaction with selected sperm surface proteins. Our results show a lower impact of cryopreservation on sperm qualitative parameters when the extender is modified by pentaisomaltose. This approach represents a promising option for the complete removal of toxic glycerol in cryopreservation. ABSTRACT: The long-term storage of boar sperm presents an ongoing challenge, and the modification of the cryoprotective compounds in semen extenders is crucial for improving cryopreservations success rate. The aim of our study was to reduce the percentage of glycerol in the extender by elimination or substitution with biocompatible, non-toxic polysaccharides. For boar semen extender improvement, we tested a novel modification with the polysaccharides dextran and pentaisomaltose in combination with unique in silico predictive modeling. We targeted the analysis of in vitro qualitative sperm parameters such as motility, viability, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, and DNA integrity. Non-penetrating polysaccharide-based cryoprotective agents interact with sperm surface proteins such as spermadhesins, which are recognized as fertility markers of boar sperm quality. The in silico docking study showed a moderate binding affinity of dextran and pentaisomaltose toward one specific spermadhesin known as AWN, which is located in the sperm plasma membrane. Pentaisomaltose formed a hydrophobic pocket for the AWN protein, and the higher energy of this proteinCligand complex compared with dextran was calculated. In addition, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis for the molecular dynamics (MD) of both polysaccharides and AWN simulation suggests their interaction was highly stable. The in silico results were supported by in vitro experiments. In the experimental groups where glycerol was partially or entirely substituted, the use of pentaisomaltose resulted in improved sperm mitochondrial activity and DNA integrity after thawing when compared with dextran. In this paper, we demonstrate that pentaisomaltose, previously used for cryopreservation in hematopoietic stem cells, represents a promising compound for the elimination or reduction of glycerol in extenders for boar semen cryopreservation. This novel approach, using in silico computer prediction and in vitro testing, represents a promising technique to help identify new cryoprotectants for use in animal breeding or genetic resource programs.","output":"Boar Sperm Cryopreservation Improvement Using Semen Extender Modification by Dextran and Pentaisomaltose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prediction of the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak and the corresponding needs of the health care system (COVID-19 patients' admissions, the number of critically ill patients, need for intensive care units, etc.) is based on the combination of a limited growth model (Verhulst model) and a short-term predictive model that allows predictions to be made for the following day. In both cases, the uncertainty analysis of the prediction is performed, i.e., the set of equivalent models that adjust the historical data with the same accuracy. This set of models provides the posterior distribution of the parameters of the predictive model that adjusts the historical series. It can be extrapolated to the same analyzed time series (e.g., the number of infected individuals per day) or to another time series of interest to which it is correlated and used, e.g., to predict the number of patients admitted to urgent care units, the number of critically ill patients, or the total number of admissions, which are directly related to health needs. These models can be regionalized, that is, the predictions can be made at the local level if data are disaggregated. We show that the Verhulst and the Gompertz models provide similar results and can be also used to monitor and predict new outbreaks.

The COVID- 19 pandemic that hit Austria in 2020 led to several lockdown events such as closing of bars, clubs, hotels and the order to stay at home. The current study was designed to elucidate the influence of these measures in order to curtail the pandemic on the number of N. gonorrhoeae diagnosed and their respective resistance patterns. Methods Retrospective data of patients positive for N. gonorrhoeae and resistances to ceftriaxone, cefixime, azithromycin and penicillin were compared using data from 2019 and 2020 collected in and sent to the Outpatients Centre for Infectious Venero-dermatological Diseases in Vienna. Resistance testing was carried out by means of the Etest?;MIC values were interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. Results Numbers of patients tested positive for N. gonorrhoeae declined dramatically from 639 in 2019 to 381 in 2020. The most prominent reduction was during the first lockdown (March to May 2020), with half as many gonococcal infections compared to this period in 2019. The second lockdown (November/December 2020) did not result in significantly lower numbers of gonococcal infected patients. In both years, no ceftriaxone-resistant isolate was detected. However, 2.3% of isolates from women showed borderline susceptibility (MIC = 0.094 and 0.125mg/ml), compared to 0.4% of isolates from men. During the two years of evaluation, cefixime and azithromycin resistant strains decreased (4% to 0% and 19% to 7%, respectively), while penicillin-resistant strains increased from 9% to 20%. Conclusion The first lockdown resulted in a decrease of 62.7% of infected individuals. A remarkable decrease of resistant gonococcal strains to azithromycin and no resistance to cefixime occurred in 2020. This is in contrast to an increase of resistances until 2019.

The incidence and outcome of these infections are determined by the degree of immaturity of the neonatal immune system, invasive procedures involved, the aetiological agent and its antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and, above all, infection control policies practised by the unit. It is important to raise awareness of infection control practices in resource-limited settings, since overdependence upon antimicrobial agents and co-existing lack of awareness of infection control is encouraging the emergence of multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. We reviewed 125 articles regarding HAIs from both advanced and resource-limited neonatal units in order to study risk factors, aetiological agents, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and reported successes in infection control interventions. The articles include surveillance studies, outbreaks and sporadic incidents. Gram-positive cocci, viruses and fungi predominate in reports from the advanced units, while Gram-negative enteric rods, non-fermenters and fungi are commonly reported from resource-limited settings. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from surveillance studies determined the empirical therapy used in each neonatal unit. Most outbreaks, irrespective of the technical facilities available, were traced to specific lack of infection control practices. We discuss infection control interventions, with special emphasis on their applicability in resource-limited settings.

An online survey with international members of the general health economics and outcomes research community was also conducted to gather opinions on key concepts. RESULTS: Based on the themes emerging from the interviews and online questionnaire, the HAT includes questions prompting investigators to consider the following constructs: similarity of the clinical condition in the health utility study and the CUA; similarity of health utility study participant demographics and the demographics of the CUA's target population; similarity of the health state descriptions in the health utility study and the CUA; and the method of assigning utility weights. Considerations of transparency prompted additional items, including: means by which the health utility study was identified; type of respondents; study design; and measure used to collect health utility estimates.

Interested patients received a prescription for DMPA-SC and a telehealth appointment with a clinic provider to learn self-injection. We recorded patient interest in DMPA-SC, completed appointments, and completed first injections. We conducted initial outreach in May, 2020 and recorded appointment attendance and completed injections through August, 2020. RESULTS: Of 90 eligible patients (age 17-54), we successfully contacted and discussed DMPA-SC with 70 (78%). Twenty-six (37%) patients expressed interest in DMPA-SC and scheduled telehealth appointments to learn to self-administer the medication. Fifteen (58%) of those interested (21% of the total) successfully self-injected DMPA-SC.

The biosynthesis of S and M was analyzed in the presence of tunicamycin and monensin. The effect of treatment with endoglycosidases H and F and glycopeptidase F on the precursors and mature forms of S and M were also examined. Species 175K and 29K were characterized as high mannose forms of S and M, respectively, and species 220K and 30C36K as complex type glycosylated forms of these two proteins. M was present mainly as a 29K species in mature virions whereas the 175K form of S was not detected, thus implying that the two proteins undergo Golgi modifications at a far different efficiency. Anti-S and -M monoclonal antibodies were examined for their reactivity towards polypeptide species either treated with endo H or produced in the presence of tunicamycin. It was found that (i) among the four major antigenic sites previously defined (Delmas et al., 1986), only site C (amino acids 363 to 371) was notably expressed by the unglycosylated S polypeptide 155K, whereas the three other sites were dependent upon core-glycosylation, (ii) three of the four anti-M mAbs tested did not recognize the unglycosylated M polypeptide 26K. These data led us to conclude that co-translational, but not terminal glycosylation is an essential requirement for both acquisition and maintenance of the antigenicity of TGEV glycoproteins.","output":"Carbohydrate-induced conformational changes strongly modulate the antigenicity of coronavirus TGEV glycoproteins S and M"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the definitive diagnosis of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is mainly made by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), some PCR-negative cases are diagnosed typically by a computed tomography (CT) scan's radiology.

In laboratory results, eosinophil count was 2,850/mm(3) and total Ig was 768 IU/mL. However, when the laboratory values and the radiological findings were combined with the patients history, COVID-19 was excluded and the chronic eosinophilic pneumonia was accepted as a diagnosis.

We describe the epidemiological and laboratory data from one of the first such outbreaks in Ontario to assess factors associated with its severity, and the impact of progressive interventions for infection control over the course of the outbreak. METHODS: We obtained line list and outbreak data from the public health unit to describe resident and staff cases, severity and distribution of cases over time and within the outbreak facility. Where available, we obtained data on laboratory specimens from the Public Health Ontario Laboratory and performed whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral specimens from the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 65 residents of the long-term care home, 61 (94%) contracted SARS-CoV-2, with a case fatality rate of 45% (28/61). Among 67 initial staff, 34 (51%) contracted the virus and none died. When the outbreak was declared, 12 staff, 2 visitors and 9 residents had symptoms. Resident cases were located in 3 of 4 areas of the home. Phylogenetic analysis showed tight clustering of cases, with only 1 additional strain of genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 identified from a staff case in the third week of the outbreak. No cases were identified among 26 new staff brought into the home after full outbreak measures were implemented. INTERPRETATION: Rapid and undetected viral spread in a long-term care home led to high rates of infection among residents and staff. Progressive implementation of outbreak measures after the peak of cases prevented subsequent staff cases and are now part of long-term care outbreak policy in Ontario.","output":"Investigation of a severe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care home early in the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) associated fungal infections including pulmonary aspergillosis, mucormycosis and other invasive fungal infections have been increasingly described in the current pandemic.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that compared management strategies for complications of intradermal BCG vaccination were included. RESULTS Of 1338 individual articles, 15 met inclusion criteria. Six RCTs, 4 prospective and 4 retrospective cohort studies compared management in 1022 children with BCG-associated lymphadenitis. For nonsuppurative lymphadenitis, no antimicrobial was found to significantly impact on time to resolution or prevention of suppuration. For suppurative lymphadenitis, there was some evidence that needle aspiration shortens time to resolution and prevents sinus tract formation.

This is an enormous opportunity for real-estate operators to innovate and address the demand in this growing market. However, investments in this area are fraught with risk. Seniors often have more health issues, and Covid-19 has exposed just how vulnerable they are -- especially those living in close proximity. Conventionally, most services for seniors are \\"high-touch\\", requiring close physical contact with trained caregivers. Not only are trained caregivers short in supply, but the pandemic has made it evident that conventional high-touch approaches to senior care are high-cost and greater risk. There are not enough caregivers to meet the needs of this emerging demographic, and even fewer who want to undertake the additional training and risk of working in a senior facility, especially given the current pandemic. In this article, we rethink the design of senior living facilities to mitigate the risks and costs using automation. With AI-enabled pervasive automation, we claim there is an opportunity, if not an urgency, to go from high-touch to almost \\"no touch\\" while dramatically reducing risk and cost.

This, along with emerging research and clinical findings, supported broader uptake of HCQ as a potential treatment for COVID-19 globally at the beginning of the pandemics. Therefore, many COVID-19 patients have been or will be exposed to HCQ, including specific populations with underlying intrinsic and/or extrinsic characteristics that may affect the disposition and drug actions of HCQ. It is critical to update our PBPK model of HCQ with adequate drug absorption and disposition mechanisms to support optimal dosing of HCQ in these specific populations. We conducted relevant in vitro and in vivo experiments to support HCQ PBPK model update. Different aspects of this model are validated using PK study from 11 published references. With parameterization informed by results from monkeys, a permeability-limited lung model is employed to describe HCQ distribution in the lung tissues. The updated model is applied to optimize HCQ dosing regimens for specific populations, including those taking concomitant medications. In order to meet predefined HCQ exposure target, HCQ dose may need to be reduced in young children, elderly subjects with organ impairment and/or coadministration with a strong CYP2C8/CYP2D6/CYP3A4 inhibitor, and be increased in pregnant women.

Few studies have investigated these associations among African American women. METHODS To assess the relation of aspirin use to risk of breast cancer in African American women, we conducted a prospective analysis within the Black Women's Health Study, an ongoing nationwide cohort study of 59,000 African American women. On baseline and follow-up questionnaires, women reported regular use of aspirin (defined as use at least 3 days per week) and years of use. During follow-up from 1995 through 2017, 1919 invasive breast cancers occurred, including 1112 ER+, 569 ER-, and 284 triple-negative (TN) tumors. We used age-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of aspirin use with risk of ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer, adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors. RESULTS Overall, the HR for current regular use of aspirin relative to non-use was 0.92 (95% CI 0.81, 1.04). For ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer, corresponding HRs were 0.98 (0.84, 1.15), 0.81 (0.64, 1.04), and 0.70 (0.49, 0.99), respectively.

Our study aims to evaluate the correlation between LU and radiographic imaging in PC patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This observational, prospective and multicentre study was carried out with patients from a PC health area whose tests for COVID-19 and suspected pneumonia had been positive and who then underwent LU and a digital tomosynthesis (DT). Four PC physicians obtained data regarding the patients symptoms, examination, medical history and ultrasound data for 12 lung fields: the total amount of B lines (zero to four per field), the irregularity of the pleural line, subpleural consolidation, lung consolidation and pleural effusion. These data were subsequently correlated with the presence of pneumonia by means of DT, the need for hospital admission and a consultation in the hospital emergency department in the following 15 days. RESULTS: The study was carried out between November 2020 and January 2021 with 70 patients (40 of whom had pneumonia, confirmed by means of DT). Those with pneumonia were older, had a higher proportion of arterial hypertension and lower oxygen saturation (sO(2)). The number of B lines was higher in patients with pneumonia (16.53 vs. 4.3, p < 0.001). The area under the curve for LU was 0.87 (95% CI 0.78C0.96, p < 0.001), and when establishing a cut-off point of six B lines or more, the sensitivity was 0.875 (95% CI 0.77C0.98, p < 0.05), the specificity was 0.833 (95% CI 0.692C0.975, p < 0.05), the positive-likelihood ratio was 5.25 (95% CI 2.34C11.79, p < 0.05) and the negative-likelihood ratio was 0.15 (95% CI 0.07C0.34, p < 0.05). An age of  55 and a higher number of B lines were associated with admission. Patients who required admission (n = 7) met at least one of the following criteria:  55 years of age, sO(2)  95%, presence of at least one subpleural consolidation or  21 B lines. CONCLUSIONS: LU has great sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in PC.

Here, we introduce our laparoscopic technique and present the associated perioperative outcomes relative to an open approach. METHODS From April 2014 to November 2017, 26 patients underwent central bisectionectomy or right anterior sectionectomy. A total of 17 patients underwent the laparoscopic approach and nine underwent an open approach. We used a perihilar Glissonian approach to determine each anatomical resection plane and employed a rubber band self-retraction technique to ensure proper exposure of the two resection planes. Detailed descriptions, illustrations, video, and perioperative outcomes of the approach are presented. RESULTS Among patients who underwent the laparoscopic approach, there were no cases of conversion to open surgery. The mean operative times for the laparoscopic and open groups were similar (333  76 vs. 305  62 min, respectively, p = 0.345). Intraoperative blood loss (535  443 vs. 966  650, p = 0.056) and postoperative complications (1 vs. 3, p = 0.065) were slightly less in the laparoscopic group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Surgical margins of both approaches were comparable (0.8  0.6 vs. 0.7  0.2 cm, p = 0.671). The length of hospital stay after surgery was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (8.8  2.6 vs. 17.1  12.7 days, p = 0.015).

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter cohort study, including 22 ICUs in Japan. Adult patients (aged 16 years) with newly suspected infection from December 2017 to May 2018 were included. We compared baseline patient characteristics and outcomes among three frailty groups based on the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score: fit (score, 1C3), vulnerable (score, 4), and frail (score, 5C9). We conducted subgroup analysis of patients with sepsis defined as per Sepsis-3 criteria. We also produced KaplanCMeier survival curves for 90-day survival. RESULTS: We enrolled 650 patients with suspected infection, including 599 (92.2%) patients with sepsis. Patients with a median CFS score of 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 3C5) were included: 337 (51.8%) were fit, 109 (16.8%) were vulnerable, and 204 (31.4%) were frail. The median patient age was 72 years (IQR 60C81). The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores for fit, vulnerable, and frail patients were 7 (IQR 4C10), 8 (IQR 5C11), and 7 (IQR 5C10), respectively (p = 0.59).

Physical exam was only positive for absent breath sounds over the right lung base. Chest X-Ray and CT Thorax were performed with findings of a large-right sided pleural effusion. Thoracentesis performed revealed transudative fluid with a high glucose level compared to serum. CT Peritoneography done showed findings of the presence of a right-sided pleuroperitoneal fistula with a diaphragmatic defect. The patient was then transitioned temporarily to hemodialysis.The pathophysiology of the PD leaks is mainly due to congenital or acquired diaphragmatic defects, disorders of lymphatic drainage, or high pleuroperitoneal pressure gradients. It has been postulated that during the PD treatment, increased intraabdominal pressure can tear the previously intact collagen fibers or worsen a congenital diaphragmatic defect, which promotes the translocation of dialysate into the pleural space. A positive pleural/serum fluid glucose measurement ratio is very highly sensitive & specific for PD leak thus referred to as sweet hydrothorax. First step to management is the discontinuation of PD. The removal of the pressure gradient between the peritoneum and pleura leads to conservative healing of the diaphragmatic defect.

Strong and weak TMS was delivered via single- and paired- (3-ms and 100-ms inter-stimulus interval) pulses on the same day and different days. All stimuli were delivered during isometric contractions of the knee extensors at 20% of maximal voluntary force. Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) were assessed in quadriceps femoris muscles. Relative (intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) and absolute (standard error of measurement, SEM) reliability and variability (coefficient of variation) were assessed. MEPs elicited by strong and weak single-pulse TMS had excellent relative reliability in all muscles as did weak short-interval and strong long-interval paired-pulse TMS (all ICC>0.75). Conversely, relative reliability of strong short-interval and weak long-interval paired-pulse TMS was lower (ICC: 0.34-0.83 and 0.22-0.97, respectively). MEP size variability was lower (P<0.05) and SEM comparable or lower in strong compared to weak TMS conditions. These results suggest single- and paired-pulse TMS at both strong and weak intensities are generally reliable in the knee extensors. Strong (or both strong and weak) single-pulse TMS is recommended.

However, whether a limited FTP functions similarly in younger and older adults, and whether inter-individual differences in socioemotional functioning are similarly associated with preference for positive information (i.e., positivity) is still not clear. We investigated younger (20C35 years, N = 73) and older (60C75 years, N = 56) adults gaze preferences on pairs of happy, angry, sad, and neutral faces using an eye-tracking system. We additionally assessed several parameters potentially underlying inter-individual differences in emotion processing such as FTP, stress, cognitive functioning, social support, emotion regulation, and well-being. While we found no age-related differences in positivity when the entire trial duration was considered, older adults showed longer fixations on the more positive face in later stages of processing (i.e., positivity shifts). This allocation of resources toward more positive stimuli might serve an emotion regulatory purpose and seems consistent with the SST. However, our findings suggest that age moderates the relationship between FTP and positivity shifts, such that the relationship between FTP and positivity preferences was negative in older, and positive in younger adults, potentially stemming from an age-related differential meaning of the FTP construct across age. Furthermore, our exploratory analyses showed that along with the age and FTP interaction, lower levels of worry also played a significant role in positivity shifts. We conclude that positivity effects cannot be solely explained by aging, or the associated reduced FTP per se, but is rather determined by a complex interplay of psychosocial and emotional features.","output":"Positivity in Younger and in Older Age: Associations With Future Time Perspective and Socioemotional Functioning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine manufacturers from developing countries have a proven track record of developing, producing, and supplying high-quality vaccines globally.

Currently, no effective vaccines are available for pathogens with a highly variable antigenic load, such as the human immunodeficiency virus or to induce cellular T-cell immunity in the fight against cancer. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has reinforced the relevance of designing smart therapeutic vaccine modalities to ensure public health.

Many pathogens are covered by a dense glycan-coat, which form an attractive target for vaccine development. Moreover, many tumor types are characterized by altered glycosylation profiles that are known as \\"tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens\\". Unfortunately, glycans do not provoke a vigorous immune response and generally serve as T-cell-independent antigens, not eliciting protective immunoglobulin G responses nor inducing immunological memory. A close and continuous crosstalk between glycochemists and glycoimmunologists is essential for the successful development of efficient immune modulators. It is clear that this is a key point for the discovery of novel approaches, which could significantly improve our understanding of the immune system.

The purpose of our research is to study the features of the course of a COVID-19 people living with HIV (PLHIV). Methods & Materials We conducted a retrospective analysis of the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data of 121 patients with HIV infection treated for COVID-19 in 2020. Among PLHIVS, 87.6% were treated with antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection an average of 5.8 years. Results It was found that 45.5% were women and 54.5% were men. The average age was 41 years old (IQR: 20-78 years). The greatest number of cases was observed among both men and women in the age category of 30-49 years (74.2% and 72.7%, respectively). In the studied group, in 63.4%, in addition to HIV infection, patients suffered from other concomitant diseases, the most frequent of which were chronic lung diseases (22.3%), hypertension (18.2%), metabolic disorders (13.2%). In all cases, the COVID-19 disease occurred with a clinical manifestation. The most common symptoms were fever (76.0%), cough (63.6%) and sore throat (56.2%), loss of taste and smell was detected in 49.6% of cases. In 48.8%, COVID-19 in PLHIV was mild. In 88.1%, the duration of the disease did not exceed 14 days. Moderate forms were noted in 40.5% of cases. 10.7% of cases have severe form of COVID-19. The fatal outcomes were recorded in 8 patients, while in the group of patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, the mortality rate was 3.8%, and in the group without antiretroviral therapy therapy - 26.7%.

Patients were organized thereafter in two subgroups, mild illness patients discharged home and inpatients who had moderate to severe illness. Results from RT-PCR tests were then correlated with results from the evaluation of the immune response.

It is unclear whether the donor-derived virome in the transplanted lung influences recipient virome dynamics in other body compartments and if so, to which degree. Likewise, it is unknown whether dependencies exist among virus populations that mutually shape viral loads and kinetics. RESULTS: To address these questions, we characterized viral communities in airways and plasma of 49 LTRs and analyzed their abundance patterns in a data modeling approach. We found distinct viral clusters that were specific for body compartments and displayed independent dynamics. These clusters robustly gathered specific viral species across the patient cohort. In the lung, viral cluster abundance associated with time after transplantation and we detected mutual exclusion of viral species within the same human host. In plasma, viral cluster dynamics were associated with the indication for transplantation lacking significant short-time changes. Interestingly, pathogenic viruses in the plasma co-occurred specifically with Alpha torque virus genogroup 4 and Gamma torque virus strains suggesting shared functional or ecological requirements. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the detailed analysis of virome dynamics after lung transplantation revealed host, body compartment, and time-specific dependency patterns among viruses. Furthermore, our results suggested genetic adaptation to the host microenvironment at the level of the virome and support the hypothesis of functional complementarity between Anellovirus groups and other persistent viruses.

To make the architecture more efficient, a distributed topology control algorithm is also proposed for UAVs. The algorithm is based on virtual spring forces and movement prediction technique that periodically updates the UAV topology to adapt to the movement of the ground-based LoRa nodes that move on the surface.

Incorporation of vaccine into patches significantly enhanced its thermostability compared to the liquid form.

A low priming dose of vaccine, by the IM route, but more so using DMN patches, induced the most efficacious immune responses, assessed by parasite growth inhibitory activity (GIA) assays. Administration of low dose AdHu5CPfRH5 using patches to the skin, boosted by high dose IM, induced the highest antigen-specific serum IgG response after boosting, the greatest skewing of the antibody response towards the antigen and away from the vector, and the highest efficacy. This study therefore demonstrates that repeated use of the same adenovirus vaccine can be highly immunogenic towards the transgene if a low dose is used to prime the response.

The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to evaluate the variation in ASR. Besides, estimates of age-sex specific prevalence, decomposition analysis for incident cases, and correlation analysis of the EAPC were conducted in our study. RESULTS: Globally, the ASR of lung cancer prevalence, incidence and YLDs in 2019 were 38.84/100,000 persons, 27.66/100,000 persons, and 6.62/100,000 persons, respectively. Over the past 30 years, the ASR of incidence (EAPC = -0.09) decreased, although that of prevalence (EAPC = 0.51) and YLDs (EAPC = 0.03) increased. The global prevalence counts was greater in males than females at all age groups and increased with age, peaking in the 65C69 age group for both sexes.

PARTICIPANTS: 2466 adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection over a 45-day period with at least 47 days of in-hospital observation. MEASUREMENTS: Body mass index (BMI), admission biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), cardiac injury (troponin level), and fibrinolysis (D-dimer level). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: Over a median hospital length of stay of 7 days (interquartile range, 3 to 14) days, 533 patients (22%) were intubated, 627 (25%) died, and 59 (2%) remained hospitalized. Compared with overweight patients, patients with obesity had higher risk for intubation or death, with the highest risk among those with class 3 obesity (hazard ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1 to 2.1]).

We included 45 patients with a mean (SD) age of 54 (13) years, and 73% were male. Ninety-one percent of coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors fit diagnostic criteria for postintensive care syndrome. 86.7 % had impairments in the physical domain, 22 (48%) reported impairments in the psychiatric domain, and four (8%) had impairments on cognitive screening. We found that 58% had some degree of mobility impairment. In the psychiatric domain, 38% exhibited at least mild depression, and 18 % moderate to severe depression. Eighteen percent presented Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, scores suggestive of posttraumatic stress syndrome diagnosis. In the Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 9% had impaired cognition. Conclusions: Survivors of critical illness related to coronavirus disease 2019 are at high risk of developing postintensive care syndrome. These findings highlight the importance of planning for appropriate post-ICU care to diagnose and treat this population.","output":"Postintensive Care Syndrome in Survivors of Critical Illness Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019: Cohort Study From a New York City Critical Care Recovery Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To better understand burnout and its development, researchers have shown an increasing interest in recent years in identifying different profiles of burnout and its development process. However, there have been few longitudinal studies on the profile and development of teacher burnout. This study used a person-centred approach to explore the profiles of teacher burnout, transition probabilities and the associations between these aspects and resource factors. Data were collected from 3743 primary school teachers in a two-wave longitudinal test over three years. The results showed that teacher burnout exhibited six relatively stable profiles across the whole study population and that the transition of individual profiles over time followed a certain probability. Psychological capital and professional identity were important resource factors in reducing the occurrence of teacher burnout and increasing transition probability toward burnout symptom alleviation over time, while positive coping played an important role in reducing the occurrence of teacher ineffectiveness. Therefore, the results indicated that the overall teacher burnout profile was stable, a discovery which has important implications for conducting group interventions to benefit more teachers, while the individual burnout profile exhibited a latent transition probability over time. Interventions employing different resource factors can be adopted to alleviate the symptoms of different burnout profiles.","output":"The Development of Teacher Burnout and the Effects of Resource Factors: A Latent Transition Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Meat products represent a core aspect of the US food supply chain and faced multiple disruptions in the COVID-19 pandemic. Available data are often aggregated or lagged in availability, thus limiting insights into consumer behavior. Using household-level data from continuous consumer tracking in the Meat Demand Monitor project, we extend understanding of consumer behavior during the pandemic. This provides a timely example of the improved insights that follow from refined and ongoing data collection to generate valuable information. ABSTRACT: Meat products represent a significant share of US consumer food expenditures. The COVID-19 pandemic directly impacted both demand and supply of US beef and pork products for a prolonged period, resulting in a myriad of economic impacts. The complex disruptions create significant challenges in isolating and inferring consumer-demand changes from lagged secondary data. Thus, we turn to novel household-level data from a continuous consumer tracking survey, the Meat Demand Monitor, launched in February 2020, just before the US pandemic. We find diverse impacts across US households related to hoarding behavior and financial confidence over the course of the pandemic. Combined, these insights extend our understanding of pandemic impacts on US consumers and provide a timely example of knowledge enabled by ongoing and targeted household-level data collection and analysis.","output":"Meat Demand Monitor during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using Richardson and Davidson's model and the sciences of pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacopsychology, this article reviewed the: (1) poor life expectancy associated with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), which may be improved in patients who adhere to clozapine; (2) findings that clozapine is the best treatment for TRS (according to efficacy, effectiveness and well-being); and (3) potential for clozapine to cause vulnerabilities, including potentially lethal adverse drug reactions such as agranulocytosis, pneumonia, and myocarditis. Rational use requires: (1) modification of the clozapine package insert worldwide to include lower doses for Asians and to avoid the lethality associated with pneumonia, (2) the use of clozapine levels for personalizing dosing, and (3) the use of slow and personalized titration. This may make clozapine as safe as possible and contribute to increased life expectancy and well-being. In the absence of data on COVID-19 in clozapine patients, clozapine possibly impairs immunological mechanisms and may increase pneumonia risk in infected patients. Psychiatrists should call their clozapine patients and families and explain to them that if the patient develops fever or flu-like symptoms, the psychiatrist should be called and should consider halving the clozapine dose. If the patient is hospitalized with pneumonia, the treating physician needs to assess for symptoms of clozapine intoxication since halving the dose may not be enough for all patients; consider decreasing it to one-third or even stopping it.

METHODS: : Retrospective cohort of 326 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through April 19, 2020. Sociodemographic and hospital course data were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS: : Compared with non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), Hispanics were younger (53 years, median age) and had higher rates of Medicaid and less commercial/HMO/PPO coverage (p<0.001). Similarly, in the age sub-grouped multivariate analysis for outcomes, Hispanics 65-year-old were 2.66 times more likely to be admitted to ICU (95% CI: 1.07-6.61; p=0.03), and 3.67 times more likely to get intubated (95% CI: 1.29-10.36; p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: : Hospitalized Hispanic patients of 65-year-old with COVID-19 were more likely to have higher risk of more severe outcomes (ICU admission and intubation) compared with NHW.

Diagnostic methods based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) have been developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 rapidly. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CRISPR for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies published before August 2021 were retrieved from four databases, using the keywords SARS-CoV-2 and CRISPR. Data were collected from these publications, and the sensitivity, specificity, negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted for analysis with MetaDiSc 1.4. The Stata 15.0 software was used to draw Deeks funnel plots to evaluate publication bias. RESULTS: We performed a pooled analysis of 38 independent studies shown in 30 publications. The reference standard was reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The results indicated that the sensitivity of CRISPR-based methods for diagnosis was 0.94 (95% CI 0.93C0.95), the specificity was 0.98 (95% CI 0.97C0.99), the PLR was 34.03 (95% CI 20.81C55.66), the NLR was 0.08 (95% CI 0.06C0.10), and the DOR was 575.74 (95% CI 382.36C866.95).

However, there are limited prospectively-collected data on assay performance, and minimal clinical information to guide interpretation of discrepant results. METHODS: Over a two-week period, 1080 consecutive plasma samples submitted for clinical SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing were tested in parallel for anti-nucleocapsid IgG (anti-N, Abbott) and anti-spike IgG (anti-S1, EUROIMMUN). Chart review was conducted for samples testing positive or borderline on either assay, and for an age/sex-matched cohort of samples negative by both assays. CDC surveillance case definitions were used to determine clinical sensitivity/specificity and conduct receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. RESULTS: There were 52 samples positive by both methods, 2 positive for anti-N only, 34 positive for anti-S1 only, and 27 borderline for anti-S1. Of the 34 individuals positive for anti-S1 alone, 8 (24%) had confirmed COVID-19. No anti-S1 borderline cases were positive for anti-N or had confirmed/probable COVID-19. The anti-N assay was less sensitive (84.2% [95% CI 72.1-92.5%] versus 94.7% [95% CI 85.4-98.9%]) but more specific (99.2% [95% CI 95.5-100%] versus 86.9% [95% CI 79.6-92.3%]) than anti-S1. Abbott anti-N sensitivity could be improved to 96.5% with minimal effect on specificity if the index threshold was lowered from 1.4 to 0.6. CONCLUSION: Real-world concordance between different serologic assays may be lower than previously described in retrospective studies.

There are concerns that SARS-CoV2 infection has a significant independent association with acute ischemic stroke, even in the absence of conventional cerebrovascular risk factors. Whether elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers have predictive value in the occurrence of stroke in SARS-CoV2 is poorly understood. AIM: : To profile the characteristics of SARS-CoV2 positive patients with ischemic stroke (COVID-Stroke) and to identify the significance of elevated IBMs in the prediction of ischemic COVID-stroke. METHODS: : Clinical characteristics, stroke risk factors, laboratory parameters- including levels of inflammatory biomarkers, and outcome of SARS-CoV2 patients with stroke (n=60) were collected. SARS-CoV2 RT- PCR positive age, gender, and pulmonary severity matched non-stroke patients were taken as controls (n=60). Binary multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of ischemic COVID-stroke. RESULTS: : D-dimer >441.8ng/mL, LDH> 395U/L, ESR >19mm/hour and CRP>0.2mg/dL were independently found to be very strong predictors of occurrence of ischemic COVID-stroke (p<0.001 for each). On multivariate analysis, D-dimer >441.8ng/mL, ESR >19mm/hour, and RDW>16.1% were found to be the most strong predictors of the occurrence of ischemic COVID-stroke. Conventional CVD risk factors- higher age (>60years), presence of diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were not found to be significant predictors in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: : In SARS-CoV2 patients, D-dimer elevated beyond 441.8ng/mL, ESR greater than 19mm/hour, and RDW widened more than 16.1% were the strongest predictors of the occurrence of ischemic stroke.

Objective To design and evaluate a molecular diagnostic tool for detection and identification of all currently recognized and potentially future emergent CoVs from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Study design and Results We designed a semi-nested, reverse transcription RT-PCR assay based upon 38 published genome sequences of human and animal CoVs. We evaluated this assay with 14 human and animal CoVs and 11 other non-CoV respiratory viruses. Through sequencing the assay's target amplicon, the assay correctly identified each of the CoVs; no cross-reactivity with the 11 common respiratory viruses was observed. The limits of detection ranged from 4 to 4  102 copies/reaction, depending on the CoV species tested.

Gene co-expression network analyses identified a module related to the mTOR pathway that was up-regulated in BPD and also enriched for markers of endothelial cells. We also found a down-regulated co-expression module enriched for genes involved in mTOR signalling and in mTOR related pathways and enriched with neuronal markers. The mTOR related modules were also replicated in the independent cohort of samples. To investigate whether the expression of the modules related to mTOR signalling pathway could be differentially regulated in different cell types we performed comparative network analyses in experimental models. We found both up-regulated modules in the PFC significantly overlapped with an up-regulated module in the brain endothelial cells from mice treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and mTOR related pathways such as JAK-STAT, PI3K-Akt and ribosome were enriched in the common genes. In addition, the down-regulated module in the PFC significantly overlapped with a down-regulated module from neurons treated with the mTOR inhibitor, Torin1 and mTOR signalling, autophagy, and synaptic vesicle cycles were significantly enriched in the common genes. These results suggest that co-expression networks related to mTOR signalling pathways may be up- or down-regulated in different cell types in the PFC of BPD. These results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of BPD.","output":"Differential expression of gene co-expression networks related to the mTOR signaling pathway in bipolar disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Quantitative characterisation of any contagious diseases could help in making effective strategy to prevent further spreading of the disease. Despite the rapid research in prevention of spreading COVID-19, yet there is no quantitatively information about spatiotemporal epidemiology and epidemic intensity of COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to quantitatively characterize spatiotemporal epidemiology and epidemic intensity of COVID-19 in Indian geography by determine its infectability rate, efficacy rate, transmission rate and likelihood of total populations to be infected with COVID-19 in India. Method: Novel statistical model was designed to quantitatively characterize spatiotemporal epidemiology and epidemic intensity of COVID-19. A Retrospective Cohort study was carried out online and offline in Indian geography using a COVID-19 transmission questionnaires sheet that comprises five mandatory questions. The collected offline as well as online data was then entered into a Microsoft excel sheet to obtain primary data and secondary data required for the mathematical model to calculate quantitative data of spatiotemporal epidemiology and epidemic intensity of COVID-19 in India geography. Result: and Discussion: Total 539 responses were analysed in the current study out of 557 received responses between April-2021 to May-2021. Average reproductive number of secondary cases was found 0.77. Infectability rate of COIVD-19 patient was found 38.11% while healthy person has 21.08% risk of becoming infected if they expose to the Primary case. J-Index and H-Index were found 55.32% and 4.44%, respectively, indicating that COVID-19 disease outbreaks as severe epidemic disease in India and has potential to infect ~4.44% Indian population. Conclusion: Higher infectability rate (38.11%) of COIVD-19 patient and higher efficacy rate (21.08%) of healthy individual to be infected with COVID-19 outbreak it a severe epidemic in India.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 25-minute online survey was distributed worldwide through social media from 5/21/2020 to 7/1/2020. MEASUREMENTS: Participants reported sociodemographic/economic information, the impact of the pandemic on major life domains, insomnia and depressive symptoms, and changes in sleep midpoint, time-in-bed, total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and nightmare and nap frequency from prior to during the pandemic. Sleep pattern changes were subjected to latent profile analysis. The identified profiles were compared to one another on all aforementioned factors using probit regression analyses. RESULTS: The sample of 991 participants (ages: 18-80 years; 72.5% women; 60.3% residing outside of the United States) reported significantly delayed sleep midpoint, reductions in TST and SE, and increases in nightmares and naps. Over half reported significant insomnia symptoms, and almost two-thirds reported significant depressive symptoms. Latent profile analysis revealed 4 sleep pattern change profiles that were significantly differentiated by pre-pandemic sleep patterns, gender, and various COVID-19-related impacts on daily living such as severity of change in routines, and family stress and discord.

The function of nsP3 has been more difficult to pin down and it has long been referred to as the more enigmatic of the nsPs. The protein comprises three domains, an N-terminal macro domain, a central zinc-binding domain and a C-terminal hypervariable domain (HVD). In this article, we review old and new literature about the functions of the three domains. Much progress in recent years has contributed to a picture of nsP3, particularly through its HVD as a hub for interactions with host cell molecules, with multiple effects on the biology of the host cell at early points in infection. These and many future discoveries will provide targets for anti-viral therapies as well as strategies for modification of vectors for vaccine and oncolytic interventions.","output":"The Enigmatic Alphavirus Non-Structural Protein 3 (nsP3) Revealing Its Secrets at Last"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of maternal antiepileptic drug (AED) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of cognitive adverse effects among the offspring. As new-generation AEDs continue to enter the market, evidence on their safety during pregnancy is limited yet necessary. To date, there are no published reviews summarizing the evidence of new-generation AED exposure in utero and the development of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring. The objective of this scoping review is to summarize the available evidence on the risk of ADHD after maternal exposure to new-generation AEDs during pregnancy. We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE for articles published from January 1988 to April 2020. New-generation AEDs were considered if marketed after 1988. ADHD was defined as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, hyperkinetic disorder, hyperkinesis, or conduct disorder. Of the total articles screened (n = 805), eight publications were finally included (seven cohort studies and one systematic review). Across the studies, the sample size of pregnant women exposed to AEDs ranged from 1 to 1383. Monotherapy was examined in six studies (mostly lamotrigine), while only two studies examined polytherapy. The included studies reported a range of adjusted relative risks, from 0.84 [0.59-1.19] to 1.63 [0.41-6.06]. Lamotrigine monotherapy holds the largest body of evidence, concluding that no significant risk of ADHD exists among the offspring. However, the available evidence is considered scarce and has several methodological limitations. Disentangling the effect of AEDs from epilepsy itself and examining polytherapies are challenges that merit additional investigations. Further comparative safety studies with longer follow-up periods and large sample sizes are needed to accurately quantify the true impact of new-generation AED exposure during pregnancy and ADHD in children.","output":"New-generation antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and the risk of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global threat to human health.

The pandemic has created challenges for acute stroke care. Rapid assessment and time-sensitive interventions required for optimum outcomes in acute stroke care have been complicated by COVID-19 due to the need for disease transmission preventive measures. The purpose of this article is to explore the putative mechanisms of ischemic stroke in COVID-19 and the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients who develop ischemic stroke.

Most affluent countries have seen substantial increases in the incidence and costs of non-communicable diseases. The interest in social models for health has led to the growth in use of social prescribing and psychological therapies. At the same time, there has been growth in application of a variety of nature-based and mindCbody interventions (NBIs and MBIs) aimed at improving health and longevity. We assess four NBI/MBI programmes (woodland therapy, therapeutic horticulture, ecotherapy/green care, and tai chi) on life satisfaction/happiness and costs of use of public services. These interventions produce rises in life satisfaction/happiness of 1.00 pts to 7.29 (n = 644; p < 0.001) (for courses or participation >50 h). These increases are greater than many positive life events (e.g., marriage or a new child); few countries or cities see +1 pt increases over a decade. The net present economic benefits per person from reduced public service use are 830C31,520 (after 1 year) and 6450C11,980 (after 10 years).

Machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used as a potential solution for predicting mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. So, our study aimed to compare several ML algorithms to predict the COVID-19 mortality using the patients data at the first time of admission and choose the best performing algorithm as a predictive tool for decision-making. METHODS: In this study, after feature selection, based on the confirmed predictors, information about 1500 eligible patients (1386 survivors and 144 deaths) obtained from the registry of Ayatollah Taleghani Hospital, Abadan city, Iran, was extracted. Afterwards, several ML algorithms were trained to predict COVID-19 mortality. Finally, to assess the models performance, the metrics derived from the confusion matrix were calculated. RESULTS: The study participants were 1500 patients; the number of men was found to be higher than that of women (836 vs. 664) and the median age was 57.25 years old (interquartile 18C100). After performing the feature selection, out of 38 features, dyspnea, ICU admission, and oxygen therapy were found as the top three predictors. Smoking, alanine aminotransferase, and platelet count were found to be the three lowest predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Experimental results demonstrated that random forest (RF) had better performance than other ML algorithms with accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 95.03%, 90.70%, 94.23%, 95.10%, and 99.02%, respectively. CONCLUSION: It was found that ML enables a reasonable level of accuracy in predicting the COVID-19 mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 761 patients with cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. RESULTS: 198 patients were diagnosed during the first pandemic time period (TP1; February 2020-mid September 2020), 494 during TP2 before the vaccination campaign (TP2/pre-vaccination; mid September 2020-21 February 2021) and 69 in TP2/post-vaccination (22 February 2021-15 May 2021). TP2 vs TP1 patients were younger (p=0.004), showed more frequently a good performance status (p<0.001) and <2 comorbidities (p=0.002), were more likely to be on active anticancer therapy (p=0.006). Significantly fewer patients in TP2 (3-4%) vs TP1 (22%) had an in-hospital potential source of infection (p<0.001). TP2 patients were more frequently asymptomatic (p=0.003). Significantly fewer patients from TP2 were hospitalized (76% TP1, 38% TP2/pre-vaccination, 42% TP2/post-vaccination, p<0.001) or admitted to intensive care unit (5% TP1, 1% TP2/pre-vaccination, 0% TP2/post-vaccination, p=0.006). All-cause mortality significantly decreased from 30.3% in TP1, to 8.9% and 8.7% in the two TP2 periods (p<0.001), reflected by a significant reduction in Sars-Cov-2-related mortality (15.2%, 7.5% and 5.8% in the three consecutive time periods, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in clinical characteristics and features of Sars-Cov-2 infection between TP1 and TP2 reflect the effects of protective measures and increased testing capacity. The lower mortality in TP2 is in line with a less frail population. However, the vast majority of death events in TP2 were related to COVID-19, reinforcing the priority to protect cancer patients.","output":"Clinical profile and mortality of Sars-Cov-2 infection in cancer patients across two pandemic time periods (Feb 2020-Sep 2020; Sep2020- May 2021) in the Veneto Oncology Network: the ROVID study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report on the study of both perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) at an oxide/ferromagnetic metal (FM) interface, i.e., BaTiO_{3} (BTO)/CoFeB.

We have studied mRNA expression of representative EBV lytic genes by RT-PCR in nasopharynx biopsies obtained from NPC and control individuals. In both NPC and control biopsies, EBV lytic genes BZLF1, BALF2 and BCLF1 were detected readily. However, BRLF1 was detected in NPC biopsies only.

IgG antibodies directed against Rta were detected in 44 of 53 NPC plasma samples (83.0%), but only in 1 of 53 control samples (1.9%). Furthermore, the antibody binding regions were found in the C-terminal two-thirds of Rta. This serological result confirms indirectly that BRLF1 is specifically expressed in NPC tumour cells.

We used matched multivariate logistic regression to compare cases with controls for poverty status using household income, household assets and relative wealth within the village. We conducted follow-up interviews of patients 10-12 months later to assess economic effects by collecting data on treatment costs, income losses, coping strategies and treatment completion. RESULTS Poverty is strongly associated with TB incidence even after controlling for smoking and other risk factors. Excluding income losses, direct out-of-pocket treatment costs (medical and non-medical) accounted for 55.5% of average annual household income, and most TB cases fell into heavy debt. The DOTS cure rate was 91%. When DOTS was incomplete or not done, mortality was high. CONCLUSIONS Poverty is both a cause and a devastating outcome of TB. Ongoing poverty reduction schemes in China must also include reducing TB.","output":"Poverty and the economic effects of TB in rural China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Soon, it has spread out across the world and become an ongoing pandemic. In Bangladesh, the first case of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected on March 8, 2020. Since then, not many significant studies have been conducted to understand the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. In this study, we estimated the basic reproduction number R 0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. Methods: The data of daily confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh and the reported values of generation time of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for Singapore and Tianjin, China, were collected. We calculated the basic reproduction number R0 by applying the exponential growth (EG) method. Epidemic data of the first 76 days and different values of generation time were used for the calculation. Results: The basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is estimated to be 2.66 [95% CI: 2.58-2.75], optimized R0 is 2.78 [95% CI: 2.69-2.88] using generation time 5.20 with a standard deviation of 1.72 for Singapore. Using generation time 3.95 with a standard deviation of 1.51 for Tianjin, China, R0 is estimated to be 2.15 [95% CI: 2.09-2.20], optimized R0 is 2.22 [95% CI: 2.16-2.29]. Conclusions: The calculated basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is significantly higher than 1, which indicates its high transmissibility and contagiousness.","output":"Estimation of the Basic Reproduction Number of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh Using Exponential Growth Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract In his 20 years in power, Vladimir Putin has employed a savvy use of social policy to bolster his popularity, but it is a set of policies not well designed to address Russia's chronic under-provision of healthcare, education, and other social servicesparticularly in rural areas.

International liver societies recommend surveillance with biannual abdominal ultrasound (US) for patients with cirrhosis of any etiology because of their high risk of developing HCC. This strategy is considered cost-effective, as surveillance requires an articulated and costly set of interventions, including linkage to care of patients with an early detected tumor. However, as transition to HCC is increasingly being observed in noncirrhotic patients, the majority of which does not reach the threshold of cost effectiveness for screening. The European and Japanese liver societies elected to confine recommendations for HCC screening to noncirrhotic patients with advanced fibrosis due to hepatitis C or hepatitis B only. These latter recommendations, however, are challenged by the increasing number of patients with viral hepatitis in whom HCC risk has been attenuated but not eradicated by successful antiviral therapy. In this set of patients, entry criteria of surveillance need to be refined in the light of the suboptimal diagnostic accuracy of non invasive tests that are employed to identify the ideal candidates for surveillance.","output":"Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced liver fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination prevents cervical, head and neck, and anogenital cancers. However, global HPV vaccine coverage falls short of global targets and has seen unexpected and dramatic declines in some countries. This paper synthesizes the impact of HPV on the global burden of cancer and the potential benefit of HPV vaccination. Approximately 5% of the worlds cancers are specifically attributed to HPV. While the greatest global burden of HPV is cervical cancers in low- and middle-income countries, HPV-associated head and neck cancers are increasing in high-income countries and have surpassed cervical cancer as the primary HPV-associated cancer in some countries. Therefore, it is also critical to improve gender-neutral HPV vaccination. Understanding the modifiable drivers of vaccine acceptance and uptake is important for increasing HPV vaccination. The Behavioural and Social Drivers of Vaccination framework is broadly applied to identify key factors associated with HPV vaccination including domains concerning practical issues, motivation, social processes, and thinking and feeling. Among the behavioural strategies available to reduce the incidence and mortality of cancer, increasing HPV vaccination stands out as having unrealized potential to prevent disease, financial cost, and psychological distress. An understanding of the shifting burden of HPV and the factors associated with vaccination can be leveraged to regularly measure these factors, develop interventions to promote vaccine uptake, and improve global HPV vaccine coverage. Future research in diverse contexts is necessary to investigate the barriers and facilitators of global HPV vaccination.","output":"HPV Vaccination: An Underused Strategy for the Prevention of Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this research work is to solve multiple object tracking problems in a given frame, wherein the proposed model intends to identify and track various objects The problem has been solved in three stages viz detecting, identifying, and tracking the object in a particular zone, i e , but it is observed that something more could be done in this field, mostly the MOT-A score was not up to the mark;hence the proposed research work utilized Kalman filters for obtaining enhanced results and compared the obtained MOT-A metric with previous works, and the results were good Object detection and recognition occur via the YOLO algorithm, which enables us to classify the objects into 80 classes Then, Motion Prediction and feature generation occur in which an estimation model is created, and Kalman filters are used to model these states for capturing moving objects in the frame Finally, tracking takes place with Kalman filters in the previous frame, and newly detected objects are placed in the current frame, after which an association is made for new detection All this is done via the DeepSORT algorithm, which is essentially a Deep association metric with the SORT algorithm Here, Kalman filters are used as they improved the accuracy of the proposed model and yielded better results On the same lines, YOLO is used to perform object detection and recognition at the same time It is also a detector, which by applying a single neural network, it can predict the bounding boxes and perform multi-class classification This problem can have various applications, especially in traffic management It can also prevent people from gathering during COVID times and raising an alert for all the authorities Hence, this is a multidisciplinary approach wherein the work of object detection is being used in various fields like crowd assembling, Surveillance, Animal management in Zoo/Biodiversity parks as well as in the case of traffic systems as well The real motivation behind this work was using the state-of-the-art technology to solve the modern-day problems Manually human vigilance in large areas is a utopian task and especially when surveillance and security is big threat out there Adding to it is the COVID Pandemic which has claimed millions of lives and yet vaccination is a still a dream yet to be realized Hence, cluster identification problem is considered and also the ways to solve this challenge using the state-of-the-art technology Once it has been achieved, it is initiated further to find more applications of this technology in various other domains and found out how it is applied in various use cases in case of crowd gathering at a single point and how this is a similar problem in case of animal gathering at a point and how forest rangers can solve the problem in a more efficient way ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Object tracking and counting in a zone using YOLOv4, DeepSORT and TensorFlow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The annual IEEE 5-Minute Video Clip Contest (5-MICC) was launched in 2020 by the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS), and the selected topic for the competition at IEEE ICIP 2021 was Automatic Medical Image Diagnosis.

There is controversy whether smaller particles may transport Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Smaller particles, referred to as fine particulate matter (2.5 m in diameter), can remain airborne for longer periods than larger particles and after inhalation will penetrate deeply into the lungs. Little is known about the size distribution and location of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a hospital setting. Methods: As a measure of hospitalrelated exposure, air samples of three particle sizes (&gt;10.0 m, 10.0-2.5 m, and 2.5 m) were collected at Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System from April to May 2020 (N=90 size-fractionated samples) using a custom-built cascade impactor. Locations included outside negative-pressure COVID-19 wards, a hospital ward not directly involved in COVID-19 patient care, and the emergency department. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in 9% of samples and in all size fractions at concentrations of 5 to 51 copies m-3. Locations outside COVID-19 wards had the fewest positive samples. A non-COVID-19 ward had the highest number of positive samples, likely reflecting staff congregation. Among all locations, the probability of a positive sample was positively associated (r=0.95, p&lt;0.01) with the number of COVID-19 patients in the hospital, which reflected (r=0.99, p&lt;0.01) the number of new daily cases of COVID-19 in Massachusetts. Conclusions: More frequent detection of positive samples in non-COVID-19 wards than outside COVID-19 hospital areas indicates effectiveness of COVID-ward hospital controls in controlling air concentrations and suggests the potential for disease spread in areas without the strictest precautions. The positive associations noted between the probability of a positive sample, COVID-19 cases in the hospital, and cases in Massachusetts suggests that hospital air sample positivity was related to community burden. The finding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples of fine particulate matter supports the possibility of airborne transmission over distances greater than six feet. The findings support guidelines that limit exposure to airborne particles including fine particles capable of longer distance transport and greater lung penetration.","output":"Characterization of airborne sars-cov-2 in a veterans affairs medical center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic created sudden changes in many areas of daily life and increased uncertainty about the future.

The results of the first study, conducted at the outbreak of the pandemic, indicated that individuals with high levels of attachment anxiety experienced more negative emotions and fewer positive emotions at that time, and that IOU and perceived social support mediated these associations. The results of the second study, conducted several months into the pandemic, indicated an association between attachment anxiety and avoidance, and perceived stress during the time of the pandemic. Results of Study 2 also indicated that IOU mediated the association between attachment anxiety and stress, and that sense of coherence (SOC) mediated the association between attachment anxiety and avoidance, and stress.

METHODS: We enrolled 174 patients with DKD from three centres from January 2010 to July 2017. The severity and extent of arteriosclerosis were analysed on sections based on dual immunohistochemical staining of CD31 and &#945;-smooth muscle actin. An X-tile plot was used to determine the optimal cut-off value. The primary endpoint was renal survival (RS), defined as the duration from renal biopsy to end-stage renal disease or death. RESULTS: The baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 135 qualified patients was 45 (29 ~ 70) ml/min per 1.73 m2, and the average 24-h urine protein was 4.52 (2.45 ~ 7.66) g/24 h. The number of glomeruli in the biopsy specimens was 21.07  9.7. The proportion of severe arteriosclerosis in the kidney positively correlated with the Renal Pathology Society glomerular classification (r = 0.28, P < 0.012), interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) (r = 0.39, P < 0.001), urine protein (r = 0.213, P = 0.013), systolic BP (r = 0.305, P = 0.000), and age (r = 0.220, P = 0.010) and significantly negatively correlated with baseline eGFR (r = - 0.285, P = 0.001). In the multivariable model, the primary outcomes were significantly correlated with glomerular class (HR: 1.72, CI: 1.15 ~ 2.57), IFTA (HR: 1.96, CI: 1.26 ~ 3.06) and the modified arteriosclerosis score (HR: 2.21, CI: 1.18 ~ 4.13). After risk adjustment, RS was independently associated with the baseline eGFR (HR: 0.97, CI: 0.96 ~ 0.98), urine proteinuria (HR: 1.10, CI: 1.04 ~ 1.17) and the modified arteriosclerosis score (HR: 2.01, CI: 1.10 ~ 3.67), and the nomogram exhibited good calibration and acceptable discrimination (C-index = 0.82, CI: 0.75 ~ 0.87).

In this paper, we explore the use of 3D printing in mass customization (MC) programs. We consider the case when 3D printing brings extra self-design fun to consumers, which is highlighted in MC practices of the auto company BMW and the furniture company Poltrona Frau, and also changes the cost formula (i.e., the marginal product variety cost) of the MC product. In addition, the roles played by the risk attitudes of the MC manufacturer and consumers, consumer returns, as well as consumers time sensitive behaviors, are also uncovered. We find that under the case with a low consumer's willingness to pay for the traditional ready-made product variety enjoyment (RPVE), even the maximized product variety level and the additional self-design fun cannot make the 3D printing based MC more profitable. In addition, compared to the markets with risk-averse and risk-neutral consumers, the 3D printing based MC can increase more MRBs and a higher consumer surplus by simultaneously highlighting the high self-design fun and the high RPVE in a market with risk-seeking consumers. The high flexibility and responsiveness of 3D printing also shows its advantages in remanufacturing the consumer returned MC items and enhancing MC programs overall lead-time. Finally, applying 3D printing in creating molds can also help the MC manufacturer tackle demand uncertainties. These findings all provide a good reference to the application of 3D printing in MC operations.","output":"Self-design Fun: Should 3D Printing be Employed in Mass Customization Operations?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: First-line therapy for treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma includes combination platinum-based chemotherapies, though resistance and long-term toxicity concerns to these regimens cause limitations in progression-free survival and overall survival. Maintenance treatment with an alternative agent such as the PD-L1 inhibitor, avelumab (Bavencio(?)), after initial chemotherapy has been shown to prolong overall survival. The aim of this review is to provide a landscape clinical use of avelumab in the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma with a focus on patient selection and outcomes. METHODS: This review includes the most up to date phases and results from clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: Three studies were included, one phase 1B trial, one phase 1B trial with 2 year follow-up, and one phase 3 trial. Patients receiving avelumab maintenance therapy at 10 mg/kg IV every two weeks had an overall better performance status, though those with an increased ECOG-PS, increased Bellmunt risk score, or failure of 3 chemotherapies had poorer responses. Patients over the age of 65 had a higher ORR (18C25%) compared to younger patients (13C14%). Patients with PD-L1 positive tumors had a significantly increased CR median ORR (13.8%), median PFS (5.7 months), and median 12-month OS rate (79.1%) compared to control subjects receiving best supportive care (1.2%, 2.1 months, 60.4%, respectively). TRAEs were seen in 86.7% of patients, with 32.4% of patients experiencing a grade 3 AE. The most common AE was IRR (32.4%, grade 3 1.01%) and irAE 25.6% of any grade, including various rashes and pruritus AEs, immune-related thyroid disorders, and immune related hepatitis. There were 3 reported treatment-related deaths (0.05%). Ongoing phases of one of the trials is investigating the use of docetaxel and avelumab together after failure of one chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Avelumab as a maintenance therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy failure or in platinum-ineligible patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma is an effective option with increased ORR, PFS, and OS with a similar safety profile to other chemotherapies. Ongoing studies currently in recruitment and active clinical trials will yield valuable insights into optimizing avelumab therapy in conjunction with chemotherapies and/or immunotherapies, better characterization of response for PD-L1 positive tumors, and a clearer insight into clinically validated prognostic factors to improve patient outcomes.","output":"Clinical Evaluation of Avelumab in the Treatment of Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma: Focus on Patient Selection and Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Classification accuracy achieved by a machine learning technique depends on the feature set used in the learning process. However, it is often found that all the features extracted by some means for a particular task do not contribute to the classification process.

We thus developed a novel artificial intelligence system based on deep learning (DL) and federated learning (FL) for the diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of a patients clinical course. METHODS: CT imaging derived from 6 different multicenter cohorts were used for stepwise diagnostic algorithm to diagnose COVID-19, with or without clinical data. Patients with more than 3 consecutive CT images were trained for the monitoring algorithm. FL has been applied for decentralized refinement of independently built DL models. RESULTS: A total of 1,552,988 CT slices from 4804 patients were used. The model can diagnose COVID-19 based on CT alone with the AUC being 0.98 (95% CI 0.97C0.99), and outperforms the radiologists assessment. We have also successfully tested the incorporation of the DL diagnostic model with the FL framework. Its auto-segmentation analyses co-related well with those by radiologists and achieved a high Dices coefficient of 0.77. It can produce a predictive curve of a patients clinical course if serial CT assessments are available. INTERPRETATION: The system has high consistency in diagnosing COVID-19 based on CT, with or without clinical data. Alternatively, it can be implemented on a FL platform, which would potentially encourage the data sharing in the future. It also can produce an objective predictive curve of a patients clinical course for visualization. KEY POINTS: ? CoviDet could diagnose COVID-19 based on chest CT with high consistency; this outperformed the radiologists assessment. Its auto-segmentation analyses co-related well with those by radiologists and could potentially monitor and predict a patients clinical course if serial CT assessments are available. It can be integrated into the federated learning framework. ? CoviDet can be used as an adjunct to aid clinicians with the CT diagnosis of COVID-19 and can potentially be used for disease monitoring; federated learning can potentially open opportunities for global collaboration.

The use of Onyx for the treatment of S-AVFs is not well established at this time. We discuss three cases of traumatic S-AVFs treated successfully with Onyx embolization alone or in association with coils. METHODS The database of patients treated at the Baptist Cardiac and Vascular Institute, Miami, Florida, was reviewed. All patients with traumatic S-AVFs treated with Onyx were included. RESULTS Two men and one woman with progressive enlarging pulsatile mass with bruit or tinnitus had angiographic evidence of S-AVF and were treated. In two patients the S-AVFs were secondary to hair transplantation. They were treated with Onyx-18 embolization as the single treatment modality. One patient with S-AVF resulting from temporomandibular joint arthroscopy was treated with coils and subsequent Onyx-34 embolization. In one patient, transarterial microcatheterization and injection of Onyx-18 was performed. In another patient, the intra-arterial approach was prevented by arterial vessel tortuosity. Therefore, access to the fistula was obtained through direct puncture of a large frontal vein; contrast injection confirmed the positioning of the needle within the draining vein of the AVF and Onyx-18 was then injected while the outflow vein was compressed. In the third patient in this series, coils were deployed to allow safer and more controlled injection of Onyx-34. No procedure related complications were noted. Post-embolization angiography demonstrated successful and complete occlusion of the AVF immediately after treatment. Follow-up revealed complete resolution of the symptoms.

Asthma does not appear to increase risk for hospitalization or mortality with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to see if atopy actually protected those hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective chart review on all patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 over 2 months at a major adult and pediatric tertiary referral center hospital. Charts were evaluated for history of atopic disease, as were the need for ICU admission, requirement for supplemental oxygen and/or intubation, and in hospital mortality. RESULTS: No significant differences in outcomes for patients (n = 275) based on atopic disease were noted: ICU admission, 43% versus 44.7% (atopic versus no atopic disease, respectively; p = 0.84); supplemental oxygen use, 79.1% versus 73.6% (p = 0.36); intubation rate, 35.8% versus 36.5% (p = 0.92); and mortality rate, 13.4% versus 20.7% (p = 0.19).

Case report A 90-year-old man presented with severe unilateral pneumonia, and despite conventional mechanical ventilation management with use of a single lumen endotracheal tube and high positive endo-expiratory pressure (PEEP), oxygenation and hemodynamics deteriorated. We then performed ILV using a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) and two ventilators, each set at a different respiratory mode. With continuous administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent, the ventilator for the left lung (non-affected lung) was set to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode, whereas the ventilator for the right lung (affected lung) was set to bi-level mode, 1 breath/min, and high PEEP. ILV and the high PEEP applied to the affected lung prevented hyperinflation of the non-affected lung and increased pulmonary blood perfusion on the non-affected side. Thus, ILV immediately improved oxygenation and hemodynamics by correcting ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Discussion Although ECMO is a valid treatment option for patients with severe respiratory failure, it is highly invasive intervention. ILV performed with use of a DLT is less invasive and more useful than ECMO. Thus, ILV should be kept in mind as a treatment option, especially in cases of refractory respiratory failure and circulatory failure in which the pathophysiology of the left and right lungs differs markedly.","output":"Independent lung ventilation with use of a double-lumen endotracheal tube for refractory hypoxemia and shock complicating severe unilateral pneumonia: A case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forero-Pe?a et al. 1 described immediate and long-term neuropsychiatric complications following the Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and discussed the possible roles of (hydroxy)chloroquine and dexamethasone on these neuropsychiatric symptoms However, arrhythmia may also contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 Patients and should not be neglected.

Focusing on the harm COVID-19 poses for human health and society, this study used system dynamics to establish a prevention and control model that combines material supply, public opinion dissemination, public awareness, scientific and technological research, staggered work shifts, and the warning effect (of law/policy). Causal loop analysis was used to identify interactions between subsystems and explore the key factors affecting social benefit. Further, different scenarios were dynamically simulated to explore optimal combination modes. The main findings were as follows: (1) The low supervision mode will produce a lag effect and superimposed effect on material supply and impede social benefit. (2) The strong supervision mode has multiple performances; it can reduce online public opinion dissemination and the rate of concealment and false declaration and improve government credibility and social benefit. However, a fading effect will appear in the middle and late periods, and over time, the effect of strong supervision will gradually weaken (but occasionally rebound) and thus require adjustment.

We have previously reported the Aneurysm Recanalization Stratification Scale, which uses accessible predictors including aneurysm-specific factors (size, rupture, and intraluminal thrombosis) and treatment-related features (treatment modality and immediate angiographic result) to predict retreatment risk after endovascular therapy. OBJECTIVE To assess the external validity of the Aneurysm Recanalization Stratification Scale. METHODS External validity was assessed in independent cohorts from 4 centers in the United States and Canada where endovascular and open neurovascular procedures are performed, and in a multicenter cohort of 1543 patients. Probability of retreatment stratified by risk score was derived for each center and the combined multicenter cohort. RESULTS Despite moderate variability in retreatment rate among centers (29.5%, 9.9%, 9.6%, 26.3%, 19.7%, and 18.3%), the Aneurysm Recanalization Stratification Scale demonstrated good predictive value with C-statistics of 0.799, 0.943, 0.780, 0.695, 0.755, and 0.719 for each center and the combined cohort, respectively.

However, little is known about the clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with active COVID-19 after in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). AIM: We aimed to characterize outcomes from IHCA in patients with COVID-19 and to identify patient- and hospital-level variables associated with 30-day survival. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study across 11 academic medical centres in the U.S. Adult patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation and/or defibrillation for IHCA between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 who had a documented positive test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 were included. The primary outcome was 30-day survival after IHCA. RESULTS: There were 260 IHCAs among COVID-19 patients during the study period. The median age was 69 years (interquartile range 60-77), 71.5% were male, 49.6% were White, 16.9% were Black, and 16.2% were Hispanic. The most common presenting rhythms were pulseless electrical activity (45.0%) and asystole (44.6%). ROSC occurred in 58 patients (22.3%), 31 (11.9%) survived to hospital discharge, and 32 (12.3%) survived to 30 days. Rates of ROSC and 30-day survival in the two hospitals with the highest volume of IHCA over the study period compared to the remaining hospitals were considerably lower (10.8% vs. 64.3% and 5.9% vs. 35.7% respectively, pa?<a?0.001 for both).

In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework, named CogMol (Controlled Generation of Molecules), for designing new drug-like small molecules targeting novel viral proteins with high affinity and off-target selectivity. CogMol combines adaptive pre-training of a molecular SMILES Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and an efficient multi-attribute controlled sampling scheme that uses guidance from attribute predictors trained on latent features. To generate novel and optimal drug-like molecules for unseen viral targets, CogMol leverages a protein-molecule binding affinity predictor that is trained using SMILES VAE embeddings and protein sequence embeddings learned unsupervised from a large corpus. CogMol framework is applied to three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins: main protease, receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, and non-structural protein 9 replicase. The generated candidates are novel at both molecular and chemical scaffold levels when compared to the training data. CogMol also includes insilico screening for assessing toxicity of parent molecules and their metabolites with a multi-task toxicity classifier, synthetic feasibility with a chemical retrosynthesis predictor, and target structure binding with docking simulations. Docking reveals favorable binding of generated molecules to the target protein structure, where 87-95 % of high affinity molecules showed docking free energy < -6 kcal/mol. When compared to approved drugs, the majority of designed compounds show low parent molecule and metabolite toxicity and high synthetic feasibility. In summary, CogMol handles multi-constraint design of synthesizable, low-toxic, drug-like molecules with high target specificity and selectivity, and does not need target-dependent fine-tuning of the framework or target structure information.","output":"CogMol: Target-Specific and Selective Drug Design for COVID-19 Using Deep Generative Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, there is no curable treatment option for non-hereditary degenerative cerebellar ataxia.

As mental health understanding and literacy develop, media reporting of elite athlete mental health may contribute to shaping of opinions and help seeking behaviour. Thus, we have aimed to understand and analyse the tone and content of media reporting on a high-profile sporting event using qualitative methods to explore key aspects of the articles sampled. Methods: We selected two UK broadsheet newspapers available online (The Guardian and The Telegraph) and identified all text articles including the terms \\"Mental Health\\" and \\"Olympics\\" or \\"Paralympics\\" published between 23rd July 2019 and 30th November 2021.

The rotavirus VP3 protein is a multifunctional capping enzyme and antagonist of the interferon-induced cellular oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L pathway. Despite mediating important processes, VP3 is the sole protein component of the rotavirus virion whose structure remains unknown. In the current study, we used sequence alignment and homology modeling to identify features common to nonturreted Reoviridae capping enzymes and to predict the domain organization, structure, and active sites of rotavirus VP3. Our results suggest that orbivirus and rotavirus capping enzymes share a domain arrangement similar to that of the bluetongue virus capping enzyme. Sequence alignments revealed conserved motifs and suggested that rotavirus and orbivirus capping enzymes contain a variable N-terminal domain, a central guanine-N7-methyltransferase domain that contains an additional inserted domain, and a C-terminal guanylyltransferase and RNA 5'-triphosphatase domain. Sequence conservation and homology modeling suggested that the insertion in the guanine-N7-methyltransferase domain is a ribose-2'-O-methyltransferase domain for most rotavirus species. Our analyses permitted putative identification of rotavirus VP3 active-site residues, including those that form the ribose-2'-O-methyltransferase catalytic tetrad, interact with S-adenosyl-l-methionine, and contribute to autoguanylation. Previous reports have indicated that group A rotavirus VP3 contains a C-terminal 2H-phosphodiesterase domain that can cleave 2'-5' oligoadenylates, thereby preventing RNase L activation. Our results suggest that a C-terminal phosphodiesterase domain is present in the capping enzymes from two additional rotavirus species. Together, these findings provide insight into a poorly understood area of rotavirus biology and are a springboard for future biochemical and structural studies of VP3. IMPORTANCE Rotaviruses are an important cause of severe diarrheal disease. The rotavirus VP3 protein caps viral mRNAs and helps combat cellular innate antiviral defenses, but little is known about its structure or enzymatic mechanisms. In this study, we used sequence- and structure-based alignments with related proteins to predict the structure of VP3 and identify enzymatic domains and active sites therein.

The objective of the study is to comprehensively compare the immunological characteristics of non-responders to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the 18-59 years with that in the 60 years and older using internationally recognized cutoff values. Participants included 627 individuals who received physical examinations and volunteered to participate in COVID-19 vaccination from the general population. The main outcome was an effective seroconversion characterized by anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG level of at least 4-fold increase from baseline. Profiling of naive immune cells was analyzed prior to vaccination to demonstrate baseline immunity. Outcomes of effective seroconversion in the 18-59 years with that in the 60 years and older were compared. The quantitative level of the anti-spike IgG was significantly lower in the 60 years and older and in men among the 18-59 years. There were 7.5% of non-responders among the 18-59 years and 11.7% of non-responders in the 60 years and older using the 4-fold increase parameter. The effective seroconversion rate was significantly related to the level of certain immune cells before vaccination, such as CD4 cells, CD8 cells and B cells and the age. An individual with a titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG that is below 50 BAU/mL might be considered a non-responder between 14-90 days after the last vaccine dose. Booster vaccination or additional protective measures should be recommended for non-responders as soon as possible to reduce disease severity and mortality.","output":"Immunological findings in a group of individuals who were non-responders to standard two-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, has been used for attenuation of hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy, but not through the nebulized route. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of preoperative dexmedetomidine nebulization on the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy-intubation, intraoperative anesthetic-analgesic requirements and recovery outcomes. Methods 120 ASA I & II adult patients, of either gender, undergoing elective surgeries requiring tracheal intubation were enrolled and randomized to receive nebulized dexmedetomidine (1 g/kg in 3-4 ml of 0.9% saline) or 0.9% saline (3-4 ml), 30 minutes before anesthesia induction. Heart rate and non-invasive systolic blood pressures were studied for 10 minutes following laryngoscopy. Results After laryngoscopy, linear mixed effect modelling showed significantly lower trend of increase in heart rate in the dexmedetomidine group versus saline (P = 0.01). However, there was no difference in the systolic blood pressure changes between the two groups (P= 0.90). Induction dose of propofol (P < 0.001), intraoperative fentanyl consumption (P = 0.007) and isoflurane requirements (P = 0.01) were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group. There was no difference in the 2-hr postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (P = 0.61) or sore-throat (P = 0.74). Conclusions Nebulized dexmedetomidine 1 g/kg attenuated the increase in heart rate but not systolic blood pressures following laryngoscopy; and reduced the intraoperative anesthetic and analgesic consumption. There was no effect on early PONV, sore-throat or increase in incidence of adverse effects. Nebulized dexmedetomidine may represent a favorable alternative to the intravenous route in short duration surgeries.","output":"The effect of preoperative dexmedetomidine nebulization on the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation: a randomized control trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Republic of the Congo detected its first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on March 14, 2020, and within several weeks, the country had introduced protective measures that were still in force in July 2020. Over the course of time, the progression in the number of clinical cases has appeared to be lower than expected, although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has been somewhat limited. In order to evaluate the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Congolese population, a seroprevalence study was conducted on healthy individuals from different districts of Brazzaville who were willing to know their COVID-19 infection status. METHODS: Oropharyngeal swab and blood samples were collected from 754 healthy volunteers between April 2020 and July 2020. The samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 using a qualitative RT-PCR assay, and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were detected using two different rapid tests. RESULTS: A total of 56 participants (7.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The remaining 698 participants (92.6%) had negative RT-PCR results; of these, 117 were found to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using serological tests. For these RT-PCR-negative subjects, the seroprevalence of IgG and IgM was found to increase over time: from 1.7% and 2.5% in April, up to 14.2% and 17.6% in July, respectively. In April 2020, 5% of the women were found to have IgG or IgM antibodies, whereas the antibodies were not detected in any of the men. The seroprevalence in RT-PCR negative subjects was significantly higher in women within IgG (P = 0.012) and IgM (P = 0.045) over the first three months.

The solaser is based on a well-known in quantum physics laser model of coherent amplification of the optical field. Social networks are at the core of the solaser model; we define them by means of a network model possessing powerClaw degree distribution. In the solaser the network environment plays the same role as the gain medium has in a physical laser device. We consider social atoms as decision making agents (humans or even chat bots), which possess two (mental) states and occupy the nodes of a network. The solaser establishes communication between the agents as absorption and spontaneous or stimulated emission of socially actual information within echo chambers, which mimic an optical resonator of a convenient (physical) laser. We have demonstrated that social lasing represents the second order nonequilibrium phase transition, which evokes the release of coherent socially stimulated information field represented with the order parameter. The solaser implies the formation of macroscopic social polarization and results in a huge social impact, which is realized by viral information cascades occurring in the presence of population imbalance (social bias). We have shown that decision making agents follow an adiabatically time dependent mass media pump, which acts in the network community reproducing various reliable scenarios for information cascade evolution. We have also shown that in contrast to physical lasers, due to node degree peculiarities, the coupling strength of decision making agents with the network may be enhanced [Formula: see text] times. It leads to a large increase of speed, at which a viral message spreads through a social media. In this case, the mass media pump supports additional reinforcement and acceleration of cascade growth. We have revealed that the solaser model in some approximations possesses clear links with familiar Ising and SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) models typically used for evaluating a social impact and information growth, respectively. However, the solaser paradigm can serve as a new platform for modelling temporal social events, which originate from microscopic (quantum-like) processes occurring in the society. Our findings open new perspectives for interdisciplinary studies of distributed intelligence agents behavior associated with information exchange and social impact.","output":"Mean-field theory of social laser"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims at assessing the impacts of climate indices on the spatiotemporal distribution of malaria and meningitis in Nigeria. The primary focus of the research is to develop an Early Warning System (EWS) for assessing climate variability implications on malaria and meningitis spread in the study area. Both climate and health data were used in the study to determine the relationship between climate variability and the occurrence of malaria and meningitis. The assessment was based on variations in different ecological zones in Nigeria. Two specific sample locations were randomly selected in each ecological zone for the analysis. The climatic data used in this study are dekadal precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature between 2000 and 2018, monthly aerosol optical depth between 2000 and 2018. The results show that temperature is relatively high throughout the year because the country is located in a tropical region. The significant findings of this study are that rainfall has much influence on the occurrence of malaria, while temperature and aerosol have more impact on meningitis. We found the degree of relationship between precipitation and malaria, there is a correlation coefficient R(2)  70.0 in Rainforest, Freshwater, and Mangrove ecological zones. The relationship between temperature and meningitis is accompanied by R(2)  72.0 in both Sahel and Sudan, while aerosol and meningitis harbour R(2) = 77.33 in the Sahel. The assessment of this initial data seems to support the finding that the occurrences of meningitis are higher in the northern region, especially the Sahel and Sudan. In contrast, malaria occurrence is higher in the southern part of the study area. In all, the multiple linear regression results revealed that rainfall was directly associated with malaria with  = 0.64, p = 0.001 but aerosol was directly associated with meningitis with  = 0.59, p < 0.001.

The retreat included 152 high school-aged boys, counselors, and staff members from 21 states and territories and two foreign countries. All attendees were required to provide documentation of either a positive serologic test result* within the past 3 months or a negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests result for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) 7 days before travel, to self-quarantine within their households for 7 days before travel, and to wear masks during travel. On July 15, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS) began an investigation after being notified that two students at the retreat had received positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results. WDHS offered RT-PCR testing to attendees on July 28 and serologic testing on August 5 and 6. Seventy-eight (51%) attendees received positive RT-PCR results (confirmed cases), and 38 (25%) met clinical criteria for COVID-19 without a positive RT-PCR result (probable cases). By the end of the retreat, 118 (78%) persons had received a positive serologic test result. Among 24 attendees with a documented positive serologic test result before the retreat, all received negative RT-PCR results. After RT-PCR testing on July 28, WDHS recommended that remaining susceptible persons (asymptomatic and with negative RT-PCR test results) quarantine from other students and staff members at the retreat. Recommended end dates for isolation or quarantine were based on established guidance (1,2) and determined in coordination with CDC.

Meteorological disasters such as droughts and floods directly impact the outbreak and transmission of infectious diseases. Climate change indirectly impacts infectious diseases by altering the ecological system, including its underlying surface and vegetation distribution. In addition, anthropogenic activities are a driving force for climate change and an indirect forcing of infectious disease transmission. International travel and rural-urban migration are a root cause of infectious disease transmission. Rapid urbanization along with poor infrastructure and high disease risk in the rural-urban fringe has been changing the pattern of disease outbreaks and mortality. Land use changes, such as agricultural expansion and deforestation, have already changed the transmission of infectious disease.

To explore the underlying mechanism of immunomodulatory activities of AEAR, DCs were produced from bone-marrow cells of mice and the effects of AEAR on cell viability were assessed by the Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) method and annexin V/propidium iodide staining assays. Then, the effects of AEAR on the morphology, maturation, and function of DCs were detected using a microscope, flow cytometry-based surface receptor characterization, and endocytosis assays. The secretion levels of cytokines were then analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The activation state of DCs was evaluated by the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The activity of MAPKs and NF-B pathways, which were involved in the regulation of AEAR on DCs, was further detected by Western blot. AEAR did not have a cytotoxic effect on DCs or mouse splenocytes. AEAR remarkably enhanced the phenotypic maturation of DCs and promoted the expression of costimulatory molecules and the secretion of cytokines in DCs. AEAR also significantly decreased the phagocytic ability of DCs and augmented the abilities of DCs to present antigens and stimulate allogeneic T-cell proliferation. Simultaneously, AEAR potently activated toll-like receptor (TLR)4-/TLR2-related MAPKs and induced the degradation of IB and the translocation of NF-B. In short, AEAR can profoundly enhance the immune-modulating activities of DCs via TLR4-/TLR2-mediated activation of MAPKs and NF-B signaling pathways and is a promising candidate immunopotentiator for vaccines.","output":"Immune-Enhancing Activity of Aqueous Extracts from Artemisia rupestris L. via MAPK and NF-kB Pathways of TLR4/TLR2 Downstream in Dendritic Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work is an investigation to test hydroxychloroquine as an inhibitor for the COVID-19 main protease.

MethodsA random sample of adolescents, aged 14-17 years, and their families was invited to a serosurvey in November and December 2020. Adolescents HRQoL was evaluated using the validated adolescent-reported KIDSCREEN-10 and parent-reported KINDL(R) scales. Psychological distress was assessed with self-reported sadness and loneliness, and using the KINDL(R) emotional well-being scale. Risk factors for adolescents low HRQoL and psychological distress were identified using generalized estimating equations and both adolescents and their parents perceptions were compared. ResultsAmong 240 adolescents, 11% had a low HRQoL, 35% reported sadness and 23% reported loneliness. Based on parents perception, 12% of the adolescents had a low HRQoL and 16% a low emotional well-being.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the medical costs associated with bronchiolitis hospitalizations caused by RSV infection among infants aged < 2 years in Colombia. METHODS This was a prevalence-based cost-of-illness multicentric study performed from the societal perspective during 2016-2017. A case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed RSV infection with hospitalization. All costs and use of resources were collected directly from medical invoices and health records. RESULTS This study included 193 patients with a diagnosis of RSV. The average hospital stay duration was 5.55 days. The major contributors to hospitalization costs were room costs (31.5%), drugs (21.8%), and indirect costs (14.9%). Medications with the highest costs were nebulization with a hypertonic solution and systemic antibiotics. In total, 96% of -lactam antibiotics, 90% of bronchodilators, and 86% of corticosteroids and epinephrine were classified as inappropriate.

Here we examine the added value of near real-time genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in a subpopulation of infected patients during the first 10 weeks of COVID-19 containment in Australia and compare findings from genomic surveillance with predictions of a computational agent-based model (ABM). Using the Australian census data, the ABM generates over 24 million software agents representing the population of Australia, each with demographic attributes of an anonymous individual. It then simulates transmission of the disease over time, spreading from specific infection sources, using contact rates of individuals within different social contexts. We report that the prospective sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 clarified the probable source of infection in cases where epidemiological links could not be determined, significantly decreased the proportion of COVID-19 cases with contentious links, documented genomically similar cases associated with concurrent transmission in several institutions and identified previously unsuspected links. Only a quarter of sequenced cases appeared to be locally acquired and were concordant with predictions from the ABM.

We aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone fundoscopy with traditional direct ophthalmoscopy for optic disc interpretation, with e-learning support. METHODS We conducted a randomised, cross-over study of 102 medical students. Students were offered e-learning for optic disc interpretation. A fundoscopy objective structured clinical examination was conducted after an introductory lecture and ten-minute practical training session on smartphone fundoscopy and traditional ophthalmoscopy. Participants examined patients and simulator slides with a randomised crossover between smartphone (D-eye [Padova, Italy] or iExaminer [Welch Allyn, Macquarie Park, Australia]) and traditional ophthalmoscopy (Welch Allyn). Optic discs were graded independently by three masked ophthalmologists. The primary outcome was the ability to interpret an optic disc as normal or abnormal. Secondary outcomes included other optic disc aspects; student preferences; and e-learning performance. RESULTS Students' agreement with the gold standard for an abnormal or normal disc was significantly greater using a smartphone (74.4%) than with direct ophthalmoscopy (68.1%, p=0.032). More students preferred smartphone (74%) over direct ophthalmoscopy (26%, p<0.001). E-learning led to an improvement in optic disc interpretation scores (mean improvement = 4.5%, 95%CI = 3.7-5.2, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Medical students are more accurate at recognising an abnormal optic disc using smartphone fundoscopy than traditional direct ophthalmoscopy, and have a strong preference for smartphone fundoscopy.

Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV, transmission and pathogenesis of both viruses seem to be quite distinct. A remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site, which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. The viral spike protein not only attaches to the entry receptor, but also mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike multibasic cleavage site increases infectivity on differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into the lung cell line Calu-3, and more frequently formed syncytial cells in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Moreover, the multibasic cleavage site increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to endosomal entry using cathepsins. Blocking serine protease activity using the clinically approved drug camostat mesylate effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Our findings provide novel information on how SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells and highlight serine proteases as an attractive antiviral target. Significance Statement Highly pathogenic coronaviruses have spilled from animals to humans three times in the past two decades. Late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and was declared a pandemic by March 2020. The other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively, but did not attain sustained human-to-human transmission. Given the high diversity of coronaviruses in animals, urbanization and increased air travel, future coronavirus pandemics are likely to occur intermittently. Identifying which factors determine pandemic potential and pathogenicity are therefore of key importance to global health. Additionally, there is an urgent need to rapidly translate fundamental knowledge to the clinic, a process that is expedited through the use of relevant cell culture systems.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site facilitates early serine protease-mediated entry into organoid-derived human airway cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The basic hypothesis of this paper is that, in Latin America, the nature of the set of variables or determinants regarding the relationships of urbanization (and correlated processes of social change, modernization, acculturation, and economic inclusion) and mental health varies with the political context or historical phase considered.

We aimed to assess the short-term impact of the pandemic lockdown on mental health emergency services use in the Kitchener-Waterloo region of Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We conducted an observational study during the 6-month period between March 5 and September 5, 2020 using National Ambulatory Care Reporting System metadata from mental health visits to three regional Emergency Departments (ED); mental health and substance related police calls; and calls to a regional mental health crisis telephone line, comparing volumes during the pandemic lockdown with the same period in 2019. Quasi-Poisson regressions were used to determine significant differences between numbers of each visit or call type during the lockdown period versus the previous year. Significant changes in ED visits, mental health diagnoses, police responses, and calls to the crisis line from March 5 to September 5, 2020 were examined using changepoint analyses. RESULTS: Involuntary admissions, substance related visits, mood related visits, situational crisis visits, and self-harm related mental health visits to the EDs were significantly reduced during the lockdown period compared to the year before. Psychosis-related and alcohol-related visits were not significantly reduced. Among police calls, suicide attempts were significantly decreased during the period of lockdown, but intoxication, assault, and domestic disputes were not significantly different. Mental health crisis telephone calls were significantly decreased during the lockdown period. There was a significant increase in weekly mental health diagnoses starting in the week of July 12 C July 18. There was a significant increase in crisis calls starting in the week of May 31 C June 6, the same week that many guidelines, such as gathering restrictions, were eased. There was a significant increase in weekly police responses starting in the week of June 14 C June 20. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, the decrease in most types of mental health ED visits, mental health and substance-related police calls, and mental health crisis calls largely mirrored the overall decline in emergency services usage during the lockdown period.

Using data from Wave 9 (2018/19) and the first Covid-19 sub-study (June/July 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we investigated changes in health and well-being during the pandemic by clinical vulnerability. We also explored the interactions between CV and age-group (50s, 60s, 70s, 80+), and between CV and shielding.

The bacterium achieves high levels of resistance to -lactam antibiotics by producing -lactamases, enzymes which destroy these valuable agents. Historically, the carbapenem family of -lactam antibiotics have been the drugs of choice for treating A. baumannii infections. However, their effectiveness has been significantly diminished due to the pathogen's production of carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D -lactamases (CHDLs); thus, new antibiotics and inhibitors of these enzymes are urgently needed. Here, we describe a new carbapenem antibiotic, MA-1-206, in which the canonical C6 hydroxyethyl group has been replaced with hydroxymethyl. The antimicrobial susceptibility studies presented here demonstrated that this compound is more potent than meropenem and imipenem against A. baumannii producing OXA-23, the most prevalent CHDL of this pathogen, and also against strains producing the CHDL OXA-24/40 and the class B metallo--lactamase VIM-2. Our kinetic and mass spectrometry studies revealed that this drug is a reversible inhibitor of OXA-23, where inhibition takes place through a branched pathway. X-ray crystallographic studies, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations of the OXA-23-MA-1-206 complex show that the C6 hydroxymethyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylated catalytic lysine of OXA-23, effectively preventing deacylation. These results provide a promising strategy for designing a new generation of CHDL-resistant carbapenems to restore their efficacy against deadly A. baumannii infections. IMPORTANCE Carbapenem antibiotics are the drugs of choice for treatment of deadly infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. However, their efficacy is severely compromised by the wide spread of carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D -lactamases (CHDLs). The importance of this research is the discovery that substitution of the canonical hydroxyethyl group of carbapenems by a hydroxymethyl significantly enhances stability against inactivation by the major CHDL of Acinetobacter baumannii, OXA-23. These results provide a novel strategy for designing next-generation, carbapenemase-stable carbapenems to fight multidrug-resistant infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens.","output":"C6 Hydroxymethyl-Substituted Carbapenem MA-1-206 Inhibits the Major Acinetobacter baumannii Carbapenemase OXA-23 by Impeding Deacylation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Protests and police fieldwork provide a high-exposure environment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. In this cross-sectional analysis, we investigated the seroprevalence among a police cohort, and sociodemographic, work, and health-related factors associated with seropositivity. METHODS: Study participants were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 and to complete online questionnaires. Serum neutralization titers toward the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (expressing D614G) and the Alpha and Beta variants were measured in seropositive study participants. RESULTS: A total of 978 police personnel representing 35% of the entire staff participated from February to March 2021. The seroprevalence was 12.9%. It varied by geographic region, ranged from 9% to 13.5% in 3 regions, including the city; and was 22% in Bernese Seeland/Jura with higher odds for seropositivity (odds ratio [OR], 2.38 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.28C4.44], P=.006). Job roles with mainly office activity were associated with a lower risk of seropositivity (OR, 0.33 [95% CI, .14C.77], P=.010). Self-reported compliance with mask wearing during working hours was 100%; 45% of seropositive vs 5% of seronegative participants (P<.001) reported having had contact with a proven coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case living in the same household prior to serological testing. The level of serum antibody titers correlated with neutralization capacity. Antibodies derived from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection effectively neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but were less effective against the Alpha and Beta variants. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of antiCSARS-CoV-2 antibodies of police officers was comparable to that reported in the general population, suggesting that the personal protective equipment of the police is effective, and that household contacts are the leading transmission venues. The level of serum antibody titers, in particular that of anti-spike antibodies, correlated well with neutralization capacity. Low antibody titers acquired from natural infection were not effective against variants.

The serum and peritoneal fluid concentrations of AGP may be useful in the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a lethal disease of cats. Currently AGP can be measured by radioimmunodiffusion (RID) assays, which are time consuming and difficult. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to develop a rapid immunoturbidimetric assay for measurement of AGP in feline serum and peritoneal fluid and to compare the results with those obtained by RID. METHODS AGP was purified by perchloric acid precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography from a pool of peritoneal fluid obtained from cats with FIP, as determined by a panel of laboratory tests, including serum AGP concentration, albumin: globulin ratio, and total protein concentration, anti-coronavirus antibody titers, and effusion analysis. The purified AGP in a complete Freund's adjuvant and Tween 20 mixture was injected into a sheep and blood was collected at monthly intervals. Anti-AGP antiserum, as confirmed by ELISA and Western blot techniques, and a pool of peritoneal fluid from cats with FIP were used to prepare standards. Clinical samples of feline peritoneal fluid (n=55) and serum (n=59) were assayed for AGP and results from the immunoturbidimetric and RID methods were compared.

Despite reports that family meetings are commonly occurring, few articles described outcomes from either the family or clinician perspectives. CONCLUSIONS Family meetings are essential communication strategies commonly used in paediatric palliative care, yet there is little guidance about how meetings should be organised and conducted, who should participate and when they should occur. The limited data available on the outcomes of family meetings suggest improvements are required to meet the needs of families. We present a framework that synthesises the available evidence. The framework offers an overview of the elements to consider when planning for and undertaking family meetings in paediatric palliative care and may be useful for both clinicians and researchers.","output":"Family meetings in paediatric palliative care: an integrative review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, pneumonia due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) emerged in Wuhan, China, which has immediately spread around the world.

In this study, the snapshot microplastic profile of an urban stream was assessed in the Braamfontein Spruit, located in Johannesburg the largest city in South Africa. The abundance of microplastics was determined in water, Chironomus sp. larvae and sediment, while in situ parameters were taken to investigate their relationship to the microplastic profile of the different matrices. Microplastics were detected in water (mean of 705 particles m-3), Chironomus sp. larvae (mean of 53.4 particles g-1 wet weight) and sediment (mean of 166.8 particles kg-1 dry weight). The study found evidence of how urban stream characteristics such as a weir, stream depth and velocity could affect the abundance and dispersion of microplastics. The results indicate that areas of increased depth and decreased flow allowed microplastics to settle down to the sediment where benthic macroinvertebrates could ingest these fragments. Large obstructions like a weir also increased microplastic counts in sediment and invertebrates above the obstruction, with a decrease of fragments after the obstruction, however, microplastics in surface water were able to flow over the obstruction and increase in abundance downstream. This study concludes that first order urban streams such as the Braamfontein Spruit may be contributing large numbers of microplastics to higher order streams and large rivers in times of increased flow.","output":"The microplastic profile of an urban African stream."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the training of foundation doctors across the UK.

Nevertheless, a long time spent in front of the screens is one of the risk factors of dry eye disease (DED). OBJECTIVES To evaluate ocular symptoms typical for DED presented by Polish students during online learning and entertainment before and during the pandemic, as well as to assess the prevalence of these symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS The original questionnaire was distributed online via social media (Facebook) to Polish students in November 2020. Three hundred sixty-eight anonymous questionnaires were collected and statistically analyzed. RESULTS During the pandemic, online learning and screen entertainment time extended on average by 4 h and 40 min, respectively. Only 8% of students admitted to having no ocular symptoms and 77% reported the exacerbation in previous ocular complaints. Reported symptoms included pain/discomfort of the eyes, itchiness, dryness, red eyes, feeling gritty particles under eyelids, and blurred vision. Actions such as using eye drops, having breaks from studying to have distant vision, consultation with an ophthalmologist, using warm and cold compresses, or none of these were undertaken by 45%, 42%, 8%, 7%, and 19% of students, respectively. Nonmedical students reported worsening of previous symptoms more often than medical students (p < 0.05). A correlation was observed between the number of new/intensified symptoms and the change in screen learning time (r = 0.17, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Eye complaints are prevalent in the population of students. During the pandemic these symptoms intensified, which may have been caused by the extension of the screen time.

To help PW Tabita, it is necessary to establish a system capable of providing output recommendations for the selection of the most appropriate community members as recipients of social assistance. The criteria for selecting social assistance recipients refer to the fulfillment of several elements, namely: employment status, monthly income, number of dependents, residence status, electricity tariff status, insurance participants, and PKH (Family Hope Program) participants. The Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) method is a method applied in this research. The results showed that determining the appropriate weight for each criterion greatly influenced the results of the calculation of the recommendation for providing social funds for people affected by COVID-19.

Abrasion of the fragile tracheal epithelium can occur at the points of contact between the tube and mucosa subject to respiratory movement. In this original experiment, we examined the mucosal protective effect of coating endotracheal tubes with poly[2-methacryloyloxyethl phosphorylcholine (MPC)-co-n-butyl methacrylate] (PMB). METHODS We prepared four types of tubes: tube A (control, no coating), tube B (two coats, 0.5% PMB), tube C (10 coats, 0.5% PMB) or tube D (one coat, 5% PMB). Twenty-nine beagle dogs were divided into four groups and orally intubated with tube A, B, C or D for 40.5 h. The cuffs of extubated tubes were stained with haematoxylin. Paraffin sections from tracheal walls in contact with the inflated cuff were stained with haematoxylin/eosin and periodic acid-Schiff. RESULTS Cuffs of tubes A and B were strongly stained with haematoxylin because of attached epithelial cells. Stained areas in those of tubes C and D were significantly reduced. Histological analysis showed that a single coat of 5% PMB prevented epithelial abrasion and proliferation of goblet cells. Excess tracheal mucus was observed in the tube A group, but not in the tube D group. CONCLUSION Tracheal epithelial damage caused by intubation was greatly reduced or eliminated by PMB coating on the surface of the tracheal tube.","output":"Prevention of intubation-induced mucosal damage using a tube coated with 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine polymer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lethal inflammatory disorder of the lung.

Declines in exercise capacity result in reduced physical activity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Self-management interventions can teach patients skills and behaviours to manage their disease. Technology-mediated interventions have the potential to provide easily accessible support for disease self-management. We evaluated the effectiveness of a web-based self-management intervention, focused on physical activity promotion, on exercise capacity in COPD. This 6-month randomised controlled trial (NCT02099799) enrolled 153 persons with COPD at two US sites (VABoston, n=108; VABirmingham, n=45). Participants were allocated (1:1) to the web-based self-management intervention (physical activity promotion through personalised, progressive step-count goals, feedback, online COPD-related education and social support via an online community) or usual care. The primary outcome was exercise capacity (6-min walk distance (6 MWD)). Secondary outcomes included physical activity (daily steps per day), HRQoL (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Total Score), dyspnoea, COPD-related knowledge and social support. Change in step-count goals reflected intervention engagement. Participants' mean age was 69 (sd=7), and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s % predicted was 61% (sd=21%). Change in 6MWD did not differ between groups. Intervention participants improved their mean daily step counts by 1312 more than those in the usual care group (p<0.001). Groups did not differ on other secondary outcomes. VABirmingham participants were significantly more engaged with the intervention, although site did not modify the effect of the intervention on 6MWD or secondary outcomes. The intervention did not improve exercise capacity but improved physical activity at 6 months.

Transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping suggested that Fe and Mo are uniformly dispersed in nitrogen-doped biochar with hierarchical mesopores. In comparison to Fe@N-BC and Mo@N-BC, Fe-Mo@N-BC exhibited a superior activity for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS).

METHODS: Using a predefined search strategy incorporating MeSH terms and keywords, all known literature databases were searched up till 10th July 2020. The review was done in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD4202019757). RESULTS: Of the 862 identified publications, 18 studies comprising 833 patients were included for meta-analysis. The socio-demographic profile showed male predilection (p = 0.0085) with no significant racial predisposition. A higher incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms (603/715, 84.3%), myocarditis (191/309, 61.8%), left ventricular dysfunction (190/422, 45.0%), pericardial (135/436, 31.0%) and neurological symptoms (138/602, 22.9%) was reported.

However, little attention has been paid to prosocial motivation in adolescents, who are often viewed as selfish and egocentric. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore the role of empathy in adolescents preventive health behavior using longitudinal data. METHODS: A total of 442 Chinese adolescents (mean age of youth = 13.35 years; 49.5% girls and 50.5% boys) completed two-wave longitudinal surveys over the span of two months during the pandemic (Time 1: July 2020; Time 2: September 2020). At T1, participants reported on their empathic concern, perspective taking, and concern for personal health. At both T1 and T2, participants reported on their preventive health behavior and COVID-related worry. RESULTS: Adolescents who showed greater empathic concern tend to engage in more preventive health behavior over time (p < .01). However, greater empathic concern also predicted adolescents greater worry about COVID-19 over time (p < .01). In comparison, adolescents perspective-taking and concern for personal health did not predict their health behavior or worry over time. Notably, the longitudinal effect of empathic concern on preventive health behavior and COVID-related worry remained (ps < .05) after taking into account adolescents perspective-taking and concern for personal health.

Methods : A retrospective cohort comparison of all free flap breast reconstruction cases conducted at a single centre by five consultant plastic surgeons in the period May 2016-May 2020. Results : A total of 281 patient records were used for analysis;146 cases were dual-consultant compared with 135 single consultant, representing 186 and 158 free flaps respectively. Patient demographics were near identical in terms of patient age, BMI and ASA grade. Operating times were significantly reduced for both unilateral (mean reduction 59.49 minutes) and bilateral cases (mean reduction 38.14 minutes) with the presence of dual-consultants. Mean length of stay for dual consultant cases was on average 0.35 days less than for single consultant cases (p=0.04).

The aim of this study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT 0430818) was to evaluate the impact of both perceived stress aroused by Covid-19 and of emotions triggered by the lockdown situation on the individual experience of time. A large sample of the French population responded to a survey on their experience of the passage of time during the lockdown compared to before the lockdown. The perceived stress resulting from Covid-19 and stress at work and home were also assessed, as were the emotions felt.

It is hypothesized that the lipid bilayer that surrounds the SARS-CoV-2 virus improves its ability to remain stable on sebum-rich skin and serves as another possible route of contracting the virus. One possible aspect of these observations that has yet to be explored in detail is what role arthropods that have been associated with human skin infestation, such as Demodecidae or Pyemotidae species, play in viral transmission. It seems likely that arthropod-coronavirus interactions may take place through the molecular attraction forces between the chitin found on the exoskeleton of mites commonly found on human skin and the lipids present on the viral envelope of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

RECENT FINDINGS: Several observational studies, including case series, patient surveys, and patient registries, have examined the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients with SLE. Due to methodologic limitations (focus on sicker patients, exclusion of asymptomatic or mild cases, limited or inaccurate viral testing), it is difficult to determine the risk and outcomes of COVID-19 in SLE patients. Corticosteroids might be associated with increased hospitalizations from COVID-19 in individuals with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Some immune suppressive treatments do not appear to significantly increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 or poor subsequent outcomes; however, data on the safety of specific drugs remain scarce. Studies in non-autoimmune cohorts have shown more severe COVID-19 in ethnic and racial minorities, populations also more heavily impacted by SLE. Such results have been attributed to highly prevalent socioeconomic disparities and comorbidities. The complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immunologic milieu may have particular implications for patients with SLE that remain to be explored. Concerns have been raised of COVID-19 heightening the risk of thromboembolic events in the presence of an SLE-induced procoagulant state. SUMMARY: Limitations in epidemiologic data available to date do not allow for assessing the risk and severity of COVID-19 in patients with SLE.

The peptides are potent, broad-spectrum microbicides that also modulate inflammatory responses in vitro and in animal models of viral infection and polymicrobial sepsis. -Defensins suppress proinflammatory cytokine secretion by leukocytes stimulated with diverse Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Studies were performed to delineate anti-inflammatory mechanisms of rhesus -defensin 1 (RTD-1), the most abundant -defensin isoform in macaque granulocytes. RTD-1 reduced the secretion of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-8 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human blood monocytes and THP-1 macrophages, and this was accompanied by inhibition of nuclear factor B (NF-B) activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Peptide inhibition of NF-B activation occurred following stimulation of extracellular (TLRs 1/2 and 4) and intracellular (TLR9) receptors. Although RTD-1 did not inhibit MAPK in unstimulated cells, it induced phosphorylation of Akt in otherwise untreated monocytes and THP-1 cells. In the latter, this occurred within 10 min of RTD-1 treatment and produced a sustained elevation of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) for at least 4 h. pAkt is a negative regulator of MAPK and NF-B activation. RTD-1 inhibited IB degradation and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and stimulated Akt phosphorylation in LPS-treated human primary monocytes and THP-1 macrophages. Specific inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) blocked RTD-1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and reversed the suppression of NF-B activation by the peptide. These studies indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties of -defensins are mediated by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and suppression of proinflammatory signals in immune-stimulated cells.","output":"Rhesus macaque -defensin RTD-1 inhibits proinflammatory cytokine secretion and gene expression by inhibiting the activation of NF-B and MAPK pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In August 2020, Paul Lewis, Guy Nordenson, David J.

Higher resilience was associated with greater use of adaptive coping behaviors and less use of maladaptive coping behaviors. The use of maladaptive coping strategies was associated with more stress. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that resilience was the strongest unique predictor of stress, thus, largely accounting for the observed coping-outcome associations. Individual differences in resilience levels moderated the effects of two coping strategies (planning and self-blame) on stress. Specifically, planning was associated with increased levels of stress for people with low resilience. In contrast, high personal resilience attenuated the negative effect of self-blame on their stress levels.
