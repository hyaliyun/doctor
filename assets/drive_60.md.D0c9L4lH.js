HBoV is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis in children. Little is known about the seroepidemiology of HBoV in populations in the Caribbean. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study conducted at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica, 287 blood samples were collected from pediatric patients and tested for the presence of HBoV-specific antibody using a virus-like-particle based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: HBoV-specific antibodies were found to be present in 220/287 (76.7%) of samples collected from the pediatric population. Seroprevalence of HBoV was highest in those 2 years old. The seroepidemiological profile suggests that most children are exposed to HBoV during the first two years of life in Jamaica. CONCLUSION: HBoV infection is common in children in Jamaica. HBoV seroprevalence rates in the Caribbean are similar to those previously reported in other areas of the world.","output":"Seroepidemiology of Human Bocavirus Infection in Jamaica"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown have been associated with multiple consequences for mental health, including an excessive and potentially harmful increase in screen media use. The specific consequences for children, adolescents and young adults with ADHD are still unknown. In the first part of this study, a short review of problematic use of the internet (PUI) in ADHD is presented, showing that patients with ADHD are at risk for different aspects of PUI, such as excessive gaming or problematic social media use. In the second part, we report original data of an online survey on screen media use before, during and after the lockdown completed by parents of children and adolescents clinically referred for ADHD. Parents rated children's/adolescents' media-related behavior and media time on a new screening questionnaire for PUI. Each item was rated three times, referring to the observed behavior before, during and 1-2 months after the lockdown. N = 126 parents of patients referred for ADHD aged 10-18 years participated in the study. Total media time increased by 46% during the lockdown and did not completely return to pre-Corona levels afterwards. Patients with difficulties concentrating, high irritability or deterioration of ADHD problems under lockdown spent more time with screen media than those with milder or no such problems. While the effects of the lockdown on screen media use and its negative impact on everyday life appear to be largely reversible, a small proportion of patients with ADHD apparently continue to show increased media use.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on screen media use in patients referred for ADHD to child and adolescent psychiatry: an introduction to problematic use of the internet in ADHD and results of a survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smallholder farmers social knowledge systems are evolving in connecting key actors within and outside their knowledge systems. These key actors play a vital role in navigating the complexity and the dynamics of organisations, and effectively influence the community. This study identified the opinion leaders of smallholder farmers and measured the extent of their influence on the quality of these farmers knowledge of agriculture. Furthermore, the study explored the reasons why farmers choose their opinion leaders. A structured questionnaire was administered to 219 purposively selected smallholder farmers in the rural areas in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data were captured and analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 and STATA to run multinomial logistic regression model (MNL). The results showed that farmers participated in field visits and attended farmers group meetings to communicate with agricultural advisors and group leaders. In addition, the findings showed that interactions could be a crucial element of knowledge and learning for farmers. This showed that the farmers required a consistent flow of material resources and knowledge. The time and energy spent by farmers building social relationships with these opinion leaders reflected the accumulation of information and resources gathered. Issues related to accessibility, availability and, quick feedback regarding farmers problems emerged, which seemed to influence the farmers choice of an opinion leader. The language and accessibility to sources of knowledge and feedback were crucial to the smallholder farmers included in the study. Furthermore, the results revealed that farmers educational level, farmers who engaged in agriculture for household consumption, and opinion agricultural skills have statistical significance on farmers choice of opinion leaders. Considering the findings, it is suggested that efforts to improve farmers active knowledge systems and access to the opinion leaders within these active knowledge systems should take into consideration the socio-economic factors that influence farmers choices and participation in social systems and social interactions. These findings may help agents develop a better understanding of the dynamics of local communities and the social complexity that shapes farmers environments and decisions. To be a progressive and effective opinion leader, constant, continuous assessment is needed to increase leadership skills. In addition, the enhancement of programmes, which will recognise the active opinion leaders within the communities, are needed to strengthen the efforts and impact for more resilient outcomes.","output":"The Influence of Farmers Socio-Economic Characteristics on Their Choice of Opinion Leaders: Social Knowledge Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ferroptosis is a newly discovered type of regulated cell death that is different from apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy.

Accumulating experience in LC has resulted in an increasing number of investigators reporting that LC can be safely performed in cirrhotic patients. The aim of this study was to report the efficacy and safety of LC in the treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis in cirrhotic patients, and a review of the literature in the matter. METHODS Between January 2006 and July 2010, from 503 patients under LC, we reviewed 43 cirrhotic patients of Child-Pugh Classification A, B, and C, with symptomatic gallstones. RESULTS Conversion to an open procedure was necessary in 5 patients due to multiple factors. The mean operative time and length of hospital stay were significantly longer and higher in cirrhotic group (P<0.05). Postoperative complications were observed in 37.2% of patients. Trocar site hematoma (P=0.02), wound complications (P=0.02), and intra-abdominal collection (P=0.01) occurred more frequently in patients with cirrhosis (Child B and C class) than in patients without cirrhosis. One case of continuing hemorrhage from the gallbladder bed required a reoperation for hemostasis. Two patients with Child-Pugh class C and 1 patient with class B cirrhosis developed ascites after surgery; 1 patient with Child-Pugh class A had bile leakage. No deaths occurred.

METHODS Between March 2014 and December 2016, laparoscopic urachal resection was carried out on 45 patients with complaints of urachal remnants. After extraction of the specimen and closure of the fascia at the umbilical site, a 1-cm square section of dermal regeneration sheet (TERUDERMIS?, Olympus) was suture retained between the fascia and the skin. Patient satisfaction with cosmesis was scored prospectively using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Perioperative records were reviewed to assess surgical outcomes. RESULTS Laparoscopic urachal resection was successfully conducted via the transperitoneal approach. Postoperative bleeding was experienced in one patient (2.2%), which was subsequently controlled laparoscopically. Infection subsided with symptomatic relief in all patients. No symptomatic recurrences were encountered. Over 80% of patients (37/45) rated the cosmetic outcome of the plasty as good to excellent, with the median scores of 8 (range 5-10).

Elective interventions and surgical procedures in most countries have been postponed and operating room resources have been diverted to manage the pandemic. The Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale was developed to provide an international standard to rationalise and harmonise the management of patients with venous and lymphatic disorders or vascular anomalies. Triage urgency was determined based on clinical assessment of urgency with which a patient would require medical treatment or surgical intervention. Clinical conditions were classified into six categories of: (1) venous thromboembolism (VTE), (2) chronic venous disease, (3) vascular anomalies, (4) venous trauma, (5) venous compression and (6) lymphatic disease. Triage urgency was categorised into four groups and individual conditions were allocated to each class of triage. These included (1) medical emergencies (requiring immediate attendance), example massive pulmonary embolism; (2) urgent (to be seen as soon as possible), example deep vein thrombosis; (3) semi-urgent (to be attended to within 30-90 days), example highly symptomatic chronic venous disease, and (4) discretionary/non-urgent- (to be seen within 6-12 months), example chronic lymphoedema. Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale aims to standardise the triage of patients with venous and lymphatic disease or vascular anomalies by providing an international consensus-based classification of clinical categories and triage urgency.

We observed that the virus maintains a low preference for GGG codon for glycine (3%) in its genome. We also observed multiple putative introns of 26C44 nucleotide (nt) length in the genomic region between the coding regions of Nsp10 and RPol in the viral ORF1ab, like several other beta-coronaviruses of similar infectivity levels. It appears that the virus employs a dual strategy to ensure unhindered replication within the host. One of the strategies employ a (? )1 frameshift translation event through programmed ribosomal slippage at the ribosomal slippage site in the ORF1ab. The alternate strategy relies on intron excision to generate a read through frame. The presence of GGG in this conserved ribosomal slippage site ensures adequate tRNA in cytoplasm to match the codon, implying no additional frameshift translation due to ribosomal stalling. With fewer replication events, viral load remains low and resulting in asymptomatic cases. We suggest that this strategy is the primary reason for the prevalence of asymptomatic cases in the disease, enabling the virus to spread rapidly.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated experiences in preparedness among stakeholders of both curative and public health sectors to formulate recommendations for optimizing preparedness protocols. Timeliness of referred patients with suspected EVD was used as indicator for preparedness. DESIGN: In focus group sessions and semistructured interviews, experiences of curative and public health stakeholders about the regional and national process of preparedness and response were listed. Timeliness recordings of all referred patients with suspected EVD (13) were collected from first date of illness until arrival in the referral academic hospital. RESULTS: Ebola preparedness was considered extensive compared with the risk of an actual patient, however necessary. Regional coordination varied between regions. More standardization of regional preparation and operational guidelines was requested, as well as nationally standardized contingency criteria, and the National Centre for Infectious Disease Control was expected to coordinate the development of these guidelines. For the timeliness of referred patients with suspected EVD, the median delay between first date of illness until triage was 2.0 days (range: 0-10 days), and between triage and arrival in the referral hospital, it was 5.0 hours (range: 2-7.5 hours). In none of these patients Ebola infection was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Coordination between the public health sector and the curative sector needs improvement to reduce delay in patient management in emerging infectious diseases. Standardization of preparedness and response practices, through guidelines for institutional preparedness and blueprints for regional and national coordination, is necessary, as preparedness for emerging infectious diseases needs a multidisciplinary approach overarching both the public health sector and the curative sector.

Because angiotensin II receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease; thus, they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.

This study lays the groundwork for the development of a novel subunit vaccine candidate from the circulating strains of South African SARS-CoV-2 and provides an understanding of the molecular epidemiological trend of the circulating strains. A total of 475 whole-genome nucleotide sequences from South Africa submitted between December 1, 2020 and February 15, 2021 available at the GISAID database were retrieved based on its size, coverage level and hosts. To obtain the distribution of the clades and lineages of South African SARS-CoV-2 circulating strains, the metadata of the sequence retrieved were subjected to an epidemiological analysis. There was a prediction of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), Helper T cells (HTL) and B-cell epitopes. Furthermore, there was allergenicity, antigenicity and toxicity predictions on the epitopes. The analysis of the physicochemical properties of the vaccine construct was performed; the secondary structure, tertiary structure and B-cell 3D conformational structure of the vaccine construct were predicted. Also, molecular binding simulations and dynamics simulations were adopted in the prediction of the vaccine construct's stability and binding affinity with TLRs. Result obtained from the metadata analysis indicated lineage B.1.351 to be in higher circulation among various circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa and GH has the highest number of circulating clades. The construct of the novel vaccine was antigenic, non-allergenic and non-toxic. The Instability index (II) score and aliphatic index were estimated as 41.74 and 78.72 respectively. The computed half-life in mammalian reticulocytes was 4.4 h in vitro, for yeast and in E. coli was >20 h and >10 h in vivo respectively. The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) score is estimated to be ?0.129, signifying the hydrophilic nature of the protein. The molecular docking indicates that the vaccine construct has a high binding affinity towards the TLRs with TLR 3 having the highest binding energy (?1203.2 kcal/mol) and TLR 9 with the lowest (?1559.5 kcal/mol).

Many health systems have transitioned to providing outpatient care via telehealth; however, there is an opportunity to utilize telehealth for inpatients to promote physical distancing. OBJECTIVE: This article evaluates the use of a rapidly implemented, secure inpatient telehealth program. METHODS: We assembled a multidisciplinary team to rapidly design, implement, and iteratively improve an inpatient telehealth quality improvement initiative using an existing videoconferencing system at our academic medical center. We assigned each hospital bed space a unique meeting link and updated the meeting password for each new patient. Patients and families were encouraged to use their own mobile devices to join meetings when possible. RESULTS: Within 7 weeks of go-live, we hosted 1,820 inpatient telehealth sessions (13.3 sessions per 100 bedded days). We logged 104,647 minutes of inpatient telehealth time with a median session duration of 22 minutes (range 1-1,961). There were 5,288 participant devices used with a mean of 3 devices per telehealth session (range 2-22). Clinicians found they were able to build rapport and perform a reasonable physical exam. CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented and scaled a secure inpatient telehealth program using an existing videoconferencing system in less than 1 week. Our implementation provided an intuitive naming convention for providers and capitalized on the broad availability of smartphones and tablets. Initial comments from clinicians suggest the system was useful; however, further work is needed to streamline initial setup for patients and families as well as care coordination to support clinician communication and workflows.

The aim of this paper is to describe the frequency of distress and wellbeing, measured by the expanded 9-item Mayo Clinic Wellbeing Index (eWBI), among general practitioners/family physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify levers to mitigate the risk of distress. Data were collected by means of an online self-reported questionnaire among GP practices. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software using Version 7 of the database, which consisted of the cleaned data of 33 countries available as of 3 November 2021. Data from 3711 respondents were included. eWBI scores ranged from ?2 to 9, with a median of 3. Using a cutoff of 2, 64.5% of respondents were considered at risk of distress. GPs with less experience, in smaller practices, and with more vulnerable patient populations were at a higher risk of distress. Significant differences in wellbeing scores were noted between countries. Collaboration from other practices and perception of having adequate governmental support were significant protective factors for distress. It is necessary to address practice- and system-level organizational factors in order to enhance wellbeing and support primary care physicians.","output":"Distress and Wellbeing among General Practitioners in 33 Countries during COVID-19: Results from the Cross-Sectional PRICOV-19 Study to Inform Health System Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This special issue of The Anatomical Record honors the bridges of knowledge and communications between Brazil and the United States in Anatomical Science, Healthcare, and Medical Education.

As argued in this chapter, this is mainly because past studies on sending states policies and institutions for the diaspora have failed to systematically focus on social protection, while also ignoring that regional integration dynamics often constrain domestic responses to the welfare needs of nationals residing abroad. This volume aims to fill this research gap by comparatively examining the type of diaspora infrastructure through which EU Member States address the vulnerabilities faced by populations abroad in five core areas of social protection: health care, pensions, family, unemployment, and economic hardship. Drawing on data from two original surveys with national experts, we operationalize the concepts of descriptive infrastructure for non-residents (i.e. the presence of diaspora-related institutions) and substantive infrastructure (i.e. policies that provide and facilitate access to welfare for nationals abroad) in order to propose a new typology of states engagement with their diaspora in the area of social protection.","output":"Do EU Member States Care About their Diasporas Access to Social Protection?

Programs often outline details of fellowships on their websites to help prospective applicants make informed decisions. Our primary goal was to evaluate the content quality of online information for all ASDS-accredited cosmetic dermatologic surgery fellowships on program websites and the ASDS website. Our secondary goal was to describe program activity on social media platforms as another avenue for applicant recruitment. METHODS Program websites were assessed using an aggregate score from twenty-one standardized content quality variables. Social media activity on Facebook and Instagram from January 6 2021, to March 6, 2021, was categorized. RESULTS Among 24 cosmetic dermatologic surgery fellowship programs, 23 had websites. Basic information was provided across most websites or the ASDS website (eg, address, 95.8%), but more qualitative variables like research opportunities or didactic schedule were not consistently reported. Most programs had highly active social media accounts (91.7% on Facebook and 79.2% on Instagram). CONCLUSION There is a gap of information availability between the ASDS website and individual cosmetic dermatologic surgery fellowship websites.

Tocilizumab (TCZ) has been in use as an off-label drug due to its antagonist activity on IL-6 receptor. This study compared the efficacy of standard of care (SOC), and SOC along with TCZ, in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methodology: In this retrospective cohort, we included 74 critically ill COVID-19 patients, aged between 18 to 90 y. Those who received only SOC were placed in the SOC group, while patients who received TCZ in addition to SOC, were placed in the TCZ + SOC group. The SOC included low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 60 mg S/C OD, dexamethasone 6 mg IV OD, remdesivir (antiviral) 200 mg IV stat then 100 mg IV OD for 5 days and when needed 10 days, antibiotics for secondary infection e.g., Azithromycin 500 mg IV OD, in the presence of High flow Oxygen (HFO) or CPAP. X-rays chest, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-Dimers, ferritin, pro-BNP, C-reactive protein (CRP), total leukocyte count (TLC), renal and liver markers, serum electrolytes, sugar levels, and ABGs were obtained from the data, at the time of admission in ICU and on the 7th day of ICU stay. Results: 57% patients received only SOC while 43% received TCZ in addition to SOC. Improvement in hypoxia and radiological findings on day-7 was more in SOC' group than TCZ+ SOC' group (52% vs. 34% and 52% vs. 31% respectively), but it was not statistically significant. Overall improvement in inflammation markers on day-7 was similar in both groups with p = 0.925. Survival was 45% vs. 37.5% in SOC' vs. TCZ+ SOC' group respectively (p = 0.504).

Bias awareness is one of the key elements to be included in implicit bias education. Research on education enhancing bias awareness is limited. Bias awareness can motivate behavior change. The objective was to evaluate whether exposure to a brief online course, Implicit Bias in the Clinical and Learning Environment, increased bias awareness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The course included the history of racism in medicine, social determinants of health, implicit bias in healthcare, and strategies to reduce the impact of implicit bias in clinical care and teaching. A sample of U.S. academic family, internal, and emergency medicine providers were recruited into the study from August to December 2019. Measures of provider implicit and explicit bias, personal and practice characteristics, and preCpost-bias awareness measures were collected. RESULTS: Of 111 participants, 78 (70%) were female, 81 (73%) were White, and 63 (57%) were MDs. Providers held moderate implicit pro-White bias on the Race IAT (Cohens d = 0.68) and strong implicit stereotypes associating males rather than females with career on the Gender-Career IAT (Cohens d = 1.15). Overall, providers held no explicit race bias (Cohens d = 0.05). Providers reported moderate explicit male-career (Cohens d = 0.68) and strong female-family stereotype (Cohens d = 0.83). A statistically significant increase in bias awareness was found after exposure to the course (p = 0.03). Provider implicit and explicit biases and personal and practice characteristics were not associated with an increase in bias awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Implicit bias education is effective to increase providers bias awareness regardless of strength of their implicit and explicit biases and personal and practice characteristics.

Methods. The present qualitative systematic review was conducted according to Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies (MOOSE). A literature search was performed from March 2020 up to May 10, 2020, using the PubMed database, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to assess the risk of airborne transmission of viruses and the potential health risk of surgical smoke- and aerosol-generating procedures produced during laparoscopic surgery. The keywords were introduced in combination to obtain better search results. Application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria identified 44 relevant articles. Results. Genetic material from certain viruses, or the virus itself, has been detected in SS and aerosols. However, in the current SARS-CoV-2, as in other coronavirus situations, studies analyzing the presence of airborne transmission of viruses in surgical smoke are lacking. Conclusion. Despite the lack of clear evidence regarding the risk of diseases as the result of smoke- and aerosol-generating procedures during laparoscopic surgery, further investigation is needed.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most commonly performed procedure for VBG revision. So we aimed at reporting our experience in conversional RYGB for a failed VBG. MATERIAL AND METHODS Analyzing follow-up records of 102 patients who underwent revisional RYGB after failed VBG in the period from April 2014 to January 2018. RESULTS A total of 102 laparoscopic revisions of failed VBGs to RYGB were performed. The mean operating time was 161.9 min 29.2 and the mean length of the hospital stay was 1.5 days 1.2. Fourteen patients (13%) developed early post-operative complications (gastrojejunostomy leak 5; bleeding 9). Four patients (4.7%) developed late complications (Port site hernia 2; internal hernia 1; Stomal ulcer 1). The mean BMI pre-RYGB was 46.6  5.9 kg/m2, and the mean %EBWL (percent excess body weight lost) of the patients at 12 and 24 months post-revision were 56.2% and 64.3%, respectively. Our patients had immediate post-revision resolution of VBG-related complications like dysphagia and vomiting. We also report improvement in all obesity-related health problems with (75.7%) complete remission rate and (24.3%) partial remission or improvement rate of diabetes mellitus.

These shocks had an immediate intergenerational impact: Children whose fathers reported an earnings drop to zero are significantly less likely to have received additional paid learning resources compared to similar children whose fathers did not experience a drop in earnings. Potentially offsetting this, they received about 30 more mins of parental help with schoolwork per day. Parental mental health is negatively affected when they experience earnings losses, and fathers who experience a full loss in earnings were less likely to quarrel or talk about things that matter with their kids than fathers who did not suffer earnings drops.

Thrombosis in placental and spinal vessels and subsequent ischemic injury in EHV-1-infected horses manifests clinically as abortion and myeloencephalopathy. We have previously shown that addition of heparin anticoagulants to equine platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can abolish ex vivo EHV-1-induced platelet activation. The goal of this study was to test whether platelets isolated from horses treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) were resistant to ex vivo EHV-1-induced activation. In a masked, block-randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial, 9 healthy adult horses received 4 subcutaneous injections at q. 12 h intervals of one of the following treatments: UFH (100 U/kg loading dose, 3 maintenance doses of 80 U/kg), 2 doses of LMWH (enoxaparin) 80 U/kg 24 h apart with saline at the intervening 12 h intervals, or 4 doses of saline. Blood samples were collected before treatment and after 36 h, 40 h (4 h after the last injection) and 60 h (24 h after the last injection). Two strains of EHV-1, Ab4 and RacL11, were added to PRP ex vivo and platelet membrane expression of P selectin was measured as a marker of platelet activation. Drug concentrations were monitored in a Factor Xa inhibition (anti-Xa) bioassay. We found that LMWH, but not UFH, inhibited platelet activation induced by low concentrations (1  106 plaque forming units/mL) of both EHV-1 strains at 40 h. At this time point, all horses had anti-Xa activities above 0.1 U/ml (range 0.15-0.48 U/ml) with LMWH, but not UFH. By 60 h, a platelet inhibitory effect was no longer detected and anti-Xa activity had decreased (range 0.03 to 0.07 U/ml) in LMWH-treated horses. Neither heparin inhibited platelet activation induced by high concentrations (5  106 plaque forming units/mL) of the RacL11 strain.

This motif is missing from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), resulting in high level of surface expression of the spike protein when it is expressed on its own in vitro. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: It has been shown that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus genome contains open reading frames that encode for proteins with no homologue in other coronaviruses. One of them is the 3a protein, which is expressed during infection in vitro and in vivo. The 3a protein, which contains a tyrosine-dependent sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain, is expressed on the cell surface and can undergo internalization. In addition, 3a can bind to the spike protein and through this interaction, it may be able to cause the spike protein to become internalized, resulting in a decrease in its surface expression. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The effects of 3a on the internalization of cell surface spike protein can be examined biochemically and the significance of the interplay between these two viral proteins during viral infection can be studied using reverse genetics methodology. IMPLICATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: If this hypothesis is proven, it will indicate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus modulates the surface expression of the spike protein via a different mechanism from other coronaviruses. The interaction between 3a and S, which are expressed from separate subgenomic RNA, would be important for controlling the trafficking properties of S. The cell surface expression of S in infected cells significantly impacts viral assembly, viral spread and viral pathogenesis. Modulation by this unique pathway could confer certain advantages during the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus.","output":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus 3a protein may function as a modulator of the trafficking properties of the spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used as an immunomodulatory therapy to counteract severe systemic inflammation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). But its use in COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not well established. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health records of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at Hazm Mebaireek General Hospital, Qatar, between March 7, 2020 and September 9, 2020. Patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for moderate-to-severe ARDS were divided into two groups based on whether they received IVIG therapy or not. The primary outcome was all-cause ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes studied were ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at day-28, and incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Propensity score matching was used to adjust for confounders, and the primary outcome was compared using competing-risks survival analysis. RESULTS: Among 590 patients included in the study, 400 received routine care, and 190 received IVIG therapy in addition to routine care. One hundred eighteen pairs were created after propensity score matching with no statistically significant differences between the groups. Overall ICU mortality in the study population was 27.1%, and in the matched cohort, it was 25.8%. Mortality was higher among IVIG-treated patients (36.4% vs. 15.3%; sHR 3.5; 95% CI 1.98C6.19; P < 0.001). Ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at day-28 were lower (P < 0.001 for both), and incidence of AKI was significantly higher (85.6% vs. 67.8%; P = 0.001) in the IVIG group.

The phenomenon of carnivalisation is analysed with reference to M. M. Bakhtin's concept of carnivalisation and D. S. Likhachev's generalisations about the folk culture of laughter. It is established that the Russian carnival is associated with will. In the situation of a new \\"coronavirus normality\\", the language forms a layer of anxiety vocabulary, which stimulates word and meaning coinage. It is proved that mass linguistic creativity is a form of resistance to disturbing reality. The author systematises potential neologisms, nonce words, and non-standard metaphors. Word innovations act as a means of creating a comic effect, characterisation, and axiological assessment of reality, as well as a means of diagnosing the tender points of the coronavirus space and a means of psychotherapy. The author distinguishes a temporal model formed in the linguistic worldview which reflects the imperfection of the world: the extended present of the coronavirus;pre-coronavirus past;post-coronavirus future which is conceived as a desired return to the past (the slogan Bneped & ydyueel). As part of the analysis, the author describes a layer of new compound word-formations with......- as the first component. Also, she pays special attention to the interpretation of words close to the core of anxiety vocabulary (nymuHkybi, no Pi Hnu kappa apaHmuHeu, etc.). A unique object of analysis is a group of colloquial words that replace business standards (partial derivative ucmaHuuoHka, y partial derivative a pi eHk alpha, anpeueHka), as well as neologisms that expand the number of derivatives of the word Macka.

The study was undertaken to provide information to the newly formed Preparedness Modeling Unit within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The focus was on the use of sophisticated mathematical models associated with three public health threats: pandemic influenza, radiologic release, and severe heat waves. The use of computer modeling and scenario-based analyses can be used to better frame problems and opportunities, integrate data sources, expect outcomes, and improve multistakeholder decision making. The results of the eight state needs assessment demonstrated that preparedness officials are familiar with models and would use computer modeling as a tool, along with other tools and general experiences, depending upon the perceived quality and validity of the model and the assumptions, as well as the applicability, of the model to their particular setting and population. More needs to be done to improve awareness and dissemination of available models and share best practices in both knowledge and use of models. Use of preparedness modeling would enhance the planning for vulnerable and at-risk populations, all-hazard emergencies and infectious disease containment strategies, as well as for response functions including evacuation, sheltering, quarantine, and distribution of medications and supplies.","output":"Use of computer modeling for emergency preparedness functions by local and state health officials: a needs assessment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It has been indicated that pregnant women and neonates are susceptible to COVID-19 infection.

Case report: This study reports the case of a neonate with COVID-19 infection who became symptomatic 30 h after birth. His pharyngeal swab specimen was reported as positive by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It happened while the newborn's mother was tested for the COVID-19 twice, and she received negative results both times. Conclusion: According to the incubation period of COVID-19 which is at least 1 day, the possibility of nosocomial transmission is less than other cases reported so far. Moreover, the mother had no COVID-19 symptoms during the last month of delivery.

EPAs are defined for Hospice and Palliative Medicine physicians but not for other members of Hospice and Palliative Care (HAPC) interprofessional teams, including pharmacists. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to develop EPAs for HAPC pharmacists. METHODS: An eleven-member workgroup of HAPC pharmacists was convened to develop candidate EPAs using nominal group and modified-Delphi methods. Content validity index was used as a measure of consensus, defined a priori at  60%. Vetting occurred via intra- and interprofessional stakeholder reactor groups and a national survey of HAPC pharmacists. RESULTS: Following an iterative process of workgroup and stakeholder consensus-building, 15 HAPC pharmacist EPAs were developed. Among the workgroup, all 15 EPAs reached  70% consensus, indicating appropriate internal validity. In a national survey of 185 HAPC pharmacists with a 20% response rate, 13 EPAs were rated by most respondents as \\"essential\\" and 2 were rated by most respondents as \\"important but not essential.\\" Respondents indicated the 15 EPA set represented the core professional activities of HAPC pharmacists well (median rating of 5 on a Likert-like scale, IQR 1).

We determined if there were differences in dead space and alveolar ventilation in ventilated infants with pulmonary disease or no respiratory morbidity. METHODS: A prospective study of mechanically ventilated infants was undertaken. Expiratory tidal volume and carbon dioxide levels were measured. Volumetric capnograms were constructed to calculate the dead space using the modified BohrCEnghoff equation. Alveolar ventilation (V(A)) was also calculated. RESULTS: Eighty-one infants with a median (range) gestational age of 28.7 (22.4C41.9) weeks were recruited. The dead space [median (IQR)] was higher in 35 infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) [5.7 (5.1C7.0) ml/kg] and in 26 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [6.4 (5.1C7.5) ml/kg] than in 20 term controls with no respiratory disease [3.5 (2.8C4.2) ml/kg, p < 0.001]. Minute ventilation was higher in both infants with RDS or BPD compared to the controls. V(A) in infants with RDS or BPD was similar to that of the controls [p = 0.54]. CONCLUSION: Prematurely born infants with pulmonary disease have a higher dead space than term controls, which may influence the optimum level during volume-targeted ventilation. IMPACT: Measurement of the dead space was feasible in ventilated newborn infants. The physiological dead space was a significant proportion of the delivered volume in ventilated infants. The dead space (per kilogram) was higher in ventilated infants with respiratory distress syndrome or evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared to term controls without respiratory disease.

METHODS AND RESULTS During March 2018, an electronic search of databases including CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO was conducted. All randomised controlled trials, which examined an intervention strategy to help heart failure patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia cope with self-care, were included. An initial search yielded 1622 citations, six studies were included (N= 595 participants, mean age 68 years). There were no significant improvements in cognitive function and depression. However, significant improvements were seen in memory (p=0.015), working memory (p=0.029) and instrumental activities of daily living (p=0.006). Nurse led interventions improved the patient's heart failure knowledge (p=0.001), self-care (p<0.05) and quality of life (p=0.029). Key elements of these interventions include brain exercises, for example, syllable stacks, individualised assessment and customised education, personalised self-care schedule development, interactive problem-solving training on scenarios and association techniques to prompt self-care activities.

METHODS: We included asymptomatic patients with diabetes and no coronary history, who had undergone both a stress a myocardial scintigraphy to diagnose myocardial ischemia, and a computed tomography to measure their coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. EAT volume was retrospectively measured from computed tomography imaging. Determinants of EAT volume and asymptomatic myocardial ischemia were evaluated. RESULTS: The study population comprised 274 individuals, including 153 men. Mean ( standard deviation) age was 62  9 years, and 243, 23 and 8 had type 2, type 1, or another type of diabetes, respectively. Mean body mass index was 30  6 kg/m(2), and mean EAT volume 96  36 cm(3). Myocardial ischemia was detected in 32 patients (11.7%). EAT volume was positively correlated with age, body mass index and triglyceridemia, but negatively correlated with HbA1c, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol levels. Furthermore, EAT volume was lower in people with retinopathy, but higher in men, in current smokers, in patients with nephropathy, those with a CAC score > 100 Agatston units, and finally in individuals with myocardial ischemia (110  37 cm(3) vs 94  37 cm(3) in those without myocardial ischemia, p < 0.05). The association between EAT volume and myocardial ischemia remained significant after adjustment for gender, diabetes duration, peripheral macrovascular disease and CAC score. We also found that area under the ROC curve analysis showed that EAT volume (AROC: 0.771 [95% confidence interval 0.683C0.858]) did not provide improved discrimination of myocardial ischemia over the following classic factors: gender, diabetes duration, peripheral macrovascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, smoking, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and CAC score (AROC 0.773 [0.683C0.862]).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to 30th December 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection were the following: (1)enrolling patients with any form of diabetes mellitus and hospitalized for COVID-19 and (2) reporting data regarding HbA1c values before infection or at hospital admission in relation to COVID-19 mortality or worsening. Descriptive statistics, HbA1c values, odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios were extracted from seven observational studies and generic inverse variance (random effects) of OR was used to estimate the effect of HbA1c on COVID-19 outcome. RESULTS: HbA1c was linearly associated with an increased COVID-19 mortality or worsening when considered as a continuous variable (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.01]; p < 0.00001).

CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the large heterogeneity in study design and patients' characteristics in the few available studies, data suggest that patients with diabetes and poor glycaemic control before infection might have an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality.","output":"Elevated HbA1c levels in pre-Covid-19 infection increases the risk of mortality: A sistematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exploring shifts in the climatic niches of introduced species can provide significant insight into the mechanisms underlying the invasion process and the associated impacts on biodiversity. We aim to test the phylogenetic signal hypothesis in native and introduced species in Europe by examining climatic niche similarity. We examined data from 134 ant species commonly found in western Europe; 130 were native species, and 4 were introduced species. We characterized their distribution patterns using species records from different databases, determined their phylogenetic relatedness, and tested for a phylogenetic signal in their optimal climatic niches. We then compared the introduced species climatic niches in Europe with their climatic niches in their native ranges and with the climatic niches of their closest relative species in Europe. We found a strong phylogenetic signal in the optimal climatic niches of the most common ant species in Europe; however, this signal was weak for the main climatic variables that affect the distributions of introduced versus native species. Also, introduced species occupied different climatic niches in Europe than in their native ranges; furthermore, their European climatic niches did not resemble those of their closest relative species in Europe. We further discovered that there was not much concordance between the climatic niches of introduced species in their native ranges and climatic conditions in Europe. Our findings suggest that phylogenetics do indeed constrain shifts in the climatic niches of native European ant species. However, introduced species would not face such constraints and seemed to occupy relatively empty climatic niches.","output":"Introduced ant species occupy empty climatic niches in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We modeled the viral dynamics of 13 untreated patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 to infer viral growth parameters and predict the effects of antiviral treatments.

Consequently, the publication of pandemic narratives has increased exponentially, which exposes a heightened social concern about the risk of viral outbreak. But instead of speaking to these growing anxieties and providing models to interpret our current position, a growing body of popular culture post-apocalyptic fiction remains deeply entrenched in a dangerous nostalgia that undermines the construction of hypothetical models that could appropriately respond to these threats. I argue that these texts can therefore be read as degenerate utopias, Louis Marins term for the false utopian myths that circulate within a society.

Application of artificial intelligence within regional anaesthesia, however, remains limited. An example of the use of a convoluted neural network applied to visual detection of nerves on ultrasound images is described. New technologies that may impact on regional anaesthesia include robotics and artificial sensing. Robotics in anaesthesia falls into three categories. The first, used commonly, is pharmaceutical, typified by target-controlled anaesthesia using electroencephalography within a feedback loop. Other types include mechanical robots that provide precision and dexterity better than humans, and cognitive robots that act as decision support systems. It is likely that the latter technology will expand considerably over the next decades and provide an autopilot for anaesthesia. Technical robotics will focus on the development of accurate sensors for training that incorporate visual and motion metrics. These will be incorporated into augmented reality and visual reality environments that will provide training at home or the office on life-like simulators. Real-time feedback will be offered that stimulates and rewards performance.

Global trends in camping show that this type of recreational activity has begun to emerge in Asia. Meeting the expectations of potential and current tourists in a camping destination will lead to the accomplishment of competitive advantage. The endurance involvement and place attachment play important roles in understanding camping behaviors. However, limited research identified place attachment as a moderator of the influence of endurance involvement on camping travel behavior. To fill this gap, based on place attachment theory, our study developed a conceptual model that postulates endurance involvement and place attachment as predictors of camping tourism. 216 self-administered questionnaires were retuned. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the psychometric properties of the measures, while regression analysis was employed to assess the research hypotheses. The study results show that endurance involvement in camping affects camping travel behavior, whereas camping place dependence, camping place identity, and camping affective attachment moderate the effect of camping endurance involvement on camping travel behavior. Camping place attachment strengthens the relationship between camping endurance involvement and camping travel behavior. To maintain the sustainable development of camping tourism, campsite authorities should attach more importance to strengthening campers emotional bonds and concentrate on how to encourage them to participate in tourism activities.

We sought to determine if there were lasting detrimental effect following hospital discharge and if these related to the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed lung function and breathing patterns in COVID-19 survivors > 3 months after discharge, comparing patients who had been admitted to the intensive therapy unit (ITU) (n = 47) to those who just received ward treatments (n = 45). Lung function included spirometry and gas transfer and breathing patterns were measured with structured light plethysmography. Continuous data were compared with an independent t-test or Mann Whitney-U test (depending on distribution) and nominal data were compared using a Fishers exact test (for 2 categories in 2 groups) or a chi-squared test (for > 2 categories in 2 groups). A p-value of < 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. RESULTS: We found evidence of pulmonary restriction (reduced vital capacity and/or alveolar volume) in 65.4% of all patients. 36.1% of all patients has a reduced transfer factor (TL(CO)) but the majority of these (78.1%) had a preserved/increased transfer coefficient (K(CO)), suggesting an extrapulmonary cause. There were no major differences between ITU and ward lung function, although K(CO) alone was higher in the ITU patients (p = 0.03). This could be explained partly by obesity, respiratory muscle fatigue, localised microvascular changes, or haemosiderosis from lung damage. Abnormal breathing patterns were observed in 18.8% of subjects, although no consistent pattern of breathing pattern abnormalities was evident. CONCLUSIONS: An extrapulmonary restrictive like pattern appears to be a common phenomenon in previously admitted COVID-19 survivors.

Vaccination is the only effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality, yet vaccine hesitancy has been observed. The aim of this study was to assess attitudes towards vaccination among lymphoma patients and to identify vaccine hesitancy predictors. Material and methods: The study was conducted on 280 patients with lymphoma who took part anonymously in a web-based survey prepared by the Pokonaj Ch?oniaka Foundation. The survey assessed: attitude to and perception of COVID-19 vaccines, the perceived likelihood of COVID-19 infection, personal experiences with COVID-19, and demographic data. Results: In our sample, almost one patient in three was vaccine-hesitant. The percentage was higher among patients living in the countryside, villages and smaller towns and in those not educated beyond high school level. The acceptance of vaccination increased with patient age. The high number of skeptical patients could be potentially dangerous, with regard to the high COVID-related complications and mortality. Conclusions: Clear and easily understood information on COVID vaccines can reduce the risk of COVID-related issues. This subject should be addressed in educational campaigns focused particularly on the identified groups of vaccination skeptics.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among lymphoma patients in Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In the spring of 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 posed a substantial challenge for countries and their healthcare systems. In Germany, over 70% of all cancer patients are treated in an outpatient setting, so gynecologic oncology practices are the guarantors of optimal patient care. We developed a survey to evaluate the management of gynecologic oncology patients. METHODS: The survey consisted of 38 questions and was sent to the members of the Berufsverband Niedergelassener Gyn?kologischer Onkologen in Deutschland e.V. (BNGO), a professional association of gynecologic oncologists in the outpatient sector in Germany. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 54 out of 133 (41%) gynecologic oncologists from 14 out of 15 (93%) federal states where the BNGO is represented. Facing the pandemic, popular measures were mask requirements (100%), restriction of access to practices (94%), increased number of disinfectant dispensers (85%), installment of panes of acrylic glass (76%), or spatial alterations (67%). For most patients the pandemic had no influence on prioritization of therapies (82%) or prescribed systemic treatments (87%). Despite an increase in perceived psychological burden among the staff (72%), 85% (45/54) of the practices were not offered any additional psychological support. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: As most cancer patients in Germany are treated in an outpatient setting, a suitable reaction of oncology centers to the new circumstances was crucial to secure optimal treatment and patient care. Nevertheless, the low prioritization of mental health or distress of healthcare workers poses a serious threat to the maintenance of optimal medical care in further waves of the pandemic.","output":"Nationwide Survey of German Outpatient Gynecologic Oncology Practices during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Reactions to the First Wave and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Older subjects have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and a greater mortality.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 404 patients &#8805; 75 years (mean age 85.2a?a?5.3 years, 55 % males), with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection, attended in two hospitals in Madrid (Spain). Patients were followed-up until they were discharged from the hospital or until death. RESULTS: Symptoms started 2-7 days before admission, and consisted of fever (64 %), cough (59 %), and dyspnea (57 %). A total of 145 patients (35.9 %) died a median of 9 days after hospitalization. In logistic regression analysis, predictive factors of death were age (OR 1.086; 1.015-1.161 per year, pa?=a?0.016), heart rate (1.040; 1.018-1.061 per beat, pa?<a?0.0001), a decline in renal function during hospitalization (OR 7.270; 2.586-20.441, pa?<a?0.0001) and worsening dyspnea during hospitalization (OR 73.616; 30.642-176.857, pa?<a?0.0001).

This disease seriously reduces the life quality of patients. The pathogenesis, recognition and treatment of endometriosis is still unclear, and cannot be over emphasized. The aim of our study was to investigate the potential biomarker of endometriosis for the mechanism and treatment. Methods: Using GSE11691, GSE23339 and GSE5108 datasets, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between endometriosis and normal samples. The functions of DEGs were reflected by the analysis of gene ontology (GO), pathway enrichment and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The LASSO regression model was performed to identify candidate biomarkers. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluate discriminatory ability of candidate biomarkers. The predictive value of the markers in endometriosis were further validated in the GSE120103 dataset. Then, the expression level of biomarkers was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Finally, the relationship between candidate biomarker expression and immune infiltration was estimated using CIBERSORT. Results: A total of 42 genes were identified, which were mainly involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, systemic lupus erythematosus and chemokine signaling pathway. We confirmed PDLIM3 was a specific biomarker in endometriosis (AUC = 0.955) and validated in the GSE120103 dataset (AUC = 0.836). The mRNA and protein expression level of PDLIM3 in endometriosis tissue was significantly higher than normal. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that PDLIM3 was correlated with M2 macrophages, neutrophils, CD4+ memory resting T cells, gamma delta T cells, M1 Macrophages, resting mast cells, follicular helper T cells, activated NK cells, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), naive B cells, plasma cells and resting NK cells.","output":"Bioinformatical analysis identifies PDLIM3 as a potential biomarker associated with immune infiltration in patients with endometriosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) are often followed by secondary bacterial infections. To better understand this phenomenon, we examined the impact of the viral agent polyinosine-polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] on the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) to pharyngeal epithelial cells. STUDY DESIGN In vitro model of cultured human pharyngeal epithelial cells. METHODS Detroit 562 cells, a human pharyngeal carcinoma cell line, were pretreated with Poly (I:C). Poly (I:C)-induced expression of platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF-R) was assayed using real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Bacterial adhesion to these epithelial cells was assessed using immunofluorescence microscopy and colony formation assays. RESULTS Pretreatment with Poly (I:C) increased mRNA and protein expression of PAF-R in Detroit 562 cells and enhanced the adherence of Spn to these epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS RNA viral infection can enhance PAF-R expression in epithelial cells and increase the adherence of Spn.

People with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), like many others with immune-mediated chronic diseases, were excluded from the pivotal trials of these vaccines, leading to early hesitancy by regulatory bodies to endorse administering the vaccines to these groups. However, recent data has shown that the adverse event rate to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among people with IBD is similar to the general population. Early data has further shown that people with IBD are capable of mounting a robust immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, particularly following a second dose, whereas the response to the first dose is blunted in those receiving anti-TNF therapy or conventional immunosuppressants (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate). Based on these data and evidence from previous vaccine programs among people with IBD, multiple national and international expert panels have recommended that individuals with IBD receive complete vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 as soon as possible.","output":"Crohns and Colitis Canadas 2021 Impact of COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: COVID-19 VaccinesBiology, Current Evidence and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors report on a possible direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from a COVID-19-positive individual to an adult horse.

In this work, we designed a vaccine based on a fragment of polymorphic protein D (FPmpD) that proved to be immunogenic enough to generate a robust systemic and mucosal IgG humoral immune response in two strains of mice. We used a heterologous prime-boost strategy, including simultaneous systemic and mucosal administration routes. The high titers of anti-PmpD antibodies elicited by this immunization scheme did not affect murine fertility. We tested the vaccine in a mouse model of Ct intravaginal infection. Anti-PmpD antibodies displayed potent neutralizing activity in vitro and protective effects in uterine tissues in vivo. Notably, the humoral immune response of PmpD-vaccinated mice was faster and stronger than the primary immune response of non-vaccinated mice when exposed to Ct. FPmpD-based vaccine effectively reduced Ct shedding into cervicovaginal fluids, bacterial burden at the genitourinary tract, and overall infectivity. Hence, the FPmpD-based vaccine might constitute an efficient tool to protect against Ct intravaginal infection and decrease the infection spreading.","output":"Heterologous prime-boost vaccination based on Polymorphic protein D protects against intravaginal Chlamydia trachomatis infection in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundImmunocompromised patients, including those with haematological malignancies, are among the high-risk group to develop severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications.

Possible reasons for the breakthrough were reduced vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant, and waning immunity. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent of waning immunity using Israels national-database. MethodsData on all PCR positive test results between July 11-31, 2021 of Israeli residents who became fully vaccinated before June 2021 were used in this analysis. Infection rates and severe COVID-19 outcomes were compared between individuals who were vaccinated in different time periods using a Poisson regression, stratifying by age group and adjusting for possible confounding factors. ResultsThe rates of both documented SARS-CoV-2 infections and severe COVID-19 exhibit a statistically significant increase as time from second vaccine dose elapsed.

R0 is determined by population behavior (frequency and proximity of interactions) and the ease by which a victim is infected by an infectious person (virus' virulence). It is reduced by herd immunity when a large fraction of the population acquires immunity by vaccination or by recovering from infection. The daily death rates in the U.S. and northern Europe exhibited peaks in April/May 2020 and Dec. 2020/Jan. 2021 with more a modest rate during the summer of 2020 and a gradually decreasing rate since Jan. 2021. The model produces this type of oscillatory response if it assumes that the population's R0 responds to information reported about the pandemic, but with a delay between infections and resulting behavioral adjustments. Oscillatory behavior is typical of a control loop with delay in its feedback. The analysis concludes that: Given the history of R0 the model predicts the development of pandemic deaths. However, since R0 is determined by the population's behavior, control of the pandemic in democracies depends primarily on preparation and the persuasive power of political and scientific authorities. Data for S. Korea and New Zealand demonstrate the effectiveness of such methods. For each death in the U.S. about 169 persons were infected, but fewer than half of them were identified as cases. The pandemic was prolonged in the U.S. because the population chose to keep R0 near 1.0 by relaxing restrictions once the death rate subsided. Initial values of R0 as high as 5.0 were observed, leading to infections doubling about every 2 days. If unabated, the resulting exponential growth increases the infected population by a factor of about 5000 before the death from the first infections is recorded. Arrival from Italy probably initiated the pandemic in the eastern U.S., but, by the time the first death was recorded the number of domestic infections exceeded by far those that were imported. Import restrictions beyond this point are ineffective except in delaying the arrival of more virulent mutations. If no social restrictions had been adopted, approximately 1.6 million deaths would have resulted in the U.S. The vaccine, although developed and deployed at record speed, was too late to ameliorate this result. A third peak in death rate in Sept. 2021 may be prevented if more than 80% of the population is vaccinated.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the attitudes (willingness) and preparedness of non-frontline physicians across different specialties in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) toward the management of hospitalized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted between April 15, 2020, and May 5, 2020, included 6209 physicians working in KSA. An electronic questionnaire was designed and validated for the assessment of 3 categorical outcome variables, namely, attitudes, confidence, and knowledge levels. Pearson's chi-square test was used for comparing the distribution of the proportions of these 3 categorical variables. RESULTS: Most participants (63.2%) were willing and prepared to treat COVID-19 patients. A significantly large proportion of participants specializing in anesthesiology (78.2%) had higher knowledge levels, followed by those from plastic surgery (71.1%), pediatrics (69.7%), and obstetrics and gynecology (69.1%) (P < 0.0001). Lower confidence levels were found for airway management skills (38.1%), particularly among dermatologists and radiologists. CONCLUSION: Higher knowledge levels about personal protective equipment (PPE) use and confidence in airway management skills were proportionally related to the level of willingness to participate in COVID-19 patient management. There is an urgent need to train doctors from certain specialties on PPE use and airway management to enable their frontline support of severely ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"Attitudes and Preparedness of Non-Frontline Physicians in Saudi Arabia Toward the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual patients (VP) have been advocated as reliable tools for teaching and evaluating clinical skills and competence. We have developed an internet-based, OSCE-like, conversational VP system designed both for training and assessment of medical students. The system, that encompasses complete patient management from H&P to diagnostic procedures and treatment, has now been used regularly during the clerkship of internal medicine. The present article describes the system and compares assessments undertaken with the VP-system over the last five years, to traditional bed-side oral exams. All students practiced on their own exercise VP cases, while preparing for the final exam. A total of 586 students were evaluated simultaneously with both assessment modalities. The Cronbach of the VP exam averaged 0.86. No correlation was found between the grades obtained in the two exams, indicating that the VP exam evaluated different parameters than those assessed by the examiners in the oral examinations.

Indeed, with earlier hospital discharges, the demands placed on caregivers continue to intensify. Moreover, an increased number of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations are being performed worldwide, and this expensive procedure has significant economic consequences. Thus, the health and well-being of family caregivers have attracted widespread attention. Mobile health technology has been shown to deliver flexible, and time- and cost-sparing interventions to support family caregivers across the care trajectory. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to leverage technology to deliver a novel caregiver-facing mobile health intervention named Roadmap 2.0. We will evaluate the effectiveness of Roadmap 2.0 in family caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: The Roadmap 2.0 intervention will consist of a mobile randomized trial comparing a positive psychology intervention arm with a control arm in family caregiver-patient dyads. The primary outcome will be caregiver health-related quality of life, as assessed by the PROMIS Global Health scale at day 120 post-transplant. Secondary outcomes will include other PROMIS caregiver- and patient-reported outcomes, including companionship, self-efficacy for managing symptoms, self-efficacy for managing daily activities, positive affect and well-being, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety. Semistructured qualitative interviews will be conducted among participants at the completion of the study. We will also measure objective physiological markers (eg, sleep, activity, heart rate) through wearable wrist sensors and health care utilization data through electronic health records. RESULTS: We plan to enroll 166 family caregiver-patient dyads for the full data analysis. The study has received Institutional Review Board approval as well as Code Review and Information Assurance approval from our health information technology services. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study has been briefly put on hold. However, recruitment began in August 2020. We have converted all recruitment, enrollment, and onboarding processes to be conducted remotely through video telehealth. Consent will be obtained electronically through the Roadmap 2.0 app. CONCLUSIONS: This mobile randomized trial will determine if positive psychology-based activities delivered through mobile health technology can improve caregiver health-related quality of life over a 16-week study period. This study will provide additional data on the effects of wearable wrist sensors on caregiver and patient self-report outcomes.

In the event of a category 5 cyclone, under the FRANZ Agreement, France, Australia and New Zealand stand ready to coordinate disaster reconnaissance and provide relief assistance when requested by Pacific Islands Forum countries. Australia and New Zealand also provide financial assistance to Pacific nations to support their economic development. In 2020, the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization prompted immediate border closures in Pacific countries. As a result, the relentless spread of the COVID-19 virus, evidenced in other parts of the world, has not been replicated as yet among these countries. Some Islands are still entirely free of infections. The remoteness of the many islands and atolls that characterise this region does afford some protection from COVID-19. Nevertheless, these developing, mostly small, island nations have not escaped the pandemic unscathed. Border closures and travel restrictions have affected tourism, supply chains, the agricultural sector, and food security. Pacific Islanders are resilient and ready to face these new challenges. However, the vulnerabilities underlined by the emergence of this new threat have revealed a continued need for assistance from Australia and New Zealand. This discourse examines community-based solutions drawing from secondary data sources, academic literature and practical examples, especially from the rural communities of Pacific nations. The paper addresses enduring vulnerabilities emphasised by the pandemic with reference to Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen's concepts of capabilities, functionings and freedom.

Furthermore, substantial progress has been made in the analysis of vitamin D metabolites and related biomarkers, such as vitamin D binding protein. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (LCCMS/MS) methods are capable of accurately measuring multiple vitamin D metabolites in parallel. Nevertheless, only 25(OH)D and the biologically active form 1,25(OH)2D are routinely measured in clinical practice. While 25(OH)D remains the analyte of choice for the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, 1,25(OH)2D is only recommended in a few conditions with a dysregulated D metabolism. 24,25(OH)2D, free and bioavailable 25(OH)D, and the vitamin D metabolite ratio (VMR) have shown promising results, but technical pitfalls in their quantification, limited clinical data and the lack of reference values, impede their use in clinical practice. LCCMS/MS is the preferred method for the measurement of all vitamin D related analytes as it offers high sensitivity and specificity. In particular, 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)2D can accurately be measured with this technology. When interpreted together, they seem to provide a functional measure of vitamin D metabolism beyond the analysis of 25(OH)D alone. The determination of VDBP, free and bioavailable 25(OH)D is compromised by unresolved analytical issues, lacking reference intervals and insufficient clinical data.

An integrative approach that covers clinical and ethical dimensions, as well as spans the spectrum of surgical care, is therefore necessary. This action research involved three key steps: 1) identification of ethical dilemmas related to the provision of surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic;2) preparation of clinical scenarios that highlight these dilemmas;and 3) determination of the appropriate options for the said scenarios, based on the best available evidence as well as most applicable ethical principles. Results. Ethical theories included utilitarianism, human rights, and communitarianism. Ethical principles included non-maleficence, justice, autonomy, and beneficence. Values considered were duty, reciprocity, human life, efficiency, fairness, fidelity, ownership, social value, and fair innings. Also incorporated were informed consent, allocation principles, resource allocation, and triage. In terms of operational issues and surgical technical concerns, the following were considered: phased standards of care, categorization of interventions, prioritization, surgical approaches, infection control, diagnostics, patient welfare, staff welfare, operations protocols, surgical training, and communication.

Many cases of COVID-19 are nosocomial, but to the best of our knowledge, no nosocomial outbreaks on psychiatric departments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in Europe. The different nature of psychiatry makes outbreak management more difficult. This study determines which psychiatry specific factors contributed to a nosocomial outbreak taking place in a psychiatric department. This will provide possible interventions in future outbreak management. METHOD: A case series describing a nosocomial outbreak in a psychiatric department of an acute care hospital in the Netherlands between March 13, 2020 and April, 14 2020. The outbreak was analyzed by combining data from standardized interviews, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and whole genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: The nosocomial outbreak in which 43% of staff of the psychiatric department and 19% of admitted patients were involved, was caused by healthcare worker (HCW)-to-HCW transmissions, as well as patient-to-HCW-to-patient transmission. We identified four aspects associated with the mental health care system which might have made our department more susceptible to an outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Infection control measures designed for hospitals are not directly applicable to psychiatric departments. Psychiatric patients should be considered a high-risk group for infectious diseases and customized measures should be designed and implemented. Extra attention for psychiatric departments is necessary during a pandemic as psychiatric HCWs are less familiar with outbreak management. Clear communication and governance is crucial in correctly implementing these measures.","output":"Why psychiatry is different - challenges and difficulties in managing a nosocomial outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in hospital care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many epidemiological aspects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) pandemics, particularly those affecting children, are still sparsely elucidated.

Materials and methods: Forty-eight patients with abnormal papillary frenum were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups; conventional frenectomy operation (C group), diode laser-assisted frenectomy (L group), and diode laser-assisted frenectomy with conventional horizontal incision on the periosteum (L + P group). Post-operative pain, discomfort in speaking, and chewing scores were assessed with visual analogue scale (VAS) at post-operative 3rd hour and on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 45. Epithelialization process of the wound surface was evaluated by hydrogen peroxide solution applied to the wound on days 7, 14, 21, and 45 following operations. The distance between the frenum attachment point and mucogingival junction (FMGJ) was recorded at baseline, post-operative 45th day, and 6th month to assess the reattachment of the frenum. Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, and probing depth were recorded at baseline and post-operative 7th, 14th, 21st, and 45th days. Results: On the 1st and 7th day after operation, VAS pain score in the C group was significantly higher than in the L and L + P groups (p < 0.017). Difficulty in speaking and chewing scores were significantly lower in the L and L + P groups compared to the C group at post-operative 3rd hour and 7th day (p < 0.017).

The purpose of this review is twofold: (1) to gain an understanding of the extent and outcomes of the implementation of CAPA in community mental health and addictions services; and (2) to identify the role of context as it influences the implementation of CAPA and resulting client and system outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a realist-informed scoping review of the literature related to CAPA in either child and adolescent or adult community mental health and addictions services. Relevant studies, reports and documentation will be identified by searching the following online databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Academic Search Premier, ERIC, Web of Science, Cochrane, Dissertations Abstracts, NCBI Bookshelf, PubMed Central and the Canadian Health Research Collection. The search strategy was developed by a health sciences library scientist and informed by a multidisciplinary team comprising methodological and content knowledge experts. The search will gather evidence from multiple online databases of peer-reviewed literature and grey literature repositories. All articles will be independently assessed for inclusion by pairs of reviewers. The key themes derived from a thematic analysis of extracted data will be presented in a narrative overview. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Research ethics review is not required for this scoping review. The results will be disseminated through meetings with stakeholders (including clients and families, clinicians and decision-makers), conference presentations and peer-reviewed publication. The results of this review will inform an overarching programme of research, policy and quality indicator development to ultimately improve mental health and addictions care and subsequent mental health outcomes for children and adolescents.","output":"The Choice and Partnership Approach to community mental health and addictions services: a realist-informed scoping review protocol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intra-vesical instillations with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) are the established adjuvant therapy for superficial bladder cancer. Although generally safe and well tolerated, they may cause a range of different, local, and systemic complications. We present a patient treated with BCG instillations for three years, who was admitted to our hospital due to fever, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain and progressive dyspnea. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed massive bilateral ground glass opacities, partly consolidated, localized in the middle and lower parts of the lungs, bronchial walls thickening, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 as well as sputum, blood, and urine for general bacteriologywere negative. Initial empiric antibiotic therapy was ineffective and respiratory failure progressed. After a few weeks, a culture of M. tuberculosis complex was obtained from the patients specimens; the cultured strain was identified as Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Anti-tuberculous treatment with rifampin (RMP), isoniazid (INH) and ethambutol (EMB) was implemented together with systemic corticosteroids, resulting in the quick improvement of the patients clinical condition. Due to hepatotoxicity and finally reported resistance of the BCG strain to INH, levofloxacin was used instead of INH with good tolerance. Follow-up CT scans showed partial resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates. BCG infection in the lungs must be taken into consideration in every patient treated with intra-vesical BCG instillations and symptoms of protracted infection.","output":"Severe Respiratory Failure Due to Pulmonary BCGosis in a Patient Treated for Superficial Bladder Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers across the globe have attempted to understand how the health and socioeconomic crisis brought about by the coronavirus is affecting children's exposure to violence. Since containment measures have disrupted many data collection and research efforts, studies have had to rely on existing data or design new approaches to gathering relevant information. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the literature that has been produced on children's exposure to violence during the pandemic to understand emerging patterns and critically appraise methodologies to help inform the design of future studies. The article concludes with recommendations for future research. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study entailed a search of working papers, technical reports, and journal articles. METHODS: The search used a combination of search terms to identify relevant articles and reports published between March 1 and December 31, 2020. The sources were assessed according to scope and study design. RESULTS: The review identified 48 recent working papers, technical reports, and journal articles on the impact of COVID-19 on violence against children. In terms of scope and methods, the review led to three main findings: 1) Studies have focused on physical or psychological violence at home and less attention has been paid to other forms of violence against children, 2) most studies have relied on administrative records, while other data sources, such as surveys or big data, were less commonly employed, and 3) different definitions and study designs were used to gather data directly, resulting in findings that are hardly generalizable. With respect to children's experience of violence, the review led to four main findings: 1) Studies found a decrease in police reports and referrals to child protective services, 2) mixed results were found with respect to the number of calls to police or domestic violence helplines, 3) articles showed an increase in child abuse-related injuries treated in hospitals, and 4) surveys reported an increase in family violence. CONCLUSIONS: This review underscores the persistent challenges affecting the availability and quality of data on violence against children, including the absence of standards for measuring this sensitive issue as well as the limited availability of baseline data. Future research on COVID-19 and violence against children should address some of the gaps identified in this review.","output":"COVID-19 and violence against children: A review of early studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We first examined the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory viral infections a year previous. Second, we examined the concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the contemporaneous medical notes.Methods:: This case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus a year previous). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker).

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to describe the impact of COVID-19 emergency on pharmaceutical care provided by pharmacists during the first wave of the pandemic. Issues related to pharmacist's involvement in the pandemic management were: changes in activities, support received by authorities and pharmacists' own perceived role in the Health System. METHODS A cross-sectional study based on a web survey was conducted between May and June 2020 collecting information from pharmacists, members of Italian Society of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics. 113 (11.4%) completed the questionnaire. The cohort was divided in 2 arms: pharmacists who worked in severely COVID-19 affected areas (High Spread Regions) and those employed in less affected areas (Low Spread Regions). RESULTS The changes in pharmacy work settings reflected the increase of logistics area and non-sterile clinical galenic, and reduction of clinical tasks. The most demanding challenge was referred to shortages of medical devices and drugs, 61/113 pharmacists reported difficulty in obtaining products compliant to quality standards. National Institutions and Regional Governments provided a greater perceived support. More than 50% of participants felt that their role did not change if compared to other health professionals. CONCLUSIONS Despite some limitations related to their clinical activity, pharmacists played a crucial role in supplying personal protective equipment, medical devices and medications to improve health outcomes during this emergency.

It is essential to establish the best practices in animal care and an efficient way to stop and prevent infectious diseases that impact animal husbandry. So far, the greatest way to combat the disease is to adopt a vaccine policy. In the fight against infectious diseases, vaccines are very popular. Vaccination's fundamental concept is to utilize particular antigens, either endogenous or exogenous to induce immunity against the antigens or cells. In light of how past emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and pandemics were handled, examining the vaccination methods and technological platforms utilized for the animals may provide some useful insights. New vaccine manufacturing methods have evolved because of developments in technology and medicine and our broad knowledge of immunology, molecular biology, microbiology, and biochemistry, among other basic science disciplines. Genetic engineering, proteomics, and other advanced technologies have aided in implementing novel vaccine theories, resulting in the discovery of new ruminant vaccines and the improvement of existing ones. Subunit vaccines, recombinant vaccines, DNA vaccines, and vectored vaccines are increasingly gaining scientific and public attention as the next generation of vaccines and are being seen as viable replacements to conventional vaccines.

Although being a reasonable measure to counteract the COVID-19 contamination, the restrictive measures have limited individual's ability to perform exercise outdoors or in gyms and similar facilities, thus raising the risks for chronic health conditions related to a sedentary lifestyle. The recent exercise recommendations to counteract the potential deleterious effects of COVID-19-related lockdown have not fully addressed resistance exercise interventions as potential home-based exercise strategies. Additionally, the following questions have been constantly raised: (1) Is training status capable of protecting an individual from COVID-19 infection?; and (2) Can a single endurance or resistance exercise session acutely increase the risks for COVID-19 infection? Therefore, the current mini review aimed to focus on these two concerns, as well as to discuss the potential use of practical blood flow restriction and no load resistance training as possible resistance exercise strategies that could be performed during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Exercise: A Protective Measure or an Open Window for COVID-19?

Results from an online survey (N = 511) revealed that the vast majority (>90 percent) of respondents had very often or always practiced preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 such as washing their hands more regularly with soap and water, staying away from crowded places, and wearing face masks out in public. In addition, COVID-19 information seeking through the four types of digital media was a salient parameter that encouraged people to practice preventive behaviors either directly or indirectly. Specifically, seeking COVID-19-related information on MSNs, SLSSs, and online news media was directly associated with preventive behaviors. Whereas COVID-19 information consumption on social media, MSNs, and SLSSs during the infectious disease outbreak could elicit intense worry and, in turn, increase preventive behaviors.

There are only few works targeted pathological x-ray images. Most of the works targeted only single disease detection which is not good enough. Some works have provided for all classes however the results suffer due to lack of data for rare classes and data unbalancing problem. METHODS: Due to arise of COVID-19 virus medical facilities of many countries are overwhelmed and there is a need of intelligent system to detect it. There have been few works regarding detection of the coronavirus but there are many cases where it can be misclassified as some techniques do not provide any goodness if it can only identify type of diseases and ignore the rest.

METHODS: Using a natural language processing model, we retrospectively categorized reported findings of 12,346 brain MRI examinations performed during 6-month pre-pandemic and early pandemic time periods across a large metropolitan health system into three acuity levels: 1, normal or near normal; 2, incidental or chronic findings not requiring a management change; and 3, new or progressive findings requiring a management change. Brain MRI frequency and imaging finding acuity level were compared over time. RESULTS: Between March and August of 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (early pandemic), our health system brain MRI examination volumes decreased 17.0% (6,745 vs. 5,601). Comparing calendar-matched 6-month periods, the proportion of higher acuity findings increased significantly (p <0.001) from pre-pandemic (22.5%, 43.6% and 34.0% in acuity level 1, 2, and 3, respectively) to early pandemic periods (19.1%, 40.9%, and 40.1%).

The BBB and AD benefit from statins, NSAIDs, oestrogen, melatonin and the Mediterranean diet. Polymicrobial involvement is supported by the upregulation of pathogen sensors/defenders (bacterial, fungal, viral) in the AD brain, blood or CSF.

Conventional aluminum adjuvant includes aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, and amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate (AAHS), which could effectively induce the humoral, and to a lesser extent, cellular immune responses. Their safety is widely accepted for a variety of vaccines. However, conventional alum adjuvant is not an ideal choice for a vaccine antigen with poor immunogenicity, especially the subunit vaccine in which cellular response is highly demanded. The outbreak of COVID-19 requires a delicately designed vaccine without the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect to ensure the safety. A sufficiently powerful adjuvant that can induce both Th1 and Th2 immune responses is necessary to reduce the risk of ADE. These circumstances all bring new challenges to the conventional alum adjuvant. However, turning conventional microscale alum adjuvant into nanoscale is a new solution to these problems. Nanoscale alum owns a higher surface volume ratio, can absorb much more antigens, and promote the ability to stimulate the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via different mechanisms.

A total of 1,054 Jordanian adolescents aged 12-18 completed and returned the survey. Overall, Jordanian adolescents showed a good base of knowledge regarding COVID-19 (regardless of their demographic characteristics) and tended to hold positive attitudes toward the country's curfew and other protective measures. The majority of adolescents reported that television and social media were their main source of information on COVID-19, while few reported receiving such information from their schools.

To address this, vaccine candidates have been designed based on the relatively conserved HA stem domain and have shown protective efficacy in animal models. Oligomerization of the antigens either by fusion to oligomerization motifs or display on self-assembling nanoparticle scaffolds, can induce more potent immune responses compared to the corresponding monomeric antigen due to multivalent engagement of B-cells. Since nanoparticle display can increase manufacturing complexity, and often involves one or more mammalian cell expressed components, it is important to characterize and compare various display and oligomerization scaffolds. Using a structure guided approach, we successfully displayed multiple copies of a previously designed soluble, trimeric influenza stem domain immunogen, pH1HA10, on the ferritin like protein, MsDps2 (12 copies), Ferritin (24 copies) and Encapsulin (180 copies). All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. The nanoparticle fusion immunogens were found to be well folded and bound to the influenza stem directed broadly neutralizing antibodies with high affinity. An 8.5 ? Cryo-EM map of Msdps2-pH1HA10 confirmed the successful design of the nanoparticle fusion immunogen. Mice immunization studies with the soluble trimeric stem and nanoparticle fusion constructs revealed that all of them were immunogenic, and protected mice against homologous (A/Belgium/145-MA/2009) and heterologous (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) challenge with 10MLD50 mouse adapted virus. Although nanoparticle display conferred a small but statistically significant improvement in protection relative to the soluble trimer in a homologous challenge, heterologous protection was similar in both nanoparticle-stem immunized and trimeric stem immunized groups.

The estimated mean incubation period was 4.6 days (95% CI, 3.8 to 5.8 days). Mean time from symptom onset to hospitalization varied between 2 and 8 days, decreasing over the course of the epidemic. Mean time from onset to death was 23.7 days (CI, 22.0 to 25.3 days), and mean time from onset to discharge was 26.5 days (CI, 25.8 to 27.2 days). Increasing age, male sex, atypical presenting symptoms, presence of comorbid conditions, and high lactate dehydrogenase level on admission were associated with a greater risk for death. LIMITATIONS Estimates of the incubation period relied on statistical assumptions because few patients had known exposure times. Temporal changes in case management as the epidemic progressed, unavailable treatment information, and several potentially important factors that could not be thoroughly analyzed because of the limited sample size complicate interpretation of factors related to case fatality.

The study of these processes has led to the identification of a number of proteins that mediate this process. These proteins are classified according to their structure, which vary according to the viral genealogy. To date, three classes of fusion proteins have been defined, but current evidence points to the existence of additional classes. Despite their structural differences, viral fusion processes follow a common mechanism through which they exert their actions. Additional studies of the viral fusion proteins have demonstrated the key role of specific proteinogenic subsequences within these proteins, termed fusion peptides. Such peptides are able to interact and insert into membranes for which they hold interest from a pharmacological or therapeutic viewpoint. Here, the different characteristics of fusion peptides derived from viral fusion proteins are described. These criteria are useful to identify new fusion peptides. Moreover, this review describes the requirements of synthetic fusion peptides derived from fusion proteins to induce fusion by themselves. Several sequences of the viral glycoproteins E1 and E2 of HCV were, for example, identified to be able to induce fusion, which are reviewed here.","output":"Identification and Characteristics of Fusion Peptides Derived From Enveloped Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The aim of the present study was to assess bioactive compounds found in Tulsi as potential COVID-19 Mpr inhibitor using molecular docking and to provide scientific justification in term of its active ingredient to target protein for prevention and symptomatic treatment of COVID-19. Methods: COVID-19 Mpr was docked with eight phytochemicals of Ocimum sanctum Linn. Using Autodock 4.2. Determination of active site and visualization of molecular interactions between ligands and target enzyme was done by Biovia Discovery Studio 4.5. Results: Our result demonstrates that Vicenin, Caryophyllene, Cirsimaritin, Isothymusin and Isothymonin have a better binding affinity to target enzyme. However, only Vicenin exhibited better binding energy i.e.-7.02 kcal/mol to COVID-19 Main protease among other phytochemicals through some responsible interactions to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the human body, whereas Caryophyllene and Cirsimaritin exhibited similar binding affinity i.e.-6.46 kcal/mol but different interactions with target enzyme.

This study examined whether isometric exercise combined with whole body-electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) can improve serum cytokine levels, muscle strength, and knee function in elderly women with early knee OA. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled study included 75 participants assigned into three groups: the control group (CON), isometric exercise group (ISOM), and isometric exercise and electromyostimulation group (ISOM + EMS). The two exercise groups performed their respective programs for 8 weeks, 3 days a week, 30 min a day. The main exercises for both groups were performed continuously during the 20 min in an alternation of a 6-s contraction with a 4-s break. At pre- and post-intervention, anthropometric variables, muscle strength, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and blood sampling for biomarkers including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-, C-reactive protein, and resistin were performed. Results: All variables at pre-intervention showed no significant differences among the three groups. However, there were significant differences between groups for body composition, muscle strength, KOOS subscale scores, and biomarkers. ISOM + EMS group resulted in a significant reduction in body weight, fat mass, fat percentage, inflammatory cytokine levels, and increased muscle strength. An ISOM + EMS group had the best KOOS score among all groups.

Recently, the focus has been on the development of minimally invasive techniques in the form of single-incision laparoscopic surgery. The single-incision technique provides a less invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery, requiring only one incision disguised within the umbilical folds in contrast to the three to five incisions in conventional laparoscopic surgery. The availability of a number of specialised ports has aided the development of single-incision laparoscopic surgery, and led to its widespread use. The successful use of single-incision laparoscopic surgery has been reported for a number of surgical procedures, and offers several potential benefits versus conventional laparoscopic surgery, including reduced pain, reduced time to recovery and improved cosmesis. This review of international literature assesses the current status, as well as the experience, of single-incision laparoscopic surgery within general, colorectal, bariatric, metabolic, gynaecological and urological surgery.

Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the association of its Spike (S) protein with the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to invade host cells, we computationally redesigned the S protein sequence to improve its immunogenicity and antigenicity. Toward this purpose, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants that perturb the core protein sequence but keep the surface conformation and B cell epitopes. The T cell epitope content and similarity scores of the perturbed sequences were calculated and evaluated. Out of 22,914 designs with favorable stability energy, 301 candidates contained at least two pre-existing immunity-related epitopes and had promising immunogenic potential. The benchmark tests showed that, although the epitope restraints were not included in the scoring function of EvoDesign, the top S protein design successfully recovered 31 out of the 32 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, where two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. Moreover, the newly designed S protein introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes that do not exist in the wildtype SARS-CoV-2.

Although clinical outcomes are the ultimate measure of effectiveness, ex vivo biomechanical evaluation provides insights about the load-carrying capacity of the mesh-tissue complex in vivo. As such, the purpose of this study was to compare the short-term fixation strength of three unique non-penetrating methods of fixation: LifeMesh?, ProGrip?, and Tisseel?. Among these, LifeMesh? is a novel technology where large-pore, mid-weight polypropylene mesh is embedded in a dry matrix of porcine gelatin and microbial transglutaminase enzyme, providing self-fixation without the need for a separate adhesive application. METHODS Seven mongrel swine underwent implantation of two 4  7 cm pieces of either LifeMesh?, ProGrip?, or polypropylene mesh fixated with 2 mL of Tisseel?; 10 min after application, the samples were excised with the abdominal wall and stored for immediate biomechanical testing. The samples underwent lap shear testing to determine the short-term fixation strength of these three technologies. RESULTS ProGrip? demonstrated mean fixation strength of 1.3 N/cm (STE 0.2). Mean fixation for mesh fixated with Tisseel? was 2.6 N/cm (STE 0.5). LifeMesh? samples had mean fixation strength of 8.0 N/cm (STE 2.1). Analysis of variance testing showed that interfacial strength of LifeMesh? was significantly greater than that of either ProGrip? or Tisseel?. ProGrip? and Tisseel? were not significantly different from each other (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS Short-term strength of mesh fixation is an undescribed factor in hernia repair, but could have significant implications for early recurrence and mesh contraction. While further investigation is needed to define adequate interfacial strength, this comparison of non-penetrating mesh fixation methods shows that the novel LifeMesh? technology exhibits greater strength than other non-penetrating fixation techniques.","output":"Short-term strength of non-penetrating mesh fixation: LifeMesh?, Tisseel?, and ProGrip?."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Deterioration of indoor air quality (IAQ) might result from the current isolation due to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

METHODS: In the discovery cohort, the gene expression level of 84 lncRNAs were measured in the blood of 24 adult patients including healthy controls and patients with asthma and COPD. In the replication cohort the expression of 6 selected lncRNAs were measured in 163 subjects including healthy controls and adults with allergic rhinitis, asthma, COPD and children with asthma. It was evaluated whether these lncRNAs can be used as diagnostic biomarkers for any studied disease. With systems biology analysis the biological functions of the selected lncRNAs were predicted. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, the mean expression of 27 lncRNAs showed nominally significant differences in at least one comparison. OIP5-AS1, HNRNPU, RP11-325K4.3, JPX, RP11-282O18.3, MZF1-AS1 were selected for measurement in the replication cohort. Three lncRNAs (HNRNPU, RP11-325K4.3, JPX) expressed significantly higher in healthy children than in adult controls. All the mean expression level of the 6 lncRNAs differed significantly between adult allergic rhinitis patients and controls. RP11-325K4.3, HNRNPU and OIP5-AS1 expressed higher in allergic asthma than in non-allergic asthma. COPD and asthma differed in the expression of RP11-325K4.3 from each other. In examining of the lncRNAs as biomarkers the weighted accuracy (WA) values were especially high in the comparison of healthy controls and patients with allergic rhinitis. OIP5-AS1 and JPX achieved 0.98 and 0.9 WA values, respectively, and the combination of the selected lncRNAs also resulted in a high performance (WA = 0.98). Altogether, OIP5-AS1 had the highest discriminative power in case of three out of six comparisons. CONCLUSION: Differences were detected in the expression of circulating lncRNAs in chronic respiratory diseases. Some of these differences might be utilized as biomarkers and also suggest a possible role of these lncRNAs in the pathomechanism of these diseases. The lncRNAs and the associated pathways are potential therapeutic targets in these diseases, but naturally additional studies are needed for the confirmation of these results.","output":"Investigation of circulating lncRNAs as potential biomarkers in chronic respiratory diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Up to 36% of patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 require tracheostomy. While the literature recommends the use of multidisciplinary teams in the management of patients with tracheostomy for other diseases, little is known on the collaborative administration of physical therapy and speech language pathology services in the COVID-19 population. Purpose: We sought to determine the outcomes of a collaboration between physical therapy (PT) and speech language pathology (SLP) in the treatment of patients who underwent tracheostomy placement as part of their treatment for COVID-19 at our facility. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case series on patients with COVID-19 who had a tracheostomy. We included patients who had undergone mechanical ventilation for 14 days or longer, had a surgical tracheostomy, been discharged from intensive care to a medical unit, and received PT and SLP referrals. We compiled retrospective data from electronic medical records, analyzing days from tracheostomy to achievement of PT and SLP functional milestones, including mobility, communication, and swallowing. Of six critically ill patients with COVID-19 who had tracheostomy placement at our facility, three met inclusion criteria: patient 1, a 33-year-old woman; patient 2, an 84-year-old man; and patient 3, an 81-year-old man. For all patients, PT interventions focused on breathing mechanics, secretion clearance, posture, sitting balance, and upper and lower extremity strengthening. SLP interventions focused on cognitive reorganization, verbal and nonverbal communication, secretion management, and swallowing function. Intensity and duration of the sessions were adapted according to patient response and level of fatigue. Results: We found that time to tracheostomy from intubation for the three patients was 23 days, 20 days, and 24 days, respectively. Time from tracheostomy insertion to weaning from ventilator was 9 days for patient 1, and 5 days for patient 2 and patient 3. Regarding time to achieve functional PT and SLP milestones, all patients achieved upright sitting with PT prior to achieving initial SLP milestone of voicing with finger occlusion. Variations in progression to swallowing trials were patient specific and due to respiratory instability, cognitive deficits, and limitations in production of an effortful swallow. Patient participation in therapy sessions improved following establishment of oral verbal communication. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary cooperation and synchronized implementation of PT and SLP interventions in three COVID-19 patients following prolonged intubation facilitated participation in treatment and achievement of functional milestones.

Whereas yeast mRNAs have no additional modifications to the cap, called cap0, higher eukaryotes are methylated at the 2'-O-ribose of the first or the first and second transcribed nucleotides, called cap1 and cap2, respectively. In the present study, we identify the methyltransferase responsible for cap1 formation in human cells, which we call hMTr1 (also known as FTSJD2 and ISG95). We show in vitro that hMTr1 catalyzes specific methylation of the 2'-O-ribose of the first nucleotide of a capped RNA transcript.

Structured personnel questionnaires, meeting minutes and workshop notes were thematically analysed to elucidate barriers and solutions.RESULT: Of 3,682 (85.3%) adult rifampicin (RIF) resistant index cases with pre-screening outcomes, 1597 (43.4%) reported having no children under 5 years in the household and 562 (15.3%) were RIF-monoresistant. More than nine index cases were pre-screened for each child enrolled. Numerous barriers to recruitment were identified. Thorough recruitment planning, customised tracking data systems, a dedicated recruiting team with strong leadership, adequate resources to recruit across large geographic areas, and excellent relationships with routine TB services emerged as key factors to ensure successful recruitment.CONCLUSION: Recruitment of children into MDR-TB prevention trials can be difficult.

This was done by Conceptualising the characteristics of the service provider and technology characteristics as the two dimensions that could influence merchant adoption of mobile payments. The study was done through the lenses of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Trust-Theoretic Model and adopted a qualitative approach where two merchants were selected from the health sector. The findings demonstrate that the role of merchant trust is very critical for adoption due to m-payment technology and security risk. Hence, sufficient trust-building structures in mobile payment space are essential for the adoption of mobile payment by merchants. Moreover, the findings indicate mobile service provider characteristics and the mobile technology characteristics are both imperative toward building trust in mobile payment systems for merchants adoption. The study also found that the trust of both technology and service provider has a far more critical influence on merchants adoption of mobile payments than perceived usefulness or ease of use. The study, therefore, recommends that service providers should consider the opportunity to nurture merchant trust because merchant trust acts as a fundamental enabler for the adoption of mobile payments.

Recent studies have highlighted the heterogeneity of airspace macrophages from healthy bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cystic fibrosis sputum. Understanding the heterogeneity and diverse roles played by AMs and recruited monocytes is critical for treating CF and other airway diseases. Objectives To identify and compare the cellular composition and functional diversity between CF and healthy airspace macrophages and monocytes. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 113,213 BAL cells from four healthy and three mild CF subjects. Transcriptional data and TotalSeq technology were used to confirm cell surface markers that distinguish resident AMs from recruited monocytes. Measurements and Main Results Unbiased clustering identified four AM superclusters based on the expression of APOC2 and IFI27 genes. Each supercluster contains four shared subclusters named after their differentially expressed gene(s): IGF1.AMs, CCL18.AMs, CXCL5.AMs, and Cholesterol.AMs. AM Supercluster 4 contained two additional subclusters. Beyond the superclusters, several additional AM clusters were identified: Chemokine, Metallothionein, Interferon, and Cycling AMs. Interestingly, the Chemokine cluster further divides into four subclusters, each selectively expressing a unique combination of chemokines. Lastly, minimal differences were observed between mild CF and healthy individuals in airspace cellular composition. Conclusions ScRNA-seq identified four AM superclusters. Several fundamental questions require further investigation, including these clusters locations, functions, transcription factors that regulate their distinct programming, and whether similar macrophage superclusters can be found in other organs.","output":"ScRNA-seq Expression of APOC2 and IFI27 Identifies Four Alveolar Macrophage Superclusters in Cystic Fibrosis and Healthy BALF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and study aims: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection spreading worldwide at an unprecedented rate Our aim was to assess the frequency of gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in COVID-19 Patients and methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies reporting clinical data about COVID-19 patients, published until 25th March 2020 The primary endpoint was the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 patients complaining of GI symptoms Secondary endpoints were the pooled prevalence of cases with COVID-19 positive stool samples, and of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients We used random-effects model for meta-analysis Results: Thirty-three studies were included in the meta-analysis Out of 4434 COVID-19 patients, the pooled prevalence of GI manifestations was 11 51% (95% CI : 8 16 to 15 35) The most frequent GI symptom was diarrhea (7 78% of cases ;95% CI : 5 05 to 11 04), followed by nausea/vomiting (3 57% ;95% CI : 1 87 to 5 80), poor appetite (2 39% ;95%CI : 0 55 ;5 46) and abdominal pain (0 78% ;95% CI : 0 26 to 1 57) Positivity for COVID-19 in stool samples was observed in 41 50% (95% CI : 17 70 to 67 65) of cases 11 85% (95% CI : 3 53 to 24 17) of COVID-19 patients remained asymptomatic Conclusions: The present meta-analysis shows that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients suffer from GI manifestations, as well as COVID-19 positivity in stool samples Asymptomatic patients need to be considered a further potential route of viral transmission ?

The role of local and global trade of live swine and swine-related products in disseminating PEDV remains unclear, especially in developing countries with complex swine production systems.

Within China, the provinces of Guangdong and Henan were identified as primary hubs for the spread of PEDV, for which we estimate live swine trade to play a very important role. On a global scale, the United States and China maintain the highest number of PEDV lineages. We estimate that, after an initial introduction out of China, the United States acted as an important source of PEDV introductions into Japan, Korea, China, and Mexico.

Sarcopenia has been considered a patient-specific imaging biomarker for predicting outcomes after cancer surgery. The present study aimed to evaluate whether preoperative sarcopenia was associated with postoperative outcomes and survival in patients that underwent liver resections. Sarcopenia, assessed by preoperative CT imaging, was present in two-thirds of patients. Independent risk factors for sarcopenia were age, male sex, ASA score  3, and malignancies. Based on CT assessment alone, sarcopenia had no impact on clinical outcomes or overall survival after hepatectomy. ABSTRACT: This retrospective observational study aimed to evaluate whether preoperative sarcopenia, assessed by CT imaging, was associated with postoperative clinical outcomes and overall survival in patients that underwent liver resections. Patients operated on between January 2014 and February 2020 were included. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was measured at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on preoperative CT scans. Preoperative sarcopenia was defined based on pre-established SMI cut-off values. The outcomes were postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay (LOS), and overall survival. Among 355 patients, 212 (59.7%) had preoperative sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia were significantly older (63.5 years) and had significantly lower BMIs (23.9 kg/m(2)) than patients without sarcopenia (59.3 years, p < 0.01, and 27.7 kg/m(2), p < 0.01, respectively). There was no difference in LOS (8 vs. 8 days, p = 0.75), and the major complication rates were comparable between the two groups (11.2% vs. 11.3%, p = 1.00). The median overall survival times were comparable between patients with sarcopenia and those without sarcopenia (15 vs. 16 months, p = 0.87). Based on CT assessment alone, preoperative sarcopenia appeared to have no impact on postoperative clinical outcomes or overall survival in patients that underwent liver resections. Future efforts should also consider muscle strength and physical performance, in addition to imaging, for preoperative risk stratification.","output":"Association between CT-Based Preoperative Sarcopenia and Outcomes in Patients That Underwent Liver Resections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the shift towards remote consultations in the medical field, including musculoskeletal (MSK) appointments. General practitioner (GP) registrars are now routinely conducting many MSK consultations remotely;however, very little is known of their level of confidence and satisfaction regarding this new and evolving scenario, or how this may impact patient management of patients. In this study, we aimed to understand GP registrars' level of confidence and satisfaction with respect to remote MSK consultations, and the perceived impact on patient management. Study design This study involved a cross-sectional online survey of GP registrars in the West Midlands, which was conducted in January 2021. Methods The survey asked for ranked responses to questions comparing face-to-face consulting methods with remote consulting, focusing on confidence, satisfaction, onward investigations, and referral activity. Statistical analysis was performed using the R software version 4.0. Results The overall survey response was 21.2% (n-312/1,471). Of the respondents, 85.9% of GP registrars had not received any training to prepare them for remote MSK consultations. GP registrars generally felt that they were more confident when treating patients face-to-face compared to remote consultations (p&lt;0.001). This was true for general MSK complaints as well as specific assessments of the hand, shoulder, spine, hip, knee, and ankle;36.2% of GP registrars were not satisfied and 51.0% thought that their patients were not satisfied with the current quality of remote MSK consultations. Of note, 77.6% of GP registrars said that they were more likely to request additional investigations, and 75.6% stated that they were more likely to refer patients to a specialist after a remote MSK consultation. Conclusion This study highlights the need for further training to better equip primary care doctors for remote MSK consultations.

To perform meta-analysis, the random effects model was used. To assess the statistical heterogeneity of the included studies, the I2 index was used, and 95% CI was estimated. Data analysis was performed by R software. RESULTS In the final analysis, 46 articles with the total sample size of 61 551 hospital staff members were included. Accordingly, anxiety prevalence among healthcare workers (HCWs) was 26.1% (95% CI 19% to 34.6%). The prevalence rates of anxiety in health technicians and medical students were 39% (95% CI 13% to 73%) and 36% (95% CI 15% to 65%), respectively, indicating a much higher prevalence than other hospital staff members. Furthermore, a positive significant relationship between prevalence of anxiety among HCWs and their age was approved (p<0.001).

Using a totally thoracoscopic approach, isolation of all left atrial arrhythmogenic substrate is achieved through the creation of 5 discrete but contiguous compartments, thereby enabling unambiguous verification with bidirectional block. Since no previous closed-chest procedure incorporates all these end points, an update on patient outcomes is reported. METHODS One hundred seventy-nine consecutive patients with antiarrhythmic drug-resistant AF (3 paroxysmal, 5 persistent, 171 longstanding persistent cases), known preoperatively for 5.7 (range 0.5 to 25) years, underwent the 5-box thoracoscopic Maze procedure. Only 1 patient suffered a serious procedural complication (sternotomy for pulmonary artery injury). Postoperative rhythm surveillance consisted of 1 week of continuous ambulatory monitoring at 3, 6, 13, and 24 months.

Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda inclusive, implemented lockdowns, curfew, banning of both private and public transport systems, and mass gatherings to minimize spread. Social control measures for COVID-19 are reported to increase violence and discrimination globally, including in Uganda as some may be difficult to implement resulting in the heavy deployment of law enforcement. Media reports indicated that cases of violence and discrimination had increased in Ugandas communities following the lockdown. We estimated the incidence and factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination among Ugandans during the COVID-19 lockdown to inform control and prevention measures. METHODS: In April 2020, we conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data under the International Citizen Project (ICP) to assess adherence to public health measures and their impact on the COVID-19 outbreak in Uganda. We analyzed data on violence and discrimination from the ICP study. We performed descriptive statistics for all the participants characteristics and created a binary outcome variable called experiencing violence and/or discrimination. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination. RESULTS: Of the 1726 ICP study participants, 1051 (58.8%) were males, 841 (48.7%) were currently living with a spouse or partner, and 376 (21.8%) had physically attended work for more than 3 days in the past week. Overall, 145 (8.4%) experienced any form of violence and/or discrimination by any perpetrator, and 46 (31.7%) of the 145 reported that it was perpetrated by a law enforcement officer.

Despite encouraging developments in Indigenous education since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a settler historical consciousness continues to pervade the modern discourse of Indigenous education, insofar as Indigenous knowledge is often perceived as outdated, irrelevant, or inferior to Western knowledge systems. This problematic misconception ignores the resilience, innovation, and adaptation that Indigenous peoples have demonstrated in the face of historical crises. This article offers an Indigenous perspective on crisis, grief, and renewal in the context of Covid-19 and advocates for the renewal of the Canadian curricular landscape.","output":"Covid-19 and In(di)genuity: Lessons from Indigenous resilience, adaptation, and innovation in times of crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human adenovirus (HAdV) can cause severe disease in certain at-risk populations such as newborns, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems Unfortunately, no FDA-approved anti-HAdV drug is currently available for treatment Within the nucleus of infected cells, the HAdV genome associates with histones and forms a chromatin-like structure during early infection, and viral gene expression appears regulated by cellular epigenetic processes Thus, one potential therapeutic strategy to combat HAdV disease may be to target the cellular proteins involved in modifying the viral nucleoprotein structure and facilitating HAdV gene expression and replication We have screened a panel of small molecules that modulate the activity of epigenetic regulatory proteins for compounds affecting HAdV gene expression Several of the compounds, specifically chaetocin, gemcitabine and lestaurtinib, reduced HAdV recovery by 100- to 1000-fold, while showing limited effect on cell health, suggesting that these compounds may indeed be promising as anti-HAdV therapeutics","output":"Identification of human adenovirus replication inhibitors from a library of small molecules targeting cellular epigenetic regulators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic that is currently ravaging the world.

Given the ubiquity of mobile phones, their use for health-care coupled with a biometric identification method, present a unique opportunity to address this challenge. Our research proposes an Android-based solution of an ear biometric tool for reliable identification. Unlike many popular biometric approaches (e.g., fingerprints, irises, facial recognition), ears are noninvasive and easily accessible on individuals across a lifespan. Our ear biometric tool uses a combination of hardware and software to identify a person using an image of their ear. The hardware supports an image capturing process that reduces undesired variability. The software uses a pattern recognition algorithm to transform an image of the ear into a unique identifier. We created three cross-sectional datasets of ear images, each increasing in complexity, with the final dataset representing our target use-case population of Zambian infants (N=224, aged 6days-6months). Using these datasets, we conducted a series of validation experiments, which informed iterative improvements to the system. Results of the improved system, which yielded high recognition rates across the three datasets, demonstrate the feasibility of an Android ear biometric tool as a solution to the persisting patient identification challenge.","output":"Project SEARCH (Scanning EARs for Child Health): validating an ear biometric tool for patient identification in Zambia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The operation of a bus rapid transit (BRT) station platform is a key factor that affects BRT system performance. As waiting passengers occupy more platform space than circulating passengers, evaluation of their distribution across the platform is important. Public transport systems have been affected by the global pandemic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This may have affected the waiting passenger distribution on BRT platform space. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the impact of COVID-19 on waiting passenger distribution on a platform during the peak period at an important station on the BRT system in Brisbane, Australia. Manual data collection was carried out before COVID-19 and during COVID-19. Waiting passenger counts in each case were evaluated separately to identify variation across the platform. The total waiting passenger count on the platform at a given time reduced significantly during COVID-19. To compare the two cases, data sets were normalized, and statistical analysis performed. The test results indicated that the distribution of waiting passengers during COVID-19 has significantly changed, bringing more waiting passengers into the platform center than the two ends, whereas before COVID-19, more waiting passengers were observed at the upstream half of the platform. There was also greater temporal variation across the whole platform during COVID-19. These findings were used to postulate the reasons behind the changes resulting from COVID-19, which affected platform operation.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Waiting Passenger Distribution on a Bus Rapid Transit Station Platform in Brisbane, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants complicates efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative for early detection of emerging variants, to trace the movement of variants, and to monitor effectiveness of countermeasures. Additionally, determining the amount of viable virus present in clinical samples is helpful to better understand the impact these variants have on viral shedding. In this study, we analyzed nasal swab samples collected between March 2020 and early November 2021 from a cohort of United States (U.S.) military personnel and healthcare system beneficiaries stationed worldwide as a part of the Defense Health Agency's (DHA) Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) program. SARS-CoV-2 quantitative real time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) positive samples were characterized by next-generation sequencing and a subset was analyzed for isolation and quantification of viable virus. Not surprisingly, we found that the Delta variant is the predominant strain circulating among U.S. military personnel beginning in July 2021 and primarily represents cases of vaccine breakthrough infections (VBIs). Among VBIs, we found a 50-fold increase in viable virus in nasal swab samples from Delta variant cases when compared to cases involving other variants. Notably, we found a 40-fold increase in viable virus in nasal swab samples from VBIs involving Delta as compared to unvaccinated personnel infected with other variants prior to the availability of approved vaccines.

However, due to organ shortage which is a universal phenomenon, most patients need to be maintained on a period of dialysis therapy before the prospect of transplantation. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) could be an ideal form of renal replacement therapy due to its favorable profile toward preservation of residual renal function, patient survival, lower overall burden on cardiovascular morbidity and infection risks. METHODS: With extensive experience in PD therapy from Hong Kong where PD-first is a mandatory health policy, we reviewed the literature and present current evidence that favors PD as an optimal form of bridging renal replacement therapy prior to kidney transplantation. RESULTS: PD provides a viable and advantageous form of renal reaplcement particularly in terms of preservation of residual renal function, patient survival and quality of life, and cost among many other factors. Potential misconceptions that PD-related peritonitis and dialysis inadequacy are potentially deterrent factors for initiating PD therapy are clarified. CONCLUSION: PD is a practical and noninferior form of renal replacement that serves as an ideal bridge from conservative therapy to kidney transplantation.","output":"Peritoneal dialysis: the ideal bridge from conservative therapy to kidney transplant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emerging reports suggest that new onset of smell or taste loss are potential early clinical markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it remains unclear as to what extent. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to systematically assess the prevalence of self-reported altered sense of smell or taste in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, overcoming the limitations of individual studies by meta-analysis of pooled data. METHODS: The databases Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and MedRxiv's set were searched from inception to the 4th May 2020. This study was conducted following the PRISMA checklist. RESULTS: 18 studies met the eligibility criteria out of the 171 initially screened citations. The overall prevalence of alteration of the sense of smell or taste was 47% , but estimates were 31% and 67% in severe and mild-to-moderate symptomatic patients, respec- tively. The loss of smell and taste preceded other symptoms in 20% of cases and it was concomitant in 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this meta-analysis, we recommend self-isolation and testing, where possible, for patients complaining smell or taste impairment during COVID-19 pandemic in order to prevent spread of disease and propose the inclusion of loss of smell and taste as recognized symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in the World Health Organization and other relevant regulatory body's lists.","output":"Self-reported alteration of sense of smell or taste in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis on 3563 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The US has among the world's strictest automobile emission standards, but it is now loosening them.

As AP1M2 was highly and differentially expressed in invasive breast carcinoma, the purpose of this study was to explore the association of AP1M2 gene with the survival, immune invasion, and tumor neoantigens of patients on a pan-cancer basis. METHODS: The expression and distribution of AP1M2 gene in tumor tissues and the corresponding normal control tissues were analyzed using the pan-cancer databases GTEx, CCLE, and TCGA. Kaplan-Meyer survival plots and proportional hazards model (COX) were employed to evaluate actions of AP1M2 on the clinical prognosis of tumor patients. Subsequently, the association of AP1M2 expression with immune invasion in different tumor types was explored. Simultaneously, the investigation of the interrelationship of AP1M2 and tumor neoantigens of the immune system, unstable microsatellite, DNA repair genes, and DNA methyltransferases were explored, and the mutation frequency of AP1M2 gene in diverse tumors was studied. Several tumor types were analyzed using gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA). RESULTS: AP1M2 was abundantly expressed in a wide range of cancers, and its expression level was positively correlated with the outcome of tumor victims. Through a study on AP1M2 action on clinical prognosis and immune infiltration in tumor patients, AP1M2 expression in breast-infiltrating carcinoma was found to be highly associated with patients' overall survival and infiltration levels of macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), and B cells. Also, AP1M2 expression was positively correlated with tumor immune neoantigens and microsatellite instability in breast invasive carcinoma. The effect of AP1M2 on tumors was analyzed by GSEA, and findings demonstrated that AP1M2 expression levels in most tumors influenced the activation of tumor-associated pathways and immune-associated pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AP1M2 expression levels are significantly correlated to patients' outcomes and levels of immune infiltration in most cancer types, including T cells (CD8+ and CD4+), macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DCs), particularly in breast cancer. The results indicate that AP1M2 may influence the tumor environment of invasive breast cancer patients and it may be a target contributing to early screening and treatment for breast cancer, helping improve the efficiency of early screening and overall survival rate in invasive breast cancer patients.","output":"System Analysis of Adaptor-Related Protein Complex 1 Subunit Mu 2 (AP1M2) on Malignant Tumors: A Pan-Cancer Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Angiosarcoma is a very rare malignancy, which varies based on the location and organ affected. A clinicopathological form of cutaneous angiosarcoma (CAS) involves the head: scalp, face, and neck. We report a 59-year-old female patient with CAS on the temporoparietal region of the scalp. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with lesions in the head area, which appeared suddenly in the last 6 months, (before her surgery). Excision was performed under general anesthesia for bleeding as indicated on the right temporal region. The excision procedure was carried out three times at various stages, and then closed with skin grafts. Pathological examination of the three excised tissues showed progression, leading to CAS. Based on the clinical picture and anatomical assessment, a consultation with the surgical oncology department was necessary for further treatment. DISCUSSION: Angiosarcoma has a high rate of progression. The onset of lesions, which are difficult to detect, does not often lead to progression. Other macroscopic features appear as bluish macules, which can be perceived as bruising. Wide surgical resection is the optimal treatment and is usually combined with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. This patient underwent gradual excision, based on bleeding in the right temporal lesion, along with progressive pain. CONCLUSION: Surgical is the preferred management for our patients. Determination of multimodality therapy as treatment for CAS requires assessment of all factors related to age and patient condition. Follow-up evaluation is carried out after palliative therapy C to observe the general condition of the patient, tumor progression, tendency for metastases, and excision of any remaining lesions.","output":"Cutaneous angiosarcoma: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We aimed to study whether social patterns of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection changed in France throughout the year 2020, in light to the easing of social contact restrictions. Methods: A population-based cohort of individuals aged 15 years or over was randomly selected from the national tax register to collect socio-economic data, migration history, and living conditions in May and November 2020. Home self-sampling on dried blood was proposed to a 10% random subsample in May and to all in November. A positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG result against the virus spike protein (ELISA-S) was the primary outcome. The design, including sampling and post-stratification weights, was taken into account in univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Of the 134,391 participants in May, 107,759 completed the second questionnaire in November, and respectively 12,114 and 63,524 were tested. The national ELISA-S seroprevalence was 4.5% [95%CI: 4.0%-5.1%] in May and 6.2% [5.9%-6.6%] in November. It increased markedly in 18-24-year-old population from 4.8% to 10.0%, and among second-generation immigrants from outside Europe from 5.9% to 14.4%. This group remained strongly associated with seropositivity in November, after controlling for any contextual or individual variables, with an adjusted OR of 2.1 [1.7-2.7], compared to the majority population. In both periods, seroprevalence remained higher in healthcare professions than in other occupations.

The objective was to determine whether a filamentous phage peptide library could be employed to allow the oligoclonal bands to select their own target epitopes. METHODS CSF IgG antibody from 14 patients with multiple sclerosis and 14 controls was used to select individual phage clones from a bacteriophage library containing approximately 4 x 10(7) different hexamers expressed on its surface pIII protein. The amino acid sequence selected was deduced by sequencing the DNA of the genetically engineered insert. RESULTS In general, after three rounds of selection, CSF from both patients with multiple sclerosis and controls selected one to two consistent peptide motifs. Five out of 14 patients with multiple sclerosis, and one control, selected the amino acid sequence motif, RRPFF. Given 20 possible amino acids per position, the likelihood of five patients selecting the same linear five amino acid sequence is at most 1.6 x 10(-3), corrected for the number of clones sequenced. A GenBank computer search showed that this sequence is found in the Epstein-Barr Virus nuclear antigen (EBNA-1), and a heat shock protein alphaB crystallin. Human serum antibodies to a synthetic peptide containing RRPFF were virtually exclusively found in patients with prior infection by Epstein-Barr virus. Other studies have suggested a relation between Epstein-Barr virus infection and multiple sclerosis, including nearly 100% Epstein-Barr virus seropositivity among patients with multiple sclerosis and increased concentrations of antibody to EBNA in CSF of patients with multiple sclerosis. By antigen specific immunoblotting, antibodies to the RRPFF motif in the CSF were shown to correspond to a subset of oligoclonal bands in the CSF from the same patient.

Additionally, post-traumatic stress was surprisingly common and possibly more enduring than depression, insomnia, and alcohol misuse. Predictions regarding COVID-19's economic impact suggest that depression and suicide rates may increase over time. Available data suggest that the mental health sequelae of COVID-19 will mirror those of previous pandemics. Clinicians and mental health leaders should focus planning efforts on the negative effects of isolation, particularly anxiety and distress, as well as post-traumatic stress symptoms.","output":"Planning for Mental Health Needs During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data from non-randomized studies have suggested that hydroxychloroquine could be an effective therapeutic agent against Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective cohort study involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed, mild to severe Covid-19 in a French university hospital. Patients who received hydroxychloroquine (200mg tid dosage for 10 days) on a compassionate basis in addition to SOCwere compared to patients without contraindications to hydroxychloroquine who received SOCalone. A propensity score-weighted analysis was performed to control for confounders: age, sex, time between symptom onset and admission &#8804; 7 days, Charlson comorbidity index, medical history of arterial hypertension, and obesity, NEWS2 score at admission, and pneumonia severity. The primary endpoint was time to unfavorable outcome, defined as: death, admission to an intensive care unit, or decision to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatments, whichever came first. RESULTS: Data from 89 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 were analyzed, 84 of whom were considered in the primary analysis; 38 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and 46 patients treated with SOCalone. At admission, the mean age of patients was 66 years, the median Charlson comorbidity index was 3, and the median NEWS2 severity score was 3. After propensity score weighting, treatment with hydroxycholoroquine was not associated with a significantly reduced risk of unfavorable outcome (HR 0.90 [0.38; 2.1], p = 0.81). Overall survival was not significantly different between the two groups (HR 0.89 [0.23; 3.47], p = 1). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adults with Covid-19, no significant reduction of the risk of unfavorable outcomes was observed with hydroxychloroquine in comparison to standard of care. Unmeasured confounders may however have persisted despite careful propensity-weighted analysis and the study might be underpowered. Ongoing controlled trials in patients with varying degrees of initial severity on a larger scale will help determine whether there is a place for hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19.","output":"Compassionate use of hydroxychloroquine in clinical practice for patients with mild to severe Covid-19 in a French university hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In light of the unprecedented public health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is highly important to acknowledge the psychological impact of this mounting threat on healthcare professionals.

RESULTS The first patient was a 50-year-old man who presented with anosmia, ageusia, right internuclear ophthalmoparesis, right fascicular oculomotor palsy, ataxia, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation and positive testing for GD1b-IgG antibodies. Five days before, he had developed a cough, malaise, headache, low back pain, and a fever. The second patient was a 39-year-old man who presented with ageusia, bilateral abducens palsy, areflexia and albuminocytologic dissociation. Three days before, he had developed diarrhea, a low-grade fever, and a poor general condition. The oropharyngeal swab test for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay was positive in both patients and negative in the cerebrospinal fluid. The first patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and the second, with acetaminophen. Two weeks later, both patients made a complete neurological recovery, except for residual anosmia and ageusia in the first case.

We conducted a 10-y (2010 to 2019) rainfall manipulation experiment in 12 0.48-ha field enclosures and found that moderate rainfall increases during the early rather than late growing season advanced the timing of peak reproduction and drove marked increases in population size through increasing the biomass of preferred plant species. By contrast, greatly increased rainfall produced no further increases in vole population growth due to the potential negative effect of the flooding of burrows. The increases in vole population size were more coupled with increased reproduction of overwintered voles and increased body mass of young-of-year than with better survival.

METHODS: Eighty-eight countries were selected based on their likelihood of providing reliable data. Using death rates/million for each country from the worldometer web site, a correlation analysis was done between death rates and a country's latitude. RESULTS: A highly significant, positive correlation was found between lower death rates and a country's proximity to the equator (Pearson r = .40 p<.0001, two-tailed t-test). The R squared of .16 means that 16% of the variation in death rates among nations is accounted for by the latitude of the country. Evidence is presented suggesting a direct correlation between sunlight exposure and reduced mortality. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to document a statistically significant correlation between a country's latitude and its COVID-19 mortality and is consistent with other research regarding latitude, Vitamin D deficiency, and COVID-19 fatalities.

A combination of serous, fibrinous and hemorrhagic inflammation was seen in most of the pulmonary alveoli with the engorgement of capillaries and detection of micro-thrombosis in some of these capillaries. Pulmonary alveoli thickened with interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, suffered diffuse alveolar damage, experienced desquamation of pneumocytes and had hyaline-membrane formation, fibrinoid materials, and erythrocytes in alveolar spaces. There were thromboembolisms in some bronchial arteries. Furthermore, hemorrhagic necrosis was also evident in lymph nodes and spleen with the attenuation of lymphocytes.

This study applied ultra-high resolution mass spectroscopy to investigate the degradation and transformation characteristics of refractory OM in mature landfill leachate at the molecular level (m/z = 150-800) during biological treatment (i.e., semi-aerobic aged refuse biofilter, SAARB) and subsequent chemical oxidation (i.e., the Fenton process and ozonation).

Compared with raw leachate, SAARB effluent (i.e., SAARB leachate) contained fewer organics with short carbon chains, more organics with long carbon chains, an elevated condensation degree for organics and, thus, a considerably reduced biodegradability. Although both the Fenton and ozonation processes could remove many of the polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols, ozone produced considerable amounts of aliphatic compounds with high bioavailability.

However, vaccines are only effective if a community collectively uptakes vaccination. This approach is growing increasingly difficult with the emergence of Vaccine Hesitancy. This paper aims to determine the association between university curricula and the degree of hesitancy for the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods The online questionnaire assessed demographic data, prior knowledge of vaccines, attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines using an adapted version of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) Working Groups Vaccine Hesitancy Survey (VHS) and factors likely to motivate vaccine uptake. By using binary scoring, the degree of hesitancy among students was determined. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on VHS revealed underlying causes of hesitancy. To analyze the dependence between hesitancy and curriculum, a chi-squared test was conducted. Results Medical students scored higher for prior knowledge of vaccines (M = 3.54) as opposed to non-medical students (M = 3.49). Medical students responded favorably to COVID-19 vaccines with only 1.37% showing hesitancy for all nine items of VHS, compared to 2.55% of non-medical students. EFA produced three subscales within the VHS: lack of confidence, risk factor concern, and misinformation. The lack of confidence factor accounted for 65% of the data obtained. The chi-square test solidified that vaccine hesitancy is dependent on curriculum. Conclusion The majority of non-medical students showed hesitancy towards obtaining COVID-19 vaccines compared to medical students who were more willing, largely owing to their knowledge and understanding of vaccines.","output":"Determination of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among University Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveThe severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic claiming more than 4 million lives worldwide.

Despite relatively lower numbers of cases initially, many African countries are now experiencing an exponential increase in case numbers. Estimates of the progression of disease and potential impact of different interventions are needed to inform policy making decisions. Herein, we model the possible trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in 52 African countries under different intervention scenarios. Design We developed a compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to estimate the COVID-19 case burden for all African countries while considering four scenarios: no intervention, moderate lockdown, hard lockdown, and hard lockdown with continued restrictions once lockdown is lifted. We further analyzed the potential impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations affected by HIV/AIDS and TB. Results In the absence of an intervention, the most populous countries had the highest peaks in active projected number of infections with Nigeria having an estimated 645,081 severe infections. The scenario with a hard lockdown and continued post-lockdown interventions to reduce transmission was the most efficacious strategy for delaying the time to the peak and reducing the number of cases. In South Africa projected peak severe infections increase from 162,977 to 203,261, when vulnerable populations with HIV/AIDS and TB are included in the analysis. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across the African continent.

Rapid and radical changes were implemented, with midwives facing anxiety and moral distress if not able to provide optimal and woman-centred care in line with professional values. BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals stress and burnout are commonly reported during other global emergencies, which may eventually contribute to reduced quality of care. There is lack of evidence of the challenges faced by midwives in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: To explore midwives experiences of providing care to women and families during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Qualitative interpretive phenomenological approach, using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. The sample included 15 midwives. Ethical approval was obtained. FINDINGS: Four themes were identified: 1) adjusting to the ever-evolving organisation of care; 2) physical, psychological and relational challenges; 3) support network; 4) deferred sense of awareness. DISCUSSION: Midwives faced professional and personal challenges during the pandemic, displaying feelings of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, discomfort, lack of support and knowledge with potential long-term effects. Adjusting to the continuous, rapid and drastic re-organisation of maternity services was particularly challenging. Factors facilitating a safe, supportive and empowering workplace included support from colleagues and managers, access to appropriate PPE, reliable guidelines, good communication and emotional support. Positive aspects of personal and professional development included communication skills, establishment of trusting relationships, sense of empowerment and teamwork.

We used a new method (richness, diversity, evenness, and similarity analyses) to classify cities according to the occupational classification of hepatitis E patients across regions in China and compared the results of cluster analysis. Methods: Data on reported hepatitis E cases from 2008 to 2018 were collected from 24 cities (9 in Jilin Province, 13 in Jiangsu Province, Xiamen City, and Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture). Traditional statistical methods were used to describe the epidemiological characteristics of hepatitis E patients, while the new method and cluster analysis were used to classify the cities by analyzing the occupational composition across regions. Results: The prevalence of hepatitis E in eastern China (Jiangsu Province) was similar to that in the south (Xiamen City) and southwest of China (Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture), but higher than that in the north (Jilin Province). The age of hepatitis E patients was concentrated between 41 and 60 years, and the sex ratio ranged from 1:1.6 to 1:3.4. Farming was the most highly prevalent occupation; other sub-prevalent occupations included retirement, housework and unemployment. The incidence of occupations among migrant workers, medical staff, teachers, and students was moderate. There were several occupational types with few or no records, such as catering industry, caregivers and babysitters, diaspora children, childcare, herders, and fishing (boat) people. The occupational similarity of hepatitis E was high among economically developed cities, such as Nanjing, Wuxi, Baicheng, and Xiamen, while the similarity was small among cities with large economic disparities, such as Nanjing and Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture. A comparison of the classification results revealed more similarities and some differences when using these two methods. Conclusion: In China, the factors with the greatest influence on the prevalence of hepatitis E are living in the south, farming as an occupation, being middle-aged or elderly, and being male. The 24 cities we studied were highly diverse and moderately similar in terms of the occupational distribution of patients with hepatitis E. We confirmed the validity of the new method on in classifying cities according to their occupational composition by comparing it with the clustering method.","output":"Hepatitis E in 24 Chinese Cities, 2008C2018: A New Analysis Method for the Disease's Occupational Characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to examine the prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes, both short-term and long-term, among SARS patients, healthcare workers and the general public of SARS-affected regions, and to examine the protective and risk factors associated with these mental health outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature using databases such as Medline, Pubmed, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science Core Collection, CNKI, the National Central Library Online Catalog and dissertation databases to identify studies in the English or Chinese language published between January 2003 to May 2020 which reported psychological distress and mental health morbidities among SARS patients, healthcare workers, and the general public in regions with major SARS outbreaks. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 6984 titles. Screening resulted in 80 papers for the review, 35 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of post-recovery probable or clinician-diagnosed anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among SARS survivors were 19, 20 and 28%, respectively. The prevalence of these outcomes among studies conducted within and beyond 6 months post-discharge was not significantly different. Certain aspects of mental health-related quality of life measures among SARS survivors remained impaired beyond 6 months post-discharge. The prevalence of probable depressive disorder and PTSD among healthcare workers post-SARS were 12 and 11%, respectively. The general public had increased anxiety levels during SARS, but whether there was a clinically significant population-wide mental health impact remained inconclusive. Narrative synthesis revealed occupational exposure to SARS patients and perceived stigmatisation to be risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers, although causality could not be determined due to the limitations of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: The chronicity of psychiatric morbidities among SARS survivors should alert us to the potential long-term mental health complications of covid-19 patients. Healthcare workers working in high-risk venues should be given adequate mental health support. Stigmatisation against patients and healthcare workers should be explored and addressed. The significant risk of bias and high degree of heterogeneity among included studies limited the certainty of the body of evidence of the review.","output":"History for some or lesson for all?

This has been a key driver for the establishment of new waste management options, particularly in the UK, which in the past relied heavily on landfill for the disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW in the UK is managed by Local Authorities, some of which in a less conventional way have been encouraging the installation and use of household food waste disposal units (FWDs) as an option to divert food waste from landfill. This study aimed to evaluate the additional burden to water industry operations in the UK associated with this option, compared with the benefits and related savings from the subsequent reductions in MSW collection and disposal. A simple economic analysis was undertaken for different FWD uptake scenarios, using the Anglian Region as a case study. Results demonstrated that the significant savings from waste collection arising from a large-scale uptake of FWDs would outweigh the costs associated with the impacts to the water industry. However, in the case of a low uptake, such savings would not be enough to cover the increased costs associated with the wastewater provision. As a result, this study highlights the need for policy intervention in terms of regulating the use of FWDs, either promoting them as an alternative to landfill to increase savings from waste management, or banning them as a threat to wastewater operations to reduce potential costs to the water industry.","output":"Food waste disposal units in UK households: the need for policy intervention."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"3CL protease is one of the key proteins expressed by SARS-Coronavirus-2 cell, the potential to be targeted in the discovery of antivirus during this COVID-19 pandemic This protein regulates the proteolysis of viral polypeptide essential in forming RNA virus 3CL protease (3CLpro) was commonly targeted in the previous SARS-Coronavirus including bat and MERS, hence, by blocking this protein activity, the coronavirus should be eradicated This study aims to review the potency of biflavonoid as the SARS-Coronavirus-2 3CLpro inhibitor The review was initiated by describing the chemical structure of biflavonoid and followed by listing its natural source Instead, the synthetic pathway of biflavonoid was also elaborated The 3CLpro structure and its function were also illustrated followed by the list of its 3D-crystal structure available in a protein data bank Lastly, the pharmacophores of biflavonoid have been identified as a protease inhibitor, was also discussed This review hopefully will help researchers to obtain packed information about biflavonoid which could lead to the study in designing and discovering a novel SARS-Coronavirus-2 drug by targetting the 3CLpro enzyme","output":"Biflavonoid as potential 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitor of SARS-Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the COVID-19 pandemic struck the United States in early 2020, few healthcare workers were prepared for what lay ahead Dermatology nurses, medical assistants, and nurse practitioners experienced rapid changes in the way they conducted their daily practice This article discusses many of those changes and explores the challenges these healthcare workers faced and continue to face Almost every aspect of how dermatologic care was delivered prepandemic was affected Some dermatology nurses, medical assistants, and nurse practitioners were redeployed to COVID-19 testing tents and inpatient hospital units or were asked to perform tasks to help support other healthcare workers This article explores how clinical practice, dermatology staff, patient care, and education were affected These changes forced dermatology healthcare workers to be brave, accept risks, and ultimately grow from these experiences","output":"Reflections of COVID-19 on Dermatology Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we tried to see and characterize potential threats to digital activism in the internet-active nation of Indonesia by doing network analysis on a recent digital activism event on Twitter, which protested against a recent law related to alcoholic beverage investment.

We evaluated changes in clinical presentation and treatment patterns in multiple myeloma (MM) during the early COVID-19 period compared to historical pre-COVID periods. Methods: Using the nationwide Flatiron Health EHR-derived de-identified database, we compared clinical presentation and treatment patterns in the immediate post-COVID period (2020) to a comparable pre-COVID period (2018 and 2019). We focused on two separate clinical settings: 1) patients newly diagnosed with MM during February-June in the years of interest (NEWPT) with evidence of management within 90 days and follow-up for 7 months; and 2) patients diagnosed with MM during 2014-2019 receiving active treatment as of February (2018, 2019, 2020, ACTIVE) and follow-up for 11 months. Delayed clinical presentation was assessed using baseline (90 days before diagnosis/index date) measures of ISS stage, ECOG performance status, anemia, and kidney function. We examined treatment patterns (choice of regimen) of both cohorts in the two time periods. We compared clinical features of initial presentation in pre-COVID and COVID period using Pearson's  2 test. For NEWPT, we also utilized Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test to compare time to treatment initiation between the two periods. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model with death as a competing risk was used to determine impact of COVID on treatment initiation by adjusting sex, age at diagnosis, race, insurance, stage, baseline ECOG, and hospital setting. All analyses were conducted in SAS (Version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) with 2 sided tests and a type I error of 5%. Results: Our study included 1319 NEWPT (964 pre-COVID and 355 COVID) and 2206 ACTIVE (1014 pre-COVID and 1192 COVID) patients. In the NEWPT cohort, we observed no differences between the pre-COVID and COVID periods in terms of baseline characteristics, including clinical features like stage, ECOG performance status, anemia or kidney function (Table A). Patients in the pre-COVID period were more likely to initiate any treatment (91.1% vs 86.2%, p<.01). Median time to treatment initiation was 30 days pre-Covid and 32 days during the Covid period (log-rank test p=0.04, Figure A). After adjusting for patient demographic, clinical features (extent of anemia, hypercalcemia, kidney dysfunction), and hospital variables (US region, practice type academic vs community), the difference between the two periods was not significant (COVID vs pre-COVID hazard ratio=0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.10, p=0.07). In NEWPT cohort, compared with their pre-COVID counterparts, patients in COVID period were more likely to receive monoclonal antibody (mAb) (14.4% vs 4.8%, p<.01, Figure B) and used IMID-based regimen as their first line of therapy (80.4% vs 74.3%, p<.01). In ACTIVE cohort, more patients in the pre-COVID period were anemic (Hemoglobin <10 g/L, 14.9% vs 9.7%, p<.01) at baseline than those in the COVID period. As in NEWPT cohort, ACTIVE patients in the COVID period used mAb-based regimen more commonly (28.9% vs 16.9%, p<.01) (Figure C). In addition, fewer ACTIVE treatment patients in the COVID period received cyclophosphamide regimens (7.9% vs 15.1% p<.01). Conclusions: During early COVID-19 pandemic we did not observe evidence of delayed diagnosis or more advanced stage, anemia or kidney disease for NEWPT with MM. MM treatment patterns were notable for higher utilization of mAb, IMID-based therapies and decreased use of cyclophosphamide regimens, without significant change in time to treatment initiation. Reassuringly, changes in treatment-patterns during COVID pandemic were modest, some likely reflecting changes in MM treatment landscape (advances in mAb regimens) rather than direct impact of COVID. Further studies are needed to understand how these changes evolve and affect clinical outcomes over time beyond 2020.

Several societies are now emphasizing its role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate how variations in social trust across 68 countries are related to the transmission speed of COVID-19. Specifically, using cross-national index data from the World Value Survey, the study tests how variations in social trust across countries generate different time durations at which each country reaches the peak in terms of increases in new infections of COVID-19. Using data drawn between December 31, 2019 and July 31, 2020, this study found that in countries with a high level of social trust, particularly trust among ingroup members, or with a narrower or wider range than the intermediate range of trustees, the number of new infections tended to reach the first peak within a shorter time duration than in other countries. These results imply that in such societies, on the one hand, high cooperation among people to achieve common goals and strong compliance to social norms may allow them to begin neutralizing COVID-19 faster. On the other hand, however, the low risk perception and prevalence of cohesive relationships among people may lead to speedier transmission of COVID-19 before neutralization takes place.","output":"Does social trust slow down or speed up the transmission of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effect of early application of social distancing interventions on Covid-19 cumulative mortality during the first pandemic wave. METHODS: Ecological longitudinal study using multivariable negative binomial regression for panel data. Daily numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths, and data on social distancing interventions, for the 37 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) were analysed. RESULTS: Covid-19 cumulative mortality over the first pandemic wave varied widely across countries (range, 4.16 to 855 deaths per million population). On average, one-day delay in application of mass gatherings ban was associated with an adjusted increase in Covid-19 cumulative mortality by 6.97% (95% CI, 3.45 to 10.5), whilst a one-day delay in school closures was associated with an increase of 4.37% (95% CI, 1.58 to 7.17) over the study period. We estimated that if each country had enacted both interventions one week earlier, Covid-19 cumulative mortality could have been reduced by an average of 44.1% (95% CI, 20.2 to 67.9).

The development of cost-effective vaccines seems to be the only solution to terminate this Pandemic. However, the vaccines effectiveness has been questioned due to recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Most of the mutations are associated with the spike protein, a vital target for several marketed vaccines. Many Countries were highly affected by the 2nd wave of the SARS-CoV-2, like the UK, India, Brazil, France. Experts are also alarming the further COVID-19 wave with the emergence of Omicron, which is highly affecting the South African populations. This review encompasses the detailed description of all vaccine candidates and COVID-19 mutants that will add value to design further studies to combat the COVID-19 Pandemic. METHODS: The information was generated using various search engines like google scholar, PubMed, clinicaltrial.gov.in, WHO database, ScienceDirect, and news portals by using keywords SARS-CoV-2 Mutants, COVID-19 Vaccines, Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines, COVID-19 waves. RESULTS: This review has highlighted the evolution of SARS-CoV2 variants and the vaccine efficacy. Currently, various vaccine candidates are also undergoing several phases of development. Their efficacy still needs to check for newly emerged variants. We have focused on the evolution, multiple mutants, waves of the SARS-CoV-2, and different marketed vaccines undergoing various clinical trials and the design of the trials to determine vaccine efficacy. CONCLUSION: Various mutants of SARS-CoV-2 arrived, mainly concerned with the spike protein, a key component to design the vaccine candidates. Various vaccines are undergoing clinical trial and show impressive results, but their efficacy still needs to be checked in different SARS-CoV-2 mutants. We discussed all mutants of SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccine's efficacy against them. The safety concern of these vaccines is also discussed. It is important to understand how coronavirus gets mutated to design better new vaccines, providing long-term protection and neutralizing broad mutant variants. A proper study approach also needs to be considered while designing the vaccine efficacy trials, which further improved the study outcomes.

Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the mouse, provides animal models for the study of central nervous system disease, including encephalitis and demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and for hepatitis. While there are many studies of the adaptive immune response to MHV, there has until recently been scant information on the type I interferon (IFN) response to MHV. The relationship between MHV and the IFN-/ response is paradoxical. While the type I IFN response is a crucial aspect of host defense against MHV in its natural host, there is little if any induction of IFN following infection of mouse fibroblast cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, MHV is relatively resistant to the antiviral effects of IFN-/ in mouse fibroblast cell lines and in human 293T cells. MHV can, under some circumstances, compromise the antiviral effects of IFN signaling. The nucleocapsid protein as well as the nsp1 and nsp3 proteins of MHV has been reported to have IFN antagonist activity. However, in primary cell types such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and macrophages, IFN is induced by MHV infection and an antiviral state is established. Other primary cell types such as neurons, astrocytes and hepatocytes fail to produce IFN following infection and, in vivo, likely depend on IFN produced by pDCs and macrophages for protection from MHV. Thus MHV induction of IFN-/ and the ability to induce an antiviral state in response to interferon is extremely cell type dependent. IFN induced protection from MHV pathogenesis likely requires the orchestrated activities of several cell types, however, the cell types involved in limiting MHV replication may be different in the

Most of them have challenges that make it difficult to settle in a university life. This issue is also compounded by the gap that exists between school and university. These challenges lead to poor retention, poor academic performance and participation. First year students often find the curriculum, workload, academic integration and adapting to the environment overwhelming. The purpose of the study is to explore and describe how a few colleagues in engineering conceived and initiated a mentorship programme to assist the first year Mechanical and Industrial Technology students in 2021. This is a case study where the inception of the mentoring programme is the case at hand. The approach is to study and analyze minutes, field notes and any documents that contains the information on how the colleagues deliberated and finally implemented the programme. From the data, it can be seen that there was a deliberate effort and drive to start a mentorship programme. A manual, describing the nature of the programme was drawn up which included a training manual to be followed. The process was a collective one. A decision was taken that a one-to-many mentoring programme using senior students was the best approach. The recruitment process was clearly outlined. The programme was conceived, deliberated and finally rolled out. About a hundred first year students from both Mechanical and Industrial Technology Degrees were in the programme. The fact that a group of academics formed a committee and joined forces in this initiative is worth noting. There is a view that the Mentorship Training Manual is generic to the type of student that is enrolled in a South African university. Even though face to face lectures and activities are prohibited due to Covid-19, the committee and the mentors found ways to start the programme.

The aim of this study was to assess and compare current practice and knowledge regarding PSM and examine satisfaction with available treatment options and need for alternative therapies in North Africa. METHODS: This is a qualitative study involving specialists participating in PSM management in North Africa. The survey analyzed demographic characteristics and current knowledge and opinions regarding PSM management in different institutions. We also looked at goals and priorities, satisfaction with treatment modalities and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) usefulness according to specialty, country, years of experience, and activity sector. RESULTS: One-hundred and three participants responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), including oncologists and surgeons. 59.2% of respondents had more than 10 years experience and 45.6% treated 20C50 PSM cases annually. Participants satisfaction with PSM treatment modalities was mild for gastric cancer (3/10 [IQR 2C3]) and moderate for colorectal (5/10 [IQR 3C5]), ovarian (5/10 [IQR 3C5]), and pseudomyxoma peritonei (5/10 [IQR 3C5]) type of malignancies. Good quality of life and symptom relief were rated as main priorities for treatment and the need for new treatment modalities was rated 9/10 [IQR 8C9]. The perceived usefulness of systemic chemotherapy in first intention was described as high by 42.7 and 39.8% of respondents for PSM of colorectal and gastric origins, while HIPEC was described as highly useful for ovarian (49.5%) and PMP (73.8) malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: The management of PSM in the North African region has distinct differences in knowledge, treatments availability and priorities. Disparities are also noted according to specialty, country, years of expertise, and activity sector.

We discuss the effect of nationwide lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its removal on May 3, 2020.

Special attention is paid to the role of entropy and cycles in the process under the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis. The work scheme analyses random cycles from time to time, and in the frequency domain, the linear and nonlinear causality relationships between variables are studied. The period analysed is from January 2005 to December 2018; the following empirical results stand out: (1) On longer scales, the periodicity of the uncertainty of decision-making is between 6 and 12 months, respectively, for all the nationalities described. (2) The elasticity of demand for tourist apartments is approximately 1% due to changes in demand for tourist hotels. (3) The elasticity of the uncertainty factor is highly correlated with the country of origin of tourists visiting Spain. For example, it has been empirically shown that increases of 1% in uncertainty cause increases in the demand for apartments of 2.12% (worldwide), 3.05% (UK), 1.91% (Germany), 1.78% (France), 7.21% (Ireland), 3.61% (The Netherlands) respectively.

Little systematic research has occurred to understand livestock bushfire injuries, risk factors for injury, or how to make decisions about management of bushfire-injured livestock. Addressing this research gap is important as there is an increasing bushfire incidence globally. This paper presents qualitative research findings about bushfire-injured and killed livestock in the south-east of Australia after the 2019/2020 Australian bushfires. We describe observed pathology, treatments used, and risk factors for injury, then use thematic analysis to understand decision making about managing fire-injured livestock. Livestock injured by the fires showed pathology predominantly associated with the common integument (feet, hooves and skin) and signs of acute respiratory damage. It could take several days for the full extent of burns to become apparent, leaving prognostic doubt. Treatment strategies included immediate euthanasia, salvage slaughter, retention for later culling, treatment and recovery on farm, hospitalization and intensive treatment, or no intervention. Risk factors reported for livestock injury included lack of warnings about an impending fire, the type and amount of vegetation around livestock and the weather conditions on the day the fire reached livestock. Moving stock to an area with little vegetation before fire arrived was seen as protective. Decision making regarding injured livestock appeared influenced by three main themes: (1) observations on the severity of pathology, clinical signs and level of prognostic doubt, (2) pre-existing beliefs about animal welfare (responsibility to minimize unnecessary suffering) and (3) assumptions about the future. The management of livestock was largely appropriate due to the rapid provision of veterinary expertise. However, it is likely that some injured livestock were euthanized due to conservative veterinary advice driven by a lack of opportunity to re-assess stock, with impacts on farmers. In future, resourcing regular revisits of injured livestock to manage risks of gradual progression of burn pathology may facilitate more accurate prognostic assessment, provided injured animals can receive appropriate pain relief. In addition, a more comprehensive burns classification system linked to prognosis that can be rapidly applied in the field may assist assessments.","output":"The Australian 2019/2020 Black Summer Bushfires: Analysis of the Pathology, Treatment Strategies and Decision Making About Burnt Livestock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Oculocerebrocutaneous syndrome (Delleman Oorthuys syndrome) (OMIM 164180) is a rare syndrome affecting eyes, skin, and central nervous system, and it is usually associated with microphthalmia.

FMDV naturally infects swine, cattle, and other cloven-hoofed animals. FMD is not adequately controlled by vaccination. An alternative strategy is to develop swine that are genetically resistant to infection. Here, we generated FMDV-specific shRNA transgenic cells targeting either nonstructural protein 2B or polymerase 3D of FMDV. The shRNA-positive transgenic cells displayed significantly lower viral production than that of the control cells after infection with FMDV (P < 0.05). Twenty-three transgenic cloned swine (TGCS) and nine non-transgenic cloned swine (Non-TGCS) were produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In the FMDV challenge study, one TGCS was completely protected, no clinical signs, no viremia and no viral RNA in the tissues, no non-structural antibody response, another one TGCS swine recovered after showing clinical signs for two days, whereas all of the normal control swine (NS) and Non-TGCS developed typical clinical signs, viremia and viral RNA was determined in the tissues, the non-structural antibody was determined, and one Non-TGCS swine died. The viral RNA load in the blood and tissues of the TGCS was reduced in both challenge doses. These results indicated that the TGCS displayed resistance to the FMDV infection. Immune cells, including CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD21(+), and CD172(+) cells, and the production of IFN- were analyzed, there were no significant differences observed between the TGCS and NS or Non-TGCS, suggesting that the FMDV resistance may be mainly derived from the RNAi-based antiviral pathway.

INTERVENTIONS: The mCARE programme involved digitally enhanced pregnancy surveillance, individually targeted text messages and in-person home-visit to pregnant women for care-seeking reminders for antenatal care, child delivery and postnatal care. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a model to project population and service coverage increases with annual geographical expansion (from 1 million to 10 million population over 10 years) of the mCARE programme and the status quo. MAJOR OUTCOMES: For this modelling study, we used Lives Saved Tool to estimate the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) that would be averted by 2027, if the coverage of health interventions was increased in mCARE programme and the status quo, respectively. Economic costs were captured from a societal perspective using an ingredients approach and expressed in 2018 US dollars. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: We estimated the mCARE programme to avert 3076 deaths by 2027 at an incremental cost of $43 million relative to the status quo, which is translated to $462 per DALY averted. The societal costs were estimated to be $115 million for mCARE programme (48% of which are programme costs, 35% user costs and 17% provider costs). With the continued implementation and geographical scaling-up, the mCARE programme improved its cost-effectiveness from $1152 to $462 per DALY averted from 5 to 10 years. CONCLUSION: Mobile phone-based pregnancy surveillance systems with individually scheduled text messages and home-visit reminder strategies can be highly cost-effective in Bangladesh. The cost-effectiveness may improve as it promotes facility-based child delivery and achieves greater programme cost efficiency with programme scale and sustainability.","output":"mCARE, a digital health intervention package on pregnancy surveillance and care-seeking reminders from 2018 to 2027 in Bangladesh: a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute cerebrovascular disease, particularly ischemic stroke, has emerged as a serious complication of infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the Coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID-19). Accumulating data on patients with COVID-19-associated stroke have shed light on specificities concerning clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and outcome. Such specificities include a propensity towards large vessel occlusion, multi-territory stroke, and involvement of otherwise uncommonly affected vessels. Conversely, small-vessel brain disease, cerebral venous thrombosis, and intracerebral hemorrhage appear to be less frequent. Atypical neurovascular presentations were also described, ranging from bilateral carotid artery dissection to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and vasculitis.

Neither sales revenue scale nor firm liquidity exerts a significant impact on firm performance measures. Certain industry types, such as materials (petrochemicals), consumer services, real estate, and consumer durables & apparel appear most affected by the pandemic. Surprisingly, the regression models do not show a significant impact on the scale of the performance measures with the onset of the pandemic. The results of this study have wide implications for decision-makers, illustrating the imperative for regulatory bodies, governments and central banks to combine forces to reduce the financial and economic impacts of the pandemic both now and in the future. ? 2021 AESS Publications.

To gain insight into how the viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) might evolve in response to common antibody responses, we studied mutations occurring during virus evolution in a persistently infected immunocompromised individual. We use antibody Fab/RBD structures to predict, and pseudotypes to confirm, that mutations found in late-stage evolved S variants confer resistance to a common class of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies we isolated from a healthy COVID-19 convalescent donor. Resistance extends to the polyclonal serum immunoglobulins of four out of four healthy convalescent donors we tested and to monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. We further show that affinity maturation is unimportant for wild-type virus neutralization but is critical to neutralization breadth. Because the mutations we studied foreshadowed emerging variants that are now circulating across the globe, our results have implications to the long-term efficacy of S-directed countermeasures.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 evolution in an immunocompromised host reveals shared neutralization escape mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tracing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission chains is still a major challenge for public health authorities, when incidental contacts are not recalled or are not perceived as potential risk contacts. Viral sequencing can address key questions about SARS-CoV-2 evolution and may support reconstruction of viral transmission networks by integration of molecular epidemiology into classical contact tracing. METHODS: In collaboration with local public health authorities, we set up an integrated system of genomic surveillance in an urban setting, combining a) viral surveillance sequencing, b) genetically based identification of infection clusters in the population, c) integration of public health authority contact tracing data, and d) a user-friendly dashboard application as a central data analysis platform. RESULTS: Application of the integrated system from August to December 2020 enabled a characterization of viral population structure, analysis of 4 outbreaks at a maximum care hospital, and genetically based identification of 5 putative population infection clusters, all of which were confirmed by contact tracing. The system contributed to the development of improved hospital infection control and prevention measures and enabled the identification of previously unrecognized transmission chains, involving a martial arts gym and establishing a link between the hospital to the local population. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated systems of genomic surveillance could contribute to the monitoring and, potentially, improved management of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the population.","output":"Characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection Clusters Based on Integrated Genomic Surveillance, Outbreak Analysis and Contact Tracing in an Urban Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a genetically complex tumor type and one of the leading causes of cancer-associated disability and mortality. Genetic instability, such as chromosomal instability, is associated with the tumorigenesis of LSCC. Copy number variations (CNVs) have been demonstrated to contribute to the genetic diversity of tumor pathogenesis. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has emerged as a high-throughput genomic technology that facilitates the aggregation of high-resolution data of cancer-associated genomic imbalances. In the present study, a total of 38 primary supraglottic LSCC cases were analyzed by high-resolution array-based CGH (aCGH) to improve the understanding of the genetic alterations in LSCC. Additionally, integration with bioinformatic analysis of microarray expression profiling data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database provided a fundamental method for the identification of putative target genes. Genomic CNVs were detected in all cases. The size of net genomic imbalances per case ranged between a loss of 682.3 Mb (~24% of the genome) and a gain of 1,958.6 Mb (~69% of the genome). Recurrent gains included 2pter-q22.1, 3q26.1-qter, 5pter-p12, 7p22.3p14.1, 8p12p11.22, 8q24.13q24.3, 11q13.2q13.4, 12pter-p12.2, 18pter-p11.31 and 20p13p12.1, whereas recurrent losses included 3pter-p21.32, 4q28.1-q35.2, 5q13.2-qter, 9pter-p21.3 and monosomy 13. Gains of 3q26.1-qter were associated with tumor stage, poor differentiation and smoking history. Additionally, through integration with bioinformatic analysis of data from the GEO database, putative target oncogenes, including sex-determining region Y-box 2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1, fragile X-related gene 1, disheveled segment polarity protein 3, defective n cullin neddylation 1 domain containing 1, insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 and CCDC26 long non-coding RNA, and tumor suppressor genes, such as CUB and sushi multiple domains 1, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, protocadherin 20, serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 5 and Nei like DNA glycosylase 3, were identified in supraglottic LSCC. Supraglottic LSCC is a genetically complex tumor type and aCGH was demonstrated to be effective in the determination of molecular profiles with higher resolution.

Viruses have an inherent potential to easily mutate, presenting major hurdles for diagnostics and requiring methods capable of detecting genetically diverse viral strains. One such infectious agent is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 2019 and has resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study presents a real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) detection assay for SARS-CoV-2, taking into account its intrinsic polymorphic nature that arises due to genetic drift and recombination, as well as the possibility of continuous and multiple introductions of genetically nonidentical strains into the human population. This advance was achieved by using mismatch-tolerant molecular beacons designed to specifically detect the SARS-CoV-2 S, E, M, and N genes. These were applied to create a simple and reproducible real-time RT-PCR assay, which was validated using external quality control panels (QCMD: CVOP20, WHO: SARS-CoV-2-EQAP-01) and clinical samples.

Numerous hospital-based investigations have revealed the RSV prevalence between 0.2-54% in the paediatric population with ARI/ALRI from Saudi Arabia during 1991-2015. Maximum RSV infections occurred in children less than 1 year of age (51-97%) and male children (51-69%) were more commonly affected than females (31-49%). RSV infections are reported mostly during winter season suggesting seasonal distribution of the virus. Other respiratory viruses reported from this region are adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus including many mixed infections. A few studies have reported the phylogenetic analysis of the circulating strains of RSV. These studies have revealed that circulating group A-RSV Saudi strains belonged to NA1 and ON1 genotypes and group B-RSV viruses clustered in the BA genotype. Molecular characterization of the Saudi strains was further carried out by mutational, selection pressure and glycosylation site analyses. We have compiled all the eighteen studies of RSV infection from Saudi Arabia in the form of this review and concluded that detailed comprehensive surveillance of RSV and other viruses in community and hospital settings is required. Information on the molecular characterization of currently circulating strains of RSV will contribute towards better understanding of the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of this viral pathogen.

Otolaryngologists are especially susceptible with the elevated risk of aerosolization and corresponding high viral loads. This study utilizes a geospatial analysis to illustrate the comparative risks of older otolaryngologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and materials Demographic and state population data were extracted from the State Physician Workforce Reports published by the AAMC for the year 2018. A geospatial heat map of the United States was then constructed to illustrate the location of COVID-19 confirmed case counts and the distributions of ENTs over 60 years for each state. Results In 2018, out of a total of 9578 practicing U.S. ENT surgeons, 3081 were older than 60 years (32.2%). The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana. The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan. Conclusions Based on our models, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan represent states where older ENTs may be the most susceptible to developing severe complications from nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 due to a combination of high COVID-19 case volumes and a high proportion of ENTs over 60 years.","output":"Geospatial analysis of COVID-19 and otolaryngologists above age 60"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seasonal flu vaccination is one of the most important strategies for preventing influenza.

BACKGROUND Since inception in 2011, there has been an exponential increase in the number of TAVR centers across the world. Multiple studies have questioned if a relationship exists between institutional TAVR volume and patient outcomes. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search for relevant articles using a combination of free text terms in the title/abstract related to volume, TAVR, and patient outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened all titles/abstracts for eligibility based on pre-specified criteria. All-cause mortality data was pooled from eligible studies and centers were categorized as low-(30-50 cases), intermediate-, or high-volume (75-130 cases) based on their annual TAVR volumes. RESULTS Our search yielded an initial list of 11,153 citations, 120 full text studies were reviewed and 7 studies met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, yielding a total of 1,93,498 TAVRs. Categorized according to center's annual volume; 25,062 TAVRs were performed in low-, 77,093 in intermediate- and 91,343 in high-volume centers. Network meta-analysis showed a relative reduction in mortality rates of 37%, 23% and 19%, for high volume versus low volume centers, high volume versus intermediate volume centers and intermediate versus low volume centers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Existing research clearly shows an inverse relationship between annual TAVR procedural volume and all-cause mortality.

This paper assesses motivations for the Fed liquidity lines, and the effects and spillovers of US dollar auctions by central banks. We find that the access to the liquidity arrangements was driven by the recipient economies close financial and trade ties with the US. Access to dollar liquidity also reflected global trade exposure. We find that announcements of expansion of Fed liquidity facilities or of auctions using these facilities led to appreciation of partner currencies against the US dollar. and reduced deviations from covered interest parity (CIP). Dollar auctions by major central banks (BoE, ECB, BoJ and SNB) led to temporary appreciation of other currencies against the US dollar, reduced CIP deviations, and persistently reduced sovereign bond yields of other economies. However, dollar auctions done by other central banks with access to Fed facilities did not have a meaningful impact on key domestic financial variables .

A cross-sectional study was conducted online between May 10 and 20, 2020, using the snowball sampling technique. All individuals over 18 were eligible. The final sample included 502 respondents. Higher stress and anxiety were associated with younger age, female gender, previous higher socio-economic status, having a family member with a chronic disease, fear of not getting access to treatment, fear of COVID-19, and physical violence at home. However, financial wellness and higher family satisfaction were significantly associated with lower stress. The multivariate analysis showed a significant interaction between fear of COVID-19 and financial wellness on estimated marginal means of stress and anxiety. The combined presence of fear of the pandemic and financial hardship is associated with higher stress and anxiety, particularly among women and younger Lebanese adults with difficult home circumstances.

This analysis used available data to simulate the intracellular pharmacokinetics of the favipiravir active metabolite [favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (FAVI-RTP)]. METHODS: Published in vitro data for intracellular production and elimination of FAVI-RTP in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were fitted with a mathematical model describing the time course of intracellular FAVI-RTP as a function of favipiravir concentration. Parameter estimates were then combined with a published population pharmacokinetic model in Chinese patients to predict human intracellular FAVI-RTP. In vitro FAVI-RTP data were adequately described as a function of concentrations with an empirical model, noting simplification and consolidation of various processes and several assumptions. RESULTS: Parameter estimates from fittings to in vitro data predict a flatter dynamic range of peak to trough for intracellular FAVI-RTP (peak to trough ratio of a??1 to 1) when driven by a predicted free plasma concentration profile, compared with the plasma profile of parent favipiravir (ratio of a??2 to 1). This approach has important assumptions, but indicates that, despite rapid clearance of the parent from plasma, sufficient intracellular FAVI-RTP may be maintained across the dosing interval because of its long intracellular half-life. CONCLUSIONS: Population mean intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations are estimated to be maintained above the Km for the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase for 9 days with a 1200 mg twice-daily regimen (following a 1600 mg twice-daily loading dose on day 1).

RESEARCH QUESTION To analyze the temporal relationship between spatially resolved surface EMG (SEMG) of the gluteal region and the corresponding ground reaction force (GRF). METHODS Healthy adults (29; 25; age 62.67.0 years) walked at their self-selected slow, normal, and fast walking speeds on a 10 m walkway (ten trials/speed). Bilateral paired eight-electrode strips were horizontally aligned at mid-distance of the vertical line between greater trochanter and iliac crest. Concerning the ventral to dorsal direction, the center of each strip was placed on this vertical line. Initially, these signals were monopolarly sampled, but eight vertically oriented bipolar channels covering the whole gluteal region from ventral to dorsal (P1 to P8) were subsequently calculated by subtracting the signals of the corresponding electrodes of each electrode strip for both sides of the body. Three vertical bipolar channels represented the tensor fasciae latae (TFL; P2), gluteus medius (Gmed, SENIAM position; average of P4 and P5), and gluteus maximus muscles (Gmax; P7). To determine the interval between SEMG and corresponding GRF, the time delay (TD) between the respective first amplitude peaks (F1) in SEMG and vertical GRF curves was calculated. RESULTS Throughout the grand averaged SEMG curves, the absolute amplitudes significantly differed among the three walking speeds at all electrode positions, with the amplitude of the F1 peak significantly increasing with increasing speed. In addition, when normalized to slow, the relative SEMG amplitude differences at the individual electrode positions showed an impressively homogeneous pattern. In both vertical GRF and all electrode SEMGs, the F1 peak occurred significantly earlier with increasing speed. Also, the TD between SEMG and vertical GRF F1 peaks significantly decreased with increasing speed. Concerning spatial activation, the TD between the respective F1 peaks in the SEMG and vertical GRF was significantly shorter for the ventral TFL position than the dorsal Gmed and Gmax positions, showing that the SEMG F1 peak during this initial phase of the gait cycle occurred earlier in the dorsal positions, and thus implying that the occurrence of the SEMG F1 peak proceeded from dorsal to ventral. SIGNIFICANCE Tightly regulated spatial and temporal activation of the gluteal intermuscular functional unit, which includes both speed- and position-dependent mechanisms, seems to be an essential requirement for a functionally optimized, steady gait.","output":"Temporal and spatial relationship between gluteal muscle Surface EMG activity and the vertical component of the ground reaction force during walking."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

The temporal and spatial distribution and the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 were described. A combination of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and a support vector machine (SVM) was constructed to forecast the trend of COVID-19. Results: : A total of 56,062 confirmed COVID-19 cases, which were mainly concentrated in Wuhan, were reported from 16 January to 16 March 2020 in Hubei Province. The daily number of confirmed cases exponentially increased to 3,156 before 4 February 2020, fluctuated on an upward trend to 4,823 before 13 February 2020, and then markedly decreased to one case after 16 March 2020. The highest mean reproduction number R(t) of 9.48 was recorded on 16 January 2020, after which it decreased to 2.15 on 2 February 2020 and further dropped to less than one on 13 February 2020. In the modelling stage, the mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error of the hybrid ARIMACSVM model decreased by 98.59%, 89.19% and 89.68%, and those of SVM decreased by 98.58%, 87.71% and 88.94% compared with the ARIMA model. Similar results were obtained in the forecasting stage. Conclusion: Public health interventions resulted in the terminal phase of COVID-19 in Hubei Province. The hybrid ARIMACSVM model may be a reliable tool for forecasting the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Transmission potential and forecasting of the number of Coronavirus disease 2019 cases in Hubei Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In February 2021, in response to emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 virus variants, the Canton Grisons launched a unique RNA mass testing program targeting the labour force in local businesses. Employees were offered weekly tests free of charge and on a voluntary basis. If tested positive, they were required to self-isolate for ten days and their contacts were subjected to daily testing at work. Thereby, the quarantine of contact persons could be waved. Here, we evaluate the effects of the testing program on the tested cohorts. We examined 121364 test results from 27514 participants during February-March 2021. By distinguishing different cohorts of employees, we observe a noticeable decrease in the test positivity rate and a statistically significant reduction in the associated incidence rate over the considered period. The reduction in the latter ranges between 18%-50%. The variability is partly explained by different exposures to exogenous infection sources (e.g., contacts with visiting tourists or cross-border commuters). Our analysis provides the first empirical evidence that applying repetitive mass testing to a real population over an extended period of time can prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic. However, to overcome logistic, uptake, and adherence challenges it is important that the program is carefully designed and that disease incursion from the population outside of the program is considered and controlled.","output":"Results from Canton Grisons of Switzerland Suggest Repetitive Testing Reduces SARS-CoV-2 Incidence (February-March 2021)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews a study to determine the effects of COVID-19 on the rate of depression and anxiety in nurses and to identify potential strategies that nurse leaders can implement to reduce depression and anxiety in their staff.","output":"Depression and anxiety prevalence in nursing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication of infection with SARS-CoV-2. A possible involvement of pathogenetically relevant autoantibodies has been discussed. Recently, neutralising autoantibodies against inflammatory receptor antagonists progranulin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) were found in adult patients with critical COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of such autoantibodies in MIS-C. METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort study, plasma and serum samples were collected from patients (0C18 years) with MIS-C (as per WHO criteria) treated at five clinical centres in Germany and Spain. As controls, we included plasma or serum samples from children with Kawasaki disease, children with inactive systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and children with suspected growth retardation (non-inflammatory control) across four clinical centres in Germany and Spain (all aged 18 years). Serum samples from the CoKiBa trial were used as two further control groups, from healthy children (negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies) and children with previous mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 (aged 17 years). MIS-C and control samples were analysed for autoantibodies against IL-1Ra and progranulin, and for IL-1Ra concentrations, by ELISA. Biochemical analysis of plasma IL-1Ra was performed with native Western blots and isoelectric focusing. Functional activity of the autoantibodies was examined by an in vitro IL-1-signalling reporter assay. FINDINGS: Serum and plasma samples were collected between March 6, 2011, and June 2, 2021. Autoantibodies against IL-1Ra could be detected in 13 (62%) of 21 patients with MIS-C (11 girls and ten boys), but not in children with Kawasaki disease (n=24; nine girls and 15 boys), asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 (n=146; 72 girls and 74 boys), inactive systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (n=10; five girls and five boys), suspected growth retardation (n=33; 13 girls and 20 boys), or in healthy controls (n=462; 230 girls and 232 boys). Anti-IL-1Ra antibodies in patients with MIS-C belonged exclusively to the IgG1 subclass, except in one patient who had additional IL-1Ra-specific IgM antibodies. Autoantibodies against progranulin were only detected in one (5%) patient with MIS-C. In patients with MIS-C who were positive for anti-IL-1Ra antibodies, free plasma IL-1Ra concentrations were reduced, and immune-complexes of IL-1Ra were detected. Notably, an additional, hyperphosphorylated, transiently occurring atypical isoform of IL-1Ra was observed in all patients with MIS-C who were positive for anti-IL-1Ra antibodies. Anti-IL-1Ra antibodies impaired IL-1Ra function in reporter cell assays, resulting in amplified IL-1 signalling. INTERPRETATION: Anti-IL-1Ra autoantibodies were observed in a high proportion of patients with MIS-C and were specific to these patients. Generation of these autoantibodies might be triggered by an atypical, hyperphosphorylated isoform of IL-1Ra. These autoantibodies impair IL-1Ra bioactivity and might thus contribute to increased IL-1-signalling in MIS-C.

In the present study, we analyzed 252 EV-related infection cases (median age of subjects, 5.1 years) diagnosed among 11,509 consecutive children visiting emergency departments within a 7-year period in the north of France. EV strains were isolated from nasopharyngeal samples by viral cell culture, identified by seroneutralization assay, and genetically compared by partial amplification and sequencing of the VP1 gene. The respiratory syndromes (79 [31%] of 252 EV infections) appeared as the second most common EV-induced pediatric pathology after meningitis (111 [44%] of 252 cases) (44 versus 31%, P < 10(-3)), contributing to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in 43 (54%) of 79 EV respiratory infection cases. Bronchiolitis was the most common EV-induced LRTI (34 [43%] of 79 cases, P < 10(-3)) occurring more often in infants aged 1 to 12 months (P = 0.0002), with spring-fall seasonality. Viruses ECHO 11, 6, and 13 were the more frequently identified respiratory strains (24, 13, and 11%, respectively). The VP1 gene phylogenetic analysis showed the concomitant or successive circulation of genetically distinct EV respiratory strains (species A or B) during the same month or annual epidemic period. Our findings indicated that respiratory tract infections accounted for the 30% of EV-induced pediatric pathologies, contributing to LRTIs in 54% of these cases.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 infection-naive and previously-infected adults receiving ChAd-BNT (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AstraZeneca followed by BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech) or BNT-ChAd as part of the UK national immunisation programme provided blood samples at 30 days and 12 weeks after their second dose. Geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-antibody) and nucleoprotein (N-antibody) IgG antibodies and geometric mean ratios (GMR) were compared with a contemporaneous cohort receiving homologous ChAd-ChAd or BNT-BNT. ResultsDuring March-October 2021, 75,827 individuals were identified as having received heterologous vaccination, 9,489 invited to participate, 1,836 responded (19.3%) and 656 were eligible. In previously-uninfected adults, S-antibody GMC at 30 days post-second dose were lowest for ChAd-ChAd (862 [95%CI, 694 - 1069]) and significantly higher for ChAd-BNT (6233 [5522-7035]; GMR 6.29; [5.04-7.85]; p<0.001), BNT-ChAd (4776 [4066-5610]; GMR 4.55 [3.56-5.81]; p<0.001) and BNT-BNT (5377 [4596-6289]; GMR 5.66 [4.49-7.15]; p<0.001). By 12 weeks after dose two, S-antibody GMC had declined in all groups and remained significantly lower for ChAd-ChAd compared to ChAd-BNT (GMR 5.12 [3.79-6.92]; p<0.001), BNT-ChAd (GMR 4.1 [2.96-5.69]; p<0.001) and BNT-BNT (GMR 6.06 [4.32-8.50]; p<0.001). Previously infected adults had higher S-antibody GMC compared to infection-naive adults at all time-points and with all vaccine schedules. ConclusionsThese real-world findings demonstrate heterologous schedules with adenoviral-vector and mRNA vaccines are highly immunogenic and may be recommended after a serious adverse reaction to one vaccine product, or to increase programmatic flexibility where vaccine supplies are constrained. O_TEXTBOXWhat is already known?PubMed was searched with the terms \\"COVID-19 Vaccine\\" and \\"heterologous\\" to identify publications relating to heterologous immunisation schedules with adenoviral-vector and mRNA vaccines from 01 January 2020 until 30 November 2021. Following early reports of vaccine-induced thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia (VITT) after the first dose of ChAd (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), several studies reported significantly higher antibody levels, with robust neutralizing activity and cellular immune responses, in adults receiving a heterologous ChAd-mRNA schedule compared to those receiving ChAd-ChAd. Few studies, however, have compared antibody responses after both heterologous schedules (ChAd-mRNA and mRNA-ChAd) with both homologous schedules (ChAd-ChAd and mRNA-mRNA). One UK study (COMCOV) compared all four ChAd and BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT; mRNA) combinations given four weeks apart and reported very high antibody and T-cell responses four weeks after the second dose for all four schedules. What are the new findings?We used the national immunisation register to identify adults who received a heterologous vaccine schedule as part of the national immunisation programme in England and collected blood samples to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses after vaccination. We found that both heterologous schedules (ChAd-BNT and BNT-ChAd) provided superior antibody responses compared to ChAd-ChAd and similar responses to BNT-BNT at 30 days and 12 weeks after second vaccine dose. ChAd-BNT induced higher antibody levels then BNT-ChAd at both timepoints. Antibody responses after vaccination were much higher in previously infected individuals, irrespective of their immunisation schedule. A recent Swedish population-based study reported higher vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with ChAd-BNT than ChAd-ChAd providing real-world confirmation of improved protection with heterologous schedules. What do the new findings imply?Our findings add to the growing body of evidence showing high antibody responses following heterologous vaccination schedules with ChAd and BNT, along with robust antibody neutralising activity and cellular responses, especially when compared to ChAd-ChAd. Given that globally COVID-19 vaccine demand far exceeds vaccine supply, these results have important implications for the future deployment of COVID-19 vaccine programmes; particularly where it is logistically and/or operationally difficult to administer two doses of the same vaccine product.

Sialic acids were identified at several levels in a broad range of cell types of nervous, respiratory, genitourinary and lymphoid origin. Nevertheless, the most contrasting was the type of glycosidic linkage between 5-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and galactose (Gal) expressed in central nervous system (CNS).

These changes include decrease or complete loss of NeuAc2,3Gal residues, mainly in olfactory structures and brain cortex, which were replaced by their isomers Neu5Ac2,6Gal/GalNAc. In the brain cortex and cerebellum, the increase of Neu5Ac2,6Gal/GalNAc molecules was paralleled by an increase of 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2).

PROCEDURES Three groups of surgeons with varying levels of experience performed 4 simple continuous sutures before (3 sutures) and after (1 suture) being educated on principles of the SL:WL ratio. All sutures were evaluated for their gaping, number of stitches, stitch intervals, tissue bite size and suture length. RESULTS No significant differences in suture parameters or SL:WL ratios were found among the 3 groups, and 60.5% of control sutures and 77.0% of test sutures had SL:WL ratios above 4:1. There was a significant improvement in the mean ratio after the information was provided (p = 0.003). Overall, the SL:WL ratios ranged from 1.54:1 to 6.81:1, with 36.3% falling between 4:1 and 5:1 (5.17 mm mean stitch interval, 5.52 mm mean tissue bite size).

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 3942 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy cases were included in the study. All the patients were divided into 3 groups: No reinforcement (NoSLR), staple line reinforcement with fibrin glue (SLR-FG), and staple line reinforcement with omentopexy (SLR-O). Demographic data and perioperative characteristics of the groups were analyzed retrospectively. Among these, age, sex, preoperative comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, body mass index, duration of operation, reoperation, complications, and Clavien-Dindo classification scores were recorded. RESULTS Age, sex, body mass index, comorbid diseases, American Society of Anesthesiologists, and Clavien-Dindo Classification scores were similar in all the groups. The overall complication rate was 3.0%. The overall minor and major complication rates were 1.7% and 1.3%, respectively. The mortality rate was 0.1% (4 patients). The most common postoperative complications were bleeding (0.9%) and leakage (0.5%). The incidence of leakage, bleeding, and twisted gastric sleeve rates were similar when compared between SLR-FG and NoSLR. In the SLR-O patients, the incidence of leakage, hemorrhage, and twist were significantly lower and the operation time was significantly longer when compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS The SLR-O technique, especially when performed by experienced surgeons, is a promising method for the prevention of postoperative leakage, bleeding, and twist complications with an acceptable increase in the duration of operation. Considering the limited effects of the SLR-FG technique, it was predicted that it would lose its popularity over time.","output":"Efficacy of Staple Line Reinforcement With Omentopexy During Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on Postoperative Complications: Experience of a Single Center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unlike porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) that infects only pigs, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has the capacity to infect different animal species In vivo gnotobiotic calves were previously confirmed to be susceptible to infection with PDCoV, but not with PEDV We next investigated in vitro whether primary bovine cells are susceptible to PDCoV or PEDV infection We conducted quantification of viral RNA in cell culture supernatants and immunofluorescent staining for the detection of PDCoV or PEDV antigen in two primary bovine cell types inoculated with the PDCoV strain OH-FD22 or PEDV strain PC22-P40 grown in LLC-PK or Vero cells, respectively, and supplemented with 1 25~5 mug/mL of trypsin in the cell culture medium The primary cells were isolated from the kidney or heart of a gnotobiotic calf, and both cell types were vimentin-positive, but E-Cadherin-negative, resembling mesenchymal cells Similar to the previous in vivo observation, cytopathic effects (CPE) that consisted of enlarged and rounded cells, followed by cell shrinkage and detachment, were identified in the two primary cell types inoculated with PDCoV Unexpectedly, similar CPE was also identified in the two cell types inoculated with PEDV High PDCoV or PEDV RNA titers and PDCoV or PEDV antigens were detected in the cell culture supernatants and CPE-positive cells, respectively Our study revealed that primary bovine mesenchymal cells are susceptible to infection with PDCoV and PEDV The in vitro observation partially coincided with the corresponding in vivo data from gnotobiotic calves Copyright ? 2020 Elsevier B V","output":"Replicative capacity of porcine deltacoronavirus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in primary bovine mesenchymal cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of our study is to propose a remote patient monitoring solution through a smart phone application (Smart Patient) collecting health data to support diagnosis, monitoring and predicting poor outcome in asymptomatic/mild cases of COVID-19, including signs and symptoms, risk factors, comorbidities, medications and vital signs such as body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate and oxygen saturation.

This retrospective study included 70 consecutive patients with 58 medium- (3.1-5.0 cm) and 17 large- (5.1-7.0 cm) sized HCCs after ME-RFA using a controller. Outcomes in terms of complete response, primary technique effectiveness, local tumor progression, and overall survival were investigated. After 1-4 applications of ME-RFA, the rates of complete response and PTE in medium-sized tumors were 79.3% and 91.4%, respectively, and in large tumors were 76.5% and 94.1%, respectively. Overall, the major complication rate was 5.7%. After a median 21-month follow-up period, both two- and three-year estimated overall survival rates were above 80%. There were no significant differences in overall survival and local tumor progression rates between medium- and large-size tumors and among BCLC stages A, B1 and B2. A complete response to ME-RFA was the only significant factor associated with improved survival (p=0.008).

However, it is still not clear whether this increased risk is related to the usage of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. We collected medical records of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Hangzhou, China), and evaluated the potential impact of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. A total of 30 hypertensive COVID-19 patients were enrolled, of which 17 were classified as non-ARB group and the remaining 13 as ARB group based on the antihypertensive therapies they received. Compared with the non-ARB group, patients in the ARB group had a lower proportion of severe cases and intensive care unit (ICU) admission as well as shortened length of hospital stay, and manifested favorable results in most of the laboratory testing. Viral loads in the ARB group were lower than those in the non-ARB group throughout the disease course. No significant difference in the time of seroconversion or antibody levels was observed between the two groups. The median levels of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (sACE2) in serum and urine samples were similar in both groups, and there were no significant correlations between serum sACE2 and biomarkers of disease severity. Transcriptional analysis showed 125 differentially expressed genes which mainly were enriched in oxygen transport, bicarbonate transport, and blood coagulation. Our results suggest that ARB usage is not associated with aggravation of COVID-19. These findings support the maintenance of ARB treatment in hypertensive patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

This was accompanied by the suspension of the surgical programme. The aim of the survey was to determine the effects of COVID-19 on surgical care in non-university hospitals in Germany. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on an anonymous online survey, which was accessible from April 24th to May 10th, 2020 for surgeons of the Konvent der leitenden Krankenhauschirurgen (Convention of leading Hospital Surgeons) in Germany. The analysis comprised of 22.8% (n = 148/649) completed surveys. RESULTS: Communication and cooperation with authorities, hospital administration and other departments were largely considered sufficient. In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, 28.4% (n = 42/148) of the respondents complained about a short supply of protective equipment available for the hospital staff. 7.4% (n = 11/148) of the participants stated that emergency operations had to be postponed or rescheduled. A decreased quantity of emergency surgical procedures and a decreased number of surgical emergency patients treated in the emergency room was reported in 43.9% (n = 65/148) and 63.5% (n = 94/148), respectively. Consultation and treatment of oncological patients in the outpatient clinic was decreased in 54.1% (n = 80/148) of the surveyed hospitals. To increase the capacity for COVID-19 patients, a reduction of bed and operating room occupancy of 50.8  19.3% and 54.2  19.1% were reported, respectively. Therefore, 90.5% (n = 134/148) of all participants expected a loss of revenue of 28.2  12.9% in 2020. CONCLUSION: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on surgical care in Germany. The reduction in the bed and the operating room capacity may have lead to considerable delays in urgent and semi-elective surgical interventions. In addition to the risk of worsening patient care, we anticipate severe financial damage to the clinics in 2020 and beyond.

The viral spike (S) protein is required for the attachment to ACE2 and subsequent virus-host cell membrane fusion. Previous work has demonstrated the presence of N-linked glycans in ACE2. N-glycosylation is implicated in many biological activities, including protein folding, protein activity, and cell surface expression of biomolecules. However, the contribution of N-glycosylation to ACE2 function is poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of N-glycosylation in the activity and localization of two species with different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, porcine ACE2 (pACE2) and hACE2. The elimination of N-glycosylation by tunicamycin (TM) treatment, or mutagenesis, showed that N-glycosylation is critical for the proper cell surface expression of ACE2 but not for its carboxiprotease activity. Furthermore, nonglycosylable ACE2 was localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and not at the cell surface. Our data also revealed that binding of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S protein to porcine or human ACE2 was not affected by deglycosylation of ACE2 or S proteins, suggesting that N-glycosylation does not play a role in the interaction between SARS coronaviruses and the ACE2 receptor. Impairment of hACE2 N-glycosylation decreased cell-to-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV S protein but not that mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Finally, we found that hACE2 N-glycosylation is required for an efficient viral entry of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses, which may be the result of low cell surface expression of the deglycosylated ACE2 receptor. IMPORTANCE Understanding the role of glycosylation in the virus-receptor interaction is important for developing approaches that disrupt infection. In this study, we showed that deglycosylation of both ACE2 and S had a minimal effect on the spike-ACE2 interaction. In addition, we found that the removal of N-glycans of ACE2 impaired its ability to support an efficient transduction of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses. Our data suggest that the role of deglycosylation of ACE2 on reducing infection is likely due to a reduced expression of the viral receptor on the cell surface. These findings offer insight into the glycan structure and function of ACE2 and potentially suggest that future antiviral therapies against coronaviruses and other coronavirus-related illnesses involving inhibition of ACE2 recruitment to the cell membrane could be developed.","output":"Analysis of the Role of N-Linked Glycosylation in Cell Surface Expression, Function, and Binding Properties of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the economic effects of policies to contain Covid-19, by extracting lessons from Sweden's experience during the Great Lockdown'.

Current data suggest that patients with cardiovascular diseases experience more serious complications with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) than those without CVD. In addition, severe COVID-19 appears to cause acute cardiac injury, as well as long-term adverse remodeling of heart tissue. Cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, being crucial in response to injury, may play a pivotal role in both contributing to and healing COVID-19-induced cardiac injury. The role of cardiac myofibroblasts in cardiac fibrosis has been well-established in the literature for decades. However, with the emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, new cardiac complications are arising. Bursts of inflammatory cytokines and upregulation of TGF-1 and angiotensin (AngII) are common in severe COVID-19 patients. Cytokines, TGF-1, and Ang II can induce cardiac fibroblast differentiation, potentially leading to fibrosis. This review details the key information concerning the role of cardiac myofibroblasts in CVD and COVID-19 complications. Additionally, new factors including controlling ACE2 expression and microRNA regulation are explored as promising treatments for both COVID-19 and CVD.

Non\\\\COVID\\\\19 subject presenting with various comorbid conditions served as controls. RESULTS: Single\\\\cell RNA\\\\seq data of immune cells from COVID\\\\19 patients showed a distinct caspase expression pattern in T cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and eosinophils compared with controls. Caspase\\\\1 was upregulated in CD4+ T\\\\cells from hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients compared with unexposed controls. Post\\\\COVID\\\\19 patients with lingering symptoms (long\\\\haulers) also showed upregulated caspase\\\\1activity in CD4+ T\\\\cells that ex vivo was attenuated with a select pan\\\\caspase inhibitor. We observed elevated caspase\\\\3/7levels in red blood cells from COVID\\\\19 patients compared with controls that was reduced following caspase inhibition. DISCUSSION: Our preliminary results suggest an exuberant caspase response in COVID\\\\19 that may facilitate immune\\\\related pathological processes leading to severe outcomes. Further clinical correlations of caspase expression in different stages of COVID\\\\19 will be needed. CONCLUSION: Pan\\\\caspase inhibition could emerge as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate or prevent severe COVID\\\\19.","output":"Caspases and therapeutic potential of caspase inhibitors in moderateCsevere SARS CoV2 infection and long COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Physical-distancing interventions are being used in Canada to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but it is not clear how effective they will be. We evaluated how different nonpharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and reduce the burden on the health care system. METHODS: We used an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada. We compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and quarantine to scenarios with the following: enhanced case finding, restrictive physical-distancing measures, or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive physical distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We present medians and credible intervals from 100 replicates per scenario using a 2-year time horizon. RESULTS: We estimated that 56% (95% credible interval 42%-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107 000 (95% credible interval 60 760-149 000) cases in hospital (non-ICU) and 55 500 (95% credible interval 32 700-75 200) cases in ICU. For fixed-duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive physical distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the 2-year period and could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity. INTERPRETATION: Without substantial physical distancing or a combination of moderate physical distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic physical distancing could maintain health-system capacity and also allow periodic psychological and economic respite for populations.","output":"Mathematical modelling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 will undoubtedly change the future landscape of medical and surgical education. The economic and environmental advantages of virtual learning are clear, while access to a wider range of resources and subject specialists makes the adoption of virtual learning within surgical education an attractive prospect. AIMS This literature review aims to evaluate evidence on the effectiveness of virtual education in orthopaedics and how we might implement positive changes to educational practice in the future, as a result of lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY We performed a review of the literature reporting on efficacy of learning outcomes achieved as a result of virtual education within orthopaedic surgery. Electronic searches were performed using NICE healthcare databases from the date of inception to March 2021. Relevant studies were identified, data extracted, and qualitative synthesis performed. RESULTS 14 manuscripts with a total of 1548 participants (orthopaedic trainees or medical students) were included for analysis. Nine studies (n = 1109) selected compared e-learning to conventional learning material (control group). All nine studies reported significantly higher outcome scores for e-learning participants compared to control participants (p < 0.001 to p < 0.05). The remaining studies compared blended e-learning approaches or evaluated pre/post intervention improvements in learning outcomes. All studies demonstrated a significant improvement in learning outcomes (p < 0.0001 to p < 0.01). The majority of studies (64%) used a blended approach. No studies were identified reporting efficacy of webinars or videoconferencing within orthopaedic education. CONCLUSION A blended approach, combining virtual teaching, face-to-face instruction and distance learning tools, based on the evidence we have provided, would improve the quality of knowledge reception and retention, and learner satisfaction. However, in order to be successful, it is vital that these educational programmes are designed with the needs of the learner in mind, and an awareness of best practice for virtual teaching and learning.","output":"The future of orthopaedic surgical education: Where do we go now?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater settled solids is associated with COVID-19 incidence in sewersheds and therefore, there is a strong interest in using these measurements to augment traditional disease surveillance methods. A wastewater surveillance program should provide rapid turn around for sample measurements (ideally within 24 hours), but storage of samples is necessary for a variety of reasons including biobanking. Here we investigate how storage of wastewater solids at 4 C, ?20 C, and ?80 C affects measured concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We find that short term (7 or 8 d) storage of raw solids at 4 C has little effect on measured concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, whereas longer term storage at 4 C (35C122 d) or freezing reduces measurements by 60%, on average. We show that normalizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations by concentrations of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA, an endogenous wastewater virus, can correct for changes during storage as storage can have a similar effect on PMMoV RNA as on SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

The overarching goal was to gain insight on how to build an effective psychological support system for teachers during and after the pandemic. Methods: The mental health condition of teachers (N = 18,521) was assessed online by using a questionnaire consisting of standard instruments PHQ-15, GAD-7, PHQ-2, PC-PTSD, and additional questions about sleep disturbance, suicidality and preference of psychological intervention methods. Results: 35.5% of Chinese teachers reported sleep disturbance, 25.3% complained somatic discomfort, 17.7% had anxiety symptoms, 4.0% had depression, 2.8% had self-injury or suicidal thoughts. Women are more likely to have somatic symptoms, sleep disturbance and depression. There were age differences for anxiety, somatic symptoms and suicidal thoughts. High percentages of university teachers reported moderate to severe anxiety, somatic symptoms, depression and sleep disturbance. The most preferred psychological intervention is the self-practice of stress management skills (N = 11,477, 62.0%). Teachers with moderate and severe symptoms are more likely in need of hotline and online counseling and those with serious suicidal thoughts are three times more likely to use a telephone hotline. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the major reported psychological distresses among Chinese teachers are anxiety, sleep disturbance and somatic symptoms. There were gender, age and school setting differences. Females, teachers over 45 years old and those who work at universities tend to be more vulnerable.

They are usually removed before discharge, but are sometimes clipped and left to retract into the skin and are thus retained. Rare complications from these retained wires have been documented in numerous case reports. We describe a case of a 57-year-old man with chronically draining wounds due to infected retained pacing wires. This case prompted a systematic review of these patients to delineate complications and to create a novel treatment algorithm. METHODS The authors conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases and retrieved relevant, English-language articles published between 1986 and 2018. Two reviewers critically appraised the studies that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS Thirty-one articles met inclusion criteria with a total of 35 patients included. The existing articles represent either level IV or level V evidence. Mean  SD time of presentation from initial TEPW placement was 4.9  5.9 years, with a range of 1 month to 24 years and 77% of patients were symptomatic. The TEPW wire migration occurred in 74% of patients, with invasion into vasculature, visceral organs, and subcutaneous tissue. Most of the patients who underwent wire removal had complete recovery. The relevant literature suggests that there is a wide range of complications, and migration is more often associated with need for surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS In patients with severe symptoms or evidence of migration, surgical intervention and removal should be strongly considered to prevent potentially deadly complications. We propose an algorithm to minimize these complications based on a literature analysis in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.","output":"Retained Temporary Epicardial Pacing Wires: A Systematic Review and Treatment Algorithm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the causal agent of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. They are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family. Proteases of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary for viral replication, structural assembly, and pathogenicity. The approximately 33.8 kDa M (pro) protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a non-human homologue and is highly conserved among several coronaviruses, indicating that M (pro) could be a potential drug target for Coronaviruses. Methods: Herein, we performed computational ligand screening of four pharmacophores (OEW, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and N3) that are presumed to have positive effects against SARS-CoV-2 M (pro )protease (6LU7), and also screened 50,000 natural compounds from the ZINC Database dataset against this protease target. Results: We found 40 pharmacophore-like structures of natural compounds from diverse chemical classes that exhibited better affinity of docking as compared to the known ligands.

The vicious tentacles of the disease have been disseminated worldwide with unknown complications and repercussions. Advanced COVID-19 syndrome is characterized by the uncontrolled and elevated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressed immunity, leading to the cytokine storm. The uncontrolled and dysregulated secretion of inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines is positively associated with the severity of the viral infection and mortality rate. The secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 leads to a hyperinflammatory response by recruiting macrophages, T and B cells in the lung alveolar cells. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that immune cells such as macrophages recruit inflammatory monocytes in the alveolar cells and allow the production of large amounts of cytokines in the alveoli, leading to a hyperinflammatory response in severely ill patients with COVID-19. This cascade of events may lead to multiple organ failure, acute respiratory distress, or pneumonia. Although the disease has a higher survival rate than other chronic diseases, the incidence of complications in the geriatric population are considerably high, with more systemic complications. This review sheds light on the pivotal roles played by various inflammatory markers in COVID-19-related complications. Different molecular pathways, such as the activation of JAK and JAK/STAT signaling are crucial in the progression of cytokine storm; hence, various mechanisms, immunological pathways, and functions of cytokines and other inflammatory markers have been discussed. A thorough understanding of cytokines molecular pathways and their activation procedures will add more insight into understanding immunopathology and designing appropriate drugs, therapies, and control measures to counter COVID-19. Recently, anti-inflammatory drugs and several antiviral drugs have been reported as effective therapeutic drug candidates to control hypercytokinemia or cytokine storm. Hence, the present review also discussed prospective anti-inflammatory and relevant immunomodulatory drugs currently in various trial phases and their possible implications.","output":"Role of Inflammatory Cytokines in COVID-19 Patients: A Review on Molecular Mechanisms, Immune Functions, Immunopathology and Immunomodulatory Drugs to Counter Cytokine Storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we first introduce a new family of operators on weighted graphs called p-bilaplacian operators, which are the analogue on graphs of the continuous p-bilaplacian operators.

METHODS: In this study, we compare DETECTR with qRT-PCR to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 on 378 patient samples. Patient sample dilution assays suggest a higher analytical sensitivity of DETECTR compared with qRT-PCR; however, this was not confirmed in this large patient cohort, where we report 95% reproducibility between the 2 tests. RESULTS: These data showed that both techniques are equally sensitive in detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) providing additional value of DETECTR to the currently used qRT-PCR platforms. For DETECTR, different guide ribonucleic acids can be used simultaneously to obviate negative results due to mutations in N-gene. Lateral flow strips, suitable as a point-of-care test, showed a 100% correlation to the high-throughput DETECTR assay. More importantly, DETECTR was 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 relative to other human coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Because there is no need for specialized equipment, DETECTR could be rapidly implemented as a complementary technically independent approach to qRT-PCR thereby increasing the testing capacity of medical microbiological laboratories and relieving the existent PCR platforms for routine non-SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.","output":"Rapid, Sensitive, and Specific Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Detection: A Multicenter Comparison Between Standard Quantitative Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and CRISPR-Based DETECTR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined Flow with Nature (FWN) treatment, which is an integrative intervention (rehabilitation) based on eco and environmental psychology, psychotherapeutic theories and professional psychological practice. FWN is intended for depression rehabilitation with the help of social support, nature environments and FWN exercises. Exercises encourage sensing the environment, mindful awareness, psychological processing and focusing on the future. The FWN treatment proceeds in separate stages (horizon, growth and path), which emphasise nature, group (social support) and FWN exercises differently. This study focused on the experiences of the participants in the FWN treatment. Finnish adults who had been diagnosed with clinical depression took part in the FWN treatment (N = 82) and answered feedback questions (by paper, electronic questionnaire or phone discussion). Answers were analysed using theory-based content analysis. Data were collected between spring 2019 and spring 2020. The majority of the participants were women (82%) and on average 44 years old. Content analysis revealed that the participant feedback answers were in agreement with the central theoretical themes of FWN. The participants emphasised the significance of nature, social support and exercises differently. Moreover, the significance of these ingredients differed according to the stages of treatment: in the horizon stage restorative (e.g., fascination) and comprehensive nature experiences (e.g., connectedness with nature), in the growth stage social support (e.g., peer support) and in the path stage environmental self-regulation (e.g., nature as a part of life) were emphasised. These results are in accordance with the objectives of the stages and seem to support the phase-based rationale. The participants' experiences of the key elements of the intervention, social support and nature environment were experienced mainly positively, which supports their inclusion in future intervention versions.

Over the decades this has led to the development of the lipid raft hypothesis and the ensuing controversy that has unfolded. Here, we review the physical concepts behind domain formation in lipid membranes, both of their structural and dynamic origins. This, then leads into a discussion of coarse-grained, phenomenological approaches that describe the wide range of phases associated with lipid lateral heterogeneity. We use these physical concepts to describe the interaction between raft-lipid species, such as long-chain saturated lipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol with non-raft forming lipids, such as those with short acyl chains or unsaturated fatty acids. While debate has persisted on the biological relevance of lipid domains, recent research, described here, continues to identify biological roles for rafts and new experimental approaches have revealed the existence of lipid domains in living systems. Given the recent progress on both the biological and structural aspects of raft formation, the research area of membrane lateral heterogeneity will not only expand, but will continue to produce exciting results.","output":"Lateral Heterogeneity and Domain Formation in Cellular Membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some experts have promoted the use of rapid testing for COVID-19.

These defects can cause hypoparathyroidism with increased or decreased serum levels of PTH through 1) impaired PTH synthesis; 2) induction of parathyroid cell apoptosis; or 3) secretion of bioinactive PTH molecules. Eight pathogenic mutations of this gene have been described previously. OBJECTIVE: Through describing two novel mutations of the PTH gene, we aim to extend the molecular basis for FIH and further refine the proposed mechanisms by which PTH mutations cause hypoparathyroidism. DESIGN: Proband case reports with extended family analysis.Patients and Other Participants: The probands in both kindreds presented before 10-days-of-age with hypocalcemia and elevated phosphate levels. Proband A had low PTH levels, while these levels were elevated in Proband B. Proband B was initially diagnosed with pseudohypoparathyroidism. INTERVENTIONS: Methylation analysis of CpG dinucleotides within three GNAS differentially methylated regions; Whole genome sequencing; and PTH infusion with analysis of nephrogenous cyclic AMP. RESULTS: Proband A had a novel heterozygous sequence change in exon 2 of the PTH gene, c.46_47delinsAA (p.Ala16Lys) and Proband B had a novel homozygous nucleotide transition in PTH exon 3 (c.128G>A; p.G43E) that led to replacement of glycine by glutamic acid at position 12 of PTH 1-84. PTH 1-34 infusion demonstrated that renal responsiveness to PTH was intact and not antagonized by circulating bioinactive PTH. CONCLUSIONS: PTH gene mutations are uncommon causes of hypoparathyroidism, but can be misdiagnosed as disorders of gland development or receptor function if PTH levels are decreased or elevated, respectively. Genetic testing should be considered early in the diagnostic approach to these presentations.","output":"Novel PTH gene mutations causing isolated hypoparathyroidism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In our previous chapter, we explore the various innovation processes that comprise frugal innovation as well as novel innovation paradigms including open and reverse innovation. Importantly, we not only define the theoretical dimensions of these innovation processes but also the functional outputs in the form of tangible technologies/devices. But while the intellectual components of these processes are critical, what does this mean for the future of humanitarian medicine and innovation? The fact of the matter is that the deployment of innovation processes in conflict and crisis situations will likely consist of an amalgam of these processes that is utilized as a catalyst for high-functioning problem-solving in the field. The reality is that crisis and conflict situations are not black and white; thus the solutions developed in the field are likely to reflect this. This is where we examine the field-based applications of these technologies and their specific capacities to preserve human life. But before we delve into these medical devices, who are these devices meant for? There are three critical stakeholders in any humanitarian healthcare operation: humanitarian practitioners (i.e., doctors, nurses, aides, relief workers), community health workers (i.e., frontline public health workers from indigenous communities), and crisis-stricken communities themselves. While the scope and capacity to utilize devices varies among these groups, nonetheless, it is vital that each one of these stakeholders be properly retrofitted with the most basic of equipment, technology, and devices. In this book we take this a step further and examine how we can not only enhance the retrofitting of humanitarian operators but also their respective problem-solving and innovation processes to create adaptive solutions. We define these as high-utility, unconventional solutions that are derived in resource-poor settings. The reality is that while we can provide frugal devices to individuals, how do we stimulate continued innovation and the implementation of adaptive solutions on the ground?

Methods: This retrospective study included 282 patients with COVID-19. The PNI score of all patients, 147 of whom were male, with a mean age of 56.415.3 years, was calculated. According to the PNI score, the patients with normal and mild malnutrition constituted group-1 (n=159) and the patients with moderate-to-severe and serious malnutrition constituted group-2 (n=123). Results: The PNI score was correlated with age (r=-0.146, p=0.014); oxygen saturation (r=0.190, p=0.001); heart rate (r=-0.117, p=0.05); hospitalization duration (r=-0.266, p<0.001); white blood cells (r=0.156, p=0.009); hemoglobin (r=0.307, p<0.001); C-reactive protein (CRP) (r=-0.346, p<0.001); creatinine (r=-0.184, p=0.002); D-dimer (r=-0.304, p<0.001); ferritin (r=-0.283, p<0.001); procalcitonin (r=-0.287, p<0.001); the confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age 65 years score (r=-0.217, p<0.001); and the quick sequential organ failure assessment score (r=-0.261, p<0.001) in patients with COVID-19.

Interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitors have been used to treat this patient population, but the comparative effectiveness of these different strategies remains undetermined. We aimed to compare IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. Methods: This cohort study included patients admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and hyperinflammation, defined as serum C-reactive protein concentration of 100 mg/L or more or ferritin concentration of 900 ng/mL or more. The primary endpoint was survival, and the secondary endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation (adverse clinical outcome). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving IL-1 inhibition (anakinra) or IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab or sarilumab) with those of patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, after accounting for baseline differences. All patients received standard care. Interaction tests were used to assess the probability of survival according to C-reactive protein or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. Findings: Of 392 patients included between Feb 25 and May 20, 2020, 275 did not receive interleukin inhibitors, 62 received the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra, and 55 received an IL-6 inhibitor (29 received tocilizumab and 26 received sarilumab). In the multivariable analysis, compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, patients treated with IL-1 inhibition had a significantly reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0450, 95% CI 0204-0990, p=0047), but those treated with IL-6 inhibition did not (0900, 0412-1966; p=079). In the multivariable analysis, there was no difference in adverse clinical outcome risk in patients treated with IL-1 inhibition (HR 0866, 95% CI 0482-1553; p=063) or IL-6 inhibition (0882, 0452-1722; p=071) relative to patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For increasing C-reactive protein concentrations, patients treated with IL-6 inhibition had a significantly reduced risk of mortality (HR 0990, 95% CI 0981-0999; p=0031) and adverse clinical outcome (0987, 0979-0995; p=00021) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For decreasing concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenase, patients treated with an IL-1 inhibitor and patients treated with IL-6 inhibitors had a reduced risk of mortality; increasing concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase in patients receiving either interleukin inhibitor were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 1009, 95% CI 1003-1014, p=00011 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1006, 1001-1011, p=0028 for IL-6 inhibitors) and adverse clinical outcome (1006, 1002-1010, p=00031 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1005, 1001-1010, p=0016 for IL-6 inhibitors) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. Interpretation: IL-1 inhibition, but not IL-6 inhibition, was associated with a significant reduction of mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation.

DESIGN A repeated-measures design was used to evaluate the auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded in background noise with transparent and opaque face masks, and without a mask (N=154). In a smaller follow-up study (N=29), the same files were presented via auditory-only presentation to determine if differences observed in the transparent and opaque mask conditions were attributable to additional visual cues or to acoustic differences between the recordings of the two mask types. Listeners completed the 40-minute online session on a computer, laptop, or tablet in a quiet room via their personal listening devices (earbuds or hearing assistive device). The adult volunteers who used English as their first language were recruited through social media links and email and categorized into three groups: normal hearing and confirmed or suspected hearing loss either with or without the use of assistive listening devices. RESULTS Auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded with the transparent mask was significantly better (M=68.9%) than for sentences recorded with the opaque mask (M=58.9%) for all participants. There was a trend for those who used hearing assistive technology to score lower than the other two groups who had similar performance across all conditions regardless of mask type. Subjective ratings of confidence and concentration followed the expected pattern based on objective scores. Results of the auditory-only presentation of the sentences to listeners with normal hearing suggested that the transparent-mask benefits were not attributable to an acoustic advantage but rather to the addition of the visual cues of the talker's face available through the transparent mask. In fact, performance in the auditory-only presentation was significantly lower with the transparent mask (M=40.7%) compared to the opaque mask (M=58.2%).

SunTag in combination with a more potent version of sACE2 achieved near complete neutralization at a sub-nanomolar range, which is comparable with clinical monoclonal antibodies.

This retrospective study compares the events managed by the dispatch center and the characteristics of the patients transported to the hospital -age, sex, SpO2, deaths- managed by the EMS in Brescia and Bergamo provinces between March-April 2020 and March-April 2019. Ambulances' waiting time at the hospitals before discharging patients and the patients' severity at emergency department admission were also analyzed.Results. EMS managed 37,340 events in March-April 2020, +51.5% versus 2019. \\"Breathing\\" or \\"Infective\\" events reported to the dispatch center increased more than ten-fold (OR 25.1, p < 0.0001) in March 2020 and two-fold in April 2020 compared to 2019 (OR 3, p < 0.0001). Deaths increased +246% (OR 1.7, p < 0.0001), and patients not transported to hospital +481% (OR 2.9, p < 0.0001) in March 2020 compared to 2019. In some hospitals, ambulances waited more than one hour before discharging the patients, and the emergency departments doubled the admission of critically ill patients. Transported patients for \\"Breathing\\" or \\"Infective\\" events were primarily males (OR 1.5, p < 0.0001). The patients had lower SpO2 in 2020 than in 2019 and they were younger.Conclusions. The Lombardy region experienced an unexpected outbreak in an extremely short timeframe and in a limited area. The EMS coped with this pandemic, covering an extremely higher number of requests, with a ten-fold increase in the number of events managed.","output":"The Lombardy Emergency Medical System faced with COVID-19: the impact of out-of-hospital outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease is the leading cause of tooth loss worldwide. Current periodontal treatment is limited by its dependency on patients learning and maintaining good dental habits, and repeated visits to oral health physicians. Vitamin C's role in collagen synthesis and immune function makes it important in wound healing and possibly periodontal healing. Therefore, if some patients are deficient, this may worsen patient outcomes. METHODS: Patients were invited to participate following assessment and treatment at the Westmead Centre of Oral Health Periodontic Clinic, regardless of current disease stage or treatment. Adults were eligible if they gave informed consent and had current periodontal disease. Study involvement consisted of periodontal assessment and care followed by an interview and measurement of serum vitamin C and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: A total of 6 out of 20 patients had vitamin C levels less than the institutional normal range, of whom 2 had levels <11.4 mol/L and one <28 mol/L. Low vitamin C was associated with higher periodontal disease stage (p = 0.03). Elevated CRP was found in 2/3 of people with low vitamin C and CRP was negatively correlated with vitamin C (p < 0.01). Vitamin C did not correlate with patient-reported fruit or vegetable consumption, but high processed meat intake was associated with lower vitamin C. CONCLUSION: Although a small study, this rate of vitamin C deficiency in the periodontal clinic is clinically important and correlations with disease severity and CRP suggests biological importance. This warrants further studies to assess vitamin C and whether supplementation improves periodontal outcomes, particularly in deficient subjects.","output":"A Pilot Study Examining Vitamin C Levels in Periodontal Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has now been declared a global pandemic with evolving incidence rates and fatalities It is important to identify vulnerable populations who will be impacted most by this pandemic leading to higher mortality rates compared to the general healthy population Although older patients and patients with co-morbidities fall into this vulnerable group, patients with hematologic and oncologic malignancies on active cytotoxic treatments are at even greater risk as they are both myelosuppressed and immunosuppressed In addition to following the universal guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it is important to also institute guidelines for cancer centers to help protect this vulnerable population We review the current data, risks, and recommendations for COVID-19 in cancer patients","output":"COVID-19 and Cancer Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although there are many asymptomatic patients, one of the problems of COVID-19 is early recognition of the disease.

The ARIA members who were seeing COVID-19 patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire on the upper airway symptoms of COVID-19, common cold and allergic rhinitis. RESULTS: Among the 192 ARIA members who were invited to respond to the questionnaire, 89 responded and 87 questionnaires were analysed. The consensus was then reported. A two-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in the symptom intensity between the three diseases (p < .001).

The molecule is completely flat and stabilized by an intramolecular OCHO hydrogen bond, yielding a six-membered pseudo-aromatic ring. The aromaticity index of this pseudo-aromatic ring was found to be 0.748, while the same indix for the pyrazine ring in favipiravir was found to be 0.954. The crystal packing of favipiravir is mainly constructed through intermolecular NCHO, NCHN and CCHO hydrogen bonds, yielding a 3D supramolecular framework with a zst topology defined by the point symbol of (658). The crystal structure of favipiravir is further stabilized by weak CCFFCC intermolecular type II dihalogen interactions, yielding a 1D supramolecular polymeric chain. More than 80% of the total Hirshfeld surface area for favipiravir is occupied by HH/C/N/O/F and CN/O contacts. Energy frameworks have been calculated to additionally analyze the overall crystal packing. It was established that the structure of favipiravir is mainly characterized by the dispersion energy framework followed by the less significant electrostatic energy framework contribution. Finally, by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, we have assigned the interaction energy of each hydrogen bond, which can be helpful to develop scoring functions to be used in force fields/docking calculations.

Until the invention of the electron microscope, it was impossible to visualize a virus. The first viruses to be visualized were bacteriophage, which appeared to have a head and tail-like structure. Only the nucleic acid entered the bacterial cell through the tail. Animal viruses were described as spherical or rod-shaped; they were bound to receptors and were taken up by the cell. After the crystallization of the tobacco mosaic virus, there was much discussion as to whether viruses were living organisms; the controversy continues to this day. Although viruses were defined in part on the basis of size and filterability, viruses much larger than the traditional viruses have recently been isolated. Studies of viral replication indicate that most viruses self-assemble as a result of interactions between the viral proteins to form a viral capsid that interacts with the nucleic acid to form the whole. The viral replication cycle and synthesis is presented in this chapter. Viral classification into a Linnaean scheme has been proposed, but newer methods using nucleic acid homologies are changing classification. Viruses are spread in the human population by various means, including airborne particles, fecal-oral contact, clothing, insects, and contact with other animals (zoonosis).","output":"What Is a Virus?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE: Billy is a 2.6-year-old boy who presented for evaluation in the developmental-behavioral pediatrics (DBP) clinic 2 weeks before the onset of pandemic-related clinic restrictions. Billy had received early intervention for the past year because of speech and fine motor delays. Billy's parents requested the evaluation in the DBP clinic because his delayed speech and disruptive behaviors had raised concern that he may have autism spectrum disorder. Owing to the onset of the pandemic, subsequent visits were completed through telehealth with a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, behavioral clinician, and social workers who developed a collaborative plan of care. Billy was diagnosed with global developmental delay, significant tantrums, and impulsivity but did not meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder.Billy lives with his parents and 2 sisters in a rural area, 3 hours from the DBP clinic. Both of his parents have been treated for depression in the past and reported that school was difficult for them. His sisters, ages 5 and 6 years, receive speech/language therapy but have not required additional special education services. His family has endured recent stressors including a flooding event that caused significant damage to their home, financial difficulties, and the recent unexpected death of a close family member. Billy's disruptive behaviors have resulted in difficulty finding and maintaining child care, further contributing to parental stress and dysfunction in the home.Despite assistance from the social worker, additional developmental and behavioral support services near the family's home were not identified.

This study aims to synthesise evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vaccine hesitancy. Methods: A scoping review of literature between 1 January 2020 and 1 August 2021 was performed. Results: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance decreased from more than 70 to <50% in 8 months starting from January 2020. Healthcare professionals demonstrate higher rates of vaccine receptivity than the public, which was more influenced by (social) media. The circulation of misinformation was associated with increased fear of side effects related to COVID-19 vaccines. Regarding other vaccines coverage, parents' intentions to vaccinate their children against influenza increased 15.8% during the COVID-19 pandemic so far. Nonetheless, the number of vaccines administered decreased, influenced by factors like fear of being exposed to the virus at healthcare facilities and restrictions.

Five Peppermint Experiments with gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS), operating in the positive mode with a tritium 3H 5.68 keV, 370 MBq ionisation source, were undertaken to provide benchmark Peppermint Washout data for this technique, to support its use in breath-testing, analysis, and research. Headspace analysis of a peppermint-oil capsule by GC-IMS with on-column injection (0.5 cm3) identified 12 IMS responsive compounds, of which the four most abundant were: eucalyptol; -pinene; -pinene; and limonene. Elevated concentrations of these four compounds were identified in exhaled-breath following ingestion of a peppermint-oil capsule. An unidentified compound attributed as a volatile catabolite of peppermint-oil was also observed. The most intense exhaled peppermint-oil component was eucalyptol, which was selected as a peppermint marker for benchmarking GC-IMS. Twenty-five washout experiments monitored levels of exhaled eucalyptol, by GC-IMS with on-column injection (0.5 cm3), at t=0 min, and then at t+60, t+90, t+165, t+285 and t+360 min from ingestion of a peppermint capsule resulting in 148 peppermint breath analyses. Additionally, the Peppermint Washout data was used to evaluate clinical deployments with a further five washout tests run in clinical settings generating an additional 35 breath samples. Regression analysis yielded an average extrapolated time taken for exhaled eucalyptol levels to return to baseline values to be 429  62 min ( 95% confidence-interval).

A key contemporary example can be found in the uptake of swap lines during the Covid-19 market turmoil in early 2020: swap lines alleviated offshore dollar funding conditions to such an extent that they also triggered reverse inflows of dollar liquidity back into the US. More than simply providing a backstop to the global system, these swap interventions effectively restructured cross-border financial flows in a way that afforded the Fed greater control over domestic markets.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the records of the Information System of the Epidemiological Surveillance of Influenza of the Health Ministry of Brazil was performed. It included the data of female patients aged 10 to 49 years hospitalized because of severe COVID-19 disease (RT-PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2), from February 17, 2020 to January 02, 2021. They were separated into 3 groups: pregnant, puerperal, and neither pregnant nor puerperal. General comparisons and then adjustments for confounding variables (propensity score matching [PSM]) were made, using demographic and clinical characteristics, disease progression (admission to the intensive care unit [ICU] and invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support), and outcome (cure or death). Deaths were analyzed in each group according to comorbidities, invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support, and admission to the ICU. RESULTS: As many as 40,640 reproductive age women hospitalized for COVID-19 were identified: 3,372 were pregnant, 794 were puerperal, and 36,474 were neither pregnant nor puerperal. Groups were significantly different in terms of demographic data and comorbidities (p<0.0001). Pregnant and puerperal women were less likely to be symptomatic than the women who were neither one nor the other (72.1%, 69.7% and 88.8%, respectively).

The current study examines in depth how the occupational balance of healthcare professionals has changed in the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: The current study has a mixed design, which involves collecting both qualitative and quantitative data. In the first stage of the study, which is the quantitative one, Turkish Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ11\\\\T) was used to collect data, whereas the second stage of the study, which is the qualitative one, was designed to explore occupational balance and the related issues via using semi\\\\structured interviews. The MannCWhitney U test was used to compare parameters between the groups (working in activeCpassive contact with COVID patients). On the other hand, qualitative data were evaluated via consensual qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: The level of occupational balance of healthcare professionals included in the study group was found to be significantly lower than the level of occupational balance of healthcare professionals included in the control group (P = .005). Although there was no clear problem in self\\\\care activities of healthcare professionals, the balance between productivity and leisure time activities was disrupted. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational balance and leisure time use of healthcare professionals, especially those who have active contact with COVID patients, have been affected.

In this paper, we propose to leverage social media users as social sensors to simultaneously predict the pandemic trends and suggest potential risk factors for public health experts to understand spread situations and recommend proper interventions. More precisely, we develop novel deep learning models to recognize important entities and their relations over time, thereby establishing dynamic heterogeneous graphs to describe the observations of social media users. A dynamic graph neural network model can then forecast the trends (e.g. newly diagnosed cases and death rates) and identify high-risk events from social media. Based on the proposed computational method, we also develop a web-based system for domain experts without any computer science background to easily interact with. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale datasets of COVID-19 related tweets provided by Twitter, which show that our method can precisely predict the new cases and death rates.

Despite its importance, the long-term persistence of its small and fragmented populations is jeopardised by genetic erosion and hence, monitoring its genetic resource and variability is practically required for providing conservation measures of the species germplasm in Zagros woodland ecosystem. The present study aimed to provide the first data on genetic diversity and genetic differentiation pattern of 19 natural populations comprising 240 individuals of A. monspessulanum across its growing area in Zagros forests using three molecular tools including inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), start codon targeted (SCoT), and simple sequence repeat (SSR). In total, ISSR and SCoT primers generated a total of 141 and 121 clear and scorable bands for analysis with the polymorphism rate of 90.50 and 90.02% and a mean of 10.85 and 11 fragments per marker, respectively. In addition, 73 alleles were achieved using 10 polymorphic SSR loci from the studied accessions with 100% polymorphism, ranging between 5 and 10 alleles per locus. Average percentage of polymorphic alleles per population for ISSR, SCoT, and SSR data was 84.02%, 83%, and 100%, respectively, and generally, Nei's gene diversity (H) and Shannon's index of diversity (I) values for all populations demonstrated moderate to high levels of genetic diversity (H = 0.267-0.707; I = 0.38-1.38). The AMOVA results of the three marker systems attributed higher genetic variation to individuals within in each population than among populations. Furthermore, overall GST value for all populations detected the moderate to high levels of genetic differentiation, indicating a limited gene flow occurrence among the populations. STRUCTURE analysis (K = 5) clustered the populations into four to five distinct groups, in accordance with geographical distances. These results could represent an important contribution for effective germplasm characterization and could be eventually used in in situ or ex situ conservation of A. monspessulanum genetic resources.","output":"Genetic diversity and genetic structure of Acer monspessulanum L. across Zagros forests of Iran using molecular markers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: A new emerging infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic Early diagnosis is essential to prevent and halt the spread of the disease, patient management and isolation In this study, we aimed to reveal correlations between clinical and laboratory findings with chest CT Methods: This in an observational case series single center study in a secondary hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia Patients were included if they had typical symptoms and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 Results: Forty-two patients with positive RT-PCR were included in this study Typical CT findings were present in 33 (78 6%) We found a positive correlation between patients in whom the imaging was performed after the 4th day of symptoms and chest CT findings (r=0 365 p&lt;0 05) In receiver operating characteristic analysis of this parameter, the area under curve (AUC) was 0 678, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0 96 and 0 44, respectively Conclusions: Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to promptly isolate and treat suspected patients Utilization of chest CT to help diagnosis in this pandemic era needs to be considered by healthcare facilities especially if RT-PCR is limited [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Germs is the property of Asociatia Pentru Cresterea Vizibilitatii Cercetarii Stiintifice (ACVCS) and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Association between clinical, laboratory findings and chest CT in COVID-19 in a secondary hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are still many unanswered questions about the novel coronavirus; however, a largely underutilized source of knowledge is the millions of people who have recovered after contracting the virus. This includes a majority of undocumented cases of COVID-19, which were classified as mild or moderate and received little to no clinical care during the course of illness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to document and glean insights from the experiences of individuals with a first-hand experience in dealing with COVID-19, especially the so-called mild-to-moderate cases that self-resolved while in isolation. METHODS: This web-based survey study called C19 Insider Scoop recruited adult participants aged 18 years or older who reside in the United States and had tested positive for COVID-19 or antibodies. Participants were recruited through various methods, including online support groups for COVID-19 survivors, advertisement in local news outlets, as well as through professional and other networks. The main outcomes measured in this study included knowledge of contraction or transmission of the virus, symptoms, and personal experiences on the road to recovery. RESULTS: A total of 72 participants (female, n=53; male, n=19; age range: 18-73 years; mean age: 41 [SD 14] years) from 22 US states were enrolled in this study. The top known source of how people contracted SARS-CoV-2, the virus known to cause COVID-19, was through a family or household member (26/72, 35%). This was followed by essential workers contracting the virus through the workplace (13/72, 18%). Participants reported up to 27 less-documented symptoms that they experienced during their illness, such as brain or memory fog, palpitations, ear pain or discomfort, and neurological problems. In addition, 47 of 72 (65%) participants reported that their symptoms lasted longer than the commonly cited 2-week period even for mild cases of COVID-19. The mean recovery time of the study participants was 4.5 weeks, and exactly one-half of participants (50%) still experienced lingering symptoms of COVID-19 after an average of 65 days following illness onset. Additionally, 37 (51%) participants reported that they experienced stigma associated with contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents preliminary findings suggesting that emphasis on family or household spread of COVID-19 may be lacking and that there is a general underestimation of the recovery time even for mild cases of illness with the virus. Although a larger study is needed to validate these results, it is important to note that as more people experience COVID-19, insights from COVID-19 survivors can enable a more informed public, pave the way for others who may be affected by the virus, and guide further research.","output":"Learning From the Experiences of COVID-19 Survivors: Web-Based Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial reduction in gastrointestinal endoscopies, creating a backlog of procedures. We aimed to quantify this backlog nationally for England and assess how various interventions might mitigate the backlog. METHODS: We did a national analysis of data for colonoscopies, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and gastroscopies from National Health Service (NHS) trusts in NHS England's Monthly Diagnostic Waiting Times and Activity dataset. Trusts were excluded if monthly data were incomplete. To estimate the potential backlog, we used linear logistic regression to project the cumulative deficit between actual procedures performed and expected procedures, based on historical pre-pandemic trends. We then made further estimations of the change to the backlog under three scenarios: recovery to a set level of capacity, ranging from 90% to 130%; further disruption to activity (eg, second pandemic wave); or introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) triaging. FINDINGS: We included data from Jan 1, 2018, to Oct 31, 2020, from 125 NHS trusts. 10 476 endoscopy procedures were done in April, 2020, representing 95% of those done in April, 2019 (n=110 584), before recovering to 105 716 by October, 2020 (845% of those done in October, 2019 [n=125 072]). Recovering to 100% capacity on the current trajectory would lead to a projected backlog of 162 735 (95% CI 143 775-181 695) colonoscopies, 119 025 (107 398-130 651) flexible sigmoidoscopies, and 194 087 (172 564-215 611) gastroscopies in January, 2021, attributable to the pandemic. Increasing capacity to 130% would still take up to June, 2022, to eliminate the backlog. A further 2-month interruption would add an extra 154%, a 4-month interruption would add an extra 438%, and a 6-month interruption would add an extra 825% to the potential backlog. FIT triaging of cases that are found to have greater than 10 g haemoglobin per g would reduce colonoscopy referrals to around 75% of usual levels, with the backlog cleared in early 2022. INTERPRETATION: Our work highlights the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy services nationally. Even with mitigation measures, it could take much longer than a year to eliminate the pandemic-related backlog. Urgent action is required by key stakeholders (ie, individual NHS trusts, Clinical Commissioning Groups, British Society of Gastroenterology, and NHS England) to tackle the backlog and prevent delays to patient management.

The requirement to pivot suddenly to remote working has required the development of contingency curriculums, socially distanced campuses and an increased demand for online learning. This paper sets out to capture the emergent working practices and experiences of a group of Teacher Educators (TEs) from a university with a large Initial Teacher Education (ITE) provision. The findings suggest that TEs have proved agile, resilient and creative in the immediate short term. They modified their pedagogies and practices to manage the successful completion of existing programmes remotely, developing contingent online Communities of Inquiry (CoI). This continues in the current academic year as the TEs develop blended learning programmes to meet the university restrictions of limited face-to-face teaching. A longer-term view presents TEs with additional challenges, in terms of (re)designing curricula, assessments and accessibility. There are positive lessons for teacher education in terms of the benefits of new technological understanding and pedagogical adaptations. There is a need for further professional development of TEs and Universities will need to skill up and kit up TEs to enable them to meet the needs of an uncertain future and the next normal. Further research into the implications of any redesigns of ITE to a blended provision aimed at meeting the needs of an uncertain future will be needed.

The method is based on the availability of a target-binding nanobody, which is then rigidly attached to two scaffolds: 1) a Fab fragment of an antibody directed against the nanobody and 2) a nanobody-binding protein A fragment fused to maltose binding protein and Fab-binding domains. The overall ensemble of 120 kDa, called Legobody, does not perturb the nanobodyCtarget interaction, is easily recognizable in EM images due to its unique shape, and facilitates particle alignment in cryo-EM image processing. The utility of the method is demonstrated for the KDEL receptor, a 23-kDa membrane protein, resulting in a map at 3.2-? overall resolution with density sufficient for de novo model building, and for the 22-kDa receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resulting in a map at 3.6-? resolution that allows analysis of the binding interface to the nanobody. The Legobody approach thus overcomes the current size limitations of cryo-EM analysis.","output":"Cryo-EM structure determination of small proteins by nanobody-binding scaffolds (Legobodies)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a discretised version of our recently-developed SIR-type mathematical model for the spread of COVID-19, we construct a design of governmental policies for the eradication of the disease in the province of DKI Jakarta, Indonesia, taking as a basis the actual data of mid-2021.

It is beyond any doubt that it is, again, a call-to-action to minimize the risk of future zoonoses caused by emerging human pathogens. The primary response to contain zoonotic diseases is to call for more strict regulations on wildlife trade and hunting. This is because the origins of coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as other viral pathogens (e.g., Ebola, HIV) are traceable to wild animals. Although COVID-19 is not related to livestock animals, the pandemic increased general attention given to zoonotic viral infectionsthe risk of which can also be associated with livestock. Therefore, this paper discusses the potential transformation of industrial livestock farming and the production of animal products, particularly meat, to decrease the risks for transmission of novel human pathogens. Plant-based diets have a number of advantages, but it is unrealistic to consider them as the only solution offered to the problem. Therefore, a search for alternative protein sources in insect-based foods and cultured meat, important technologies enabling safer meat production. Although both of these strategies offer a number of potential advantages, they are also subject to the number of challenges that are discussed in this paper. Importantly, insect-based foods and cultured meat can provide additional benefits in the context of ecological footprint, an aspect important in light of predicted climate changes. Furthermore, cultured meat can be regarded as ethically superior and supports better food security. There is a need to further support the implementation and expansion of all three approaches discussed in this paper, plant-based diets, insect-based foods, and cultured meat, to decrease the epidemiological risks and ensure a sustainable future. Furthermore, cultured meat also offers a number of additional benefits in the context of environmental impact, ethical issues, and food security.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Is a Call to Search for Alternative Protein Sources as Food and Feed: A Review of Possibilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measles incidence in the United States has grown dramatically, as vaccination rates are declining and transmission internationally is on the rise. Measles virus is highly infectious and can cause severe symptoms and even death. Because imported cases are necessary drivers of outbreaks in non-endemic settings, predicting measles outbreaks in the US depends on predicting imported cases. To assess the predictability of imported measles cases, we performed a regression of imported measles cases in the US against an inflow variable that combines air travel data with international measles surveillance data. To understand the contribution of each data type to these predictions, we repeated the regression analysis with alternative versions of the inflow variable that replaced each data type with averaged values and with versions of the inflow variable that used modeled inputs. We assessed the performance of these regression models using correlation, coverage probability, and area under the curve statistics, including with resampling and cross-validation. Our regression model had good predictive ability with respect to the presence or absence of imported cases in a given state in a given year (AUC = 0.78) and the magnitude of imported cases (Pearson correlation = 0.84). By comparing alternative versions of the inflow variable averaging over different inputs, we found that both air travel data and international surveillance data contribute to the model's ability to predict numbers of imported cases, and individually contribute to its ability to predict the presence or absence of imported cases. Predicted sources of imported measles cases varied considerably across years and US states, depending on which countries had high measles activity in a given year. Our results emphasize the importance of the relationship between global connectedness and the spread of measles.","output":"Air passenger travel and international surveillance data predict spatiotemporal variation in measles importations to the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVIDCare@Home (CC@H) is a multi-faceted, interprofessional team-based remote monitoring program led by family medicine for diagnosed COVID-19 patients, based at Women's College Hospital, an ambulatory academic centre in Toronto, Canada. CC@H offers virtual visits (phone and video) to address the clinical needs and broader social determinants of health of patients during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, including finding a primary care provider and support for food insecurity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this evaluation is to understand the implementation and quality outcomes of CC@H within the Quadruple Aim framework of patient experience, provider experience, cost, and population health. METHODS: This multi-method cross-sectional evaluation follows the Quadruple Aim to focus on implementation and service quality outcomes including feasibility, adoption, safety, effectiveness, equity, and patient-centeredness. These measures were explored using clinical and service utilization data, patient-experience data (an online survey and a post-discharge questionnaire), provider-experience data (surveys, interviews and focus groups) and stakeholder interviews. Descriptive analysis was conducted for surveys and utilization data. Deductive analysis was conducted for interviews and focus groups, mapping to implementation and quality domains. The Ontario Marginalization Index (ON-Marg) measured the proportion of underserved patients accessing CC@H. RESULTS: 3412 visits were conducted in the first 8 months (Apr 8-Dec 8, 2020) for 616 discrete patients, including 2114 visits with family physician staff/residents, and 149 visits with social worker/mental health professionals. There was a median of 5 (IQR=4) visits per patient, with a median follow-up of 7 days (IQR=27). The Net Promoter Score was 77. 23.3% of patients were in the most marginalized populations based on residential postal code (as per the ON-Marg index). Interviews with providers and stakeholder indicated that the program continues to adapt to meet the needs of patients and the healthcare system.

In Germany the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a slowly growing demand for health care with a sudden occurrence of regional hotspots. This leads to an unpredictable situation for many hospitals, leaving the question of how many bed resources are needed to cope with the surge of COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: In this study we created a simulation-based prognostic tool that provides the management of the University Hospital of Augsburg and the civil protection services with the necessary information to plan and guide the disaster response to the ongoing pandemic. Especially the number of beds needed on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU) are the biggest concerns. The focus should lie not only on the confirmed cases as the patients with suspected COVID-19 are in need of the same resources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the input we used the latest information provided by governmental institutions about the spreading of the disease, with a special focus on the growth rate of the cumulative number of cases. Due to the dynamics of the current situation, these data can be highly variable. To minimize the influence of this variance, we designed distribution functions for the parameters growth rate, length of stay in hospital and the proportion of infected people who need to be hospitalized in our area of responsibility. Using this input, we started a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 runs to predict the range of the number of hospital beds needed within the coming days and compared it with the available resources. RESULTS: Since 2 February 2020 a total of 306 patients were treated with suspected or confirmed COVID-19a?at this university hospital. Of these 84 needed treatment on the ICU. With the help of several simulation-based forecasts, the required ICU and normal bed capacity at Augsburg University Hospital and the Augsburg ambulance service in the period from 28 March 2020 to 8 June 2020 could be predicted with a high degree of reliability. Simulations that were run before the impact of the restrictions in daily life showed that we would have run out of ICU bed capacity within approximately 1 month. CONCLUSION: Our simulation-based prognosis of the health care capacities needed helps the management of the hospital and the civil protection service to make reasonable decisions and adapt the disaster response to the realistic needs. At the same time the forecasts create the possibility to plan the strategic response days and weeks in advance. The tool presented in this study is, as far as we know, the only one accounting not only for confirmed COVID-19 cases but also for suspected COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the few input parameters used are easy to access and can be easily adapted to other healthcare systems.","output":"Bettenkapazit?tssteuerung in Zeiten der COVID-19-Pandemie : Eine simulationsbasierte Prognose der Normal- und Intensivstationsbetten anhand der deskriptiven Daten des Universit?tsklinikums Augsburg./ [Bed capacity management in times of the COVID-19 pandemic : A simulation-based prognosis of normal and intensive care beds using the descriptive data of the University Hospital Augsburg]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its resultant human disease, COVID-19, will likely have a significant impact on the corneal tissue donor pool.

To explore the diversity of deltacoronaviruses in animals in the Middle East, we tested fecal samples from 1,356 mammals and birds in Dubai, The United Arab Emirates. Four novel deltacoronaviruses were detected from eight birds of four species by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR): FalCoV UAE-HKU27 from a falcon, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 from a houbara bustard, PiCoV UAE-HKU29 from a pigeon, and QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 from five quails. Complete genome sequencing showed that FalCoV UAE-HKU27, HouCoV UAE-HKU28, and PiCoV UAE-HKU29 belong to the same CoV species, suggesting recent interspecies transmission between falcons and their prey, houbara bustards and pigeons, possibly along the food chain. Western blotting detected specific anti-FalCoV UAE-HKU27 antibodies in 33 (75%) of 44 falcon serum samples, supporting genuine infection in falcons after virus acquisition. QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 belongs to the same CoV species as porcine coronavirus HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15) and sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (SpCoV HKU17), discovered previously from swine and tree sparrows, respectively, supporting avian-to-swine transmission. Recombination involving the spike protein is common among deltacoronaviruses, which may facilitate cross-species transmission. FalCoV UAE-HKU27, HouCoV UAE-HKU28, and PiCoV UAE-HKU29 originated from recombination between white-eye coronavirus HKU16 (WECoV HKU16) and magpie robin coronavirus HKU18 (MRCoV HKU18), QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 from recombination between PorCoV HKU15/SpCoV HKU17 and munia coronavirus HKU13 (MunCoV HKU13), and PorCoV HKU15 from recombination between SpCoV HKU17 and bulbul coronavirus HKU11 (BuCoV HKU11).

Genome analysis revealed evidence of recent interspecies transmission between falcons and their prey, houbara bustards and pigeons, possibly along the food chain, as well as avian-to-swine transmission. Recombination, which is known to occur frequently in some coronaviruses, was also common among these deltacoronaviruses and occurred predominantly at the spike region. Such recombination, involving the receptor binding protein, may contribute to the emergence of new viruses capable of infecting new hosts.

The effect of newly discovered viruses on asthma control is less well defined. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the contribution of respiratory viruses to asthma exacerbations in children with a panel of PCR assays for common and newly discovered respiratory viruses. METHODS: Respiratory specimens from children aged 2 to 17 years with asthma exacerbations (case patients, n = 65) and with well-controlled asthma (control subjects, n = 77), frequency matched by age and season of enrollment, were tested for rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and human bocavirus. RESULTS: Infection with respiratory viruses was associated with asthma exacerbations (63.1% in case patients vs 23.4% in control subjects; odds ratio, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.7- 11.6). Rhinovirus was by far the most prevalent virus (60% among case patients vs 18.2% among control subjects) and the only virus significantly associated with exacerbations (odds ratio, 6.8; 95% CI, 3.2-14.5). However, in children without clinically manifested viral respiratory tract illness, the prevalence of rhinovirus infection was similar in case patients (29.2%) versus control subjects (23.4%, P > .05). Other viruses detected included human metapneumovirus (4.6% in patients with acute asthma vs 2.6% in control subjects), enteroviruses (4.6% vs 0%), coronavirus 229E (0% vs 1.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (1.5% vs 0%).

The most commonly studied cohorts were mechanically ventilated patients (28/29, 96.6%) and postsurgical patients (11/29, 37.9%) with inclusion criteria for age ranging from 00.5 to 15.07.3 years (medianIQR). The median age of enrolled patients was 1.7 years (IQR=4.4 years). Patients excluded from trials were those with neurological impairment (21/29, 72.4%), complex disease (20/29, 69.0%) or receipt of neuromuscular blockade (10/29, 34.5%). Trials evaluated drugs/protocols for sedation management (20/29, 69.0%), weaning (3/29, 10.3%), daily interruption (3/29, 10.3%) or protocolisation (3/29, 10.3%). Primary outcome measures were heterogeneous, as were assessment instruments and follow-up durations. CONCLUSIONS There is substantial heterogeneity in methodological approach in clinical trials evaluating sedation in critically ill paediatric patients. These results provide a basis for the design of future clinical trials to improve the quality of trial data and aid in the development of sedation-related clinical guidelines.","output":"Design and reporting characteristics of clinical trials investigating sedation practices in the paediatric intensive care unit: a scoping review by SCEPTER (Sedation Consortium on Endpoints and Procedures for Treatment, Education and Research)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In Brazil, telemedicine was allowed as an exception during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite its recognized value and availability, telemedicine is not universally used, suggesting that some barriers prevent its adoption and acceptance within the community. This study aims to describe the implementation of a low-cost telemedicine service in a pediatric hospital in Brazil. METHOD: Retrospective descriptive study reporting the first three months (April to June 2020) of the experience of implementing a low-cost telemedicine emergency care program in a public tertiary hospital. The service was available to patients up to 18 years of age enrolled in this hospital. A tool for assessing the severity of the patient was developed, the aim of standardizing the procedure, while maintaining quality and safety. Guardian's satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire sent after teleconsultations. RESULTS: 255 teleconsultations were carried out with 140 different patients. Of the total consultations, 182 were from 99 patients that had performed the Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test for the new coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) or had direct contact with a person known to be positive for COVID-19. Only 26 (14%) were referred to an in-person consultation. No deaths, adverse events or delayed diagnosis were recorded. 86% of the patients who answered the satisfaction questionnaire were satisfied and 92% would use telemedicine again. CONCLUSION: This study presents an innovative implementation of a telemedicine program in a public and exclusively pediatric tertiary service, serving as a reference for future implementation in other public services in Brazil and developing countries.","output":"Fast, cheap and feasible: implementation of pediatric telemedicine in a public hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over 5 years, we prospectively collected nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from pediatric outpatients with prolonged fever (5 days, 38.0C).

PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 500 patients underwent ePLND for intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer by one surgeon during a 48-month period. A transperitoneal laparoscopic approach was used in all patients to allow adequate access to the internal iliac vessels. The variables chosen as being the most important discriminators of the quality of ePLND were operating time, complication rate and lymph node (LN) yield. The learning curves for ePLND were calculated using the cumulative sum and cumulative average methods and the number of procedures performed until attainment of acceptable failure rates (competence levels) was calculated. LN parameters were compared with the results from the preceding 311 cases where limited PLND was undertaken. RESULTS The median (range) preoperative PSA level was 8.0(1-62.5) ng/mL and biopsy Gleason score was 7(6-10). In all, 64% of patients had intermediate-risk and 36% had high-risk prostate cancer. There were no intraoperative blood transfusions and no conversions to open surgery. The median (range) blood loss was 200(10-1400) mL and the postoperative transfusion rate was 1.6%. The operating time fell at a steady rate of 2.7% after the 15th case and plateaued after 130 patients. At competence levels of 5% and 10%, the learning curve for all complications ended after 346 and 136 patients, respectively. At a 5% competence level the learning curve for PLND-specific complications was 40 cases and there was no learning curve at a 10% competence level. The overall complication rate was 7.2% of which almost half (47%) were deemed to be PLND-specific. The cumulative average of the LN counts plateaued after 150 procedures. Furthermore, the median LN count after ePLND was more than double that of the authors' historical standard PLND controls (14 vs 6, P < 0.001) and increased with experience up to the end of the series (9 to 20). The likelihood of LN involvement (LNI) correlated with biopsy and pathological Gleason grade, clinical and pathological stage and d'Amico risk group. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests a learning curve of 130 cases for operating time, 136 cases for all complications, 40 cases for PLND-specific complications and 150 cases for LN yield. The risk of LNI for patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer was 8.4% and 19.4%, respectively, which suggests that a significant proportion would benefit from ePLND. It also shows that ePLND can be safely incorporated into LRP, and therefore also into robot-assisted RP, in a high-volume setting.","output":"The learning curve for laparoscopic extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer: implications for compliance with existing guidelines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory disease; however, there have been multiple reports of associated myocarditis.

The subsequent efficient human-to-human transmission of this virus eventually affected millions of people worldwide. The most devastating thing is that the infection rate is continuously uprising and resulting in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities. This enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus is chiefly responsible for the infection of the upper respiratory system. The virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 is mostly regulated by its proteins like entry to the host cell through fusion mechanism, fusion of infected cells with neighboring uninfected cells to spread the virus, inhibition of host gene expression, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, mitochondrial biogenesis, etc. But very little is known about the protein structures and functionalities. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to learn more about these proteins through bioinformatics approaches. In this study, ORF10, ORF7b, ORF7a, ORF6, membrane glycoprotein, and envelope protein have been selected from a Bangladeshi Corona-virus strain G039392 and a number of bioinformatics tools (MEGA-X-V10.1.7, PONDR(R), ProtScale, ProtParam, SCRIBER, NetSurfP v2.0, IntFOLD, UCSF Chimera, and PyMol) and strategies were implemented for multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny analysis with 9 different variants, predicting hydropathicity, amino acid compositions, protein-binding propensity, protein disorders, 2D and 3D protein modeling.

The distribution of the number of patients who applied to subspecialty sections of urology outpatient clinics and inpatient services were recorded by weeks. That data was compared to data obtained from 145,247 patients that applied to the same centers in the same period of the previous year (group 2). The reflection of worldwide and Turkish COVID-19 case distribution on the daily urological practice was analyzed. RESULTS: There was a decrease in the number of patients in all subspecialty sections the in group 1 compared to group 2; however, there was a significant proportional increase in urooncology and general urology admissions. A decrease of approximately 75% was observed in the total number of surgeries (p < 0.001). We detected a negative correlation between the numbers of admission to all outpatient clinics and COVID-19 cases or deaths in Turkey (p < 0.05). The same negative correlation was present for all surgical procedures and consultations (p < 0.05). The multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the number of cases in Turkey, and the number of deaths worldwide affect the number of outpatient clinic admissions (R2 = 0.38, p = 0.028) and urological surgery (R2 = 0.33, p = 0.020) in Turkey negatively.

To determine the role of Ab bivalency and the contribution of its Fc portion in the neutralization of viral infectivity and passive protection of mice by an in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective mAb (7-10A), F(ab')2 and Fab fragments were generated and their biologic properties were examined. The two fragments reacted in ELISA like the whole Ab against viral Ag or specific anti-idiotypic Abs. The affinity constants of the different Ab preparations were determined by surface plasmon resonance using immobilized anti-idiotypic Abs. The apparent affinity constant of the whole Ab molecule was 7.0 x 10(9) M-1 and was reduced 2-fold for F(ab')2 fragments and 14-fold for Fab molecules. Like whole Ab, both F(ab')2 and Fab fragments could neutralize virus in vitro and passively protect mice in vivo. However, the efficiency of in vivo neutralization by Fab fragments was reduced compared with the bivalent molecules, despite almost identical half-lives of both types of Ab fragments. These results demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo virus neutralization mechanisms by this Ab are independent of Fc-mediated functions and bivalency, but are probably influenced by Ab avidity.

The Zambian urban adherence club (AC) is a health service innovation designed to improve on-time drug pickup and retention in HIV care through off-hours facility access and pharmacist-led group drug distribution. Similar models of differentiated service delivery (DSD) have shown promise in South Africa, but observational analyses of these models are prone to bias and confounding. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of ACs in Zambia using a more rigorous study design. METHODS AND FINDINGS Using a matched-pair cluster randomized study design (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02776254), 10 clinics were randomized to intervention (5 clinics) or control (5 clinics). At each clinic, between May 19 and October 27, 2016, a systematic random sample was assessed for eligibility (HIV+, age  14 years, on ART >6 months, not acutely ill, CD4 count not <200 cells/mm3) and willingness to participate in an AC. Clinical and antiretroviral drug pickup data were obtained through the existing electronic medical record. AC meeting attendance data were collected at intervention facilities prospectively through October 28, 2017. The primary outcome was time to first late drug pickup (>7 days late). Intervention effect was estimated using unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox proportional hazards model to derive an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR). Medication possession ratio (MPR) and implementation outcomes (adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and fidelity) were additionally evaluated as secondary outcomes. Baseline characteristics were similar between 571 intervention and 489 control participants with respect to median age (42 versus 41 years), sex (62% versus 66% female), median time since ART initiation (4.8 versus 5.0 years), median CD4 count at study enrollment (506 versus 533 cells/mm3), and baseline retention (53% versus 55% with at least 1 late drug pickup in previous 12 months). The rate of late drug pickup was lower in intervention participants compared to control participants (aHR 0.26, 95% CI 0.15-0.45, p < 0.001). Median MPR was 100% in intervention participants compared to 96% in control participants (p < 0.001). Although 18% (683/3,734) of AC group meeting visits were missed, on-time drug pickup (within 7 days) still occurred in 51% (350/683) of these missed visits through alternate means (use of buddy pickup or early return to the facility). Qualitative evaluation suggests that the intervention was acceptable to both patients and providers. While patients embraced the convenience and patient-centeredness of the model, preference for traditional adherence counseling and need for greater human resources influenced intervention appropriateness and feasibility from the provider perspective. The main limitations of this study were the small number of clusters, lack of viral load data, and relatively short follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS ACs were found to be an effective model of service delivery for reducing late ART drug pickup among HIV-infected adults in Zambia. Drug pickup outside of group meetings was relatively common and underscores the need for DSD models to be flexible and patient-centered if they are to be effective.

From February 25 to March 20, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey through online questionnaire, and selected obstetric nurses from Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces as the research objects by convenience sampling. Three hundred eighteen valid questionnaires were collected; the results of Symptom Checklist 90 showed that the scores of obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobia, and psychosis were higher than the Chinese norm (P < .01). There were 107 people whose total score of Symptom Checklist 90 was more than 160, and 83 people whose number of positive items was more than 43. Logistic regression results showed that married, temporary employment, lack of support and communication from family and relatives, onerous task, and unbearable responsibility were independent risk factors for mental disorder. There is a great psychological burden for obstetric nurses during the epidemic period. Decision makers should focus on necessary psychological intervention for those that are married, temporarily employed, and those lacking family supports including communication. At the same time, managers should distribute tasks reasonably to avoid psychological burdens caused by overwork.","output":"A survey of mental health status of obstetric nurses during the novel coronavirus pneumonia pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Millions of people have enrolled and enrol (especially in the Covid-19 pandemic world) in MOOCs. However, the retention rate of learners is notoriously low. The majority of the research work on this issue focuses on predicting the dropout rate, but very few use explainable learning patterns as part of this analysis. However, visual representation of learning patterns could provide deeper insights into learners' behaviour across different courses, whilst numerical analyses can -- and arguably, should -- be used to confirm the latter. Thus, this paper proposes and compares different granularity visualisations for learning patterns (based on clickstream data) for both course completers and non-completers. In the large-scale MOOCs we analysed, across various domains, our fine-grained, fish-eye visualisation approach showed that non-completers are more likely to jump forward in their learning sessions, often on a 'catch-up' path, whilst completers exhibit linear behaviour. For coarser, bird-eye granularity visualisation, we observed learners' transition between types of learning activity, obtaining typed transition graphs. The results, backed up by statistical significance analysis and machine learning, provide insights for course instructors to maintain engagement of learners by adapting the course design to not just 'dry' predicted values, but explainable, visually viable paths extracted.","output":"Is MOOC Learning Different for Dropouts?

complicated by the need for complex critical care, dynamic treatment guidelines, and a vague knowledge regarding the disease's pathophysiology A second key component of this challenge was the overwhelming surge in patient burden and the relative lack of trained staff and medical equipment which required rapid re-organization of large systems and augmenting health care efficiencies to unprecedented levels In contrast to the risk management strategies employed to mitigate other serious threats and the billions of dollars that are invested in reducing these risks annually by

A high levels of D-dimer have been suggested as a prognostic factor in cancerous and other critically ill patients. We aimed to evaluate D-dimer levels and outcomes of critically ill patients admitted to a tertiary care intensive coronary care unit (ICCU). Material and method: All patients admitted to the ICCU at our Medical Center between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their Ddimer level on admission. Low D-dimer level <500 ng/ml, and high Ddimer level 500 ng/ml. Survival, in-hospital interventions and complications were compared. Results and discussion: Overall 1,082 consecutive patients were included, mean age was 67 (16), 70% were males. Of them 296 (27.4%) had low D-dimer level and 663 (61.3%) had high D-dimer level. Patients with high D-dimer level were older as compared to patients with low Ddimer level (mean age 70.415 and 5913 years respectively, p=0.004), had significantly higher rate of female gender (35.9% vs 15.9% respectively, p<0.0001) and significantly higher rate of any prior cardiac interventions prior to their admission (26.7% vs 4.4% respectively, p<0.0001). Interestingly, patients with high D-dimer level had significantly lower rate of any acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as compared with the low D-dimer group (25.7 vs 66.4% respectively, p<0.0001) and lower rate of smokers (22.5 vs 45.6% respectively, p<0.0001). All 11 post-COVID-19 patients had high D-dimer level on admission. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis for mortality, adjusted for age, gender, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, ejection fraction<40 found that high D-dimer level was independently associated with higher mortality rates (HR=5.8;95% CI;1.7-19.1;p=0.004) as shown in Figure 1.

Although this is a challenging task due to significant fluctuations of daily confirmed cases, the results achieved by MGGP are promising. To be more specific, the predicted confirmed cases are acceptably close to the observed values for seven countries considered in this study. Thus, MGGP is suggested for developing estimation models of COVID-19. Furthermore, similarities and differences between the proposed prediction models are presented.

METHODS: Study of telephone consultation calls and toxicology analysis records of poisoning cases referred to the Dammam Poison Control Center in Saudi Arabia during the first half of 2020. Their distribution according to frequencies, causes, and other characteristics was compared to the first half of 2019. RESULTS: Analysis of telephone consultation calls revealed that the proportion of exposure to disinfectants and hand sanitizers during first half of 2020 increased to 20.4% (n = 496) and 3.4% (n = 83), respectively, compared to 9.8% (n = 215) and 0.4% (n = 10) for surface disinfectants and hand sanitizers, respectively, during the first half of 2019. In 2020, exposure to disinfectants and hand sanitizers dominated in preschool children (0-5 years). The total number of cases suspected for drugs/drugs of abuse overdose during the first 6 months of 2020 (n = 783) showed a significant decrease (P < 0.001) compared to the first 6 months of 2019 (n = 1086).

Prospective comparative studies with non-CoViD-19 ICU patients are completely lacking. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the incidence of DVT in ICU patients with CoViD-19 compared to non-CoViD-19 ICU patients who were treated in the University Hospital Augsburg during the same period. In addition, the aim was to investigate what type of anticoagulation was present in CoViD-19 patients at the time the DVT occurred and to what extent DVT is associated with increased mortality in this patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT. For this purpose, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of DVT in the investigated patient collective was markedly higher in patients with SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19 patients 20% vs. non-CoViD-19 patients 5%). Both DVT and elevated D-dimer levels were associated with increased mortality in the present study. CONCLUSION: We recommend the determination of D-dimer levels and, in the case of elevated levels, the broad indication for compression sonography of the deep leg veins on admission of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2.

With the anticipated population\\\\level increase in mental health issues as a result of COVID\\\\19, API college students are an especially high risk group to consider as API young and emerging adults tend to report similar levels of depression and anxiety symptoms compared with their peers, but underutilize service relative to their level of need. The objective of this presentation is to understand the impact of the pandemic on API mental health using large\\\\scale data, by evaluating pre\\\\pandemic (Fall 2019), initial months of the pandemic (March\\\\May 2020) and recent pandemic (Fall 2020) trends in API mental health and treatment utilization, as well as discussing the public health implications in higher education settings for API student populations. STUDY DESIGN: Data comes from 3 administrations of the Healthy Minds Study: Sept\\\\Dec 2019 (n=33,372 students across 32 campuses), March\\\\May 2020 (n=12,039 students across 7 campuses) and Sept\\\\Dec 2020 (n=15,949 students across 28 campuses). This data represents the largest and most comprehensive nationally recognized assessment of API student mental health symptoms, help\\\\seeking behavior and experiences of discrimination directly related to COVID\\\\19. We used bi\\\\variate analyses to compare mental health symptoms and treatment utilization across API students who identified as international students and those who reported US citizenship or permanent residency in the US. We used cross\\\\sectional logistic regression models to assess the association between discrimination and mental health symptoms and help\\\\seeking behavior. POPULATION STUDIED: Young and emerging adults who identify as Asian or Pacific Islander and are enrolled at a college or university in the United States. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Comparing Fall 2019 to Fall 2020, we found that API non\\\\international students reported a 23% increase in severe anxiety, a 10% increase in moderate or severe anxiety, and a 9% increase in severe depression; API international students reported a 16% increase in severe depression and a 12% increase in severe anxiety. In Spring 2020, 22% of API students experienced COVID\\\\related discrimination or hostility (25% in Fall 2020). COVID\\\\related discrimination or hostility was associated with greater odds of meeting the criteria for one or more clinically significant mental health conditions [aOR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.35\\\\2.49; p=0.000]. Treatment utilization among Asian students with at least one clinically significant mental health condition decreased by 26% between Fall 2019 and Spring 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Throughout the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, both API international and non\\\\international students reported increases in mental health symptoms and decreases in treatment utilization. Our analyses also suggest that COVID\\\\related discrimination is correlated with greater odds of clinically significant mental health symptoms as well decreased help\\\\seeking. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: The racialization of COVID\\\\19 has the potential to produce long\\\\lasting effects on attitudes towards API populations. Culturally tailored psychoeducation, collaborative care models and active recruitment of diverse and culturally\\\\competent mental health providers are potential avenues to facilitate help\\\\seeking.

This study adopts the framework of existential positive psychology, a second wave of positive psychology that emphasizes the importance of effective coping with the negative aspects of living in order to achieve greater wellbeing. Trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) can be crucial in this context as it refers to emotion-related personality dispositions concerning the understanding and regulation of one's emotions and those of others. The present study investigated the relationship between trait EI and both wellbeing and psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress), while exploring the mediating role of meaning-centered coping (proactive transformative strategies based on meaning in life) and maladaptive coping (i.e., behavioral disengagement and self-blame) during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 326 Lebanese adults completed measures of trait EI, wellbeing, psychological distress, coping, and meaning-centered coping. Results showed a strong positive correlation between trait EI and meaning-centered coping. Trait EI also correlated positively with wellbeing and negatively with psychological distress. Structural equation modeling showed that meaning-centered coping partially mediated the relationship between trait EI and wellbeing. Maladaptive coping fully mediated the relationship between trait EI and psychological distress. Findings indicate that trait EI is positively related to dealing with a stressful situation such as the pandemic in positive ways at both the cognitive level, by reformulating the situation to see something valuable in it, and behavioral level, by being proactive about it. Trait EI was positively linked to seeing the situation as an opportunity for personal growth, finding personal meaning in this situation, maintaining an attitude of hope and courage, and acting more responsibly with one's self and others during the current crisis. In turn, this coping formula was related to lower psychological distress and improved mental health. These results are consistent with the existential positive psychology framework and can inform implementation programs and policies aiming at raising awareness and promoting healthy and successful coping during the pandemic.","output":"Trait Emotional Intelligence and Wellbeing During the Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Meaning-Centered Coping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Left-right hemispheric asymmetry is an important aspect of healthy brain organization for many functions including language, and it can be altered in cognitive and psychiatric disorders.

In contrast to previous studies using the ROI approach, which has several drawbacks, the present study aimed to measure the impact of ischemic lesion location on functional outcome using a more precise voxelwise approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS Datasets of patients with acute ischemic strokes from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) were used. Primary outcome was functional outcome as assessed by the modified Rankin Scale 3 months after stroke. Ischemic lesion volume was determined on CT scans 3-9 days after stroke. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping techniques, including covariates that are known to be associated with functional outcome, were used to determine the impact of ischemic lesion location for outcome. RESULTS Of the 500 patients in the MR CLEAN trial, 216 were included for analysis. The mean age was 63 years. Lesion-symptom mapping with inclusion of covariates revealed that especially left-hemispheric lesions in the deep periventricular white matter and adjacent internal capsule showed a great influence on functional outcome.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical care associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (odds ratio 1.052 (1.009-1.101); p=00043) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (1.968 (1.389-2.590); p<00001), both at the time of hospital admission. The AUC-ROC for the combined model was 0.83 (0.76-0.90) (vs AUC-ROC SOFA p<0.05). The AUC-ROC for the validation cohort was 0.89 (0.82-0.95) (p>0.05 vs AUC-ROC development). CONCLUSION Patients COVID-19 presenting at admission SOFA score 2 combined with CRP  9,1 mg/mL could help clinicians to identify them at high risk to require critical care.","output":"[C-Reactive protein and SOFA scale: a simple score as early predictor of critical care requirement in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Spain.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vital statistics have had an important role in shaping the public health response, including recommendations for physical distancing and mask wearing, temporary lockdowns, and mobilization of health care systems.2 Racial and socioeconomic disparities in deaths attributed to COVID-19 have shown how structural racism contributed to vulnerability during the pandemic.3 Although monitoring death certificates for reference to COVID-19 is a useful method for detecting the mortality associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, it is likely to result in an undercount if COVID-19 is missing on death certificates in cases in which COVID-19 contributed to death.4-6 In fact, between 15% and 34% of excess deaths that occurred in 2020 duringthe COVID-19 pandemic were not directly assigned to COVID-19 on death certificates.7 These deaths likely include COVID-19 deaths not assigned to COVID-19 and indirect deaths related to social and economic consequences of the pandemic.

The race for a safe and efficacious vaccine was thus initiated with government agencies as well as major pharmaceutical companies as frontrunners. An ideal vaccine would activate multiple arms of the adaptive immune system to generate cytotoxic T cell responses as well as neutralizing antibody responses, while avoiding pathological or deleterious immune responses that result in tissue damage or exacerbation of the disease. Developing an effective vaccine requires an inter-disciplinary effort involving virology, protein biology, biotechnology, immunology and pharmaceutical sciences. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the pathology and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which are fundamental to vaccine development.

After LRYGB, the endoscopic access to the gastric remnant and pancreaticobiliary system is challenging. The laparoscopic gastric bypass with fundectomy and exploration of the gastric remnant (LRYGBfse) was introduced in an attempt to overcome this limitation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the medium-term outcomes and safety of LRYGBfse. METHODS Observational prospective single-arm multicenter cohort study. Patients with BMI > 35 kg/m2 were included. Previous open abdominal surgery was an exclusion criterion. Postoperative 1, 2, 3, and 5-year weight loss, BMI decrease, and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) were recorded. Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was used for paired data. RESULTS Among 653 enrolled patients, 229 completed the 5-year follow-up. Preoperative median body weight (kg) and BMI (kg/m2) were 133.4 kg (interquartile range (IQR) = 12.0) and 48.2 kg/m2 (IQR = 10.1), respectively. Median 5-year body weight, BMI, and %EWL were 83.7 (IQR = 17.3), 31.2 (IQR = 7.7), and 74.8 (IQR = 23.4), respectively, all significantly improved compared to baseline (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, and p = 0.012, respectively). Comorbid improvement or resolution was observed in 88% of the patients. No major intraoperative complications were reported. Postoperative overall morbidity and mortality rates were 1 and 0%, respectively. Banding removal was necessary in one patient 62 months after the index operation. CONCLUSIONS The LRYGBfse seems safe and effective with durable results at 5-year follow-up.

We discuss the impact of these factors on the CFR estimates for Germany, Italy, France, and Spain for the COVID-19 pandemic from early March to mid-April, 2020. We found that, first, a large proportion of the difference in CFRs can be attributed to different age structures of the cases. Second, lags of 5-10 days between day of case report and death should be used, since these provide the most constant estimates. Third, for France, Italy, and Spain, intensive care beds occupied by COVID-19 patients were positively associated with fatality risks of hospitalized cases.

One particular sequela of the disease that has gained wider attention over the past year is the sudden onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the weeks following recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia. While the pathophysiology for the development of this condition is uncertain, symptoms ranging from mild confusion and anxiety to florid psychosis with manic delusions and auditory and visual hallucinations have been rarely, but increasingly, reported in the literature. The acute development of such symptoms in the post-recovery period can be devastating for patients, their caregivers, and clinicians who may be unaware of effective management options. CASE REPORT In this case report, we present a 23-year old man who developed psychotic symptoms, including acute mania, delusions of grandeur, and auditory and visual hallucinations, 1 week following an extended hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient was admitted to our psychiatric unit and treated with a combination of antipsychotic and mood stabilizer medications. After 2 weeks of treatment, the patient's psychotic and mood-related symptoms resolved, with normal mental status maintained at last follow-up 1 month following discharge from our unit. CONCLUSIONS The acute development of neuropsychiatric symptoms is a rare but increasingly recognized sequela of COVID-19.

Many countries, from India to the U.K., have demonstrated vaccine nationalism. What are the ethical limits to this vaccine nationalism? Neither extreme nationalism nor extreme cosmopolitanism is ethically justifiable. Instead, we propose the fair priority for residents (FPR) framework, in which governments can retain COVID-19 vaccine doses for their residents only to the extent that they are needed to maintain a noncrisis level of mortality while they are implementing reasonable public health interventions. Practically, a noncrisis level of mortality is that experienced during a bad influenza season, which society considers an acceptable background risk. Governments take action to limit mortality from influenza, but there is no emergency that includes severe lockdowns. This \\"flu-risk standard\\" is a nonarbitrary and generally accepted heuristic. Mortality above the flu-risk standard justifies greater governmental interventions, including retaining vaccines for a country's own citizens over global need. The precise level of vaccination needed to meet the flu-risk standard will depend upon empirical factors related to the pandemic. This links the ethical principles to the scientific data emerging from the emergency. Thus, the FPR framework recognizes that governments should prioritize procuring vaccines for their country when doing so is necessary to reduce mortality to noncrisis flu-like levels. But after that, a government is obligated to do its part to share vaccines to reduce risks of mortality for people in other countries. We consider and reject objections to the FPR framework based on a country: (1) having developed a vaccine, (2) raising taxes to pay for vaccine research and purchase, (3) wanting to eliminate economic and social burdens, and (4) being ineffective in combating COVID-19 through public health interventions.","output":"On the Ethics of Vaccine Nationalism: The Case for the Fair Priority for Residents Framework."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The micro-bolometer is important in the field of infrared imaging, although improvements in its performance have been limited by traditional materials.

It is akin to a national lockdown. METHODS: A multi-centric cross-sectional web-based study was conducted from 29th May to 27th July 2020 among HCWs in Perlis, Malaysia using a 19-item validated questionnaire [Cronbach's alpha: 0.61 (knowledge domain), 0.74 (attitude domain), and 0.72 (practice domain)]. Challenges when working during MCO were identified from a self-rated five-point Likert scale of 14-item. RESULTS: There were a total of 373 respondents (response rate more than 40%); 48.0% were nurses, 14.7% were medical doctors, and 12.9% were administrative and technical support staffs. Majority of HCWs (90.1%, n = 336) had good knowledge, optimistic attitude (54.7%, n = 204) and good COVID-19 preventive measure practices (90.9%, n = 339). Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that profession was the single significant factor for good COVID-19 KAP. Though having lesser odds of good knowledge (aOR 0.07, 95% CI:0.01-0.36, p = .009), nurses showed greater odds of good attitude (aOR 3.14, 95% CI: 1.71-5.76, p = .011) and practice (aOR 10.69, 95% CI:2.25-50.86, p = .022) as compared to doctors and dentists.

We evaluate how family behaviors during the stay-at-home orders are related to changes in psychopathology relative to the assessment prior to the pandemic, identify factors that moderate the association of pandemic-related stressors with psychopathology, and determine whether these associations vary by age. Higher exposure to pandemic-related stressors was associated with increases in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms and this association persisted six months later. Greater engagement in exercise, a structured routine, greater time spent in nature, and less screen time, were associated with reduced internalizing and externalizing problems. The association between pandemic-related stressors and increases in psychopathology was significantly lower for youths with limited passive screen time, and marginally so for those with more time outdoors.

The strategy behind HDT is to interfere with host cell factors that are required by a pathogen for replication or persistence, to enhance protective immune responses against a pathogen, to reduce exacerbated inflammation and to balance immune reactivity at sites of pathology. Although HDTs encompassing interferons are well established for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis, novel strategies aimed at the functional cure of persistent viral infections and the development of broad-spectrum antivirals against emerging viruses seem to be crucial.

The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=154), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=149) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity. Differences in the performance of the Fear of Infection and Existential Threat scales are considered in terms of the respective objective and subjective nature of the constructs.","output":"Measuring COVID-19-related Fear and Threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali University Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case study focuses on the pastoral and communicative activity of priests from nine Roman Catholic dioceses during the first wave of Covid-19, i.e. from the beginning of the pandemic to approximately June 2020.

We explored subjects' COPD knowledge, including education they receive from health care providers, treatment experiences, and practices with inhalation devices. METHODS A multiple-choice online survey, developed by a steering committee of American Thoracic Society clinicians and scientists, was administered to subjects with COPD who were sourced from the Harris Poll Online panel. RESULTS Of the 254 respondents (mean age 61.8 y; 49% males), most subjects (82%) claimed to understand their disease and available treatments, yet COPD symptoms and causes were well known to only 45% and 44% of subjects, respectively. Forty-three percent of subjects had ever used a pressurized metered-dose inhaler or dry-powder inhaler. Of the 54% of subjects who had ever used a small-volume nebulizer (SVN), 63% considered this device to be easy to use, 55% considered it to be fast-acting, 53% considered it to be convenient, and 38% considered it to be essential for treatment. Among subjects who had ever used them, SVNs were preferred by 54% over other devices. One third of subjects desired more extensive education during office visits; 25% felt the time was insufficient to cover questions, and 15% felt their concerns about COPD treatment(s) were ignored. Subjects believed physicians (32%), nurses (26%), and no single provider (28%) were primarily responsible for training and assessing proper inhalation technique. CONCLUSION The survey showed differences between patients' beliefs and knowledge of COPD; the need for continuous education from health care providers, particularly on inhalation devices; and extensive use of pressurized metered-dose inhalers and dry-powder inhalers despite positive perceptions of SVNs.","output":"Results of a Patient Survey Regarding COPD Knowledge, Treatment Experiences, and Practices With Inhalation Devices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Low intensity, high-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied over the motor cortex decreases the amplitude of motor evoked potentials.

They were advised to treat a maximum of five migraine attacks over the course of six weeks. Results: From forty patients, twenty-five completed the study, sixteen in the active and nine in the sham group with a total of 102 treated migraine attacks. The percentage of terminated migraine attacks not requiring acute rescue medication was significantly higher in the active (21.5%) than in the sham group (0%), and the perceived pain after active stimulation was significantly less for 2C4 h post-stimulation than after sham stimulation. Conclusion: tACS over the visual cortex has the potential to terminate migraine attacks.

In the present study, we examined the association between distribution frequency of ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: We undertook an ecological study to examine the association between ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality across 25 countries to represent different geographical regions of the world. The population frequencies of ACE genotypes were drawn from previously published reports and data on COVID-19-related mortality were extracted from 'Worldometer'. Multivariable analyses were also undertaken adjusting for age (median age), sex (percentage of females) and the number of COVID-19 tests undertaken. Associations between genotypes deletion/deletion () and insertion/insertion (II) prevalence and COVID-19-related mortality (per million people per day since the first diagnosed case) were evaluated. RESULTS: The frequency of II genotype is highest in east Asian countries and lower among the European and African countries. An inverse geographical distribution frequency was noted for  genotype. Increasing II genotype frequency was significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.002-0.7, pa?=a?0.03). However, no association was found between  genotype frequency and COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted IRR 4.3, 95% CI: 0.5-41.2, pa?=a?0.2).

We synthesize current US Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates for parameter of infectious transmission, infection severity, and disease burden, and summarize epidemiologic contributions to these parameters published by CDC-affiliated investigators through Oct 30, 2020. Authoritative estimates of most infectious transmission and infection severity parameters exist but rely primarily on data from studies conducted in non-U.S. populations. Estimates of secondary infection risks for household, workplace, school, or other community settings are lacking and estimates of the clinical fraction remain uncertain. The CDC reports multiple disease incidence and prevalence measures at national and state geographies, including some measures disaggregated by age group, race/ethnicity and sex; however, nationally uniform disease burden measures are not available at the sub-state level or for sub-populations defined by exposure setting, limiting opportunities for targeted interventions. CDC-affiliated investigators authored 133 quantitative studies on COVID-19 through Oct 30, 2020; however only 34 employed analytic methods. The remainder were descriptive. Of the 34 analytic studies, eleven reported on risk factors for infection, seven reported on risk factors for severe disease, three on symptomatic infections, three reported secondary infection risks, and four reported on indirect pandemic effects.

Thematic analysis was used to interpret the transcripts. Participants described initial interest in trying ENDS in hopes of quitting smoking and because of convenience (i.e., due to rules, regulations, or social norms). Risk perceptions and higher prices relative to cigarettes were reported as disadvantages of ENDS that discouraged initiation. Dual Users and Rejectors reported product problems (e.g., products breaking) and dissatisfaction (i.e., inability to satisfy cravings for cigarettes) as factors that lowered their substitutability for cigarettes or led to discontinuing ENDS use. Switchers indicated that satisfaction, lack of product problems, and perceived safety facilitated successfully switching from cigarette smoking to exclusive ENDS use. However, Switchers reported trying many products before they found ones that satisfied their needs.

AF patients were hospitalized for primary catheter ablation. Patients with sinus rhythm admitted for other diseases during the same period were included in the control group. ELISA was used to measure plasma GDF\\\\15 concentrations. RESULTS: 60 UeAF patients, 60 paroxysmal AF (PAF) patients, and 70 control patients were enrolled. The mean age was 44.6 years. In the UeAF group, no patients had traditional clinical risk factors. The plasma GDF\\\\15 level in the UeAF group was (1028.5  180.5) pg/ml, higher than in the control group, and moderately lower than in the PAF group.

Because of the increasing prevalence of mental health disorders, there is increased use of psychotropic medications in adult and pediatric patients, which can pose a risk for potentially adverse pediatric ingestions. The objective was to determine trends and outcomes for pediatric psychotropic medication ingestions reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) National Poison Data System (NPDS). METHODS This was a retrospective review of pediatric (18 years of age) exposures reported to AAPCC NPDS between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018. Single psychotropic medication ingestions of atypical antipsychotics, bupropion, buspirone, clonidine, lithium, methylphenidate, mirtazapine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), trazodone, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were examined. RESULTS Over the 10-year study period, 356,548 pediatric psychotropic medication ingestions were reported to NPDS. SSRI ingestions were the most frequently reported (34%), followed by atypical antipsychotics (17%), and methylphenidate (15%). Unintentional ingestions were most prominent in patients 0-12 years of age (79%), whereas, in patients age 13-18 years, 76% were intentional. SSRI ingestions were asymptomatic in 68% of cases. Clonidine and bupropion ingestions had the highest proportion of moderate and major clinical effects (29 and 25%, respectively). There were 29 deaths: atypical antipsychotics (n = 4), bupropion (n = 10), lithium (n = 1), SNRI (n = 1), SSRIs (n = 7), and TCAs (n = 6); 19 (65%) were in adolescent patients. CONCLUSIONS SSRIs were the most frequently reported ingestion, while bupropion and clonidine were associated with a high percentage of moderate and major clinical effects.

These closure signs are characterised by a heavy use of relational features, including four expressive speech acts, namely greetings, apologies, thanks and wishes, which form the focus of the analysis. The relational work performed by these speech acts reflects the social changes brought about by the pandemic as well as the business owners attempts to retain their customers. The expressive speech acts featured on the signs are evaluated against the norms set out by the genre of closure signs. The comparative angle of the study, on the other hand, links the discussion to norms related to the display of emotions and to the use of conventionalised formulae in the two countries under study, thus revealing culture-specific perspectives on the dual function of expressive speech acts.","output":"On the dual role of expressive speech acts: Relational work on signs announcing closures during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with subsequently imposed restrictions and lockdowns also radically disrupted academic life.

The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death.

One child had SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive on nasopharyngeal swab while 2 had positive antibodies (IgM) to SARS-CoV-2. One adolescent female had features of Multi-Inflammatory System in Children (MIS-C) a few weeks before presenting with multiple pulmonary emboli and DVT. Thrombotic events included DVT of lower extremity (3 patients), multiple PE (2 patients), orbital vein thrombosis (1 patient) and upper extremity DVT (1 patient). Two of these patients had both DVT and PE. All patients had one or more antiphospholipid antibody present. Two adolescent females had new onset of systemic lupus erythematous. All patients were treated with systemic anticoagulation with heparin (initially with unfractionated heparin if clinically unstable and later changed to low molecular weight heparin). We report a cluster of adolescents with unusual thrombotic complications with antiphospholipid antibody positivity during the coronavirus 19 pandemic, 3 with positive virologic criteria, one with delayed presentation after MIS-C like features and one with close family member exposure. We hypothesize that VTE in children is likely due to development of antiphospholipid antibodies when associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This research builds on potential synergies between industry and university to expand the Palestinian agriculture sector resilience. We report on an explorative study that sought to understand the reality of the university?industry linkages (UILs) by considering information and experience gathered from 29 interviews in January 2020 and April 2021. Interviewees represent five key actor groups: farmers and agribusinesses, private institutions, universities, the Ministry of Agriculture, and NGOs. Content analysis revealed a nascent collaboration scope and uncovered the lack of a confident attitude among farmers towards agriculture research efforts, the poor communication performance, and misalignment of purpose. University actors need to encompass the UILs in their mission and touch farmers? needs by providing novelty evidence research. Yet, farmers and agribusinesses may take the initiative to communicate their problems and search for renovation. We developed a framework of underpinnings to enhance collaboration and a healthier agriculture sector.

This study aims to analyze the risk factors for upper gastrointestinal tract rebleeding among acute peptic ulcer patients. METHODS: This is a cohort clinical study conducted between July 2018 and June 2020. Patients admitted or hospitalized because of UGIB or developed it during their hospital stay were included.s The patients were divided into two groups for the statistical analysis using Forrest's ulcer rebleeding risk classification. Group 1: Forrest 1a+1b+2a+2b, and group 2: Forrest 2c+3. The fasting time before the endoscopic procedure was from 12 to 24 hours. Follow-ups were conducted for 30 days after the treatment. RESULTS: The total number of included subjects was 152, out of which 57.89% (n = 88) were male patients. The mean SD for patients age was 52.63 16.89; more than 40% (n = 62) of subjects were using antiplatelet medications, while only 13.15% (n = 20) used NSAIDs, and the mean SD for the transferred units was 2.32  1.88, 7.24% (n = 11) of patients died. After 30 days of the treatment, 6.57% (n = 10) of patients suffered from recurrent bleeding. The most common presentation was melena 67.95% (n = 103), 53% (n = 81) of patients had hematemesis, 69.73% (n = 106) patients had gastric ulcer and 30.26% (n = 46) had duodenal ulcers. CONCLUSION: Age, NSAIDs, altered mental capacity, Forrest classification (Ia,Ib, and IIa), and blood transfusion were associated with a higher risk of rebleeding. Furthermore, patients who needed 3.83 blood units were at higher risk of recurrent bleeding.","output":"The risk factors for the recurrent upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage among acute peptic ulcer disease patients in Syria: A prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International travel has been a significant factor in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Many countries and airlines have implemented travel restrictions to limit the spread of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. A common requirement has been a negative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction performed by a clinical laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of departure. A more recent travel mandate for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin M serology testing was instituted by the Chinese government on October 29, 2020. Pretravel testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 raises complications in terms of cost, turnaround time, and follow-up of positive results. In this report, we describe the experience of a multidisciplinary collaboration to develop a workflow for pretravel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin M serology testing at an academic medical center. The workflow primarily involved self-payment by patients and preferred retrieval of results by the patient through the electronic health record patient portal (Epic MyChart). A total of 556 unique patients underwent pretravel reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing, with 13 (2.4%) having one or more positive results, a rate similar to that for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing performed for other protocol-driven asymptomatic screening (eg, inpatient admissions, preprocedural) at our medical center. For 5 of 13 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive samples, the traveler had clinical history, prior reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive, and high cycle thresholds values on pretravel testing consistent with remote infection and minimal transmission risk. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin M was performed on only 24 patients but resulted in 2 likely false positives.

METHODS: A cohort-based probabilistic simulation model, informed by the latest epidemiological estimates on COVID-19 in the United States provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and literature review. Heterogeneity of parameter values across age group was accounted for. The main outcome studied was QALYs for the infected patient, patients family members, and the contagion effect of the infected patient over the duration of the pandemic. RESULTS: Averting a COVID-19 infection in a representative US resident will generate an additional 0.061 (0.016-0.129) QALYs (for the patient: 0.055, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.014-0.115; for the patients family members: 0.006, 95% CI 0.002-0.015). Accounting for the contagion effect of this infection, and assuming that an effective vaccine will be available in 3 months, the total QALYs gains from averting 1 single infection is 1.51 (95% CI 0.28-4.37) accrued to patients and their family members affected by the index infection and its sequelae. These results were robust to most parameter values and were most influenced by effective reproduction number, probability of death outside the hospital, the time-varying hazard rates of hospitalization, and death in critical care.

Doxycycline, with its pleiotropic effects, including anti-viral activity, has been proposed as a therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and about twenty clinical trials have started since the beginning of the pandemic. To gain information on the activity of doxycycline against SARS-CoV-2 infection and clarify some of the conflicting clinical data published, we designed in vitro binding tests and infection studies with a pseudotyped virus expressing the spike protein, as well as a clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain. Doxycycline inhibited the transduction of the pseudotyped virus in Vero E6 and HEK-293 T cells stably expressing human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 but did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. Although this conclusion is apparently disappointing, it is paradigmatic of an experimental approach aimed at developing an integrated multidisciplinary platform. To avoid wasting precious time and resources we believe very stringent experimental criteria are needed in the preclinical phase, including infectious studies with SARS-CoV-2 in the platform before moving on to [failed] clinical trials. Author Summary The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has created a completely unusual situation in rapidly searching for compounds able to interfere with the biological processes exploited by the virus. This new scenario has substantially changed the timing of drug development which has also resulted in the generation of controversial results, proving that the transition from computational screening to the clinical application requires great caution and careful studies. It is therefore necessary to establish new paradigms for evaluating the efficacy of a potential active molecule. We set up a preclinical platform aimed at identifying molecules active against SARS-CoV-2 infection developing a multidisciplinary approach based on very stringent experimental criteria, comprising in-silico studies, in vitro binding tests and infection studies with pseudovirus expressing the spike protein as well as clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains. We focused our attention on doxycycline which has been suggested as potential therapeutic candidate for treating COVID-19 and is currently employed in about twenty clinical trials. Doxycycline resulted effective in inhibiting the transduction of pseudovirus but it did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The results obtained underline the need to define more stringent and controlled pharmacological approaches before wasting precious time and resources with clinical trials.","output":"Doxycycline inhibition of a pseudotyped virus transduction does not translate to inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Psychological distress in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures represents an important public health issue. Aim: We studied psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures in the general population in Greece and Cyprus. Also, we investigated several demographic, clinical and job characteristics of the participants as possible determinants of distress. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Greece and Cyprus. Data collection was performed during lockdown measures and in particular during April 21st to May 4th 2020. We used the Greek version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R-Gr) to measure the distress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. Also, we collected data regarding the demographic, clinical and job characteristics of the participants. All participants provided informed consent to participate in the study. Results: Seventeen point four percent of the participants had overall IES-R score from 24 to 32 indicating that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinical concern, while 33.5% had overall IES-R score >32 indicating that PTSD is a probable diagnosis. Females, Cyprus residents, participants that live with elderly people or patients with a chronic disease in home, participants with a mental health disease or/and chronic disease, participants under pharmaceutical treatment, participants that lost their work due to the pandemic and participants that work in hospital experienced greater distress.

Current research has shown that there is a higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities amongst patients with severe COVID-19 or COVID-19-related deaths, but the link between cardiovascular disease and poorer prognosis is poorly understood. We believe that pre-existing immune dysregulation that accompanies cardiovascular disease predisposes patients to a harmful inflammatory immune response, leading to their higher risk of severe disease.

Within the last century, four global pandemics have resulted from the introduction of novel IAVs into humans, with components of each originating from avian viruses. IAVs infect many avian species wherein they maintain a diverse natural reservoir, posing a risk to humans through the occasional emergence of novel strains with enhanced zoonotic potential. One natural barrier for transmission of avian IAVs into humans is the specificity of the receptor-binding protein, hemagglutinin (HA), that recognizes sialic acid-containing glycans on host cells. HAs from human IAVs exhibit \\"human-type\\" receptor specificity, binding exclusively to glycans on cells lining the human airway where terminal sialic acids are attached in the &#945;2-6 configuration (NeuAc&#945;2-6Gal). In contrast, HAs from avian viruses exhibit specificity for \\"avian-type\\" &#945;2-3-linked (NeuAc&#945;2-3Gal) receptors, and thus require adaptive mutations to bind human-type receptors. Since all human IAV pandemics can be traced to avian origins, there remains ever-present concern over emerging IAVs with human-adaptive potential that might lead to the next pandemic. This concern has been brought into focus through emergence of SARS-CoV-2, aligning both scientific and public attention to the threat of novel respiratory viruses from animal sources. In this review we summarize receptor-binding adaptations underlying the emergence of all prior IAV pandemics in humans, maintenance and evolution of human-type receptor specificity in subsequent seasonal IAVs, and potential for future human-type receptor adaptation in novel avian HAs.","output":"Adaptation of Influenza Viruses to Human Airway Receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many countries consider the lifting of restrictions of social contacts (RSC).

Aberrant regulation of these kinases is a major cause of human disease. We report here that the vertebrate nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src-related kinase lacking C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and N-terminal myristylation sites (SRMS) inhibits autophagy and promotes growth in a nutrient-responsive manner. Under nutrient-replete conditions, SRMS phosphorylates the PHLPP scaffold FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), disrupts the FKBP51-PHLPP complex, and promotes FKBP51 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This prevents PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of AKT, causing sustained AKT activation that promotes growth and inhibits autophagy. SRMS is amplified and overexpressed in human cancers where it drives unrestrained AKT signaling in a kinase-dependent manner. SRMS kinase inhibition activates autophagy, inhibits cancer growth, and can be accomplished using the FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. This illuminates SRMS as a targetable vulnerability in human cancers and as a new target for pharmacological induction of autophagy in vertebrates.","output":"The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase SRMS inhibits autophagy and promotes tumor growth by phosphorylating the scaffolding protein FKBP51"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To review the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews for the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) herbs for treating acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and to discuss the limitations of current clinical trials of TCM.

As the coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus type 2, has progressed, persistent COVID-19 syndrome is an increasingly recognized problem on which a significant volume of medical literature is developing. Symptoms may be persistent or appear, after an asymptomatic period, weeks or months after the initial infection. The clinical picture is as markedly heterogeneous and multisystemic as in the acute phase, so multidisciplinary management is required. In addition, their appearance is not related to the severity of the initial infection, so they can affect both mild patients, even asymptomatic, and seriously ill patients who have required hospitalization. Although it can affect people of any age, it is more common in middle-aged women. The sequelae can generate a high impact on the quality of life, and in the work and social environment.

METHODS: Data were collected from Our World in Data. Regression analysis was conducted to adjust for potential confounding factors such as economic activity (GDP), the rate of COVID-19 testing, and the stringency of COVID-19 control policies. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant negative association between smoking prevalence and the prevalence of COVID-19 across the 38 European nations after controlling for confounding factors (p = 0.001). A strong association was found between the prevalence of COVID-19 per million people and economic activity (p = 0.002) and the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0006). Nations with stricter policy enactment showed fewer COVID-19 cases per million people, but the association was not significant (p = 0.122). Delaying policy enactment was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 (p = 0.0535). Evidence of a direct association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality was not found (p = 0.626). There was a strong positive association between COVID-19 mortality rate and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases (p < 0.0001) as well as the proportion of the population over 65 years of age (p = 0.0034) and a negative association with the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0023).

Methods: The ACE1 D allele frequencies in 18 selected European populations were analyzed and compared with COVID-19 prevalence, mortality, and severity using multivariate linear regression analysis. Results and Discussion: The ACE1 D allele distribution within the B&H population was similar to its distribution in other European populations. Regression analysis showed no significant correlation between the D allele frequency and the incidence of infections between the examined populations, nor with the rates of fatality and severe cases.

Data informing whether immune-mediated medications lead to more severe infection are sparse. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether outpatient immunosuppressive therapies that treat autoimmune inflammatory disease or prevent solid organ transplant rejection are associated with severe illness after diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a positive PCR nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 from February 25 to September 9, 2020, cared for within a large integrated health care organization MAIN MEASURES: Exposure was defined as an outpatient fill of prednisone, immunomodulator, small-molecule, or biologic therapy in the 105 days prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The main outcome was either hospitalization, ICU admission, or death within 45 days after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for age, race, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, and autoimmune disease. KEY RESULTS: A total of 39,686 adults had a positive PCR test. In the primary analysis, prior prednisone use was associated with severe illness after diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio (OR) 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08C1.60); however, immunomodulator (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.57C1.34) and biologic/small-molecule therapy (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.79C2.00) were not. Secondary analyses showed variable risk among therapies: Janus-kinase inhibitors had an increased odds of severe illness (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.16C9.67), thiopurines/conventionaldisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs had a reduced odds (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.32C0.88), and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors were not associated (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.18C1.08).

There are a number of factors that pose major challenges in their development. Approaches to the development of anti-2019-nCoV include screening existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, repositioning of readily available clinical compounds, and &lt;italic&gt;de novo&lt;/italic&gt; development of novel and specific agents for 2019-nCoV. Candidate compounds can be developed either to inhibit virus-based targets, such as RNA proteases, polymerase, spike glycoproteins, and viral envelop and membrane proteins, or to inhibit host-based targets, such as receptors and proteases that are utilized by virus for viral entry and endocytosis. Recently, the RNA polymerase remdesivir had demonstrated clinical efficacy in one patient with severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). The broad-spectrum viral protease inhibitor Kaletra&lt;sup&gt;&reg;&lt;/sup&gt; is also recommended in the current NCP clinical practice. Both drugs had lately been proceeded into multiple controlled phase III clinical trials to test their safety and efficacy in NCP. Combinational therapies consisting of multiple drugs provide other viable options against 2019-nCoV, based on scientific and clinical rationales.

However, the roles of lncRNAs in acute myocarditis (AM), especially fulminant myocarditis (FM), remain unclear. METHODS: FM and non-fulminant myocarditis (NFM) were induced by coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) in different mouse strains. Then, the expression profiles of the lncRNAs in the heart tissues were detected by sequencing. Finally, the patterns were analyzed by Pearson/Spearman rank correlation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Cytoscape 3.7. RESULTS: First, 1,216, 983, 1,606, and 2,459 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in CVB3-treated A/J, C57BL/6, BALB/c, and C3H mice with myocarditis, respectively. Among them, 88 lncRNAs were commonly dysregulated in all four models. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses further confirmed that four out of the top six commonly dysregulated lncRNAs were upregulated in all four models. Moreover, the levels of ENSMUST00000188819, ENSMUST00000199139, and ENSMUST00000222401 were significantly elevated in the heart and spleen and correlated with the severity of cardiac inflammatory infiltration. Meanwhile, 923 FM-specific dysregulated lncRNAs were detected, among which the levels of MSTRG.26098.49, MSTRG.31307.11, MSTRG.31357.2, and MSTRG.32881.28 were highly correlated with LVEF.

METHODS: An electronic survey was administered to 577 caregivers of children aged 2 years residing in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic curfew. The sources of information on childhood vaccination considered by the caregivers and their influence on the caregivers decision to delay scheduled vaccination were assessed and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Most participants (90.8%) were mothers aged 32.6  5.7 years. Before the pandemic, most caregivers sought information about childrens vaccinations personally from the healthcare workers, or trustworthy sources, including the Ministry of Health (MOH), MOH call center 937, and MOH Sehha app. However, during the pandemic, there was a noticeable decrease in the searches for health information through professional consultations (in person and health websites) and a significant increase in the use of social media platforms. Twitter was the most used platform (29.9%) and the use of Snapchat was significantly higher during the lockdown period compared to its use before the pandemic (21.9% vs 17.2%, P < 0.001). The use of social media not only increased the level of fear among the caregivers but also had a negative effect on their decisions about childrens vaccinations. Searches on YouTube and Facebook particularly increased the odds of delaying vaccinations by 2.63 times (P = 0.008) and 3.66 times (P = 0.025), respectively. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, caregivers health-information seeking behavior was directed towards social media networking. In Saudi Arabia, YouTube and Facebook, in particular, played an important role in the caregivers decision-making about childhood vaccinations. The results of this survey provide valuable information on how to reach the Saudi population and launch an effective awareness campaign using the most commonly accessed and influential sources of information.","output":"Caregivers Sources of Information About Immunization as Predictors of Delayed Childhood Vaccinations in Saudi Arabia During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, suicide was the 12th leading cause of death for all ages in the United States, changing from the 10th leading cause in 2019 due to the emergence of COVID-19 deaths and increases in deaths from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (1).

A nationally representative online and telephone survey conducted in 12C26 October on the Social Research Centres Life in Australia(TM) panel (aged  18 y, 78.8% response, N = 3043) asked about access, visitation, and felt benefits from green and/or blue spaces. Increasing financial difficulty was associated with less time in and fewer visits to green and/or blue spaces, as well as fewer different types visited. Financial difficulty was also associated with feelings that visits to green and/or blue space had less benefit for maintaining social connection. Working from home was associated with more frequent and longer visitation to green and/or blue spaces, as well as discovery of ones previously unvisited. Working from home was also associated with increased levels of exercise and respite resulting from visits to green and/or blue spaces. Residents of Melbourne, a city of 4.9 million who were in lockdown at the time of the survey, appeared more likely to benefit from visits to green and/or blue spaces than residents of Sydney, Australias largest city at 5.2 million, who were not in lockdown. Residents of Melbourne compared with Sydney reported consistently increased visitation of, discovery of, and greater levels of various felt benefits derived from green and/or blue spaces, including more respite, connection, and exercise. Comparatively shorter distances to preferred green and/or blue spaces and closure of alternative settings at the time of the survey completion in Melbourne compared with Sydney may provide partial explanation, though more acute responses to experiencing green and/or blue spaces within highly cognitively demanding antecedent conditions posed by lockdown are also plausible and warrant further investigation with other health indicators. These results were robust to adjustment for a range of covariates including preferences for natural settings, which were consistently associated with greater levels of green and/or blue space visitation and felt benefits. Collectively, these results indicate that parallel efforts to generate (or renew) felt connection to natural settings, to increase working from home opportunities, and to mitigate financial difficulties may be important to help maximize the population health benefits of urban planning strategies intended to improve the availability of, and to reduce inequities in access to, green and blue spaces.

In the United States (US), different state governments have adopted various combinations of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions (NPIs), such as non-essential business closures and gathering bans, to mitigate the epidemic from February to April, 2020. Quantitative assessment on the effectiveness of NPIs is greatly needed to assist in guiding individualized decision making for adjustment of interventions in the US and around the world. However, the impacts of these approaches remain uncertain. METHODS: Based on the reported cases, the effective reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 epidemic for 50 states in the US was estimated. Measurements on the effectiveness of nine different NPIs were conducted by assessing risk ratios (RRs) between Rt and NPIs through a generalized linear model (GLM). RESULTS: Different NPIs were found to have led to different levels of reduction in Rt. Stay-at-home contributed approximately 51% (95% CI 46-57%), wearing (face) masks 29% (15-42%), gathering ban (more than 10 people) 19% (14-24%), non-essential business closure 16% (10-21%), declaration of emergency 13% (8-17%), interstate travel restriction 11% (5-16%), school closure 10% (7-14%), initial business closure 10% (6-14%), and gathering ban (more than 50 people) 7% (2-11%). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective assessment of NPIs on Rt has shown that NPIs played critical roles on epidemic control in the US in the past several months.

We assessed efficacy in terms of accuracy of the clinical diagnosis in comparison to the histopathological result and whether treatment was designated the appropriate clinical priority/urgency. A total of 120 lesions in 98 patients were assessed, 55 patients in the face-to-face clinic cohort, and 43 patients in the teleclinic cohort. Diagnostic accuracy was better in face-to-face clinic compared to teleclinic; 85.0% and 63.6% respectively (&#967;2 (1, Na?=a?120)a?=a?7.35, pa?=a?0.0067).

However, reading CT films brings a lot of concentration and time for doctors. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automatic CT image diagnosis system to assist doctors in diagnosis. Previous studies devoted to COVID-19 in the past months focused mostly on discriminating COVID-19 infected patients from healthy persons and/or bacterial pneumonia patients, and have ignored typical viral pneumonia since it is hard to collect samples for viral pneumonia that is less frequent in adults. In addition, it is much more challenging to discriminate COVID-19 from typical viral pneumonia as COVID-19 is also a kind of virus. In this study, we have collected CT images of 262, 100, 219, and 78 persons for COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, typical viral pneumonia, and healthy controls, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study of quaternary classification to include also typical viral pneumonia.

Social media platforms such as Twitter are extensively used to communicate about cancer care, yet little is known about the role of these online platforms in promoting early detection or sharing the lived experiences of patients with CRC. This study tracked Twitter discussions about CRC and characterized participating users to better understand public communication and perceptions of CRC during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Tweets containing references to CRC were collected from January 2020 to April 2021 using Twitter's Application Programming Interface. Account metadata was used to predict user demographic information and classify users as either organizations, individuals, clinicians, or influencers. We compared the number of impressions across users and analyzed the content of tweets using natural language processing models to identify prominent topics of discussion. RESULTS: There were 72,229 unique CRC-related tweets by 31,170 users. Most users were male (66%) and older than 40 years (57%). Individuals accounted for most users (44%); organizations (35%); clinicians (19%); and influencers (2%). Influencers made the most median impressions (35,853). Organizations made the most overall impressions (1,067,189,613). Tweets contained the following topics: bereavement (20%), appeals for early detection (20%), research (17%), National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month (15%), screening access (14%), and risk factors (14%). CONCLUSION: Discussions about CRC largely focused on bereavement and early detection. Online coverage of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month and personal experiences with CRC effectively stimulated goal-oriented tweets about early detection.

For example, a location-disease-time tensor of case counts can have multiple delayed updates of recent temporal slices for some locations or diseases. Recovering such missing or noisy (under-reported) elements of the input tensor can be viewed as a generalized tensor completion problem. Existing tensor completion methods usually assume that i) missing elements are randomly distributed and ii) noise for each tensor element is i.i.d. zero-mean. Both assumptions can be violated for spatio-temporal tensor data. We often observe multiple versions of the input tensor with different under-reporting noise levels. The amount of noise can be time- or location-dependent as more updates are progressively introduced to the tensor. We model such dynamic data as a multi-version tensor with an extra tensor mode capturing the data updates. We propose a low-rank tensor model to predict the updates over time. We demonstrate that our method can accurately predict the ground-truth values of many real-world tensors. We obtain up to 27.2% lower root mean-squared-error compared to the best baseline method. Finally, we extend our method to track the tensor data over time, leading to significant computational savings.","output":"Multi-version Tensor Completion for Time-delayed Spatio-temporal Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) can indicate the presence of novel, widespread community pathogens. Comparing week-to-week reported influenza-like illness percentages may identify the time of year a novel pathogen is introduced. However, changes in health-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic call in to question the reliability of 2019-2020 ILINet data as a comparison to prior years, potentially rendering this system less reliable as a novel pathogen surveillance tool. Corroboration of trends seen in the 2019-2020 ILINet data lends confidence to the validity of those trends. This study compares predicted versus reported influenza and influenza-like illnesses in vaccinated adults as a surrogate measure of novel pathogen surveillance. METHODS An online survey was used to ask US adults their influenza vaccination status, whether they were diagnosed with influenza after vaccination, and whether they experienced an influenza-like illness other than flu. RESULTS Prevalence of self-reported flu diagnosis in adults age 18-64 who received the flu vaccine between September 1, 2019 and April 15, 2020 (n = 3,225) was 5.8 %, while self-reported flu or flu-like illness (without a flu diagnosis) was 17.9 %. CONCLUSION Flu and flu-like illness in this sample of flu-vaccinated U.S. adults is significantly higher than predicted, consistent with substantially higher ILI's in 2019-20 compared to ILI's from 2018-19, suggesting that the ILI values reported during the COVID-19 pandemic may be appropriate for comparison to prior years.","output":"Self-reported influenza and influenza-like symptoms in U.S. adults age 18-64 between September 1, 2019 and April 15, 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Early reports show the unequal effect the COVID-19 pandemic might have on men versus women engaged in medical research. Purpose To investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on scientific publishing by female physicians in medical imaging. Materials and Methods We conducted a descriptive bibliometric analysis of first and last-author gender of papers submitted to the top 50 medical imaging journals from March to May 2020 (n=2480) compared to the same period of the year in 2018 (n=2238) and 2019 (n=2355). Manuscript title, date of submission, first and last name of first and last authors, journal impact factor and author country of provenance were recorded. The Gender-API software was used to determine author gender. Statistical analysis comprised Chi square tests and multivariable logistic regression. Results Percentages of female first- and last-authorship were 1172/3711 (31.6%) and 717/3711 (19.3%) in 2018- 2019 versus 725/2248 (32.3%) and 465/2248 (20.7%) in 2020 (p=0.61 and p=0.21 respectively), and of COVID-19-related papers 89/253 (35.2%) and 52/253 (20.6%) respectively. No associations were found between first and last author gender, year of publication and continent of provenance. First- and last-authorship of high-ranking papers was not in favor of North American females whatever the year: OR 0.79 (p=0.05) and OR 0.72 (p=0.02). Higher rates of female last-authorship of high-ranking papers were observed in Europe (p=0.003): OR 1.20 (p=0.21) in 2018-2019 multiplied by interaction term OR 1.52 (p=0.09) in 2020, and of female first-authorship of low-ranking papers in Asia: OR=1.38 [0.98-1.92] (p=0.06) in 2020. Female first- and last-authorship of COVID-19-related papers was overrepresented for lowest-rank papers (p=0.02 and p=0.01). Conclusion One in three first authors and one in five last authors were female in 2018-2019 and 2020.

RECENT FINDINGS: Pulmonary capillaritis likely contributes to the pathogenesis, however is only observed in half of the biopsies. Corticosteroids induce remission in the majority of patients, however almost half recur and require a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive to maintain remission. Cyclophosphamide- or rituximab-based regimens achieve the highest remission rates (50%); other strategies include intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, mycophenolate mofetil, and/or azathioprine.

Methods: Cross sectional chest CT images (N=12744) from well-evaluated cases of pneumonias induced by COVID-19 or H1N1 Influenza viruses, and normal individuals were collected. We examined the computer tomographic (CT) chest images from 137 individuals. Various pre-trained convolutional neural network models, such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, Wide ResNet, SqueezNet, VGG 16 and VGG 19 were fine-tuned on our datasets. The datasets were used for training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) of the final models. Also, the predictive power and means of precision and recall were determined for each model. Results: Fine-tuned ResNet-50 model differentiated the pneumonia due to COVID-19 or H1N1 influenza virus with accuracies of 96.7% and 92%, respectively This model outperformed all others, i.e., InceptionV3, Wide ResNet, SqueezNet, VGG 16 and VGG 19.

Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the multiplexed BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel plus (BFPP) for the rapid detection of various clinically relevant respiratory pathogens and genetic markers among 50 patients admitted with HAP to an intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care hospital in Egypt. In comparison to standard culture methods, BFPP showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 90%, respectively, with the identification of 11 viral targets (22%) among the tested specimens. The BFPP semi-quantitative analysis showed a concordance rate of 47.4% among positive culture specimens. For the examination of the antibiotic resistance genes, BFPP showed a positive percent agreement (PPA), a negative percent agreement (NPA) and an overall percent agreement (OPA), reaching 97%, 95%, and 95%, respectively, with standard antibiotic sensitivity testing. According to the obtained results, BFPP has the potential to enhance the rapid microbiological diagnosis of HAP cases, tailor appropriate antibiotic therapy, apply antimicrobial stewardship programs, and implement effective infection control measures. ABSTRACT: Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a substantial public health issue that is associated with high mortality rates and is complicated by an arsenal of microbial etiologies, expressing multidrug-resistant phenotypes, rendering relatively limited therapeutic options. BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel plus (BFPP) is a simple multiplexed PCR system that integrates sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and analysis of microbial etiology, with a turnaround time of about one hour. In comparison to standard culture methods, BFPP is simpler, easier to perform, and can simultaneously detect the most common pathogens involved in lower respiratory tract infections (34 targets). Accordingly, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of the multiplexed BFPP for the rapid detection of 27 clinically relevant respiratory pathogens and 7 genetic markers among 50 HAP cases admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), who submitted mini-bronchoalveolar (mBAL) specimens. In comparison to standard culture methods, BFPP showed an overall sensitivity of 100% [95% CI; 90C100] and overall specificity of 90% [95% CI; 87.4C92.5] among all the tested bacterial targets. BFPP identified 11 viral targets (22%) among the tested specimens. The BFPP semi-quantitative analysis showed a concordance rate of 47.4% among positive culture specimens. For the investigation of the antibiotic resistance genes, BFPP showed a positive percent agreement (PPA), a negative percent agreement (NPA), and an overall percent agreement (OPA), reaching 97% [95% CI; 90C100], 95% [95% CI; 91.5C97], and 95% [95% CI; 93C97], respectively, with standard antibiotic sensitivity testing.

A web-based survey was conducted from mid-April to mid-May 2021 on hospital workers one year after the first evaluation performed during the lock-down phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-traumatic stress, general anxiety, depression, and burnout were assessed by using, respectively, the impact of event scale (IES-R), the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Maslach burnout inventory-general survey (MBI-GS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with each of the four mental health outcomes one year after the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 1033 HCWs participated. The percentage of HCWs scoring above the cut-off increased from 2020 to 2021 in all of the outcome domains (anxiety, 50.1% vs. 55.7, p < 0.05; depression, 26.6% vs. 40.6%, p < 0.001; burnout, 28.6% vs. 40.6%, p < 0.001; chi-square test), with the exception of post-traumatic distress. There was also an increase when stratifying by occupation and workplace, with a greater increase for depression and burnout. Multivariate analysis revealed that, one year after the COVID-19 outbreak, nurses were at the greatest risk of anxiety and depression, whereas residents were at the greatest risk of burnout (in terms of low professional efficacy).

AIM: Considering the number of infected patients and the stressed supplies of PPE, reuse of PPE can serve as an efficient contingency plan. Multiple studies have investigated the effect of different decontamination methods. METHODS: We chose the most user-friendly, easily scalable viral decontamination methods, including ultraviolet irradiation and heat treatment. In this paper, we investigated a unique approach to reuse the mask by creating a hybrid model that efficiently sanitizes the infected mask. RESULTS: The advantages of the proposed hybrid model as compared to the respective single arms is its decontamination efficacy, operational speed, as well as the number of reuse cycles as verified by mathematical analysis and simulation. This model is mainly intended for medical PPE but can also be used for other domestic and personal sanitization during the COVID-19 pandemic. As per the situation, the hybrid system can be used as standalone systems also. This sanitization process is not only limited to the elimination of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 but can be extended to any other infectious agents. Thus, our results indicate that the proposed hybrid system is more effective, meets disinfection criterion and time saving for the reuse of respirators and PPE.","output":"A hybrid model integrating warm heat and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation might efficiently disinfect respirators and personal protective equipment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have provided insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. However, the longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here we serially analysed immune responses in 113 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages, with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. An early elevation in cytokine levels was associated with worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, patients with moderate COVID-19 displayed a progressive reduction in type 1 (antiviral) and type 3 (antifungal) responses. By contrast, patients with severe COVID-19 maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of the disease. Moreover, severe COVID-19 was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors, including interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-13, immunoglobulin E and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified four immune signatures, representing growth factors (A), type-2/3 cytokines (B), mixed type-1/2/3 cytokines (C), and chemokines (D) that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories. The immune profiles of patients who recovered from moderate COVID-19 were enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature A, whereas the profiles of those with who developed severe disease had elevated levels of all four signatures.

Nevertheless, organs outside the respiratory tract had been reported in recent studies, including the gastrointestinal tract and liver. The host innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through their pattern recognition receptor (PRRs). Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) is a pattern recognition receptor recognizing ssRNA (SARS-CoV-2 is an ssRNA). Polymorphisms are characterized by two or more alternative forms of a distinct phenotype in the same population. Polymorphisms in tlrs genes can negatively influence the immune response to infectious diseases. There are several references in the literature to non-synonymous single nucleotide (rs) polymorphisms related to several genes. Some of them are important for the innate immunity, as rs 179008 (tlr-7), rs3775291 (tlr3), rs8177374 (tir domain-containing adaptor protein, tirap), rs1024611 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, mcp-1) and rs61942233 (2-5-oligoadenylate synthase-3, oas-3). CASE PRESENTATION: We identified a 5-year-old-male child with gastrointestinal symptoms and fever presenting acholic stool and jaundice, who was positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgA, and IgG and presenting the Gln11Leu rs 179008 in tlr-7. The child presented high levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and was negative for serological tests for hepatitis A, B, C, E, HIV 1 and 2, herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, EpsteinCBarr virus, and negative for RTqPCR for Influenza A and B, RSV and SARS-CoV-2.

After an interview with the child's caregivers, any possible accidental ingestion of drugs or hepatotoxic substances was ruled out. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a SARS-CoV-2 caused hepatitis in a male child that has the tlr-7 Gln11Leu rs 179008, which could impair an efficient initial immune response.

This study aimed to determine the patient demographics, risk factors including comorbidities, and medications used to treat COVID-19, presenting symptoms and signs, and the outcome of management. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19-associated ROCM managed or co-managed by ophthalmologists in India from January 1, 2020 to May 26, 2021. RESULTS: Of the 2826 patients, the states of Gujarat (22%) and Maharashtra (21%) reported the highest number of ROCM. The mean age of patients was 51.9 years with a male preponderance (71%). While 57% of the patients needed oxygen support for COVID-19 infection, 87% of the patients were treated with corticosteroids, (21% for > 10 days). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was present in 78% of all patients. Most of the cases showed onset of symptoms of ROCM between day 10 and day 15 from the diagnosis of COVID-19, 56% developed within 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, while 44% had delayed onset beyond 14 days. Orbit was involved in 72% of patients, with stage 3c forming the bulk (27%). Overall treatment included intravenous amphotericin B in 73%, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)/paranasal sinus (PNS) debridement in 56%, orbital exenteration in 15%, and both FESS/PNS debridement and orbital exenteration in 17%. Intraorbital injection of amphotericin B was administered in 22%. At final follow-up, mortality was 14%. Disease stage >3b had poorer prognosis. Paranasal sinus debridement and orbital exenteration reduced the mortality rate from 52% to 39% in patients with stage 4 disease with intracranial extension (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Corticosteroids and DM are the most important predisposing factors in the development of COVID-19-associated ROCM. COVID-19 patients must be followed up beyond recovery. Awareness of red flag symptoms and signs, high index of clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and early initiation of treatment with amphotericin B, aggressive surgical debridement of the PNS, and orbital exenteration, where indicated, are essential for successful outcome.","output":"Epidemiology, clinical profile, management, and outcome of COVID-19-associated rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis in 2826 patients in India C Collaborative OPAI-IJO Study on Mucormycosis in COVID-19 (COSMIC), Report 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted important needs in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services and standard practices for infection prevention and control in sub-Saharan Africa.

Data from health facility surveys conducted between 2013 and 2018 in 18 sub-Saharan African countries were used to estimate the access to an improved water source within 500 m, an improved toilet, soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub, and standard precautions for infection prevention at health facilities. Rural-urban differences and public-private differences in access to services were calculated. We also compared population level access to health facility access to services. RESULT: Overall, 16,456 health facilities from 18 countries were included. Across countries, an estimated 88 % had an improved water source, 94 % had an improved toilet, 74 % had soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub, and 17 % had standard precautions for infection prevention available. There was wide variability in access to water, sanitation and hygiene services between rural and urban health facilities and between public and private facilities, with consistently lower access in both rural and public facilities. In both rural and urban areas, access to water, sanitation and hygiene services was ubiquitously better at health facilities than households. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of WASH services in health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa has improved but remains below the global target of 80 % in many countries.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted through the Carenity US HIV platform (04/07/2020C05/26/2020). Eligible respondents were adults with HIV-1 registered on the platform who were receiving darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (DRV/c/FTC/TAF) and living in the United States. This descriptive study assessed patient satisfaction with DRV/c/FTC/TAF and HIV-related symptoms at baseline and follow-up (4C6 weeks). Two HIV patient-reported outcomes tools were completed at both time points: the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQs; range: 0C60 points [higher score indicates greater satisfaction]) and the HIV Symptom Distress Module (HIV-SDM; range: 0C80 points [lower score indicates lower distress]). RESULTS: Of 100 respondents from across the United States who completed the survey at baseline, mean age was 39 years, 69 were male, 48 were Caucasian, 76 were HIV treatment-experienced, and 24 were HIV treatment-na?ve. Of baseline respondents, 46 completed the follow-up survey. In the overall population, treatment discontinuation between baseline and follow-up was low (6.5%: 3/46 respondents at follow-up). Mean total HIVTSQs score at baseline was 50.2 with the highest proportion of respondents satisfied regarding their willingness to continue DRV/c/FTC/TAF (79%) and to recommend DRV/c/FTC/TAF to other patients (76%). Among all baseline respondents, mean total HIV-SDM score was 23.5. On average, respondents experienced 10.7 overall symptoms (grades 1C4) and 3.8 bothersome symptoms (grades 3C4). Both satisfaction rate and occurrence of symptoms with DRV/c/FTC/TAF were stable between baseline and follow-up.

METHODS: In this large cohort study, 15,409 confirmed patients with the COVID-19 of different severities were followed-up from three specialized COVID-19 hospitals between March 18 and October 11, 2020 in Iraqi Kurdistan. The predictors of mortality and severity were examined in binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The incidence rate of severe/critical status was 12.3% with a median age of 36.0 and case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.98%. The incidence rate of severe/critical conditions and CFR rose with increased age groups; except for 0-14 years (11.9%). The incidence rate of severe/critical patients and CFR was 8.3% and 0.5%, 21.1% and 4.0%, and 23.7% and 8.7% in 15-49 years, 50-64 years, and 65 and older age groups, respectively. The severity of the disease and CFR was associated with coexisting chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (18.2% and 3.1%) and diabetes mellitus (19.8% and 3.4%). The asymptomatic patients (8400 and 54.5%) had statistically higher CFR; 2.3% versus 1.6% (P = 0.006). The most common symptoms on diagnosis were fever (31.9%), cough (23.5%), loss of smell/taste (16.3%), sore throat (15.7%), shortness of breath (9.8%), and headache (9.5%). The results showed that being older was the only predictor of mortality and severity in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This region has a low incidence of severe-critic status and CFR. The patients with coexisting medical conditions are more likely to have severe conditions and die of COVID-19.

To deal with these changes, it is necessary to develop a resilience capacity that allows for the establishment of different patterns of relationships through a new management model. The application of circularity principles implies a radical change in stakeholder relations, breaking with the \\"end-of-life\\" concept existing in linear economies. Furthermore, circular economy can ensure resilience in supply chains, and it can be considered as a tool in uncertain environments. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyse the association between the customer-supplier relationships with circular supply chains based on the intellectual capital-based view theory. External capital is a crucial factor for organisations, and it helps with building remarkable capabilities for the whole supply chain due to collaboration and cooperation. This research contributes with a systematic revision of the literature regarding circular supply chains and customer-supplier external capital, providing an exploratory model. Establishing a closer and effective relationship with customers and suppliers supposes a differentiating value and competitive advantages. Actors involved in the supply chain are essential in the implementation of circularity in organisations for reducing waste production and returning resources to the production cycle. Therefore, circular networks related to customers' behaviour, sustainable supplier election and IT tools play a key factor in improving resilience in supply chains.","output":"New Circular Networks in Resilient Supply Chains: An External Capital Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disease dynamics, human mobility, and public policies co-evolve during a pandemic such as COVID-19.

We herein developed an ultrasensitive, rapid, and duplex digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dELISA) for simultaneous detection of spike (S-RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 based on a single molecule array. This assay effectively combines magnetic bead encoding technology and the ultrasensitive detection capability of a single molecule array. The detection strategies of S-RBD protein and N-protein exhibited wide response ranges of 0.34-1065 pg/mL and 0.183-338 pg/mL with detection limits of 20.6 fg/mL and 69.8 fg/mL, respectively. It is a highly specific method for the simultaneous detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein and has minimal interference from other blood proteins. Moreover, the spike assay showed a satisfactory and reproducible recovery rate for the detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein in serum samples. Overall, this work provides a highly sensitive method for the simultaneous detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein, which shows ultrasensitivity and high signal-to-noise ratio and contributes to improve the diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19.","output":"Simultaneous detection of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins from SARS-CoV-2 based on ultrasensitive single molecule assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article features strengths and challenges indicated by foreign-born counselor educators in programs accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs.

However, there are limited prospectively-collected data on assay performance, and minimal clinical information to guide interpretation of discrepant results. METHODS: Over a 2-week period, 1080 consecutive plasma samples submitted for clinical SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing were tested in parallel for anti-nucleocapsid IgG (anti-N, Abbott) and anti-spike IgG (anti-S1, EUROIMMUN). Chart review was conducted for samples testing positive or borderline on either assay, and for an age/sex-matched cohort of samples negative by both assays. CDC surveillance case definitions were used to determine clinical sensitivity/specificity and conduct receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. RESULTS: There were 52 samples positive by both methods, 2 positive for anti-N only, 34 positive for anti-S1 only, and 27 borderline for anti-S1. Of the 34 individuals positive for anti-S1 alone, 8 (24%) had confirmed COVID-19. No anti-S1 borderline cases were positive for anti-N or had confirmed/probable COVID-19. The anti-N assay was less sensitive (84.2% [95% CI 72.1-92.5%] vs 94.7% [95% CI 85.4-98.9%]) but more specific (99.2% [95% CI 95.5-100%] vs 86.9% [95% CI 79.6-92.3%]) than anti-S1. Abbott anti-N sensitivity could be improved to 96.5% with minimal effect on specificity if the index threshold was lowered from 1.4 to 0.6. CONCLUSION: Real-world concordance between different serologic assays may be lower than previously described in retrospective studies.

Low pH induces an irreversible modification of the virus envelope, which has so far resisted 3D structural analysis, partly due to the virus pleiomorphy. This study showed that atomic force microscopy (AFM) in physiological buffer could be used to image the structural details of the virus envelope, both at neutral pH and after a low-pH treatment. At low and intermediate magnification, AFM of control virions confirmed both the pleiomorphy and the existence of zones devoid of glycoprotein spikes at the virus surface, as established by electron microscopy (EM). At higher magnification, the unique vertical resolution of the AFM in 3D topography demonstrated the lateral heterogeneity in spike distribution and strongly suggested that, at least locally, the spikes can be organized in an irregular honeycomb pattern. The surface honeycomb pattern was more easily detected due to an increase in spike height following low-pH treatment at low temperature, which probably prevented disruption of the organization. This enhanced contrast associated with low-pH treatment emphasized differences in the glycoprotein distribution between virions.

The paper targeted China to investigate whether social structural factors (education level and urban-rural differences) lead to the knowledge gap of COVID-19. Also, this paper examined whether media use, interpersonal communication, public communication, and perceived salience of information can influence the knowledge gap of COVID-19. Furthermore, this paper explored the strategies to promote communication equality. METHODS: An online survey on COVID-19 knowledge and its influencing factors was conducted in February 2020, with a valid sample of 981 participants. The dependent variable was the total score of knowledge related to COVID-19. In addition to demographic variables such as education level and residence, the main explanatory variables include four independent variables: the use of different media (print media, radio, television, Internet), interpersonal communication, public communication, and perceived salience of information. This paper utilized descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis for data processing. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics indicated that the Internet was the most frequent source of information for participants to obtain COVID-19 knowledge (M = 6.28, SD = 1.022). Bi-variate analysis and regression analysis presented that education level, Internet media use, and perceived salience of information predicted the difference in knowledge level. Hierarchical multiple regression showed that Internet media use significantly predicted differences in the level of knowledge related to COVID-19 among groups with different education levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a COVID-19 knowledge gap among the Chinese public, especially the digital knowledge gap. Education level, perceived salience of information, and internet media use can significantly predict the difference in COVID-19 knowledge level. In contrast, the use of traditional media such as newspaper, radio, and television, public communication, and interpersonal communication did not improve knowledge level. Internet media use and education level have an interactive effect on the formation of a COVID-19 knowledge gap. That is, online media use will expand the COVID-19 knowledge gap between groups with different education levels.","output":"Factors influencing COVID-19 knowledge-gap: a cross-sectional study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vasculitis may be associated with infection, immunization or anti-microbial drugs.

However, advances in pedagogical methods, changes in the skills of high-school graduates, and widening online options in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic brought on a new set of expectations. This situation may be considered an opportunity to address the threat of potentially increasing mismatch and misalignment between competences required by the IS industry labour market and current training contents offered and methods used by higher education institutions. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the challenges BIS programs have to face and address. It considers everyday experiences of BIS educators and current best practices as starting point. Then provides an overview of employer and alumni opinion, as well as reviews up-to-date teaching methods related to teaching soft computer skills. It also considers the requirements and opportunities related to an increasingly online-centred situation.

The most widely used method for COVID-19 diagnosis is the detection of viral RNA by RT-qPCR with a specific set of primers and probe. It is important to frequently evaluate the performance of these tests and this can be done first by an in silico approach. Previously, we reported some mismatches between the oligonucleotides of publicly available RT-qPCR assays and SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from GISAID and NCBI, potentially impacting proper detection of the virus. In the present study, 11 primers and probe sets investigated during the first study were evaluated again with 84,305 new SARS-CoV-2 unique genomes collected between June 2020 and January 2021. The lower inclusivity of the China CDC assay targeting the gene N has continued to decrease with new mismatches detected, whereas the other evaluated assays kept their inclusivity above 99%. Additionally, some mutations specific to new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were found to be located in oligonucleotide annealing sites. This might impact the strategy to be considered for future SARS-CoV-2 testing. Given the potential threat of the new variants, it is crucial to assess if they can still be correctly targeted by the primers and probes of the RT-qPCR assays. Our study highlights that considering the evolution of the virus and the emergence of new variants, an in silico (re-)evaluation should be performed on a regular basis. Ideally, this should be done for all the RT-qPCR assays employed for SARS-CoV-2 detection, including also commercial tests, although the primer and probe sequences used in these kits are rarely disclosed, which impedes independent performance evaluation.","output":"Deepening of In Silico Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Detection RT-qPCR Assays in the Context of New Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The first analyses of cases described high numbers of critically ill patients requiring intensive care admission with significant late inflammatory features. By the time the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were diagnosed in the UK, a wide range of drugs were under consideration and it became clear that the input of clinicians covering all organ systems (in particular, infectious diseases, haematology, rheumatology, renal medicine and intensive care) and of expert specialist pharmacists was necessary at the local level. Thus, an expert multidisciplinary (MDT) group within our organisation was convened to offer a standardised approach and robust clinical governance for the treatment of COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospitals and rapidly develop standards of care as evidence evolved. This commentary explores the methods and mechanisms for creating an MDT COVID-19 treatment working group which are applicable to any hospital likely to admit and care for high numbers of COVID-19 patients and demonstrates how the structure and governance of the group allowed for rapid adoption of both dexamethasone and tocilizumab into standard of care as data became available.","output":"The utility of a local multidisciplinary working group to oversee the establishment of rapidly evolving standards of care and to support trial recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is concern that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at risk of developing secondary bacterial and fungal infections; however, data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with fungal infections are limited. We evaluated the risk factors and mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with fungal infections. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of 51 patients with fungal infections at an 877-bed teaching hospital in Detroit, Michigan from March through May 2020. Demographic data, comorbidities, complications, treatment, and outcomes, including relapse, readmission and mortality were collected. We performed a descriptive analysis. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients with fungal infections were included, in which 31 (60.8%) had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Of the COVID-19 patients, the average age was 66 years and the majority (54.9%) were female. The average length of stay (LOS) was 29.3 days. Aspergillus sp. (2 A. fumigatus, 1 A. niger) were isolated in 3 (10%) patients while 23 (74.2%) had candidemia diagnosed via blood culture or T2Candida? Panel. One had a positive serum galactomannan. The average time from admission to diagnosis was 13 days. Significant comorbidities included hypertension (74%), diabetes (51.6%), coronary artery disease (25.8%), congestive heart failure (32.2%), chronic kidney disease (22.6%), and malignancy (16.1%). Most patients received steroids (83.9%) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (80.6%), had a central line (80.6%), and required intensive care unit management (90%). Only 71% were treated with antifungals. One patient with candidemia relapsed due to poor source control; two were readmitted within 30 days. In-hospital mortality rate was 51.6% among COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with fungal infections had multiple comorbidities, prolonged hospitalization and predisposing risk factors for fungal infections with a high in-hospital mortality rate.

Methods: Our online survey included 1591 participants from 31 provinces of China with 87% urban and 13% rural residents. We performed multiple linear regressions and path analysis to examine the relationship between rural status and behavioral intention, attitude, subjective norms, information appraisal, knowledge, variety of information source use, and preventive behaviors against COVID-19. Findings: Compared with urban residents, rural residents were less likely to perform preventive behaviors, more likely to hold a negative attitude toward the effectiveness of performing preventive behaviors, and more likely to have lower levels of information appraisal skills. We identified information appraisal as a significant factor that might contribute to the rural/urban differences in preventive behaviors against COVID-19 through attitude, subjective norms, and intention. We found no rural/urban differences in behavioral intention, subjective norms, knowledge about preventive behaviors, or the variety of interpersonal/media source use. Conclusions: As the first wave of the pandemic inundated urban areas, the current media coverage about COVID-19 prevention may not fully satisfy the specific needs of rural populations. Thus, rural residents were less likely to engage in a thoughtful process of information appraisal and adopt the appropriate preventive measures. Tailoring health messages to meet rural populations' unique needs can be an effective strategy to promote preventive health behaviors against COVID-19.","output":"Differences in Preventive Behaviors of COVID-19 between Urban and Rural Residents: Lessons Learned from A Cross-Sectional Study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a way to improve the boundary shape modeling process in solving boundary value problems in elasticity. The inclusion of NURBS curves into the mathematical formalism of the parametric integral equations system method (PIES) is proposed. The advantages of such an application are widely discussed. Recently, the Bezier curves, mainly the cubic curves (of third-degree), were used. The segments of the boundary shape were modeled by such curves (with ensuring continuity at the connection points). Using NURBS curves, the boundary shape can be modeled with only one curve. So, continuity is automatically ensured. Additionally, the second degree NURBS curve is enough to obtain the shape with high accuracy (better than cubic Bezier curves). The NURBS curve is defined by points, their weights and knots vector. Such parameters significantly improve the shape modification process, which can directly improve e.g. the shape identification process. To examine the impact of modeling accuracy on the final PIES solutions, examples described by the Navier-Lam equations were used. To improve calculations, the PIES method using NURBS curves was implemented as a computer program. Then, it was decided to verify the accuracy of the obtained solutions. For comparison, the solutions were also obtained using analytical solutions, boundary element method, and PIES method (with the Bezier curves). An improvement in the boundary shape modeling was noticed. It significantly affects the accuracy of solutions. As a result, the consumption of computer resources was reduced, while the process of boundary shape modeling and the accuracy of the obtained results were improved.","output":"NURBS Curves in Parametric Integral Equations System for Modeling and Solving Boundary Value Problems in Elasticity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the potential anticancer activity of auranofin was discovered, gold compounds have attracted interest with a view to developing anticancer agents that follow cytotoxic mechanisms other than cisplatin.

RESULTS The patient was taken emergently to surgery for T9-T11 laminectomy and en bloc resection of the tumor. The lesion was identified and resected. Histology revealed randomly oriented tumor cells with irregular capillaries consistent with HPC. Postoperatively, the patient had an improved neurological examination, and he continued to do so with intense physical therapy. CONCLUSION The standard treatment for HPC is surgery when the lesion is resectable.

As part of a broader concept of parental mentalization, PRF has been identified as one of the central predictors for sensitive parenting. However, the unique contribution of PRF to the quality of various parenting behaviors has not yet been addressed systematically. Thus, the present article provides a systematic overview of current research on the associations between PRF or its sub-dimensions and observed parenting behaviors in infancy and early childhood, while considering the influence of contextual factors. METHODS: The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Systematic searches were carried out in five electronic databases. The eligibility and methodological quality of the identified studies were assessed using pre-defined criteria and a standardized checklist. RESULTS: Sixteen studies with moderate to high quality on a total of 15 parenting behaviors were included, the majority of which examined positive parenting behaviors, while negative parenting behaviors were rarely investigated. Most of the associations indicated a positive effect of PRF on parenting behavior, with mostly small-sized effects. The strength and direction of the associations varied depending on the dimensionality of PRF, observation settings, sample types, socioeconomic factors, and cultural background. Moreover, five assessment instruments for PRF and 10 observation instruments for parenting behaviors were identified. CONCLUSION: In summary, PRF has shown a positive association with parenting quality. However, its complex interaction with further contextual factors emphasizes the need for differentiation of PRF dimensions and the consideration of the observation settings, assessment time points, psychosocial risks, and sample types in observational as well as intervention studies. Further high-quality studies with multivariate analyses and diverse study settings are required.","output":"Parental Reflective Functioning and Its Association With Parenting Behaviors in Infancy and Early Childhood: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1039/D0RA04249H.].","output":"Correction: Metal-free [2+2+1] cycloaddition polymerization of alkynes, nitriles, and oxygen atoms to functional polyoxazoles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In December 2019, an unbelievable outbreak of pneumonia associated with coronavirus was reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province.

In this article, we review the most common indications for TEE and discuss the data supporting the viability of using cardiac CT as an alternative to TEE.","output":"Computed tomography as an alternative to transesophageal echocardiography: A review of the literature in light of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This interview was conducted with professors Ana Paula Duboc and Lynn Mario Menezes de Souza, both from the University of S?o Paulo Based upon the theme: Between heterogeneity and normativity: research, educational policies and practices in progress, the interview led us to debate the concept of transcendental normativity, as well as the ways in which it has been established as a rule in the political and educational discourses These have given rise to a setback as neoconservative policies aim to straighten society, through policies related to order, consensus, homogeneity, and universalism On the other hand, the interviewees invite us to perceive that within normativity there are a series of heterogeneities, each of which has its own normativity Therefore, heterogeneity is a sine qua non condition of any social relationship This interview/chat provides us with a broad discussion on language, educational and language policies, literacies, philosophies, decoloniality, national politics, and invites us to critique ourselves from the inside out It leaves us the following provocation: What is our share of the blame as researchers, as teacher educators, as teachers who are in the classroom, who have been in favor of sociocultural and critical orientation?","output":"Research, Educational Policies and Practices in Progress: Conversations about Heterogeneity and Normativity with Ana Paula Duboc and Lynn Mario Menezes De Souza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The polar regions provide valuable insights into the functioning of the Earth's regulating systems. Conducting field research in such harsh and remote environments requires strong international cooperation, extended planning horizons, sizable budgets and long-term investment. Consequently, polar research is particularly vulnerable to societal and economic pressures during periods of austerity. The global financial crisis of 2008, and the ensuing decade of economic slowdown, have already adversely affected polar research, and the current COVID-19 pandemic has added further pressure. In this article we present the outcomes of a community survey that aimed to assess the main barriers and success factors identified by academic researchers at all career stages in response to these global crises. The survey results indicate that the primary barriers faced by polar early and mid-career researchers (EMCRs) act at institutional level, while mitigating factors are developed at individual and group levels. Later career scientists report pressure toward taking early retirement as a means of institutions saving money, reducing both academic leadership and the often unrecognized but vital mentor roles that many play. Gender and social inequalities are also perceived as important barriers. Reorganization of institutional operations and more effective strategies for long-term capacity building and retaining of talent, along with reduction in non-research duties shouldered by EMCRs, would make important contributions toward ensuring continued vitality and innovation in the polar research community.","output":"Shifting Perspectives in Polar Research: Global Lessons on the Barriers and Drivers for Securing Academic Careers in Natural Sciences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Reliable data regarding maternal mental well-being during the Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic are scarce. This study aimed to assess the state/trait anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms of pregnant women and compare those with the non-pregnant population using patient-reported validated outcome measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary Coronavirus Pandemic Hospital in ?stanbul, Turkey in April, 2020. Pregnant and non-pregnant women were consecutively allocated to two groups regardless of gestational age. The primary outcome was to identify the anxiety levels and obsessive-compulsive symptoms of pregnant women during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic using the State-Trait Anxiety inventory (STAI) and Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive inventory (MOCI), respectively. RESULTS: Two hundred three pregnant women and 101 non-pregnant women were included. The mean STAI-S questionnaire score of pregnant and nonpregnant women was 41.969.15 and 46.6212, respectively (p=0.001). The overall incidence of STAI >40 in pregnant and non-pregnant women was 62.6% and 73.3%, respectively. The mean total score of MOCI was 17.96.7 and 156.6 in pregnant and non-pregnant women, respectively. The overall incidence of 30-item-MOCI 13.1 in pregnant and non-pregnant women was 61.6% (125/203) and 30.7% (31/103), respectively (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: State anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in pregnant women were found increased during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Pregnant women showed more favourable anxiety levels compared with non-pregnant women. These findings can be used to improve the coping skills of pregnant women during the pandemic, to prepare for the post-pandemic period, and to deal with the long-term mental health impact of COVID-19.","output":"Anxiety levels and obsessive compulsion symptoms of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As digital peer support is quickly expanding across the globe in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, standardization in the training and delivery of digital peer support can advance the professionalism of this field. While telehealth competencies exist for other fields of mental health practice, such as social work, psychiatry, and psychology, limited research has been done to develop and promote digital peer support competencies. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to introduce the coproduction of core competencies that can guide digital peer support. METHODS: Peer support specialists were recruited through an international listserv and participated in a 1-hour virtual focus group. A total of four focus groups were conducted with 59 peer support specialists from 11 US states and three countries. RESULTS: Analysis was conducted using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction (RADaR) technique, and 10 themes were identified: (1) protecting the rights of service users, (2) technical knowledge and skills in the practice of digital peer support, (3) available technologies, (4) equity of access, (5) digital communication skills, (6) performance-based training, (7) self-care, (8) monitoring digital peer support and addressing digital crisis, (9) peer support competencies, and (10) health literacy (emerging). The authors present recommendations based on these themes. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of digital peer support core competencies is an initial first step to promote the standardization of best practices in digital peer support. The established competencies can potentially act as a guide for training and skill development to be integrated into US state peer support specialist competencies and to enhance competencies endorsed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).","output":"Core Competencies to Promote Consistency and Standardization of Best Practices for Digital Peer Support: Focus Group Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A high proportion of medical school graduates pursue specialties different from those declared at matriculation. While these choices influence the career paths, satisfaction, and potential regret students will experience, they also impact the supply and demand ratio of the shorthanded physician workforce across many specialties. In this study, we investigate how the choice of medical specialty and the factors motivating those choices change between the beginning and end of medical school training. Methods: A questionnaire was administered annually from 2017 to 2020 to a cohort of medical students at the University of Connecticut to determine longitudinal preferences regarding residency choice, motivational factors influencing residency choice, future career path, and demographic information. Results: The questionnaire respondent totals were as follows: n=76 (Year 1), n=54 (Year 2), n=31 (Year 3), and n=65 (Year 4). Amongst newly matriculated students, 25.0% were interested in primary care, which increased ~1.4-fold to 35.4% in the final year of medical school. In contrast, 38.2% of matriculated students expressed interest in surgical specialties, which decreased ~2.5-fold to 15.4% in the final year. Specialty choices in the final year that exhibited the largest absolute change from matriculation were orthopedic surgery (-9.9%), family medicine (+8.1%), radiology (+7.9%), general surgery (-7.2%), and anesthesiology (+6.2%). Newly matriculated students interested in primary care demonstrated no differences in their ranking of motivational factors compared to students interested in surgery, but many of these factors significantly deviated between the two career paths in the final year. Specifically, students interested in surgical specialties were more motivated by the rewards of salary and prestige compared to primary care students, who more highly ranked match confidence and family/location factors. Conclusions: We identified how residency choices change from the beginning to the end of medical school, how certain motivational factors change with time, how these results diverge between primary care and surgery specialty choice, and propose a new theory based on risk-reward balance regarding residency choice. Our study promotes awareness of student preferences and may help guide school curricula in developing more student-tailored training approaches. This could foster positive long-term changes regarding career satisfaction and the physician workforce.","output":"Medical student residency preferences and motivational factors: a longitudinal, single-institution perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Spain is one of the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 patients.

A retrospective study was performed in French Guiana, an ultraperipheral region of Europe in Amazonia. We identified 17 human cases between 2003 and 2019. The clinical and biological picture was close to Chikungunya with fever and arthralgia. One patient had acute meningo-encephalitis, and 4 had persistent arthralgia. Physicians should be aware of this virus, as imported cases in Europe have already occurred. AUTHOR SUMMARY: Latin America has experienced several epidemics of arboviruses in recent years, some known for a long time, such as the dengue virus, and others of more recent introduction such as the chikungunya or Zika viruses. There are other arboviruses for the moment more discreet which are rife with low noise in several countries of the continent, such as the Mayaro virus. This alphavirus, with a presentation similar to that of the chikungunya virus, is currently confined to transmission by forest mosquitoes, but its potential to be transmitted by coastal mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti, make it a potential candidate for a continent-wide epidemic. It therefore seems necessary to know this virus as well as possible in order to anticipate the occurrence of a possible new epidemic.

Traditional antibiotic therapies can hardly eradicate biofilms in many cases, as biofilms always form a robust fortress for pathogens inside, inhibiting the penetration of drugs. To address the issues, many novel drug carriers emerged as promising strategies for biofilm treatment. Among them, stimuli-responsive nanocarriers have attracted much attentions for their intriguing physicochemical properties, such as tunable size, shape and surface chemistry, especially smart drug release characteristic. Based on the microenvironmental difference between biofilm infection sites and normal tissue, many stimuli, such as bacterial products accumulating in biofilms (enzymes, glutathione, etc.), lower pH and higher H(2)O(2) levels, have been employed and proved in favor of on-demand drug release for biofilm elimination. Additionally, external stimuli including light, heat, microwave and magnetic fields are also able to control the drug releasing behavior artificially. In this review, we summarized recent advances in stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for combating biofilm infections, and mainly, focusing on the different stimuli that trigger the drug release. ժҪ: ϸĤɳ, ̵ĸȾ, ˳вȫ ĤΪڲԭ彨䱣, 谭ҩ͸, ˴ͳĿƷͨԸĤ Ϊ˽һ, оԱ͵ҩ, ΪľǰĤƲԡ , ̼ӦȤ-ѧ, ߴ, ״ͱ滯ѧɵڵ, رҩͷ, ǵĹ㷺ע ĤȾλú֮֯΢, öִ̼, Ĥڻ۵ϸ (ø, ׸ĵ), pH͸H(2)O(2)ˮƽ, ҩġͷšĤ , , , ΢ʹųڵԴ̼, Ҳ˹ҩͷΪ ƪ, ܽ˴̼ӦڶԿϸĤе½չ, ҩͷŵĶִ̼ GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]","output":"Stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for bacterial biofilm treatme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally.

In the early stages of the pandemic, countries with universal BCG vaccination programs registered a low number of new cases of COVID-19, with the situation now reversed, as exemplified by India. The high genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2, a known characteristic of RNA viruses, causing the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may have led to the virus adapting to overcome the initial immune protection. The strains from the United Kingdom (B1.1.7), Brazil (B1.1.28 and B1.1.33), South Africa (B.1.351), and India (B.1.617) are characterized by a greater ability to spread in the environment, in comparison with the original infectious agent of SARS-CoV-2. It should be remembered that the large variation in the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 may result in future changes in its pathogenicity, immunogenicity and antigenicity, and therefore it is necessary to carefully study the mutations occurring within the virus to determine whether the current vaccines will remain effective.

Bushfire smoke-related air pollution reached hazardous levels in major metropolitan areas, including the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), for prolonged periods of time. Bushfire smoke directly challenges human health through effects on respiratory and cardiac function, but can also indirectly affect health, wellbeing and quality of life. Few studies have examined the specific health effects of bushfire smoke, separate from direct effects of fire, and looked beyond physical health symptoms to consider effects on mental health and lifestyle in Australian communities. This paper describes an assessment of the health impacts of this prolonged exposure to hazardous levels of bushfire smoke in the ACT and surrounding area during the 2019C20 bushfire season. An online survey captured information on demographics, health (physical and mental health, sleep) and medical advice seeking from 2,084 adult participants (40% male, median age 45 years). Almost all participants (97%) experienced at least one physical health symptom that they attributed to smoke, most commonly eye or throat irritation, and cough. Over half of responders self-reported symptoms of anxiety and/or feeling depressed and approximately half reported poorer sleep. Women reported all symptoms more frequently than men. Participants with existing medical conditions or poorer self-rated health, parents and those directly affected by fire (in either the current or previous fire seasons) also experienced poorer physical, mental health and/or sleep symptoms. Approximately 17% of people sought advice from a medical health practitioner, most commonly a general practitioner, to manage their symptoms. This study demonstrated that prolonged exposure to bushfire smoke can have substantial effects on health. Holistic approaches to understanding, preventing and mitigating the effects of smoke, not just on physical health but on mental health, and the intersection of these, is important. Improved public health messaging is needed to address uncertainty about how individuals can protect their and their families health for future events. This should be informed by identifying subgroups of the population, such as those with existing health conditions, parents, or those directly exposed to fire who may be at a greater risk.","output":"Physical and Mental Health Effects of Bushfire and Smoke in the Australian Capital Territory 2019C20"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The Covid-19 pandemic eliminated nearly all visiting sub-internships. We seek to uncover match rate disparities across plastic surgery, otolaryngology, urology, and neurosurgery subspecialties with respect to in-person appraisals. These data aim to highlight the common practices as well as subtle differences that each subspecialty may be displaying in selecting their respective residency candidates. DESIGN: We accessed publicly available online spreadsheets between March 24 to 27 specific to the following surgical subspecialties: plastic surgery, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, and urology. We collected available information including the matched applicants medical school, the institution at which they matched, and whether they had previous communication with their matched program. This data was then used to record whether the applicant matched at their home institution. SETTING: N/A PARTICIPANTS: N/A RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in the number of plastic surgery and otolaryngology applicants who matched at their home programs during the 2020 to 2021 application cycle. 12.1% and 17.2% of plastic surgery applicants matched at their home program in the 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 application cycles, compared to 25.0% during the 2020 to 2021 application cycle (p = 0.0345). Overall, 23.4% and 22.2% of otolaryngology applicants matched at their home program in the 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 application cycles, compared to 31.3% during the 2020 to 2021 application cycle (p = 0.0482). Neurosurgery and urology applicants did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in home match rates during the 2020 to 2021 application cycle (p = 0.164 and p = 0.105, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 related restrictions in the 2020 to 2021 match cycle led residency programs to utilize novel selection mechanisms to evaluate applicants. Without visiting sub-internships during the 2020 to 2021 match cycle, some programs appear to have intentionally favored candidates with whom they were previously acquainted. The significantly higher number of international medical graduates and non-senior medical graduates among neurosurgery and urology residencies, respectively, likely washed out the home matching effect among these specialties but does not discount the importance of in-person appraisals.","output":"Disparate Responses in Match Outcome across Competitive Surgical Subspecialties to Pandemic Era Constraints: An Analysis of Impacts of Minimal Auditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory illnesses, including COVID\\\\19, present a serious threat to endangered wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) populations. In some parts of sub\\\\Saharan Africa, chimpanzee tracking is a popular tourism activity, offering visitors a chance to view apes in their natural habitats. Chimpanzee tourism is an important source of revenue and thus benefits conservation; however, chimpanzee tracking may also increase the risk of disease transmission from people to chimpanzees directly (e.g., via aerosol transmission) or indirectly (e.g., through the environment or via fomites). This study assessed how tourist behaviors might facilitate respiratory disease transmission at a chimpanzee tracking site in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We observed tourists, guides, and student interns from the time they entered the forest to view the chimpanzees until they left the forest and noted behaviors related to disease transmission. Common behaviors included coughing, sneezing, and urinating, which respectively occurred during 88.1%, 65.4%, and 36.6% of excursions.

Closure of live poultry markets in some affected cities dramatically reduced numbers of cases during summer of 2013, but the epidemic resurged during the winter 2013C14, increasing reported cases to 393 in Mainland China as of 30 March 2014. PURPOSE: The study aimed to explore population behavior patterns responding to an epidemic of influenza A(H7N9) virus. METHOD: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted among 1000, 680, and 1011 respondents in December 2013, January 2014, and February 2014, with response rates of 68.0, 64.4, and 66.6 %, respectively, in Hong Kong. Adults were recruited and interviewed using random digit-dialing telephone survey. Latent class analysis was employed to explore heterogeneity in protective behavior patterns across the three surveys. Multinomial regression models were developed to determine factors associated with latent class membership. RESULTS: Three comparable latent classes were identified across the three surveys: Moderate hygiene compliance (Class 1), High hygiene compliance (Class 2), and Vigilance (Class 3). The prevalence of Class 1 was 48C52 % across the three surveys while Class 3 prevalence increased significantly from 13 % in the Dec-2013 survey to 20 % in the Feb-2014 survey. Compared with Class 1, Class 3 were more likely to be female, older, better educated, married, perceive higher susceptibility to H7N9, attribute greater severity to H7N9, report higher current worry, and anticipated worry about H7N9 infection. CONCLUSION: The three classes reflect different levels of adoption of protection and thereby may have different levels of vulnerability toward contracting H7N9 infection. It appears that as the epidemic intensifies, Class 2 (Good hygiene compliance) members are likely to transfer to Class 3 (Vigilance) while Class 1 (Moderate hygiene compliance) could be unchanged. The young, mostly single males and those with lower educational achievement represent a group for whom public health messages need to be targeted.","output":"Population Behavior Patterns in Response to the Risk of Influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong, December 2013CFebruary 2014"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced substantial health challenges from the perspective of both its direct health complications and the disruption to delivery of standard care for individuals with a range of acute and chronic health issues. In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. Challenges The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management.

The GAD-7 was employed as measure for anxiety during and pre the pandemic The survey was conducted online via an anonymised questionnaire and disseminated by management through the heads of various disciplines within the mental health work force, using the local email portal in the Cork region. It was made available for research participation for a period of one month(JULY).Following this stage, the reported data were analysed utilizing paired samples t-test, Pearson's correlations, and a hierarchical regression. Demographic variables were controlled for during analysis.Result102 mental health healthcare workers participated in the survey (81.2% Female, 18.8% Male). The mean GAD-7 total scores for Pre-COVID-19 doubled in the during COVID-19 condition. The largest effect can be seen on the GAD-7 facet of feeling afraid as if something awful might happen with pre-COVID-19 GAD-7 mean scores more than quadrupling during COVID-19 conditions.Managerial support had a moderate negative relationship with GAD-7 scores during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information dissemination total scores also had a moderate positive correlation with managerial support total scores and perceived risk/safety total scores. There was no correlation found between the GAD-7 total scores during COVID-19 pandemic and Information dissemination total scores nor Risk/safety total scores. Childcare was a concern for 64% of staff that it was applicable to;45% of these staff considered altering work hours;17% reported issues from management regarding these requests.ConclusionMental health workers have seen a dramatic increase in anxiety since the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the context of expecting something bad to happen. Managerial support appears to be a protective factor for increased anxiety levels in this population. Childcare has been a predominant concern and altering working hours to accommodate this has been problematic for almost 1 in 5 mental health workers.

However, little is known about the impact of social media use, unhealthy lifestyles and the risk of miscarriage among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the association between social media use, unhealthy lifestyles and the risk of miscarriage among pregnant women in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 456 singleton pregnant women in mainland China were recruited during January and February, 2020. Social-demographic characteristics, history of previous health, social media use, and current lifestyles was collected at baseline and the occurrence of miscarriage was followed up. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the risk ratios (RRs) of miscarriage for women with different exposure of COVID-19-specipfic information. RESULTS: Among all the 456 pregnant women, there were 82 (18.0%) without any physical activities, 82 (18.0%) with inadequate dietary diversity, 174 (38.2%) with poor sleep quality, and 54 (11.8%) spending &#8805; 3 hours on reading COVID-19 news per day. Women with excessive media use (&#8805;3h) were more likely to be previous pregnant, never taking physical activities, with inadequate dietary diversity, and poor sleep quality (all P<.05). The prevalence of miscarriage was 16.0% (95% CI: 12.6%-19.4%). Compared with women who spent 0.5-2h (10.1%) on reading COVID-19 news per day, miscarriage prevalence in women who spent <0.5h (21.7%), 2-3h (19.7%) and &#8805;3h (31.5%) were higher (P<.05). Miscarriage prevalence was also higher in pregnant women with poor sleep quality (22.4% vs 12.1%, P<.05) and high educational level (17.9% vs 8.0%, P<.05). In the multivariable model, poor sleep quality (adjusted RR, 2.06; 95% CI: 1.24-3.44), 2-3h media use daily (adjusted RR, 1.74; 95% CI: 1.02-2.97), and &#8805; 3h media use daily (adjusted RR, 2.56; 95% CI: 1.43-4.59) were associated with miscarriage (all P<.05) (all P<.05). In the sensitivity analysis, results were still stable. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with excessive media use were more likely to be never taking physical activities, with inadequate dietary diversity, and poor sleep quality. Excessive media use and poor sleep quality was associated with the higher risk of miscarriage.

We previously studied 35 hospitalized COVID-19 patients of the 1st wave demonstrating a cytokine storm and the exhaustion of most lymphocyte subpopulations. Herein, we describe the results obtained from COVID-19 patients of the 2nd wave. METHODS: We analyzed interleukin (IL)-6 by human-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a large set of lymphocyte subpopulations by flow cytometry in 274 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from September 2020 to May 2021. RESULTS: Patients of 2nd wave compared with those of 1st wave showed lower serum IL-6 levels and a higher number of B and most T lymphocyte subpopulations in advanced stages, in relation with the age and the gender. On the other hand, we observed in 2nd wave patients: (i) a reduction of most lymphocyte subpopulations at mild and moderate stages; (ii) a reduction of natural killer cells and T regulatory cells together with a higher number of activated T helper (TH) 17 lymphocytes in all stages, which were mainly related to steroid and azithromycin therapies before hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a less severe impact in patients of the 2nd wave in advanced stages, while the impact appeared more severe in patients of mild and moderate stages, as compared with 1st wave patients. This finding suggests that in COVID-19 patients with milder expression at diagnosis, steroid and azithromycin therapies appear to worsen the immune response against the virus.

How the defects in this system might result in autoimmunity is discussed in this review. Reduced lymphocyte number, termed lymphopenia, can mediate lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) to maintain peripheral lymphocyte numbers. LIP not only occurs in normal physiological conditions but also correlates with autoimmunity. Of note, lymphopenia is also a typical marker of immune aging, consistent with the fact that not only the autoimmunity increases in the elderly, but also autoimmune diseases (ADs) show characteristics of immune aging. Here, we discuss the types and rates of LIP in normal and autoimmune conditions, as well as the coronavirus disease 2019 in the context of LIP. Importantly, although the causative role of LIP has been demonstrated in the development of type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, a two-hit model has suggested that the factors other than lymphopenia are required to mediate the loss of control over homeostasis to result in ADs. Interestingly, these factors may be, if not totally, related to the function/number of regulatory T cells which are key modulators to protect from self-reactivity. In this review, we summarize the important roles of lymphopenia/LIP and the Treg cells in various autoimmune conditions, thereby highlighting them as key therapeutic targets for autoimmunity treatments.","output":"Lymphopenia, Lymphopenia-Induced Proliferation, and Autoimmunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the prevalence of the adverse mental health outcomes in medical staff working in the hospital settings during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and explore the relative distribution of anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Yet, no assessment tool exists. This study hence developed and validated the COR Scale for COVID-19 (CORS-COVID-19) to facilitate relevant research. The five hypothesized domains included losses in financial resource, family resource, future control, fun, and social resource. A population-based random telephone survey interviewed 300 Chinese adults in the general population in Hong Kong, China during April 3C10, 2020. The levels of different types of resource losses were high (especially for loss in fun). The 5-factor structure identified by factor analysis matches with the five hypothesized dimensions. Its psychometric properties are acceptable, including good internal consistency, content validity (the correlations between the items and their respective subscales were stronger than that between the items and the other four subscales), concurrent validity (significant correlations between the scale/subscale scores and both emotional distress due to COVID-19 and satisfaction with living in Hong Kong), and convergent validity (significant correlations between specific subscales and corresponding external variables). Relatively high floor effects were detected in some subscales.

We quantitatively characterize both the long-term earnings consequences on children from a Covid-19 induced loss of schooling, as well as the associated welfare losses. Due to self-productivity in the human capital production function, skill attainment at a younger stage of the life cycle raises skill attainment at later stages, and thus younger children are hurt more by the school closures than older children. We find that parental reactions reduce the negative impact of the school closures, but do not fully offset it. The negative impact of the crisis on children's welfare is especially severe for those with parents with low educational attainment and low assets.

In laboratory animal models, SM is extremely lethal. Since no specific antidote has been proposed, decontamination upon contact is the recommended procedure. Several antidotes have been screened for SM, and in that sulfanyl compounds, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and S-2(2-aminoethylamino) ethylphenyl sulfide (DRDE-07) showed good protection. Since they showed protection at high doses, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy in combination at low dose, for percutaneously administered SM in mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 4 LD(50) of SM (32.4 mg/kg) was administered, and NAC (50 mg/kg), DRDE-07 (25 and 50 mg/kg) and their combinations were evaluated as 30 min pre-treatment by single oral administration. RESULT: After 72 h of SM exposure, significant decrease in body weight, decrease in hepatic reduced glutathione, and increase in hepatic malondialdehyde were observed (P < 0.001), showing oxidative stress. The combination of NAC (100 mg/kg) and DRDE-07 (50 mg/kg) showed significant protection (P < 0.01). The severe histopathological lesions induced by SM in liver, spleen and skin were also considerably reduced by the combination.

It is important to note, however, that more than 50% of these prescriptions are unnecessary or inappropriate. AREAS COVERED The current choice of antimicrobial therapy for etiological agents of LRTIs is examined and discussed considering each type of LRTI. EXPERT OPINION There is a clear need for the appropriate utilization of antibiotics in children. Therefore, accurate drug selection and choice of best dosage and duration of the antibacterial treatment are important to optimize the treatment of LRTIs. It's fundamental to bear in mind that children differ from adults in how LRTIs manifest and evolve not only because of the diversity in the immunological profiles but also the fundamental age-related differences in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of drugs. Since comprehensive antibiotic guideline recommendations for the treatment of pediatric LRTIs are generally lacking, there is an undeniable need for the introduction of pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programmes in both community and hospital settings.","output":"Current pharmacotherapeutic options for pediatric lower respiratory tract infections with a focus on antimicrobial agents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evolutionary innovations allow populations to colonize new ecological niches.

METHODS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 11 hospitals from three provinces of South China were included in the study. Clinical information was collected and compared with children and adults infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. RESULTS: In total, 52 children were enrolled, including 28 boys. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4-12); 44.2% cases were of clustered occurrences, 40.4% patients had fever, 48.1% had cough, and 46.2% had a high lymphocyte count. No abnormalities were found in the liver and kidney function. Also, 82.7% of patients received antiviral therapy, but such therapy did not shorten the time to virus negativity or hospital stay (P = .082). The time to virus negativity was 12.0 days (IQR, 8.0-16.8) and hospital stay was 14.5 days (IQR, 10.3-17.9). Compared with reports in Wuhan, there were more acute upper respiratory tract infection (AURTI) and fewer pneumonia cases (P = .000). Compared with the non-ICU adult COVID-19 in Wuhan, these children's diseases were relatively mild, with fewer complications. CONCLUSIONS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a mild fever, lymphocyte elevation was more common than reduction, and antiviral treatment had no obvious effect.

The assumption used are: 1) Risk of infection is a product of exposure rate and time and 2) the exposure rate decreases with distance. One-way vs. two-way pedestrian traffic scenarios within hallways were modeled and analyzed for various configurations. The underlying assumption that a small exposure to a large number of people is similar to a large exposure to a few people is the driver to minimize exposures levels in all aspects. The analysis indicates that minimizing the time spent in passing between classes is the driving factor in minimizing risk, and one-way traffic may increase the time required to pass between classes. While the case presented is limited, the modeled approaches are intended to provoke future research that can be extended and applied to larger populations to help provide decision makers with more rigorous tools to shape future policies regarding traffic flow within buildings.","output":"COVID-19 indoor exposure levels: An analysis of foot traffic scenarios within an academic building"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019 the world was shocked by the emergence of a new type of virus from the Corona family namely the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which had never been previously identified in humans later known as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS Nineteen patients who admitted to a single university hospital emergency department between March 5, 2020, and April 27, 2020, describing dyspnea were included in the study and underwent LUS by a single emergency specialist. The patient population was divided into 2 groups, COVID-19 positive and negative, and the sensitivity and specificity of LUS according to chest computed tomography were calculated for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis. In the subgroup analysis, the patient group was divided into real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positive (n = 7) and negative (n = 12), and sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to the CO-RADS. RESULTS According to the CO-RADS, significant differences were detected between the LUS positive and negative groups in terms of COVID-19 pneumonia presence. Only 1 patient was evaluated as CO-RADS 2 in the LUS positive group, and 2 patients were evaluated as CO-RADS 4 in the LUS negative group (P = 0.04). The sensitivity of LUS according to the CO-RADS for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis was measured to be 77.78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.9%-97.1%), specificity was 90% (95% CI, 55.5%-99.75%), positive predictive value was 87.5% (95% CI, 51.35%-97.8%), and accuracy was 84.21% (95% CI, 60.4%-96.62%; P = 0.004).

However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies. Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes. Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) & 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) & 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) & 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms. Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.

RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 61 years (7.4 years). The average hospital stay was 7 days (3,4 days). 33 patients (68.75%) had grade 1-2 viral pneumonia, 15 patients (31.25%) had CT grade 3-4. The average C-reactive protein was 69 mg/L (12.1 mg/L). The average white blood cell count was 12.1x109/L (5,3 x 109/L). The average blood D-dimer was 918 ng/ml (129 ng/ml). The average blood fibrinogen constituted 5.6 g/l (1.2 g/l). The mean oxygen saturation value at the time of surgery averaged 84% (8%). 28 patients (58.3%) needed oxygen supplementation. All patients were on anticoagulant therapy and 29 patients received IL-6 inhibitors. Suprapubic cystostomy was placed in 17 patients with AUR. Cystoscopy followed by endoscopic hemostasis was performed in 3 patients with haematuria. Ureteral stent and nephrostomy tube placement were performed in 19 and 9 patients with renal colic and pyelonephritis. All surgeries were performed under local or intravenous anaesthesia according to EAU recommendations. Haematuria was the most common postoperative complication - 10.4% (5 patients). Urinary tract infections reported by 2 patients. Progression of pneumonia, and respiratory insufficiency requiring patients transfer to the ICU, was noted in 16.7% (8 patients). 3 patients died. The mean age of deceased patients was 74 years all of them had comorbid pathology, severe grade 4 pneumonia, and were hypoxic at the time of surgery. The cause of death in 2 patients was respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary embolism.

The explosive spread of the virus and the rapid increase in the number of cases require the immediate development of effective therapies and vaccines as well as accurate diagnosis tools. The pathogenesis of the disease is triggered by the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein into ACE2-bearing host cells, particularly pneumocytes, resulting in overactivation of the immune system, which attacks the infected cells and damages the lung tissue. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with host cells is primarily mediated by the N-terminal helix of ACE2; thus, inhibition of the spike-ACE2 interaction may be a promising therapeutic strategy for blocking the virus entry into host cells. In this paper, we used an in-silico approach to explore small-molecule &#945;-helix mimetics as inhibitors that may disrupt the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. First, the RBD-ACE2 interface in the 6M0J structure was studied by the MM-GBSA decomposition module of the HawkDock server, which led to the identification of two critical target regions in the RBD. Next, two virtual screening experiments of 7236 &#945;-helix mimetics from ASINEX were conducted on the above regions using the iDock tool, which resulted in 10 candidates with favorable binding affinities.

Methods Students who previously registered for the Medical Student Neurosurgery Training Camps were sent an online Qualtrics survey, requesting them to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic was affecting their neurosurgical education. The Pearson Chi-Square test and post-hoc pairwise Fishers exact test were used for analysis of categorical variables and the two-tailed paired Students t-test was utilized for continuous variables. Results The survey was distributed to 852 medical students with 127 complete responses. Concerns regarding conferences/networking opportunities (63%), clinical experience (59%), and board exam scores (42%) were most frequently cited. 76% of M3s reported at least one cancelled/postponed neurosurgery rotation. On average, students were more likely to take a year off from medical school after COVID-19 than before the start of the pandemic, measured from 0 to 100 (25.3  36.0 vs 39.5  37.5; p = 0.004). Virtual mentorship pairing was the highest rated educational intervention suggested by M1s and M2s, while M3s and M4s cited virtual surgical skills workshops most frequently. Conclusions This nationwide survey highlights the concerns of medical students in neurosurgery education during the COVID-19 pandemic. With these findings, neurosurgery organizations can consider targeted plans for students of each year to continue their development.","output":"Medical student concerns relating to neurosurgery education during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted an international workshop on ultraviolet-C (UV-C) disinfection technologies on January 14-15, 2020, in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in collaboration with the International Ultraviolet Association (IUVA). This successful public event, as evidenced by the participation of more than 150 attendees, with 65 % from the ultraviolet technology industry, was part of an ongoing collaborative effort between NIST and the IUVA and its affiliates to examine the measurement and standards needs for pathogen abatement with UV-C in the healthcare whole-room environment. Prior to and since this event, stakeholders from industry, academia, government, and public health services have been collaboratively engaged with NIST to accelerate the development and use of accurate measurements and models for UV-C disinfection technologies and facilitate technology transfer. The workshop served as an open forum to continue this discussion with a technical focus centered on the effective design, use, and implementation of UV-C technologies for the prevention and treatment of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in complex hospital settings. These settings include patient rooms, operating rooms, common staging areas, ventilation systems, personal protective equipment, and tools for the reprocessing and disinfecting of instruments or devices used in medical procedures, such as catheters and ventilators. The critical need for UV-C technologies for disinfection has been amplified by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), stimulating an even greater emphasis on identifying testing and performance metrology needs. This paper discusses these topics based on the international workshop and community activities since the workshop, including a public World-Wide-Web-based seminar with more than 500 registered attendees on September 30, 2020;an international conference on UV-C technologies for air and surface disinfection, December 8-9, 2020;and a webinar on returning to normalcy with the use of UV-C technologies, April 27 and 29, 2021.

This translational study aimed to conceptualise a real-life, cognitively enriched walking program for older adults (65+) by investigating (a) which cognitive tasks are most suited for cognitive enrichment of a walking program, and (b) how to embed these tasks in a walking program to become feasible, enjoyable and effective. METHODS: A co-design process was followed with input of 34 academic experts and 535 end users. First, an online, three-rounds Delphi process was used to obtain consensus amongst academic experts on the key characteristics that a real-life cognitively enriched walking program should have. Next, end users provided feedback and suggestions on what the experts concluded, and gave more insight into their preferences and concerns by means of an online/telephone survey. RESULTS: Combined input from experts and end users resulted in a list of recommendations to guide the further development of the cognitively enriched walking program. First, it is important to provide a range of cognitive tasks to choose from. Each of these tasks should (a) provide variation and differentiation, (b) be implemented with increasing levels of difficulty, and (c) be integrated in the walk. Second, divide the walk into three parts: 5C10 min brisk walking, cognitive tasks for most of the walk, and 5C10 min free walking. Finally, the program should strive for a minimal session frequency of twice a week, include competition occasionally and carefully, ensure safety and keep the walks fun. CONCLUSIONS: The co-design process resulted in recommendations to guide the next steps in the program development process. Additional studies will be performed to improve the enjoyability and feasibility, and to assess the effectiveness of the cognitively enriched walking program to improve cognitive functioning and physical activity in older adults (65+).

Alternatively, close contact with children may increase risk of SARs-CoV-2 infection. We investigated whether risk of infection with SARs-CoV-2 and severe outcomes differed between adults living with and without children. Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we conducted a population-based cohort study using primary care data and pseudonymously-linked hospital and intensive care admissions, and death records, from patients registered in general practices representing 40% of England. Using multivariable Cox regression, we calculated fully-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of outcomes from 1st February-3rd August 2020 comparing adults living with and without children in the household. Findings: Among 9,157,814 adults []65 years, living with children 0-11 years was not associated with increased risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospital or ICU admission but was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 death (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62-0.92). Living with children aged 12-18 years was associated with a small increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13), but not associated with other COVID-19 outcomes. Living with children of any age was also associated with lower risk of dying from non-COVID-19 causes. Among 2,567,671 adults >65 years there was no association between living with children and outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2. We observed no consistent changes in risk following school closure. Interpretation: For adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings have implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 pandemic especially has created unforeseen public health challenges including a global shortage of PPE needed for the safety of health care workers (HCWs). Although sufficient stocks of PPE are currently available, their critical shortage may develop soon due to increase in demand and depletion of existing supply lines. To empower our HCWs and ensure their continued protection, proactive measures are urgently required to develop procedures to safely decontaminate the PPEs to allow their \\"selective reuse\\" during contingency situations. Methods: Herein, we have successfully developed a decontamination method based on vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). We have used a range of concentration of hydrogen peroxide to disinfect PPE (coveralls, face-shields, and N-95 masks). To ensure a proper disinfection, we have evaluated three biological indicators namely Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus, considered as the gold standard for disinfection processes. We next evaluated the impact of repeated VHP treatment on physical features, permeability, and fabric integrity of coveralls and N-95 masks. Next, we performed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to evaluate microscopic changes in fiber thickness of N-95 masks, melt blown layer or coverall body suits. Considering the fact that any disinfection procedure should be able to meet local requirements, our study included various regionally procured N-95 masks and coveralls available at our institute All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. Lastly, the practical utility of VHP method developed herein was ascertained by operationalizing a dedicated research facility disinfecting used PPE during COVID-19. Results: Our prototype studies show that a single VHP cycle (7-8% Hydrogen peroxide) could disinfect PPE and PPE housing room of about 1200 cubic feet (length10 ft  breadth 10 ft  height 12 ft) in less than 10 min, as noted by a complete loss of B. stearothermophilus spore revival. The results are consistent and reproducible as tested in over 10 cycles in our settings. Further, repeated VHP treatment did not result in any physical tear, deformity or other appreciable change in the coverall and N-95 masks. Our permeation tests evaluating droplet penetration did not reveal any change in permeability post-VHP treatments. Also, SEM analysis indeed revealed no significant change in fiber thickness or damage to fibers of coveralls or melt blown layer of N-95 masks essential for filtration. There was no change in user comfort and experience following VHP treatment of PPE. Based on results of these studies, and parameters developed and optimized, an institutional research facility to disinfect COVID-19 PPE is successfully established and operationalized with more than 80% recovery rate for used PPE post-disinfection. Conclusions: Our study, therefore, successfully establishes the utility of VHP to effectively disinfect PPE for a possible reuse as per the requirements. VHP treatment did not damage coveralls, cause physical deformity and also did not alter fabric architecture of melt blown layer. We observed that disinfection process was successful consistently and therefore believe that the VHP-based decontamination model will have a universal applicability and utility. This proces2s can be easily and economically scaled up and can be instrumental in easing global PPE shortages in any biosafety facility or in health care settings during pandemic situation such as COVID-19.","output":"Development of a highly effective low-cost vaporized hydrogen peroxide-based method for disinfection of personal protective equipment for their selective reuse during pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 189 countries representing a global health problem of enormous proportions not only as a health crisis, but one with devastating social and economic implications for years to come. Adding to the already complex scenario are the different responses to the pandemic between countries according to their own strengths and weaknesses. The aim of our study was to provide a brief overview on how confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 were managed and worked up in an outpatient setting. Methods: We conducted an observational telephone-based study among 153 outpatients with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 from the city of Guayaquil-Ecuador from April to May 2020. To be included in the study, participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 through a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Alternatively, in cases where testing for was not accessible we considered a suspected case in those who presented with typical symptoms of COVID-19, and had either a compatible computed tomography (CT) scan, or a positive IgM in a rapid serological test. Results: The final sample comprised 153 patients, with a mean age of 44.3 years, and a gender distribution of 54.9% male and 45.1% female. The most reported comorbidity was hypertension (30.1%), followed by allergies (15.7%), and type 2 diabetes (7.2%). From all the patients, only 47.1% had a confirmed diagnosis through a positive PCR test for COVID-19. Fatigue was identified as the most common symptom in 82.3% of patients, followed by subjective fever (79.1%), and cough (76.6%). Regarding the workup of these cases, we found that CT scans were performed in 69.9% of cases, followed by PCR testing (47.1%), and chest x-ray (21.6%). Regarding treatment, acetaminophen was the most frequently prescribed medication (83%), followed by azithromycin (66.1%), n-acetylcysteine (56.2%), nitazoxanide (34.7%), hydroxychloroquine (25.5%), and corticosteroids (11.2%).Conclusions: During peak months of the pandemic in our country we found that roughly half of suspected outpatient cases with COVID-19 surveyed in our study had undergone confirmatory PCR testing. This finding may be the result of oversaturation of the healthcare system and a decreased capacity to perform confirmatory tests in our country. Furthermore, there was a considerable outpatient use of experimental treatments that may have led to potential drug interactions and side effects that were not accounted or supervised directly by a healthcare professional. class='MsoNormal' style='text-align:justify;lineheight: 150%'&gt; .","output":"Outpatient management and workup of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases: A brief perspective from a developing country at the height of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type I interferons (IFN-I) exert pleiotropic biological effects during viral infections, balancing virus control versus immune-mediated pathologies and have been successfully employed for the treatment of viral diseases. Humans express twelve IFN-alpha () subtypes, which activate downstream signalling cascades and result in distinct patterns of immune responses and differential antiviral responses. Inborn errors in type I IFN immunity and the presence of anti-IFN autoantibodies account for very severe courses of COVID-19, therefore, early administration of type I IFNs may be protective against life-threatening disease. Here we comprehensively analysed the antiviral activity of all IFN subtypes against SARS-CoV-2 to identify the underlying immune signatures and explore their therapeutic potential. Prophylaxis of primary human airway epithelial cells (hAEC) with different IFN subtypes during SARS-CoV-2 infection uncovered distinct functional classes with high, intermediate and low antiviral IFNs. In particular IFN5 showed superior antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dose-dependency studies further displayed additive effects upon co-administered with the broad antiviral drug remdesivir in cell culture. Transcriptomics of IFN-treated hAEC revealed different transcriptional signatures, uncovering distinct, intersecting and prototypical genes of individual IFN subtypes. Global proteomic analyses systematically assessed the abundance of specific antiviral key effector molecules which are involved in type I IFN signalling pathways, negative regulation of viral processes and immune effector processes for the potent antiviral IFN5. Taken together, our data provide a systemic, multi-modular definition of antiviral host responses mediated by defined type I IFNs.

Liver fibrosis is an important prognostic factor in NAFLD, and detection is vital. The pathophysiological changes of obesity can alter the accuracy of non-invasive NAFLD tests. We aimed to review current evidence for common non-invasive tests for NAFLD-related fibrosis in obesity. METHODS We systematically searched for studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of 11 biomarker panels and elastography techniques for NAFLD-related fibrosis in obesity. Meta-analyses were performed where possible. RESULTS Thirty-eight studies were identified assessing the selected tests in obese populations. Simple biomarker panels (e.g. NAFLD fibrosis score) were the most validated. Evidence showed better accuracy of complex biomarker panels (NAFLD fibrosis score: summary receiver operator characteristic [SROC] 0.795-0.813 vs. enhanced liver fibrosis: SROC 0.962); however, these were poorly validated in obesity. Elastography techniques were better studied and had high diagnostic accuracy (transient elastography: SROC 0.859; magnetic resonance elastography: SROC 0.965) but were limited by BMI-dependent failure. Limited evidence was found to validate the accuracy of any test in exclusively obese populations. CONCLUSION In obese subjects, complex biomarker panels and elastography have been reasonable to good accuracy for NAFLD-related fibrosis; however, these methods have not been well validated. Further study in this high-risk population is needed.","output":"Systematic review and meta-analysis: non-invasive detection of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease related fibrosis in the obese."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To explore the experiences of the first nurses assigned to work in COVID-19 units with the onset of the outbreak in Turkey.

RESULTS: From the analyses of the data, four key themes have emerged as follows: 'needs', 'anger', 'questioning' and 'decision'. Needs include visibility, support, adaptation and sleep/rest. Nurses were angry because of their unmet expectations, feelings of injustice, and selfish and insensitive behaviours they faced. They questioned their profession and decided to either alienate from the profession or continue with the gains they had made. CONCLUSION: This study found that nurses perceived an imbalance between their efforts and their achievements.

We focused on encounters with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, and described their demographics, clinical presentation, and outcomes. Sequential multivariable logistic regressions examined the strength of association between age cohort and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 4536 encounters, median patient age was 55 years, 49% were women, and 34% were non\\\\Hispanic Black persons. Cough was the most common presenting complaint across age groups (18C64, 65C74, and 75+): 71%, 67%, and 59%, respectively (p < 0.001).

Vacuum-assisted wound closure and mesh-mediated fascial traction (VAWCM) is a widely used approach for temporary abdominal closure to close the abdominal wall. However, this method is associated with a high incidence of re-operations in short term and late sequelae such as incisional hernia. The current study aims to compare the results of surgical strategies of OA with versus without permanent mesh augmentation. METHODS Patients with OA treatment undergoing vacuum-assisted wound closure and an intraperitoneal onlay mesh (VAC-IPOM) implantation were compared to VAWCM with direct fascial closure which represents the current standard of care. Outcomes of patients from two tertiary referral centers that performed the different strategies for abdominal closure after OA treatment were compared in univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 139 patients were included in the study. Of these, 50 (36.0%) patients underwent VAC-IPOM and 89 (64.0%) patients VAWCM. VAC-IPOM was associated with reduced re-operations (adjusted incidence risk ratio 0.48 per 10-person days; CI 95% = 0.39-0.58, p < 0.001), reduced duration of stay on intensive care unit (ICU) [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.53; CI 95% = 0.36-0.79, p = 0.002] and reduced hospital stay (aHR 0.61; CI 95% = 0.040-0.94; p = 0.024).

People with obesity are blamed for their weight, and there is a common perception that weight stigmatization is justifiable and may motivate individuals to adopt healthier behaviors. The authors of this study aimed to explore WS prevalence and factors associated with WS in a large nationwide study of Saudi Arabian adults. Methods: This study was a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted via phone interviews in June 2020. A proportional quota-sampling technique was adopted to obtain equal distributions of participants by age and sex across the 13 regions of Saudi Arabia. In total, 6239 people were contacted, and 4709 (75.48%) responded and completed the interview. The authors of the study collected data about WS using the Arabic Weight Self-Stigma Questionnaire (WSSQ), BMI, smoking, nutritional knowledge, bariatric surgery, risk of depression, and demographic variables. Results: Participants had a mean age of 36.4  13.5 (18C90), and 50.1% were female. The prevalence of higher WS was 46.4%. Among other risk factors, there was a significant association between WS and obesity (odds ratio (OR): 3.93; 95% CI: 2.83C5.44; p < 0.001), waterpipe smoking (OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.20C2.69; p < 0.001), bariatric surgery (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.53C2.81; p < 0.001), and risk of depression (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.36C2.09; p < 0.001). Conclusion: This was the first study to explore WS and its associated factors among adults in a community setting in Saudi Arabia. This study revealed some risk factors associated with WS that may help to identify people at risk of WS and to develop interventions to reduce WS, such as improving nutritional knowledge, correcting the ideas about bariatric surgery and obesity in general, and ceasing waterpipe smoking.","output":"Exploring Weight Stigma in Saudi Arabia: A Nationwide Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent dramatic appearance of variants of concern of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights the need for innovative approaches that simultaneously suppress viral replication and circumvent viral escape from host immunity and antiviral therapeutics.

Moreover, greater collaboration between formulation experts and clinical colleagues, including healthcare professionals, is advocated to lead to safe and effective, age-appropriate medicinal products. Acceptability testing should be a secondary endpoint in paediatric clinical trials to ensure post-marketing adherence is not compromised by a lack of acceptability.

We included 54 studies in the data synthesis. Compared to patients with a non-severe form of COVID-19, patients who had a severe form of disease revealed higher values for white blood cells (WBC), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, troponin, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. By contrast, platelet count, lymphocyte count, and albumin levels were decreased in patients with a severe form of COVID-19. Also, patients with a severe phenotype of disease were more likely to have diabetes, chronic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and malignancy.

In the evaluation of the first (prevalence) screening round, we observed exceptionally high early recall rates, which made the routine application of MSCT screening questionable. Because screening may behave differently in subsequent (incidence) screening rounds, we analyzed (a) basic characteristics for the annual rounds 2 to 4, which have now also been completed, and (b) the first 3 years with complete follow-up since time of randomization. METHODS Data material was the data record of LUSI after the fourth screening round and the 3-year follow-up had been completed. Basic characteristics of screening, e.g., early recall rate, detection rate, and interval cancers as well of proportion of advanced cancers, were descriptively evaluated and, if informative, group differences were tested for statistical significance. RESULTS Early recall rates were significantly lower in the subsequent screening rounds than in the first one if the MSCT information from the previous screening rounds was available. Detection and biopsy rates were approximately 1% or lower, ratio of benign:malignant biopsies: 1:1.6 to 1:3. CONCLUSION Our recent data may not only settle one concern regarding high recall rates in routine MSCT screening but also indicate that screening must be strictly organized to be effective. Performance indicators are similar to those in mammography screening. Nevertheless, possible consequences for the participants (diagnostic workup of suspicious findings, biopsies) are more invasive than in mammography screening.","output":"Randomized Study on Early Detection of Lung Cancer with MSCT in Germany: Results of the First 3 Years of Follow-up After Randomization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract We study partisan differences in Americans response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

During viral encephalomyelitis, the absence of CD4 T cells decreases CD8 T cell activity and impedes viral control in the central nervous system (CNS). By contrast, the absence of B7-H1 enhances CD8 T-cell function and accelerates viral control, but increases morbidity. However, the relative contribution of CD4 T cells to CD8 function in the CNS, in the absence of B7-H1, remains unclear. METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and B7-H1(?/?) mice were infected with a gliatropic coronavirus and CD4 T cells depleted to specifically block T helper function in the CNS. Flow cytometry and gene expression analysis of purified T-cell populations from lymph nodes and the CNS was used to directly monitor ex vivo T-cell effector function. The biological affects of altered T-cell responses were evaluated by analysis of viral control and spinal-cord pathology. RESULTS: Increased anti-viral activity by CD8 T cells in the CNS of B7-H1(?/?) mice was lost upon depletion of CD4 T cells; however, despite concomitant loss of viral control, the clinical disease was less severe. CD4 depletion in B7-H1(?/?) mice also decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression by microglia and macrophages, consistent with decreased microglia/macrophage activation and reduced interferon (IFN)-. Enhanced production of IFN-, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-21 mRNA was seen in CD4 T cells from infected B7-H1(?/?) compared with WT mice, suggesting that over-activated CD4 T cells primarily contribute to the increased pathology. CONCLUSIONS: The local requirement of CD4 T-cell help for CD8 T-cell function is not overcome if B7-H1 inhibitory signals are lost. Moreover, the increased effector activity by CD8 T cells in the CNS of B7-H1(?/?) mice is attributable not only to the absence of B7-H1 upregulation on major histocompatibility complex class I-presenting resident target cells, but also to enhanced local CD4 T-cell function. B7-H1-mediated restraint of CD4 T-cell activity is thus crucial to dampen both CD8 T-cell function and microglia/macrophage activation, thereby providing protection from T-cell-mediated bystander damage.","output":"Enhanced CD8 T-cell anti-viral function and clinical disease in B7-H1-deficient mice requires CD4 T cells during encephalomyelitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxygen (O2) and other dissolved gases such as the gasotransmitters H2S, CO and NO affect cell metabolism and function.

Provitamin D (7-dehydrocholesterol) is converted to previtamin D which is further modified by a series of reactions to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This Chapter summarises the discovery of vitamin D and reviews the chemistry and photochemistry of its precursors, transformations and metabolites. The production of vitamin D in various human populations is described, and how to assess vitamin D status. The skeletal and non-skeletal effects of vitamin D are discussed, particularly its role in immunomodulation with consequences for protection against a variety of human diseases. The Chapter concludes with evolutionary aspects, the occurrence and role of vitamin D in the plant kingdom, biogeographical considerations, and the nonphotochemical production of vitamin D in certain plants.","output":"Vitamin D: Photobiological and Ecological Aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To identify the metabolic determinants of type 2 diabetes non-remission status after bariatric surgery at 12 and 24 months. METHODS A total of 40 adults [mean  sd body mass index 36  3 kg/m(2) , age 48  9 years, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 9.7  2%) undergoing bariatric surgery [Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG)] were enrolled in the present study, the Surgical Treatment and Medication Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial. Type 2 diabetes remission was defined as HbA1c <6.5% and fasting glucose <126 mg/dl (i.e. <7 mmol/l) without antidiabetic medication. Indices of insulin secretion and sensitivity were calculated from plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide values during a 120-min mixed-meal tolerance test. Body fat, incretins (glucagon-like polypeptide-1, gastric inhibitory peptide, ghrelin) and adipokines [adiponectin, leptin, tumour necrosis factor-, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] were also assessed. RESULTS At 24 months, 37 patients had available follow-up data (RYGB, n = 18; SG, n = 19). Bariatric surgery induced type 2 diabetes remission rates of 40 and 27% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Total fat/abdominal fat loss, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and -cell function (C-peptide0-120 /glucose0-120  Matsuda index) improved more in those with remission at 12 and 24 months than in those without remission. Incretin levels were unrelated to type 2 diabetes remission, but, compared with those without remission, hs-CRP decreased and adiponectin increased more in those with remission. Only baseline adiponectin level predicted lower HbA1c levels at 12 and 24 months, and elevated adiponectin correlated with enhanced -cell function, lower triglyceride levels and fat loss. CONCLUSIONS Smaller rises in adiponectin level, a mediator of insulin action and adipose mass, characterize type 2 diabetes non-remission up to 2 years after bariatric surgery. Adjunctive strategies promoting greater fat loss and/or raising adiponectin may be key to achieving higher type 2 diabetes remission rates after bariatric surgery.","output":"Attenuated improvements in adiponectin and fat loss characterize type 2 diabetes non-remission status after bariatric surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the relationship between the transformative power of pain and posttraumatic growth in nurses with positive Covid\\\\19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

The participants were grouped as; yoga practitioners, other spiritual practitioners, and non-practitioners based on their responses to daily practices that they follow. Yoga practitioners were further examined based on the duration of practice as; long-term, mid-term and beginners. Multivariate analysis indicates that yoga practitioners had significantly lower depression, anxiety, & stress (DASS), and higher general wellbeing (SWGB) as well as higher peace of mind (POMS) than the other two groups. The results further revealed that the yoga practitioners significantly differed in the perception of personal control, illness concern and emotional impact of COVID19. However, there was no significant difference found for the measure of resilience (BRS) in this study. Yoga practitioners also significantly differed in the cognitive reappraisal strategy for regulating their emotions than the other two groups. Interestingly, it was found that beginners -those who had started practicing yoga only during the lockdown period reported no significant difference for general wellbeing and peace of mind when compared to the mid- term practitioner. Evidence supports that yoga was found as an effective self- management strategy to cope with stress, anxiety and depression, and maintain wellbeing during COVID19 lockdown.","output":"Yoga an effective strategy for self-management of stress-related problems and wellbeing during COVID19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contracts serve an important function: allocation of risks. In achieving this function, contractual parties routinely include a force majeure clause in their contracts to be excused from performance in the face of a supervening event. But what events qualify to excuse performance and how have courts approached force majeure clauses? Scholars emphasize parties intent and contractual language. Courts decisions, however, have been inconsistent. This Article provides novel data showing the leading role of the control factor and argues that parties reliance (not control) should be the center of force majeure inquiry. As courts become inundated with a slew of claims arising out of COVID-19 disruptions, it is critical to have a fresh look at force majeure clauses. Using empirical methods (including machine learning and natural language processing) and doctrinal analysis, this Article makes the following contributions: First, based on empirical analysis of force majeure clauses and behavioral economics, it argues that parties primarily do away with the basic assumption requirement in their force majeure clauses. Second, by parsing through past courts decisions, it shows that courts have relied on three factors (i.e., control, foreseeability, and language) to approach force majeure clauses. Third, using com-putational tools on force majeure cases since 1810, it shows that the control factor (beyond the control of the parties) is the most important factor in courts decisions. Fourth, the Article suggests an overhaul shift based on promisees reliance rather than solely based on promisors ability to control.","output":"Contracting Risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Additive Manufacturing, referred to as 3D printing has extended beyond simple prototyping and is being used for the fabrication of fully functional active components It is one of the flexible manufacturing technique that can apply to polymers, metals, ceramics, concrete, and composites Owing to the ability to select from a wide range of processible polymers and the enhancement in some of the properties offered by polymers, the AM industry, still predominantly targets the production of polymeric components This review demonstrates the current state of AM industry regarding polymeric materials A brief explanation of the additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, polymers, and polymer composites (fibre reinforces, particle reinforced and nanocomposites) utilised in the AM processes is provided Polymer AM is being applied in different applications such as biomedical, electronics, aerospace, automobile, and sporting industries respectively The review also emphasizes the rising importance of antimicrobial polymers in the COVID-19 pandemic The exponential use of polymeric materials in the industrial sector has caused an increase in wastage generation and disposal issues which draws attention to the importance of green composites as well as life cycle assessment (LCA) of products and processes Finally, the significance of Distributed Recycling via AM due to the disposal issues and low polymer recycling rates is illustrated ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved","output":"A review on additive manufacturing of polymers composites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Covid-19 is the second most devastating event over a century The pandemic, alongside deep health crises, has ushered the largest economic shocks, which require governments attention to ameliorate to avoid an economic downturn The aim of this study is to measure the economic impacts of Covid-19 in Brunei by estimating the exposure, vulnerability, and resilience of the economy This study deployed the United Nations Disaster Risk Reduction framework to examine the economic impact empirically The data related to variables of gross domestic product, oil prices, international merchandise trade, tourism, unemployment, consumer price index, money supply, and national accounts were collected from September 2019 to July 2020 and analyzed through the fixed effects panel regression technique The findings show that the news of the Covid-19 outbreak has exposed the weaknesses in energy sectors by having a significant negative impact Additionally, analysis discloses that the energy and tourism sectors are vulnerable to the shocks of Covid-19 During the peak of the pandemic outbreak, unemployment in Brunei has also escalated Additionally, the energy and tourism sectors are less resilient to pandemic shocks The findings indicated that the consumer price index has significantly escalated during the economic recovery process The findings elucidate that the overall GDP growth rate, international merchandise trade, and the financial sector continue exhibiting better performance amid Covid-19 The findings of this study contribute to developing policy implications for the emerging economies concerned with the economic recovery process during the pandemic ?

Among them, psychological resilience (PR) is defined as the capacity of responding positively to stressful events. Our aim was to assess whether PR is associated with CVD or metabolic disturbances through a systematic review. METHODS: We gathered articles from PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar up to October 28, 2021. We included articles that were in English, were observational, and had PR examined as exposure. The CVD outcomes were either clinical or metabolic outcomes (i.e., dyslipidemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and diabetes). RESULTS: Our literature search identified 3,800 studies, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria. Of them, seven were longitudinal and 10 cross-sectional, and 13 were on adults and four on children. The exposure assessment was heterogeneous, i.e., 12 studies used different kinds of self-administered questionnaires and five used interviews with a psychologist. Regarding outcomes, five studies investigated CVD, seven obesity, one metabolic syndrome, two hypertension, four dyslipidemia, and four diabetes. In longitudinal studies, PR was found to have an inverse association with included outcomes in five studies from the Swedish military conscription cohort but had no association with CVD in a study on African-American women and was associated with slower progression of diabetes in a general population. The cross-sectional studies showed that the prevalence of disease was not associated with PR in many cases but the progression of disease was associated with PR. CONCLUSION: PR seems to have a possibly favorable association with CVD and metabolic disturbances that differs according to the type of outcome and population. Our study limitations are given by the small number of studies available and the heterogeneity in PR measurement.

Data Sources PubMed, the Cochrane COVID-19 trial registry, and the Living Overview of Evidence platform were searched until January 29, 2021. Study Selection The RCTs selected compared any type of convalescent plasma vs placebo or standard of care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in any treatment setting. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two reviewers independently extracted data on relevant clinical outcomes, trial characteristics, and patient characteristics and used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The primary analysis included peer-reviewed publications of RCTs only, whereas the secondary analysis included all publicly available RCT data (peer-reviewed publications, preprints, and press releases). Inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the treatment effects. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Main Outcomes and Measures All-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, mechanical ventilation use, and serious adverse events. Results A total of 1060 patients from 4 peer-reviewed RCTs and 10 722 patients from 6 other publicly available RCTs were included. The summary risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality with convalescent plasma in the 4 peer-reviewed RCTs was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.38), the absolute risk difference was -1.21% (95% CI, -5.29% to 2.88%), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision. Across all 10 RCTs, the summary RR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.12) and there was moderate certainty of the evidence due to inclusion of unpublished data. Among the peer-reviewed RCTs, the summary hazard ratio was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.07 to 20.34) for length of hospital stay, the summary RR was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.20 to 2.87) for mechanical ventilation use (the absolute risk difference for mechanical ventilation use was -2.56% [95% CI, -13.16% to 8.05%]), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision for both outcomes. Limited data on clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, and serious adverse events showed no significant differences. Conclusions and Relevance Treatment with convalescent plasma compared with placebo or standard of care was not significantly associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality or with any benefit for other clinical outcomes.

Methods: This cross-sectional report assessed the triage processes and outcomes (triage category, referral to emergency/dental facility undertaken, remote medications prescribed, and procedures performed at the point of referral); and evaluated the demand for the newly introduced TD service during 5 months of the first wave of the pandemic. Results: Of 850 calls, about 70.6% of the samples were managed remotely; 29.4% were categorized as emergency/urgent and referred to the emergency/dental facility. Compared with other complaints, orofacial dental pain was the most common reason for the calls (41.6%, p < 0.0001). About 14.71% of callers received prescription for medications remotely. The most demanded disciplines were general dentistry, orthodontics, and oral surgery, respectively (p < 0.0001). Of those referred to a dental facility, 31.84% required no clinical intervention, 28.7% received orthodontic appliance repair, and 14.3% and 11.2% had urgent dental extractions or root canal treatments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant articles with the keywords Retinal detachment AND Coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR SARS OR MERS. RESULTS: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated a 53C66% reduction in RD presentation. The decrease in the rate of macula-on RD, the increase in the mean duration of symptoms, and the rise in the number of patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy were all suggestive of a delayed presentation of RD. Moreover, a drop of 56C62% in RD repair surgeries was observed. However, the most frequently performed ophthalmic surgery changed from cataract surgery in April 2019 to RD repair in April 2020. Using phacovitrectomy instead of vitrectomy alone can reduce the number of operations in ophthalmology centers, decrease the use of personal protective equipment by 50%, and cut costs per patient by 17C20%. Also, developing a well-organized telemedicine system can decrease unnecessary visits and delayed presentations.

Previous studies demonstrated that tRNS delivered over cortical areas acutely enhances visual contrast detection of stimuli when tRNS intensity is optimized for the individual. However, it is currently unknown whether tRNS-induced signal enhancement could be achieved within different neural substrates along the retino-cortical pathway and whether the beneficial effect of optimal tRNS intensities can be reproduced across sessions. In 3 experimental sessions, we tested whether tRNS applied to the primary visual cortex (V1) and/or to the retina improves visual contrast detection. We first measured visual contrast detection threshold (VCT; N=24, 16 females) during tRNS delivery separately over V1 (no tRNS, 0.75, 1, 1.5mA) and over the retina (no tRNS, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3mA), determined the optimal tRNS intensities for each individual (ind-tRNS), and retested the effects of ind-tRNS within the sessions. We further investigated whether we could reproduce the ind-tRNS-induced modulation on a different session (N=19, 14 females). Finally, we tested whether the simultaneous application of ind-tRNS to the retina and V1 causes additive effects. We found that at the group level tRNS of 0.75mA decreases VCT compared to baseline when delivered to the V1. Beneficial effects of ind-tRNS could be replicated when retested within the same experimental session but not when retested in a separate session. Applying tRNS to the retina did not cause a systematic reduction of VCT, irrespective of whether the individually optimized intensity was considered or not. We also did not observe consistent additive effects of V1 and retina stimulation. Our findings demonstrate that V1 seems to be more sensitive than the retina to tRNS-induced modulation of visual contrast processing. Significance statement Our findings confirm previous evidence showing acute online benefits of tRNS of V1 on visual contrast detection in accordance with the stochastic resonance phenomenon. We further extend it, demonstrating that the optimal tRNS intensity varies among participants, but when individually tailored it can improve visual processing when re-tested within the experimental session. The tRNS-induced enhancement in visual sensitivity seems to be specific for cortical contrast processing as stimulation of the retina did not lead to systematic effects.","output":"Transcranial random noise stimulation of the primary visual cortex but not retina modulates visual contrast sensitivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sinds de uitbraak van COVID-19 in februari is het aantal kankerdiagnoses fors gedaald ten opzichte van de maanden daarvoor.

So far, different pathological pathways for SARS-CoV-2 infection have been introduced in which the excess release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin 1  [IL-1], IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor  [TNF]) has earned most of the attentions. However, recent studies have identified new pathways with at least the same level of importance as cytokine storm in which endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is one of them. In COVID-19, two main pathologic phenomena have been seen as a result of EC dysfunction: hyper-coagulation state and pathologic angiogenesis. The EC dysfunction-induced hypercoagulation state seems to be caused by alteration in the levels of different factors such as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen, soluble thrombomodulin, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). As data have shown, these thromboembolic events are associated with severity of disease severity or even death in COVID-19 patients. Other than thromboembolic events, pathologic angiogenesis is among the recent findings. Furthermore, over-expression/higher levels of different proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-inducible factor 1  (HIF-1), IL-6, TNF receptor super family 1A and 12, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) have been found in the lung biopsies/sera of both survived and non-survived COVID-19 patients. Also, there are some hypotheses regarding the role of nitric oxide in EC dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been demonstrated that different pathways involved in inflammation are generally common with EC dysfunction and angiogenesis. Altogether, considering the common possible upstream pathways in cytokine storm, pathologic angiogenesis, and EC dysfunction, it seems that targeting these molecules (such as nuclear factor B) could be more effective in the management of patients with COVID-19.","output":"Endothelial cell dysfunction, coagulation, and angiogenesis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paradoxical effects of reward and aversion with abused drugs may interact to produce drug addiction, which is the so-called paradoxical effect hypothesis of abused drugs. However, there is no research examining how the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) regulates morphine's paradoxical effect of reward and aversion. The present study addresses this issue, utilizing a high concentration of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) via injections to destroy the VTA or the PAG. Moreover, the study employed the new \\"pre- and postassociation\\" experimental paradigm (2010) to test whether the simultaneous rewarding and aversive effects of morphine can be affected by an NMDA lesion in the VTA or the PAG. The results indicated that the NMDA lesion of the VTA simultaneously reduced morphine-induced conditioned suppression of saccharin solution intake in conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and morphine-induced spent time in the preference compartment in conditioned place preference (CPP), whereas the PAG lesion did not change either measure. Thus, the VTA, but not the PAG, appears to contribute to the paradoxical effect reward in CPP and aversion in CTA induced by morphine. The VTA's involvement in morphine-induced CTA aversion and CPP reward supports the paradoxical effect hypothesis of abused drugs.

DESIGN This was a secondary data analysis of the Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical Quality, Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care project, in which clinical staff employed in the NH setting conducted medical, transitional, and palliative care quality improvement initiatives and gathered data related to resident transfers to the emergency department/hospital setting. R software and Microsoft Excel were used to characterize a subset of transfers prompted by behavioral concerns. SETTING NHs in central Indiana were utilized (N = 19). PARTICIPANTS This study included long-stay NH residents with behavioral concerns prompting transfer for acute emergency department/hospital evaluation (N = 355 transfers). MEASUREMENTS The measures used in this study were symptoms prompting transfer, resident demographics and baseline characteristics (Minimum Data Set 3.0 variables including scores for the Cognitive Function Scale, ADL Functional Status, behavioral symptoms directed toward others, and preexisting psychiatric diagnoses), on-site management (e.g., medical evaluation in person or by phone, testing, and interventions), avoidability rating, transfer disposition (inpatient vs emergency department only), and hospital discharge diagnoses. RESULTS Over half of the transfers, 56%, had a medical evaluation before transfer, and diagnostic testing was conducted before 31% of transfers. After transfer, 80% were admitted. The most common hospital discharge diagnoses were dementia-related behaviors (27%) and altered mental status (27%), followed by a number of medical diagnoses.

OBJECTIVES To investigate the mechanism of lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 in the progression of CRC. MATERIAL AND METHODS Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure FEZF1-AS1 and miR-363-3p expression. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were analyzed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assays. Protein expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT)-related markers and paired-related homeobox 1 (PRRX1) were determined using western blot analysis. The interactions among FEZF1-AS1, miR-363-3p and PRRX1 were verified with dual-luciferase reporter assay. A xenograft model was constructed in vivo to confirm the role of FEZF1-AS1 in CRC tumor growth. RESULTS We demonstrated that FEZF1-AS1 expression was upregulated in CRC, and its silencing reduced CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT. MiR-363-3p could be inhibited by FEZF1-AS1, which inhibitor could reverse the suppressive effect of FEZF1-AS1 silencing on CRC progression. Paired-related homeobox 1 could be targeted by miR-363-3p, and the inhibitory effect of FEZF1-AS1 knockdown on CRC progression could also be eliminated by PRRX1 overexpression. Furthermore, interference of FEZF1-AS1 reduced the tumor growth of CRC in vivo.

Our aim was to quantify associations between Infectieradar participant characteristics and the incidence of self-reported COVID-19-like illness. Recruitment for this cohort study was via a web announcement. After registering, participants completed weekly questionnaires, reporting the occurrence of a set of symptoms.

However, little is known about the impact of these measures on the population as expressed on social media from different cultural contexts. OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the evolution of the topics discussed on Chinese and French social media during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We extracted posts containing \\"COVID-19\\"- or \\"lockdown\\"-related keywords in the most commonly used micro-blogging social media platforms, i.e., Weibo (China) and Twitter (France), from one week before to the lifting of the lockdown. A topic model was applied independently for three periods: pre-lockdown, early lockdown and mid-to-late lockdown, to assess the evolution of the topics discussed on Chinese and French social media. RESULTS: 6 395, 23 422 and 141 643 Chinese Weibo messages, and 34 327, 119 919, and 282 965 French tweets were extracted in the pre-lockdown, early lockdown and mid-to-late lockdown periods in China and France, respectively. Four categories of topics were discussed in a continuously evolving way in all three periods: epidemic news and everyday life, scientific information, public measures and solidarity & encouragement. The most represented category over all periods in both countries was epidemic news and everyday life. Scientific information was far more discussed on Weibo than in French tweets. Misinformation circulated through social media in both countries; however, it was more concerned with the virus and epidemic in China, whereas it was more concerned with the lockdown measures in France. Regarding public measures, more criticisms were identified in French tweets than on Weibo. Advantages and data privacy concerns regarding tracing apps were also addressed in French tweets. All these differences were explained by the different use of social media, the different timeline of the epidemic and the different cultural context in these two countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to compare the social media content in Eastern and Western countries during the unprecedented COVID-19 lockdown. Using general COVID-19-related social media data, our results describe common and different public reactions, behaviors and concerns in China and France, covering even the fine topics identified in prior studies focusing on specific interests.

Prescription records of cholinesterase inhibitors confirmed the diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorders; all use of cholinesterase inhibitors was reviewed by experts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Conditional Poisson regression was used to derive incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals for evaluating the risk of falls and fractures for different treatment periods: use of cholinesterase inhibitors alone, antipsychotic drugs alone, and a combination of cholinesterase inhibitors and antipsychotic drugs, compared with the non-treatment period in the same individual. A 14 day pretreatment period was defined before starting the study drugs because of concerns about confounding by indication. RESULTS: The incidence of falls and fractures per 100 person years was 8.30 (95% confidence interval 8.14 to 8.46) for the non-treatment period, 52.35 (48.46 to 56.47) for the pretreatment period, and 10.55 (9.98 to 11.14), 10.34 (9.80 to 10.89), and 9.41 (8.98 to 9.86) for use of a combination of cholinesterase inhibitors and antipsychotic drugs, antipsychotic drugs alone, and cholinesterase inhibitors alone, respectively. Compared with the non-treatment period, the highest risk of falls and fractures was during the pretreatment period (adjusted incidence rate ratio 6.17, 95% confidence interval 5.69 to 6.69), followed by treatment with the combination of cholinesterase inhibitors and antipsychotic drugs (1.35, 1.26 to 1.45), antipsychotic drugs alone (1.33, 1.24 to 1.43), and cholinesterase inhibitors alone (1.17, 1.10 to 1.24). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of falls and fractures was high in the pretreatment period, suggesting that factors other than the study drugs, such as underlying diseases, should be taken into consideration when evaluating the association between the risk of falls and fractures and use of cholinesterase inhibitors and antipsychotic drugs. The treatment periods were also associated with a higher risk of falls and fractures compared with the non-treatment period, although the magnitude was much lower than during the pretreatment period. Strategies for prevention and close monitoring of the risk of falls are still necessary until patients regain a more stable physical and mental state.","output":"Use of antipsychotic drugs and cholinesterase inhibitors and risk of falls and fractures: self-controlled case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease) can induce systemic vascular involvement contributing to morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial and endothelial cells through the ACE2 receptor. The anatomical involvement of the coronary tree is not explored yet. METHODS: Cardiac autopsy tissue of the entire coronary tree (main coronary arteries, epicardial arterioles/venules, epicardial capillaries) and epicardial nerves were analyzed in COVID-19 patients (n = 6). All anatomical regions were immunohistochemically tested for ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68 and IL-6. COVID-19 negative patients with cardiovascular disease (n = 3) and influenza A (n = 6) served as controls. FINDINGS: COVID-19 positive patients showed strong ACE2 / TMPRSS2 expression in capillaries and less in arterioles/venules. The main coronary arteries were virtually devoid of ACE2 receptor and had only mild intimal inflammation. Epicardial capillaries had a prominent lympho-monocytic endotheliitis, which was less pronounced in arterioles/venules. The lymphocytic-monocytic infiltrate strongly expressed CD4, CD45, CD68. Peri/epicardial nerves had strong ACE2 expression and lympho-monocytic inflammation. COVID-19 negative patients showed minimal vascular ACE2 expression and lacked endotheliitis or inflammatory reaction. INTERPRETATION: ACE2 / TMPRSS2 expression and lymphomonocytic inflammation in COVID-19 disease increases crescentically towards the small vessels suggesting that COVID-19-induced endotheliitis is a small vessel vasculitis not involving the main coronaries. The inflammatory neuropathy of epicardial nerves in COVID-19 disease provides further evidence of an angio- and neurotrophic affinity of SARS-COV2 and might potentially contribute to the understanding of the high prevalence of cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmias in COVID-19.

Since 2005 this virus has been responsible for an epidemic outbreak of unprecedented magnitude. By analogy with other alphaviruses, it is thought that cellular proteases are able to process the viral precursor protein E3E2 to produce the receptor-binding E2 protein that associates as a heterodimer with E1. Destabilization of the heterodimer by exposure to low pH allows viral fusion and infection. We show that among a large panel of proprotein convertases, membranous furin but also PC5B can process E3E2 from African CHIKV strains at the HRQRR(64) / ST site, whereas a CHIKV strain of Asian origin is cleaved at RRQRR(64) / SI by membranous and soluble furin, PC5A, PC5B, and PACE4 but not by PC7 or SKI-1. Using fluorogenic model peptides and recombinant convertases, we observed that the Asian strain E3E2 model peptide is cleaved most efficiently by furin and PC5A. This cleavage was also observed in CHIKV-infected cells and could be blocked by furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone. This inhibitor was compared with chloroquine for its ability to inhibit CHIKV spreading in myoblast cell cultures, a cell-type previously described as a natural target of this virus. Our results demonstrate the role of furin-like proteases in the processing of CHIKV particles and point out new approaches to inhibit this infection.","output":"Inhibition of Chikungunya virus infection in cultured human muscle cells by furin inhibitors: impairment of the maturation of the E2 surface glycoprotein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In its most trending interpretation, empowerment in health care is implemented as a patient-centered approach. In the same sense, many mobile health (mHealth) apps are being developed with a primary focus on the individual user. The integration of mHealth apps into the health care system has the potential to counteract existing challenges, including incomplete or nonstandardized medical data and lack of communication, especially in the intersectional context (eg, patients, medical forces). However, concerns about data security and privacy, regional differences in regulations, lack of accessibility, and nontransparent apps hinder the successful integration of mHealth into the health care system. One approach to address this is to rethink the interpretation of empowerment. On that basis, we here examine existing approaches of individual empowerment and subsequently analyze a different view of empowerment in digital health, namely interaction empowerment. Such a change of perspective could positively influence intersectoral communication and facilitate secure data and knowledge sharing. We discuss this novel viewpoint on empowerment, focusing on more efficient integration and development of mHealth approaches.

The fatal coronavirus and Covid-19 pandemic have already affected more than 216 countries worldwide, with more than thirty-six million confirmed cases, including millions of death tolls. Now, India has the second-largest number of Covid-19 affected confirmed cases. The pandemic-driven nationwide lockdown has had a fatal impact on the economy. The supply-side and demand-side for entire economic sectors were disrupted, industrial production has come to a halt, millions of jobs were lost, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was eroded away at an unprecedented rate, economic anxiety is inevitable in every sphere of life and livelihood.

Several variants have been labeled variants of concern (VOCs) because they may have a transmission advantage, increased risk of morbidity and/or mortality, or immune evasion upon a background of prior infection or vaccination. Placing the VOCs in context with the underlying variability of SARS-CoV-2 is essential in understanding virus evolution and selection pressures. Dominant genome sequences and the population genetics of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from hospitalized patients were characterized. Nonsynonymous changes at a minor variant level were identified. These populations were generally preserved when isolates were amplified in cell culture. To place the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron VOCs in context, their growth was compared to clinical isolates of different lineages from earlier in the pandemic. The data indicated that the growth in cell culture of the Beta variant was more than that of the other variants in Vero E6 cells but not in hACE2-A549 cells. Looking at each time point, Beta grew more than the other VOCs in hACE2-A549 cells at 24 to 48 h postinfection. At 72 h postinfection there was no difference in the growth of any of the variants in either cell line. Overall, this work suggested that exploring the biology of SARS-CoV-2 is complicated by population dynamics and that these need to be considered with new variants. In the context of variation seen in other coronaviruses, the variants currently observed for SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in terms of their clinical spectrum of disease. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus has spread across the planet, causing a global pandemic. In common with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 genomes can become quite diverse as a consequence of replicating inside cells. This has given rise to multiple variants from the original virus that infected humans. These variants may have different properties and in the context of a widespread vaccination program may render vaccines less effective. Our research confirms the degree of genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. By comparing the growth of previous variants to the pattern seen with four variants of concern (VOCs) (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron), we show that, at least in cells, Beta variant growth exceeds that of Alpha, Delta, and Omicron VOCs at 24 to 48 h in both Vero E6 and hACE2-A549 cells, but by 72 h postinfection, the amount of virus is not different from that of the other VOCs.","output":"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasopharyngeal Samples from Patients with COVID-19 Illustrates Population Variation and Diverse Phenotypes, Placing the Growth Properties of Variants of Concern in Context with Other Lineages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Single loop reconstruction (SLR) was routine in our institution for patients undergoing pancreatico-duodenectomy (PD).

Presence of cervical facet joint effusion and CDS was recorded. Data were analyzed to deduce possibility of an association between cervical facet joint effusion and CDS. RESULTS: Seventeen patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of cervical spondylotic myelopathy associated with CDS. Out of these, 10 patients revealed facet joint effusion at C3-C4 (4 patients) and C4-C5 (6 patients) levels. The mean age of patients was 65.8 years (49C79) and M:F was 2.2:1. Amount of facet joint effusion varied and ranged from 1.6 mm to 4.7 mm on the axial images. Ten patients (58.82%) demonstrated facet joint effusion associated with mobile CDS. Seven patients (41.17%) with CDS and without facet effusion did not demonstrate mobility of more than 0.5 mm in flexion-extension radiographs. CONCLUSION: The current study acknowledges the association of cervical facet effusion and CDS. Clinically measurable facet joint effusion on MRI suggests the need for further attempts to diagnose CDS.","output":"Cervical facet joint effusion: A sign of instability in cervical degenerative spondylolisthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. ONBEHALF: the GeroCovid Investigators Introduction. Atrial fibrillation (AF), the arrhythmia most frequently diagnosed in older patients, associates with serious, thrombo-embolic, complications and high mortality. COVID-19 severely affects aged subjects, determining an important prothrombotic status. Purpose. Aim of this study was to evaluate mortality-related factors in older AF patients with COVID-19. Methods. We included 806 in-hospital COVID-19 patients aged 60 years or more hospitalized between March 1st and June 6th 2020 and enrolled in a multicenter observational study. Results. The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. In-hospital mortality was higher in the AF group (36.9 vs. 27.5%; p = 0.015). Among AF patients, those who survived were younger (81  8 vs. 84  7 years; p = 0.002), had a lower CHA2DS2-VASc score (3.9  1.6 vs. 4.4  1.3; p = 0.02) and were more frequently treated with oral anticoagulants at admission (63.1 vs. 32.3%; p < 0.001) than those who died in hospital. At multivariable logistic regression analysis, lower age (p = 0.042), a better functional profile (p = 0.007), less severe COVID-19 manifestations at admission (p = 0.001), and the use of Vitamin K antagonists (OR = 0.16, 95%CI: 0.03-0.84; p = 0.031) or DOACs (OR = 0.22, 95%CI: 0.08-0.56; p = 0.002), compared to antiplatelet therapy or no treatment at all, were associated with a lower chance of in-hospital death. Conclusions. AF is a prevalent condition and a severity factor in older COVID-19 patients. Advanced age, dependency and severe clinical manifestations of disease characterized older AF subjects with a worse prognosis. Interestingly, pre-admission anticoagulant therapy correlated positively with in-hospital survival.","output":"Oral anticoagulant therapy at hospital admission associates with lower mortality in older COVID-19 patients with atrial fibrillation.

The opening of the vaccination for these strata may play a key role in order to limit virus circulation, infection spreading towards the most vulnerable subjects, and plan safe school reopening. Vaccine hesitancy (VH) could limit the ability to reach the coverage threshold required to ensure herd immunity. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and determinants of VH among parents/guardians toward a potentially available COVID-19 vaccination for children and adolescents. An online survey was performed in parents/guardians of children aged &lt;18 years old, living in Bologna. Overall, 5054 questionnaires were collected. A vast majority (60.4%) of the parents/guardians were inclined to vaccinate, while 29.6% were still considering the opportunity, and 9.9% were hesitant. Highest vaccine hesitancy rates were detected in female parents/guardians of children aged 6-10 years, &lt;=29 years old, with low educational level, relying on information found in the web/social media, and disliking mandatory vaccination policies.

Among them, convalescent plasma administered to hospitalized patients has been unsuccessful, perhaps because antibodies should be administered earlier in the course of illness. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of convalescent plasma with high IgG titers against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in older adult patients within 72 hours after the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was severe respiratory disease, defined as a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or more, an oxygen saturation of less than 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air, or both. The trial was stopped early at 76% of its projected sample size because cases of Covid-19 in the trial region decreased considerably and steady enrollment of trial patients became virtually impossible. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients underwent randomization. In the intention-to-treat population, severe respiratory disease developed in 13 of 80 patients (16%) who received convalescent plasma and 25 of 80 patients (31%) who received placebo (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.94; P=0.03), with a relative risk reduction of 48%. A modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded 6 patients who had a primary end-point event before infusion of convalescent plasma or placebo showed a larger effect size (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.81). No solicited adverse events were observed.

Hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as a possible treatment; however, it is associated with multiple adverse reactions. We report a rare case of a patient with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis with Stevens-Johnson syndrome due to hydroxychloroquine. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is characterized by acute onset of a generalized rash that is pustular and erosive in nature, affecting limbs; trunk; face; and, less often, mucosal membranes. Although rare, it is important to be mindful of this side effect because the diagnosis is often delayed, and the disease has the potential to be life-threatening. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old American woman presented to our hospital with a painful, rapidly spreading rash. Its morphologic features included erythema multiformeClike lesions with extensive skin sloughing in various regions of the head, neck, and trunk and mucosal involvement. Her Nikolsky sign was negative, and she had no evidence of lesions on areas of skin trauma. Four weeks prior, she had been initiated on hydroxychloroquine for a presumed diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Three punch biopsies of the head and neck area revealed subcorneal pustules consistent with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Treatment began with high doses of methylprednisolone, leading to only minimal improvement of existing areas and ongoing spread to new areas. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated, at which point disease stability was achieved. The patients rash ultimately resolved, as did her cutaneous pain and pruritus. CONCLUSIONS: Among many potential adverse reactions involving hydroxychloroquine, cutaneous side effects are varied and can lead to significant morbidity or even death. The drug is currently being investigated in a multitude of trials for coronavirus disease2019 treatment, prevention, and prophylaxis after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is a rare side effect of hydroxychloroquine, and even fewer cases demonstrate histologic evidence of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis while clinically presenting with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients who develop Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis require best supportive care with aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement and prevention of further breakdown of the skin barrier. With the potential of widespread hydroxychloroquine use, it is important that providers be aware of its potential severe adverse drug reactions.","output":"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome overlap due to hydroxychloroquine: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Italy was the first country in Europe to face the coronavirus pandemic The aim of the study was to analyze healthcare workers' (HCWs) level of information, practice, and risk perception towards COVID-19 We set up a cross-sectional study through SurveyMonkey R and distributed the link through Facebook and Whatsapp closed groups The research instrument was a 31 items questionnaire distributed using Facebook and Whatsapp It was conducted in Italy from February to May 2020 The study participants were general practitioners, pediatricians and other health professionals A total of 958 participants were included: 320 (33 4%) general practitioners, 248 (25 9%) pediatricians and 390 (40 7%) other health professionals The highest response rate was from Northern Italy (48 1%), followed by Central Italy (29 9%) and Southern Italy (22 0%) Less than a half (46%) of respondents felt they had a good level of information of COVID-19 case definition and of national prevention guidelines Respondents reported to have changed their clinical practice;particularly, they increased the use of masks (87 1%, p &lt; 0 001), disinfection and sanitization of doctors' offices (75 8%, p &lt; 0 001), the use of protective glasses (71 2%, p &lt; 0 001), alcoholic hand solution (71 2%, p &lt; 0 001), and hand washing (31 8%, p = 0 028) HCWs are at high risk of infection;less than a half of them felt adequately prepared to face COVID-19 pandemic, so they need extensive information and awareness of the disease to take adequate precautionary measures, and they are crucial to disseminate good practices","output":"Knowledge and Perception of COVID-19 Pandemic during the First Wave (Feb-May 2020): A Cross-Sectional Study among Italian Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: PCR testing for COVID-19 is not done at random but selectively on suspected cases. This paper presents a method to estimate a 'genuine Virus Prevalence' by quantifying and removing the bias related to selective testing. Methods: Data used are from nine (9) neighboring countries in Western Europe that record similar epidemic trends despite differences in Testing Rate. Regression analysis is used to establish a relationship of declining Test Positivity with increased Testing Rate. By extrapolating this trend to an 'infinitely complete' Testing Rate, an unbiased Test Positivity or 'genuine Virus Prevalence' is computed. Via pairing of 'genuine Virus Prevalence' with Excess-Deaths, a 'genuine Infection Fatality Rate' (IFR) is also derived. Results: Peak levels of 'genuine Virus Prevalence' were around 0.5 to 2% during the 1st epidemic wave (week 10 to week 20) and are approaching similar levels in the ongoing 2nd wave (week 34 onward). 'Genuine Virus Prevalence' estimates are close to reported Seroprevalence in the studied countries with a correlation coefficient of 0.58. 'Genuine IFR' is found comparable to closed-community model IFR. Finally, results of community mass-testing in Slovakia are within the estimated range of 'genuine Virus Prevalence'. Conclusions: Estimates of 'genuine Virus Prevalence' benchmark favorably to other indications of virus prevalence suggesting the estimation method is robust and potentially deployable beyond this initial dataset of countries. 'Genuine Virus Prevalence' curves suggest that during the 1st epidemic wave, curve flattening and waning happened at very modest levels of infection spread, either naturally or facilitated by government measures.","output":"Estimating COVID-19 Virus Prevalence from Records of Testing Rate and Test Positivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that blood biomarkers for nervous system injury, serum concentrations of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) can serve as biomarkers for disease severity in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. RESULTS: In total, 21% (n = 10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and the overall mortality rate was 13% (n = 6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p < 0.001) upon admission than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p = 2.6  10(C7)) and unadjusted analyses (p = 0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements; whereas, the concentrations in survivors were stable. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p = 0.02).

This study used the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique to identify anatomically specific variation in white-matter microstructure that is associated with pediatric emotional dysregulation severity. Thirty-two children (mean age 9.53 years) with varying levels of emotional dysregulation symptoms were recruited by the Massachusetts General Hospital and underwent the DTI scans at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Emotional dysregulation severity was measured by the empirically-derived Child Behavior Checklist Emotional Dysregulation Profile that includes the Attention, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression subscales. Whole-brain voxel-wise regression tests revealed significantly increased radial diffusivity (RD) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cingulum-callosal regions linked to greater emotional dysregulation in the children. The results suggest that microstructural differences in cingulum-callosal white-matter pathways may manifest as a neurodevelopmental vulnerability for pediatric mood disorders as implicated in the clinical phenotype of pediatric emotional dysregulation. These findings may offer clinically and biologically relevant neural targets for early identification and prevention efforts for pediatric mood disorders.","output":"Cingulum-Callosal white-matter microstructure associated with emotional dysregulation in children: A diffusion tensor imaging study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although there was a report about the seasonal variation in Wuhan city, it only analyzed the prevalence data of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) cases, and just studied the seasonality by subgroup of smear positive and negative from 2006 to 2010 by spectral analysis. In this study, we investigated the seasonality of the total newly notified pulmonary TB cases by subgroups such as time period, sex, age, occupation, district, and sputum smear result from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan by a popular seasonal adjustment model (TRAMO-SEATS). METHODS: Monthly pulmonary TB cases from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan were analyzed by the TRAMO-SEATS seasonal adjustment program. Seasonal amplitude was calculated and compared within the subgroups. RESULTS: From 2004 to 2013, there were 77.76 thousand newly notified pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan, China. There was a dominant peak spring peak (March) with seasonal amplitude of 56.81% and a second summer peak (September) of 43.40%, compared with the trough month (December). The spring seasonal amplitude in 2004C2008 was higher than that of 2009C2013(P<0.05). There were no statistical differences for spring seasonal amplitude within subgroups of gender, age, district, and sputum smear result (P>0.05). However, there were significant differences in spring seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 59.37% to 113.22% (P<0.05). The summer seasonal amplitude in 2004C2008 was higher than that of 2009C2013(P<0.05).

Also, there were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 43.40% to 109.88% (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was an apparent seasonal variation in pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan. We speculated that spring peak in our study was most likely caused by the increased reactivation of the latent TB due to vitamin D deficiency and high PM2.5 concentration, while the summer peak was mainly resulted from the enhanced winter transmission due to indoor crowding in winter, overcrowding of public transportation over the period of the Spring Festival and health care seeking delay in winter.","output":"Seasonal Variation of Newly Notified Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cases from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined individuals' information behaviors in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among SARS-CoV-2-infections-associated neurological symptoms fatigue, headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness and anosmia/ageusia are most frequent, but less frequent neurological deficits such as seizures, Guillain-Barr syndrome or ataxia may also occur. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we present a case of a 62-year-old man who developed a subacute cerebellar syndrome with limb-, truncal- and gait ataxia and scanning speech 1 day after clinical resolution of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Apart from ataxia, there were no signs indicative of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome or Miller Fisher syndrome. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebellar atrophy.

BMD generally increases following parathyroidectomy, however longitudinal changes to other DXA-derived parameters, the trabecular bone score (TBS) and hip structural analysis (HSA), have not been described. Postoperative calcium requirements and positive calcium balance raise concerns for an increased risk of vascular calcification. This case illustrates the dramatic increase in BMD that can follow parathyroidectomy in a patient on dialysis, and for the first time demonstrates improvements to HSA parameters and to the TBS. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year old woman on haemodialysis underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. She developed a post-operative 'hungry bone syndrome' requiring substantial calcium and calcitriol supplementation. Six months post-parathyroidectomy, BMD increased by 42% at the lumbar spine, 30% at the femoral neck and 25% at the total proximal femur, with increases sustained over the following 18 months. The TBS increased by 8%. HSA showed a 63% increase in femoral neck cortical thickness and 38% reduction in the buckling ratio, consistent with increased femoral neck stability. The abdominal aortic vascular calcification score (0-24) increased from zero 8-years pre-parathyroidectomy to 2/24 at 18-months post-parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSION: BMD losses incurred by secondary hyperparathyroidism recover rapidly after parathyroidectomy, particularly at sites of trabecular bone. Bone architectural parameters, measured as the TBS and by HSA, also improve. Greater BMD gains may be associated with higher post-operative calcium requirements. While bone is the major reservoir for post-parathyroidectomy calcium supplementation, positive calcium balance may contribute to vascular calcification risk.","output":"Changes to bone mineral density, the trabecular bone score and hip structural analysis following parathyroidectomy: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The modified Marsh and Schnider pharmacokinetic models for propofol consistently produce negatively and positively biased predictions in underweight patients, respectively. We aimed to develop a new pharmacokinetic model of propofol in underweight patients. METHODS Twenty underweight (BMI<18.5 kg m-2) patients aged 20-68 yr were given an i.v. bolus of propofol (2 mg kg-1) for induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was maintained with a zero-order infusion (8 mg kg-1 h-1) of propofol and target-controlled infusion of remifentanil. Arterial blood was sampled at preset intervals. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using non-linear mixed effects modelling. The time to peak effect (tpeak, maximally reduced bispectral index) was measured in 28 additional underweight patients receiving propofol 2 mg kg-1. RESULTS In total, 455 plasma concentration measurements from the 20 patients were used to characterise the pharmacokinetics of propofol. A three-compartment mammillary model well described the propofol concentration time course. BMI and lean body mass (LBM) calculated using the Janmahasatian formula were significant covariates for the rapid peripheral volume of distribution and for the clearance of the final pharmacokinetic model of propofol, respectively. The parameter estimates were as follows: V1(L)=2.02, V2(L)=12.9(BMI/18.5), V3(L)=139, Cl (L?min-1)=1.66(LBM/40), Q1 (L?min-1)=1.44, Q2 (L?min-1)=0.87+0.0189(LBM-40).

We examined associations between SLT intensity (hours/week), dosage (total hours), frequency (days/week), duration (weeks), delivery (face to face, computer supported, individual tailoring, and home practice), content, and language outcomes for people with aphasia. METHODS: Databases including MEDLINE and Embase were searched (inception to September 2015). Published, unpublished, and emerging trials including SLT and 10 individual participant data on aphasia, language outcomes, and time post-onset were selected. Patient-level data on stroke, language, SLT, and trial risk of bias were independently extracted. Outcome measurement scores were standardized. A statistical inferencing, one-stage, random effects, network meta-analysis approach filtered individual participant data into an optimal model examining SLT regimen for overall language, auditory comprehension, naming, and functional communication pre-post intervention gains, adjusting for a prioriCdefined covariates (age, sex, time poststroke, and baseline aphasia severity), reporting estimates of mean change scores (95% CI). RESULTS: Data from 959 individual participant data (25 trials) were included. Greatest gains in overall language and comprehension were associated with >20 to 50 hours SLT dosage (18.37 [10.58C26.16] Western Aphasia BatteryCAphasia Quotient; 5.23 [1.51C8.95] Aachen Aphasia TestCToken Test). Greatest clinical overall language, functional communication, and comprehension gains were associated with 2 to 4 and 9+ SLT hours/week. Greatest clinical gains were associated with frequent SLT for overall language, functional communication (3C5+ days/week), and comprehension (4C5 days/week). Evidence of comprehension gains was absent for SLT 20 hours, <3 hours/week, and 3 days/week. Mixed receptive-expressive therapy, functionally tailored, with prescribed home practice was associated with the greatest overall gains. Relative variance was <30%. Risk of trial bias was low to moderate; low for meta-biases.

For this purpose, both quantitative and qualitative data on consumption included in the Consumer Survey Expectations (CES) carried out by the European Central Bank are used. First, we construct a consumption index on the basis of its qualitative data on spending trends during the pandemic, and its heterogeneity across population groups points towards both unsatisfied consumption (due to existing restrictions on consumption) and the deterioration in the labor market being drivers of the decline of consumption during the pandemic. Likewise, the results show that, in line with the less stringent measures in place to control the pandemic, the strong negative link between income levels and consumption developments (linked to forced savings) has moderated in 2021 (with data up to August) with respect to the previous year. Then, we estimate what proportion of the recovery in household expenditure during the third quarter of 2020, after the large decline observed in the first semester, can be explained by the observed changes in the distribution of hours worked. First, we combine information on hours, industry, gender and age in the Spanish Labor Force Survey and consumption in the Spanish Survey on Household Finances (EFF) to estimate the potential change in expenditure associated with the change of hours worked for different population groups (age, gender, and education level). Those estimations also inform about the groups of the population whose expenditure has been most affected by the pandemic (low-schooling and individuals below 55 years of age). In a second step, we then compare potential and actual changes in consumption observed in the ECB's Consumer Expectation Survey to gauge quantitative contribution of changes in hours to the evolution of expenditure vs other factors (such as postponed expenditure). We find that changes in hours worked can explain almost half of consumption recovery in the 3rd quarter of 2020. Expected consumption trends are also analyzed. Results based on the analysis of qualitative data on expected consumption developments in the CES database indicate that in 2020 consumption perspectives were similar for households with different income levels, even if higher income families accumulated larger forced savings during this period. During 2021, once the phase of larger uncertainty about the economic and sanitary situation was overcome, higher income households also showed better consumption prospects. This suggests that savings accumulated during the pandemic may add greater momentum to the pick-up in consumption once the uncertainty about the epidemiological and economic situation abates. Likewise, individuals that have suffered a recent decline in hours worked (and, particularly, those that have run into unemployment) seem to be also more pessimistic about their labor situation perspectives, affecting their consumption expectations. This suggests that that the consolidation of the recovery of the labor market observed recently is likely to have a key role in explaining future consumption developments.","output":"Analysis of Labor Flows and Consumption in Spain during COVID-19 (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergency department (ED) is one of the crucial parts of the hospital infrastructure during all phases of the pandemic. The ED plays an important part in detecting an increasing number of new contagious diseases, which could potentially lead to an epidemic or pandemic.During a pandemic, the ED's main task is to detect infected individuals. These patients then need to be isolated and an adequate treatment is required. The ED must be prepared in order to perform well in such a situation. One major part for readiness is communication in an open manner to all partners within the department, as well as with emergency medical services and other departments of the hospital.The ED must be restructured to withstand the rising number of infected patients. These patients must be separated from other critically ill patients. Strategies for a diagnostic workup depending on the kind of infection have to be put in place. Pathways for the outpatient and inpatient management must be defined to avoid overcrowding in the ED. Depending on the number of patients, escalation and de-escalation strategies have to be set up within the hospital.Over the whole course of the pandemic, all staff members are the key resources for the ED and the entire hospital. The ED can only cope with a pandemic situation if staff are working together as a whole. This implies several important steps to get the staff prepared: Recurring, open conversations about fears, problems, and successes are critical for staff morale. Training must be continually provided, and protection strategies implemented. In the chronic phase of the pandemic the focus should shift more towards strategies on how to create possibilities for recuperation, domestic support measures, and mental health care for staff.","output":"[How can an emergency department be strengthened against a pandemic?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique challenges for evaluating general surgery residency applicants to MATCH 2021.

Dental aerosols and droplets contain oral microbes, and there is potential for infectious disease transmission and major disruption to dental services during infectious disease outbreaks. One method to control hazardous aerosols often used in industry is local exhaust ventilation (LEV). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of LEV on aerosols and droplets produced during dental procedures. Experiments were conducted on dental mannequins in an 825.4-m(3) open-plan clinic and a 49.3-m(3) single surgery. Ten-minute crown preparations were performed with an air-turbine handpiece in the open-plan clinic and 10-min full-mouth ultrasonic scaling in the single surgery. Fluorescein was added to instrument irrigation reservoirs as a tracer. In both settings, optical particle counters (OPCs) were used to measure aerosol particles between 0.3 and 10.0 m, and liquid cyclone air samplers were used to capture aerosolized fluorescein tracer. In addition, in the open-plan setting, fluorescein tracer was captured by passive settling onto filter papers in the environment. Tracer was quantified fluorometrically. An LEV device with high-efficiency particulate air filtration and a flow rate of 5,000 L/min was used. LEV reduced aerosol production from the air-turbine handpiece by 90% within 0.5 m, and this was 99% for the ultrasonic scaler. OPC particle counts were substantially reduced for both procedures and air-turbine settled droplet detection reduced by 95% within 0.5 m. The effect of LEV was substantially greater than suction alone for the air-turbine and was similar to the effect of suction for the ultrasonic scaler. LEV reduces aerosol and droplet contamination from dental procedures by at least 90% in the breathing zone of the operator, and it is therefore a valuable tool to reduce the dispersion of dental aerosols.","output":"Local Exhaust Ventilation to Control Dental Aerosols and Droplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated illness (illness requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation, or resulting in death) increases with increasing age as well as presence of underlying medical conditions that have shown strong and consistent evidence, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity (1-4).

Attempt was made to provide preliminary evidences for interaction of 35 phytochemicals from two plants (Phyllanthus amarus and Andrographis paniculata used in Ayurveda) with SARS-CoV-2 proteins (open & closed state S protein, 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp) through in silico docking analysis. The nucleotide analogue remdesivir, being used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2, was used as a positive control. The results revealed that 18 phytochemicals from P. amarus and 14 phytochemicals from A. paniculata shown binding energy affinity/dock score < ? 6.0 kcal/mol, which is considered as minimum threshold for any compound to be used for drug development. Phytochemicals used for docking studies in the current study from P. amarus and A. paniculata showed binding affinity up to ? 9.10 kcal/mol and ? 10.60 kcal/mol, respectively. There was no significant difference in the binding affinities of these compounds with closed and open state S protein. Further, flavonoids (astragalin, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and quercetin) and tannins (corilagin, furosin and geraniin) present in P. amarus have shown more binding affinity (up to ? 10.60 kcal/mol) than remdesivir (up to ? 9.50 kcal/mol).

We planned a prospective cohort study to determine the impact of ARI during infancy on the pulmonary function test indices at 3 years of age. METHODS: A cohort of normal, full-term newborns were followed up 6 monthly and during ARI episodes. Infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit using tidal breathing flow-volume loop, rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RTC) and raised volume RTC manoeuvres. During each ARI episode, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We screened 3421 neonates; 310 were enrolled; IPFT was performed in 225 (boys: 125 (55.6%)) at 3 years. During infancy, 470 ARI episodes were documented in 173 infants. At 3 years, children with history of any ARI episode during infancy had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1.0)), forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV(0.75)), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV(0.5)), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF(25C75)), and maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC (MEF(25)) as compared with those without any ARI episode during infancy. The ratio of tidal expiratory flow (TEF) at 25% or 50% of tidal expiratory volume to peak TEF (TEF(50) or TEF(25)/peak TEF) at 3 years was significantly increased in children who had ARI in infancy.

The second survey with three waves in June, July and September will address knowledge, attitudes, and compliance towards physical-distancing measures and physical, mental and social wellbeing. The mathematical network model will be developed for all-Ireland (on various levels of spatial granularity including the scale of counties and electoral divisions) based on outputs from both cross-sectional surveys and relevant publicly available data to inform decisions on optimal levels and duration of physical distancing measures. Discussion: This study will contribute to our understanding of the impact and sustainability of public health measures of the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings will have long-lasting benefits, informing decision-making on the best levels, and duration of physical-distancing measures, balancing a range of factors including capacity of the health service with the effects on individuals wellbeing and economic disruption. Findings will be shared with key policy-makers.","output":"Covid-19 Estimating the burden of symptomatic disease in the community and the impact of public health measures on physical, mental and social wellbeing: a study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was identified in December 2019. The symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnea, early symptom of sputum, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is the immediate treatment used for patients with severe cases of COVID-19. Herein, we describe two confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to explore the role of MSC in the treatment of COVID-19. MSC transplantation increases the immune indicators (including CD4 and lymphocytes) and decreases the inflammation indicators (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein). High-flow nasal cannula can be used as an initial support strategy for patients with ARDS. With MSC transplantation, the fraction of inspired O(2) (FiO(2)) of the two patients gradually decreased while the oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) and partial pressure of oxygen (PO(2)) improved. Additionally, the patients chest computed tomography showed that bilateral lung exudate lesions were adsorbed after MSC infusion.

The main problem is the subjectivity of the test. The MMT in the version of a break test depends on the testers force rise and the patients ability to resist the applied force. As a first step, the investigation of the reproducibility of the testers force profile is required for valid application. The study examined the force profiles of n = 29 testers (n = 9 experiences (Exp), n = 8 little experienced (LitExp), n = 12 beginners (Beg)). The testers performed 10 MMTs according to the test of hip flexors, but against a fixed leg to exclude the patients reaction. A handheld device recorded the temporal course of the applied force. The results show significant differences between Exp and Beg concerning the starting force (p(adj) = 0.029), the ratio of starting to maximum force (p(adj) = 0.005) and the normalized mean Euclidean distances between the 10 trials (p(adj) = 0.015). The slope is significantly higher in Exp vs. LitExp (p = 0.006) and Beg (p = 0.005). The results also indicate that experienced testers show inter-tester differences and partly even a low intra-tester reproducibility. This highlights the necessity of an objective MMT-assessment.

The region is characterized by a low contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) of 5.4%. Lack of awareness of contraceptive use, husband objection and religious barriers are attributed to low CPR in the region. This study assessed the effect of community-based interventions for promoting family planning (FP) use among pastoralist communities in Ethiopia. METHODS: The study design was a three-arm, parallel, clustered randomized controlled trial (CRT). The three study arms were: (1) male involvement in family planning (FP) education; (2) women's education on FP; and (3) control. A total of 33 clusters were randomized and allocated with a one-to-one ratio. Intervention components included (1) health education on FP to married women and men by faema leaders (a traditional community-based structure that serves as a social support group); (2) video-assisted message on FP; and (3) assisting the faema leader using health workers and health extension workers (HEWs). The intervention was given for a total of nine months. FP use and intentions were measured as outcome variables. In addition, a cluster-level summary considering a cluster effect analysis was performed. The result was presented with t.test, adjusted risks and its 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The proportion of FP use among the arms was 34% in the male involvement in FP education, 17.5% in women's education on FP and 4.3% in the control. There was a positive change in the proportion of FP use in the male involvement in FP education and women's education on FP arms with absolute risk (AR) of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.23,0.34) and 0.13 (95% CI,0.08,0.17), respectively, as compared to the control arm. Similarly, married women in the male involvement in FP education and women's education on FP arms had 3.4 (2.48, 4.91) and 2.1 (1.50, 2.95) higher intention to use FP, respectively, as compared with the control arm. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that in such male-dominated pastoralist communities with more considerable religious barriers, the community-based health education mainly targeting males appears to be a promising strategy for improving FP use and intention to use FP.

METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to June 2021 using the biomedical databases EBSCO Megafile Ultimate, Cochrane Library and EMBASE. Original research conducting comparative investigation of cutaneous microvascular reactivity in the foot of adults with diabetes and any pattern of acute or chronic Charcot neuroarthropathy and any non-Charcot adult control groups were included. A modified Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool was used for quality appraisal. Cutaneous microvascular reactivity in diabetes-related Charcot neuroarthropathy data were synthesised and meta-analysis conducted where possible. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 1,684 articles, with seven eligible for inclusion. Included studies used various methodologies and equipment to assess cutaneous microvascular reactivity in 553 participants (162 with Charcot neuroarthropathy). Cutaneous microvascular reactivity in Charcot neuroarthropathy groups was impaired compared to uncomplicated diabetes groups. Meta-analysis investigating the difference in response to thermal hyperaemia demonstrated a significant difference in cutaneous microvascular reactivity between Charcot neuroarthropathy and peripheral neuropathy with a large, pooled effect size (SMD 1.46 95% CI: 0.89-2.02) and low heterogeneity (I2 = 4%, T2 = 0.01) indicating that the cutaneous microvascular response is more impaired in peripheral neuropathy than in Charcot neuroarthropathy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients included were candidates for hepatic percutaneous RFA as they had single biopsy-proven hepatic tumors sized  1.5 cm and poorly defined on ultrasonography. Following apnea induction, unenhanced CBCT scans were acquired and used to deploy the RF electrode with the aid of a virtual navigation system. If the tumor was not clearly identified on the unenhanced CBCT scan, a right retrograde arterial femoral access was established to carry out hepatic angiography and localize the tumor. Patients' lesions and procedural variables were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Three patients (2 male and 1 female), aged 68, 76, and 87 years were included; 3 lesions (2 hepato-cellular carcinoma and 1 metastasis from colorectal cancer) were treated. One patient required hepatic angiography. Cycles of apnea used to acquire CBCT images and to deploy the electrode lasted <120 s. Mean fluoroscopic time needed to deploy the electrode was 36.6  5.7 min. Mean overall procedural time was 66.0  22.9 min. No peri- or post-procedural complications were noted. No cases of incomplete ablation were noted at 1-month follow-up.

Catheter ablation has been reported to restore left ventricular (LV) function but patients benefit differently. This study investigated the correlation between left atrial (LA) fibrosis extent and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) recovery after AF ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS In this study, 103 patients [64 years, 69% men, 79% persistent AF, LVEF 33% interquartile range (IQR) (25-38)] undergoing first time AF ablation were investigated. Identification of LA fibrosis and selection of ablation strategy were based on sinus rhythm voltage mapping. Continuous rhythm monitoring was used to assess ablation success. Improvement in post-ablation LVEF was measured as primary study endpoint. An absolute increase in post-ablation LVEF 10% was defined as 'Super Response'. Left atrial fibrosis was present in 38% of patients. After ablation LVEF increased by absolute 15% (IQR 6-25) (P < 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction improvement was higher in patients without LA fibrosis [15% (IQR 10-25) vs. 10% (IQR 0-20), P < 0.001]. An inverse correlation between LVEF improvement and the extent of LA fibrosis was found (R2 = 0.931). In multivariate analysis, the presence of LA fibrosis was the only independent predictor for failing LVEF improvement [odds ratio 7.2 (95% confidence interval 2.2-23.4), P < 0.001].

Under these conditions, microglia are able to secrete neurotoxic substances, provoking neuronal cell death. However, microglia in the healthy brain carry out CNS-supporting functions. This is due to the ability of microglia to acquire different phenotypes that can play a neuroprotective role under physiological conditions or a pro-inflammatory, damaging one during disease. Therefore, therapeutic strategies focus on the downregulation of these neuroinflammatory processes and try to re-activate the neuroprotective features of microglia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) of different origins have been shown to exert such effects, due to their immunomodulatory properties. In recent years, MSC derived from adipose tissue have been made the center of attention because of their easy availability and extraction methods. These cells induce a neuroprotective phenotype in microglia and downregulate neuroinflammation, resulting in an improvement of clinical symptoms in a variety of animal models for neurological pathologies, e.g., Alzheimers disease, traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke.

The research has focused on different patient populations, and identified common outcomes measures related to ventilation. At the crux of the new research is the decision to undergo an additional invasive procedure, mainly tracheostomy, rather than attempt endotracheal tube ventilation with or without early extubation. Notably, recent research indicates that neurological and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) patients seem to have an exaggerated benefit from early tracheostomy. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies of patients undergoing early tracheostomy have shown decreases in ventilator associated pneumonia, ventilator duration and duration of ICU stay. However, these studies have shown mixed data with respect to mortality and length of hospitalization. Such advantages only become apparent with large-scale examination. Confounding the overall discussion is that the research has focused on heterogeneous groups, including neurosurgical ICU patients, general ICU patients, and most recently, intubated COVID-19 patients. SUMMARY: Specific populations such as neurosurgical and COVID-19 patients have clearly defined benefits following early tracheostomy. Although the benefit is less pronounced, there does seem to be an advantage in general ICU patients with regards to ventilator-free days and lower incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects. OBJECTIVES To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE (https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm); and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non-randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short-term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses. Mefloquine efficacyOf 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short-term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%).In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline in non-immune, short-term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants). Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone-proguanil Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone-proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; high-certainty evidence). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone-proguanil (940 travellers).One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short-term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, moderate-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, moderate-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, moderate-certainty evidence), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, moderate-certainty evidence). The cohort studies in longer-term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (high-certainty evidence) and dizziness (high-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone-proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood. Mefloquine safety versus doxycyclineNo difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (low-certainty evidence) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; low-certainty evidence).Six cohort studies in longer-term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short-term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, very low-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, very low-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short-term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia.Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, low certainty-evidence), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, very low-certainty evidence), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, very low-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non-military participants, provided no conclusive findings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The absolute risk of malaria during short-term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil).The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once-weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood.","output":"Mefloquine for preventing malaria during travel to endemic areas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to assess the clinical course and risk factors for adverse outcomes, as well as the treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant recipient (RTR). Patients and methods: a retrospective study included 279 RTRs (M 60.9%, age 49.910.9 years), infected with SARS-CoV-2 from 01.04.2020 to 30.11.2020. After confirmation of COVID-19 by PCR and chest CT, MMF/Aza were canceled. In severe cases, the CNI dose was minimized while that of CS was increased. Observation endpoints: hospital discharge/recovery or death. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 84.2% of RTRs. In almost 90% of patients, the COVID-19 was confirmed by CT data. Duration after transplantation at the time of infection was 54.0 (14.0;108.0) months, in 17.6% of cases it was 6 months or less. 223/79.9% RTRs were treated in the hospital. The period from the onset of the disease to the hospitalization was 6.84.5 days. Severe lung damage (&gt;50%) occurred in 43.1% RTRs;45.3% of patients required respiratory support. Hospital mortality was 13.9%, overall mortality was 11.1%. The most common cause of death (93.5%) was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The risk factors associated with an unfavorable outcome were a high comorbidity index, the severity of the pulmonary lesion, the degree of graft dysfunction at the onset of the disease, decreased SpO2 and the use of mechanical ventilation, as well as anemia, leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, increased levels of creatinine, AST, CRP, LDH, and D-dimer, interleukin-6 and procalcitonin. Scr during the course of the disease increased from 171.678.0 M to 221.5121.3 M (p&lt;0.01) with no signs of acute rejection. In 2 recipients with severe graft failure at the time of infection with SARS-CoV-2, HD was resumed from the moment of hospitalization. We were unable to identify the effect of hydroxychloroquine on the outcome of COVID-19. At the same time, mortality in patients with hydroxychloroquine use was higher than in recipients treated with immunobiological drugs: 25.6% and 11.4%, respectively, p&lt;0.02. When immunomodulators were combined with dexamethasone, mortality decreased to 4.8%. The independent factors of adverse outcome were high levels of procalcitonin (p&lt;0.019) and mechanical ventilation (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: COVID-19 in RTRs is characterized by a severe course and high mortality, which necessitates hospitalization of the majority of infected patients. An increase in procalcitonin levels and the need for mechanical ventilation were independent predictors of an unfavorable outcome of COVID-19. ? 2021 JSC Vidal Rus.

Although AI represents extraordinary opportunities for businesses, companies must avoid the dangers and risks associated with the adoption of such systems. Integrating perspectives from emerging research on AI, morality of machines, and norm activation, we examine how individuals morally behave toward AI agents and self-service machines. Across three studies, we demonstrate that consumers moral concerns and behaviors differ when interacting with technologies versus humans. We show that moral intention (intention to report an error) is less likely to emerge for AI checkout and self-checkout machines compared with human checkout. In addition, moral intention decreases as people consider the machine less humanlike. We further document that the decline in morality is caused by less guilt displayed toward new technologies. The non-human nature of the interaction evokes a decreased feeling of guilt and ultimately reduces moral behavior. These findings offer insights into how technological developments influence consumer behaviors and provide guidance for businesses and retailers in understanding moral intentions related to the different types of interactions in a shopping environment.","output":"Artificial Intelligence and Declined Guilt: Retailing Morality Comparison Between Human and AI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, resulting in nearly three hundred thousand deaths distributed heterogeneously across countries. Estimating the infection fatality rate (IFR) has been elusive due to the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections and lack of testing capacity. We analyze global data to derive the IFR of COVID-19. Estimates of COVID-19 IFR in each country or locality differ due to variable sampling regimes, demographics, and healthcare resources. We present a novel statistical approach based on sampling effort and the reported case fatality rate of each country. The asymptote of this function gives the global IFR. Applying this asymptotic estimator to cumulative COVID-19 data from 139 countries reveals a global IFR of 1.04% (CI: 0.77%,1.38%). Deviation of countries' reported CFR from the estimator does not correlate with demography or per capita GDP, suggesting variation is due to differing testing regimes or reporting guidelines by country. Estimates of IFR through seroprevalence studies and point estimates from case studies or sub-sampled populations are limited by sample coverage and cannot inform a global IFR, as mortality is known to vary dramatically by age and treatment availability.

A total of 437 participants provided demographical data and were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Emotional Eating subscale of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Correlational analyses were performed to assess the relationship between continuous variables, while ANOVA was conducted to detect differences between males and females for emotional eating. To assess whether demographic and clinical data predicted emotional eating, hierarchical linear regression was performed. Then, a mediation analysis was conducted to assess whether emotional dysregulation was a mediator between psychological distress and emotional eating. Emotional eating was associated with psychological distress and emotional dysregulation. Moreover, higher levels of emotional eating were found in females than in males. Predictors of emotional eating were sex, psychological distress, and emotional dysregulation. Mediation analyses showed that the indirect effect of psychological distress on emotional eating through emotional dysregulation was significant (b = 0.0069;SE = 0.0024;CI = 0.0024C0.0118), confirming that the relationship between psychological distress and emotional eating was mediated by emotional dysregulation, controlling for sex.

Impaired innate and adaptive immunity observed in T1DM seem to play a major role. Severe, life-threatening COVID-19 disease is characterized by the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, known as a cytokine storm. Patients with T1DM present elevated levels of cytokines including interleukin-1a (IL), IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), suggesting the pre-existence of chronic inflammation, which, in turn, has been considered the major risk factor of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in many cohorts. Even more importantly, oxidative stress is a key player in COVID-19 pathogenesis and determines disease severity. It is well-known that extreme glucose excursions, the prominent feature of T1DM, are a potent mediator of oxidative stress through several pathways including the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the increased production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Additionally, chronic endothelial dysfunction and the hypercoagulant state observed in T1DM, in combination with the direct damage of endothelial cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may result in endothelial and microcirculation impairment, which contribute to the pathogenesis of acute respiratory syndrome and multi-organ failure. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in pancreatic b-cells permits the direct destruction of b-cells, which contributes to the development of new-onset diabetes and the induction of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with T1DM. Large clinical studies are required to clarify the exact pathways through which T1DM results in worse COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Oxidative Stress as a Major Pathophysiological Mechanism Linked to Adverse Clinical Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, global governing bodies prioritized transmissibility-based precautions and hospital capacity as the foundation for delay of elective procedures. As elective surgical volumes increased, convalescent COVID-19 patients faced increased postoperative morbidity and mortality and clinicians had limited evidence for stratifying individual risk in this population. Clear evidence now demonstrates that those recovering from COVID-19 have increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. These datain conjunction with the recent American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelinesoffer the evidence necessary to expand the early pandemic guidelines and guide the surgeons preoperative risk assessment. Here, we argue elective surgeries should still be delayed on a personalized basis to maximize postoperative outcomes. We outline a framework for stratifying the individual COVID-19 patients fitness for surgery based on the symptoms and severity of acute or convalescent COVID-19 illness, coagulopathy assessment, and acuity of the surgical procedure. Although the most common manifestation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is COVID-19 pneumonitis, every system in the body is potentially afflicted by an endotheliitis. This endothelial derangement most often manifests as a hypercoagulable state on admission with associated occult and symptomatic venous and arterial thromboembolisms. The delicate balance between hyper and hypocoagulable states is defined by the local immune-thrombotic crosstalk that results commonly in a hemostatic derangement known as fibrinolytic shutdown. In tandem, the hemostatic derangements that occur during acute COVID-19 infection affect not only the timing of surgical procedures, but also the incidence of postoperative hemostatic complications related to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC). Traditional methods of thromboprophylaxis and treatment of thromboses after surgery require a tailored approach guided by an understanding of the pathophysiologic underpinnings of the COVID-19 patient. Likewise, a prolonged period of risk for developing hemostatic complications following hospitalization due to COVID-19 has resulted in guidelines from differing societies that recommend varying periods of delay following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we propose the perioperative, personalized assessment of COVID-19 patients CAC using viscoelastic hemostatic assays and fluorescent microclot analysis.","output":"Immuno-Thrombotic Complications of COVID-19: Implications for Timing of Surgery and Anticoagulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS Little is known about the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among severely obese adolescents or factors that determine its development. We investigated the prevalence of NAFLD in a multicenter cohort of adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery and the factors associated with it. METHODS We enrolled 242 adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery between March 2007 and February 2012 at 5 tertiary care centers into a multicenter, prospective observational cohort study. Intraoperative core liver biopsies were collected from 165 subjects; 17 were excluded because of insufficient liver tissue or use of hepatotoxic medications, so 148 remained in the study (mean age, 16.8  1.6 years; median body mass index = 52 kg/m(2)). Liver tissues were analyzed by histology using validated criteria. Hepatic gene expression was analyzed in 67 samples. RESULTS NAFLD was present in 59% of this predominantly female (72%), white (68%), non-Hispanic (91%) cohort. Of subjects with NAFLD, 24% had borderline and 10% had definite nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Mild fibrosis (stage 2 or lower) was observed in 18% of liver biopsies and stage 3 was observed in 0.7%, but cirrhosis was not detected. Dyslipidemia was present in 78% of subjects, hypertension in 44%, and diabetes in 14%. More severe NAFLD was associated with increasing levels of alanine aminotransferase, fasting glucose level, hypertension (each P < .01), and white blood cell count (P = .04). Only diabetes was associated with detection of fibrosis (odds ratio = 3.56; 95% confidence interval: 1.93-6.56). Microarray analysis associated presence of NASH with altered expression of genes that regulate macrophage chemotaxis, cholesterol absorption, and fatty acid binding. CONCLUSIONS More than half of adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery in this cohort had NAFLD, yet the prevalence of severe or fibrotic NASH was low. Increasing severity of NAFLD was associated with level of alanine aminotransferase and cardiometabolic risk factors, but not body mass index. Based on gene expression analysis, borderline and definite NASH were associated with abnormal immune function, intestinal cholesterol absorption, and lipid metabolism.","output":"High Prevalence of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Adolescents Undergoing Bariatric Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ageing is a global concern with major social, health, and economic implications.

The impact of global warming and climate change on health involves an increase in respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and cognitive mental diseases. Furthermore, a change in the frequency and patterns of infectious diseases can also be observed in Europe. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This article presents the most important studies that investigated diseases associated with the climate change, with special reference to those that represent a challenge for intensive care medicine. RESULTS: Currently available epidemiological data and statistical extrapolations indicate that diseases resulting from the climate change (acute infection-related respiratory and intestinal diseases, exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary lesions, heat-related dehydration, cerebral insults and myocardial infarction) are relevant for intensive care medicine. Particular emphasis is placed on a significant increase in acute kidney damage during heat waves. A previously unknown pattern of infectious diseases necessitates new knowledge and targeted management. In some studies, persisting mental impairments were registered during heat waves and natural disasters, e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSION: Intensive care medicine must be prepared for the challenges due to global warming and climate change. Slow but continuous changes (e.g. rise in temperature) as well as acute changes (e.g. heat waves and natural disasters) will induce an increased need for intensive medical care services (e.g. an increase in the need for renal replacement procedures).

In May 2020, the adult UVA CF program redesigned the care model to adjust to the reopening of ambulatory operations and introduced hybrid clinics. The goal remained to minimize person-to-person contacts for patients and care team members (CTMs) while ensuring patient access to quarterly, coproduced, synchronous, multidisciplinary CF care, similar to pre-COVID-19 era regular CF care. Methods: Using quality improvement tools, the UVA adult CF program created a standardized hybrid model of care for in-clinic visits, which included combined components of in-person and synchronous virtual interactions with members of the multidisciplinary team. Results: A total of 16 hybrid visits occurred between May 14 and June 11, 2020. All hybrid visits were multidisciplinary and fulfilled patient requests to see CTMs. All patients seen by hybrid encounter participated in coproduced agenda setting, underwent spirometry, and obtained blood work; 75% provided sputum for surveillance culture. Each hybrid visit type was attended by an average of four CTMs and amounted to 63 separate interactions. Of these interactions, 28 were completed virtually, reducing in-person contacts and personal protection equipment utilization by 44% compared with a fully in-person model of care. Conclusions: Combining in-person and telehealth components in a multidisciplinary CF care model reduces patient and staff interactions and personal protective equipment utilization. The hybrid model of in-person/remote combined care enables reliable access to biological data to support medical decision making while mitigating the risks of person-to-person contact for patients and staff.","output":"Preserving Multidisciplinary Care Model and Patient Safety During Reopening of Ambulatory Cystic Fibrosis Clinic for Nonurgent Care: A Hybrid Telehealth Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Psychiatrists in clinical practice face a number of stressors related to patient care, such as overwork. On the other hand, they gain satisfaction from their work. We quantified and assessed the potential relationship between levels of occupational stress, satisfaction, and depressive symptoms among Japanese clinical psychiatrists. We surveyed 206 psychiatrists with up to 15 years of clinical experience who primarily worked in patient care. Levels of occupational stress and occupational satisfaction were measured using the Visual Analogue Scale and the level of depressive symptoms was measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Workplace stressors and satisfiers were also evaluated. RESULTS Out of 206 psychiatrists, 154 (74.8%) responded to the survey. The respondents' mean (SD) age was 34.3 (5.2) years. The estimated prevalence of significant depressive symptoms was 34.4% (n = 53), and the experienced frequent violence was 14.9% (n = 23). The level of depressive symptoms was inversely correlated with the level of occupational satisfaction. In respondents who reported a moderate level of occupational stress, having fewer depressive symptoms was associated with higher occupational satisfaction, but this association was not significant in those who reported a high level of stress. In addition, high occupational satisfaction was associated with interest towards work content, ability to work at one's discretion, opportunities for growth and career development, and ease of communication with supervisors and colleagues. CONCLUSIONS Nearly one-third of the psychiatrists screened positive for significant depressive symptoms. Having fewer depressive symptoms was associated with higher occupational satisfaction in those who reported a moderate level of stress. Implications from the present findings may be to enhance occupational satisfaction by discussing work interests with a supervisor, as well as increased opportunities for career development, which may prevent depression among psychiatrists.","output":"Mental health of Japanese psychiatrists: the relationship among level of occupational stress, satisfaction and depressive symptoms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to assess the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with VTE, to help develop preventive measures for venous thromboembolism (VTE in COVID-19) cases.

As the world has largely adapted to remote platforms for employment, socializing, and health service delivery, the degree to which virtual opportunities for social engagement may offset the impact of limited in-person interactions on mental health functioning is unknown. This column offers preliminary data from an ongoing experience sampling study of the prevalence, course, and impact of loneliness on mental health in a community adult sample living under social distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial findings aggregated across all experience sampling reports showed negative associations between virtual social contact (via text, phone, or videoconferencing) and feelings of loneliness, while in-person interactions appeared to have no impact on loneliness. In addition, respondents reported frequent instances of negative effects on physical and mental health, including disruptions in sleep and recurring suicidal ideation. While further analyses are needed, these findings are consistent with similar emerging reports showing increased rates of mental health concerns during periods of social distancing. Possible avenues for addressing these concerns using remote interventions are explored.","output":"COVID-19: Preliminary Data on the Impact of Social Distancing on Loneliness and Mental Health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the promising approaches to facilitate healing and regenerative capacity includes the application of growth-factor-loaded biomaterials. Human platelet lysate (hPL) derived from platelet-rich plasma through a freeze-thaw process has been used as a growth factor rich therapeutic in many regenerative applications. To provide sustained local delivery of the hPL-derived growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), the hPL can be loaded into biomaterials that do not degrade rapidly in vivo. Keratin (KSO), a strong filamentous protein found in human hair, when formulated as a hydrogel, is shown to sustain the release of drugs and promote wound healing. In the current study, we created a KSO biomaterial that spontaneously forms a hydrogel when rehydrated with hPL that is capable of controlled and sustained release of pro-regenerative molecules. Our study demonstrates that the release of hPL is controlled by changing the KSO hydrogel and hPL-loading concentrations, with hPL loading concentrations having a greater effect in changing release profiles. In addition, the 15% KSO concentration proved to form a stable hydrogel, and supported cell proliferation over 3 days without cytotoxic effects in vitro. The hPL-loaded keratin hydrogels show promise in potential applications for wound healing with the sustained release of pro-regenerative growth factors with easy tailoring of hydrogel properties.","output":"Characterization of a Human Platelet Lysate-Loaded Keratin Hydrogel for Wound Healing Applications In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-learning via electronic mail, the Internet, the Worldwide Web (WWW), and multimedia has emerged as a result of the convergence of digital technologies and growing interest in the computerized delivery of higher education.

Hydrodynamic injection (HI) of HBV in the mouse model is a useful tool for study of HBV replication in vivo. However, only HBV genotype A has been used for studies with HI. METHODS: We constructed 3 replication-competent clones containing 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 fold overlength of a HBV genotype B genome and tested them both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, A HBV genotype B clone based on the pAAV-MCS vector was constructed with the 1.3 fold HBV genome, resulting in the plasmid pAAV-HBV1.3(B) and tested by HI in C57BL/6 mice. Application of siRNA against HBx gene was tested in HBV genotype B HI mouse model. RESULTS: The 1.3 fold HBV clone showed higher replication and gene expression than the 1.1 and 1.2 fold HBV clones. Compared with pAAV-HBV1.2 (genotype A), the mice HI with pAAV-HBV1.3(B) showed higher HBsAg and HBeAg expression as well as HBV DNA replication level but a higher clearance rate. Application of two plasmids pSB-HBxi285 and pSR-HBxi285 expressing a small/short interfering RNA (siRNA) to the HBx gene in HBV genotype B HI mouse model, leading to an inhibition of HBV gene expression and replication. However, HBV gene expression may resume in some mice despite an initial delay, suggesting that transient suppression of HBV replication by siRNA may be insufficient to prevent viral spread, particularly if the gene silencing is not highly effective. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the HI mouse model with a HBV genotype B genome was successfully established and showed different characteristics in vivo compared with the genotype A genome. The effectiveness of gene silencing against HBx gene determines whether HBV replication may be sustainably inhibited by siRNA in vivo.","output":"Inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression and replication by HBx gene silencing in a hydrodynamic injection mouse model with a new clone of HBV genotype B"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cocrystallization has been used extensively to optimize the physicochemical properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), such as stability, dissolution, and bioavailability.

Here, we report the processes and findings of bronchoscopy in a patient with COVID-19 accompanied by respiratory failure. CASE SUMMARY: A 65-year-old male patient was admitted to the Hainan General Hospital on February 3, 2020 for fever and shortness of breath for 13 d that worsened for the last 2 d. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid test was positive. Routine blood examination on February 28 showed a white blood cell count of 11.02  10(9)/L, 86.9% of neutrophils, 6.4% of lymphocytes, absolute lymphocyte count of 0.71  10(9)/L, procalcitonin of 2.260 ng/mL, and C-reactive protein of 142.61 mg/L. Oxygen saturation was 46% at baseline and turned to 94% after ventilation. The patient underwent video bronchoscopy. The tracheal cartilage ring was clear, and no deformity was found in the lumen. The trachea and bilateral bronchi were patent, while the mucosa was with slight hyperemia; no neoplasm or ulcer was found. Moderate amounts of white gelatinous secretions were found in the dorsal segment of the left inferior lobe, and the bronchial lumen was patent after sputum aspiration. The right inferior lobe was found with hyperemia and mucosal erosion, with white gelatinous secretion attachment. The patients condition did not improve after the application of therapeutic bronchoscopy. CONCLUSION: For patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure, bronchoscopy can be performed under mechanical ventilation to clarify the airway conditions.

The research is focused on the case of wine in British Columbia (Canada). The methodology applied was based on a theoretical framework as a starting point for the study. From there, on the one hand, an analysis of the contents of the events carried out by the winegrowers of British Columbia during the harvest months in 2019 and 2020 has been carried out. On the other hand, interviews were conducted with relevant professionals and academics in the sector in order to determine the extent to which they meet the needs of promotion of the site, taking into account the impact on the sustainability of the territory. The results show the link between the events and the territory brand, which is a means to generate growth through wine tourism promoted by the wineries, thus revaluing the winegrowing landscape and, in general, the traditions of the place, among others. There is also a need to look for strategies that seek collaboration between the public and private sectors to improve the creation of integrated events that transmit the branding values of the place.

Its classically known role is to decrease surface tension in alveolar air spaces to a degree that facilitates adequate ventilation of the peripheral lung. More recently, other important surfactant functions have come into view. Probably most notable among these, surfactant has been demonstrated to enhance local pulmonary defense mechanisms and to modulate immune responses in the alveolar milieu. These findings have prompted interest in the role and the possible alterations of the surfactant system in a variety of lung diseases and in environmental impacts on the lung. However, only a limited number of studies investigating surfactant changes in human lung disease have hitherto been published. Preliminary results suggest that surfactant analyses, e.g., from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, may reveal quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of the surfactant system in human lung disorders.

Yet it is not clear what mechanisms can promote the participation in and compliance with such a commitment, especially when the former is costly and deviating from the latter is profitable. Prior work either considers regimented commitments where compensation is assumed enforceable from dishonest committers, or assume implicit commitments from every individual (so they are all in and thus being treated as such). Here we develop a theory of participation and compliance with respect to an explicit prior commitment under institutional incentives where individuals, at first, decide whether or not to join a cooperative agreement to play a one-shot social dilemma game. Using a mathematical model, we determine when participating in a costly commitment and complying with it, is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) when playing against all other possible strategies, and results in high levels of cooperation in the population. We show that, given a sufficient budget for providing incentives, reward of commitment compliant behaviours better promotes cooperation than punishment of non-compliant ones. Moreover, by sparing part of this budget for rewarding those who are willing to participate in a commitment, the overall frequency of cooperation can be significantly enhanced, for both reward and punishment.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of HCV-induced cell death and to determine the timing and relative contributions of apoptosis and pyroptosis during HCV infection. In a model employing a cell culture-adapted strain of JFH-1 HCV and Huh-7.5 hepatocyte-like cells, we found that pyroptosis occurred earlier than did apoptosis during infection. CRISPR knockout of NLRP3 resulted in decreased caspase-1 activation, but not complete elimination, indicating multiple sensors are likely involved in HCV-induced pyroptosis. Knockout of gasdermin-D resulted in increased activation of apoptosis-related caspase-3, suggesting potential crosstalk between the two cell death pathways. An unexpected decrease in activated caspase-1 levels was observed when caspase-3 was knocked out, implying that caspase-3 may have a role in the initiation of pyroptosis, at least in the context of HCV infection. Lower viral titres in culture fluids and increased ratios of intracellular to extracellular levels of infectious virus were observed in knockout versus wild-type Huh-7.5 cells, suggesting that HCV may induce programmed cell death in order to enhance virus release from infected cells.

This review focuses on identifying the outcomes of the recent studies related to the usage of video consulting in urology centers for hematuria referrals and follow-up appointments for a variety of illnesses, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), kidney stone disease (KSD), and urinary tract infections (UTIs) and found that they are highly acceptable and satisfied. Certain medical disorders can cause embarrassment, social exclusion, and also poor self-esteem, all of which can negatively impair health-related quality-of-life. Telemedicine has proven beneficial in such patients and is a reliable, cost-effective patient-care tool, and it has been successfully implemented in various healthcare settings and specialties.","output":"Telemedicine and Telehealth in UrologyWhat Do the Patients' Think About It?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals with preexisting psychological difficulties are at risk of further deterioration of their mental well\\\\being during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. This longitudinal study, conducted during the period between two national lockdowns, aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on veterans in the United Kingdom with preexisting mental health difficulties. Treatment\\\\seeking veterans with preexisting mental health difficulties (N = 95) were surveyed in two waves. Wave 1 was conducted at the end of the first lockdown (June 2020CJuly 2020), and Wave 2 took place during the second lockdown (November 2020). Participants completed measures to assess symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); common mental health difficulties (CMDs), including anxiety and depression; anger; and alcohol use. Initial analyses revealed no significant changes in symptoms of PTSD, CMDs, anger, or alcohol use between the lockdowns, ps = .247C.986. However, veterans who experienced more COVID\\\\19Crelated stressors were more likely to experience increases in PTSD, odds ratio (OR) = 6.30, p = .002, and CMD symptoms, OR = 4.32, p = .025. Participants with lower levels of social support during the second lockdown were more likely to experience increased anger difficulties, OR = 0.91, p = .025. The findings suggest that although mental health among veterans in the United Kingdom may have remained relatively stable between the two lockdowns, those who reported more COVID\\\\related stressors and lower levels of social support may have been particularly vulnerable to symptom exacerbation. Such findings hold important implications for tailoring support for veterans during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.","output":"The impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on treatment\\\\seeking veterans in the united kingdom with preexisting mental health difficulties: A longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The utilization of the prone position to treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are critically ill and mechanically ventilated is well documented. This case series reports the location, severity, and prevalence of focal peripheral nerve injuries involving the upper limb identified in an acute COVID-19 rehabilitation setting. The purpose of this study was to report observations and to explore the challenges in assessing these patients. METHODS: Participants were patients with suspected peripheral nerve injuries following discharge from COVID-19 critical care who were referred to the peripheral nerve injury multidisciplinary team. The patients studied had suspected peripheral nerve injuries following discharge from COVID-19 critical care and were referred to the peripheral nerve injury multidisciplinary team. Data were collected retrospectively on what peripheral neuropathies were observed, with reference to relevant investigation findings and proning history. RESULTS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, 256 patients were admitted to COVID-19 critical care of Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom. From March to June 2020, a total of 114 patients required prone ventilation. In this subgroup, a total of 15 patients were identified with clinical findings of peripheral nerve injuries within the upper limb. In total, 30 anatomical nerve injuries were recorded. The most commonly affected nerve was the ulnar nerve (12/30) followed by the cords of the brachial plexus (10/30). Neuropathic pain and muscle wasting were identified, signifying a high-grade nerve injury. CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve injuries may be associated with prone positioning on intensive care units, although other mechanisms, such as those of a neuroinflammatory nature, cannot be excluded. IMPACT: Proning-related upper limb peripheral nerve injuries are not discussed widely in the literature and may be an area of further consideration when critical care units review their proning protocols. Physical therapists treating these patients play a key part in the management of this group of patients by optimizing the positioning of patients during proning, making early identification of peripheral nerve injuries, providing rehabilitation interventions, and referring to specialist services if necessary.","output":"Brachial Plexus Neuropathies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Case Series of 15 Patients in Critical Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"gp350, the major envelope protein of Epstein-Barr-Virus, confers B-cell tropism to the virus by interacting with the B lineage marker CD21.

We demonstrate here the co-transfer of functional CD154 protein on tailored gp350+ exosomes to malignant B blasts from patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), rendering B blasts immunogenic to tumor-reactive autologous T cells. Intriguingly, engulfment of gp350+ exosomes by B-CLL cells and presentation of gp350-derived peptides also re-stimulated EBV-specific T cells and redirected the strong antiviral cellular immune response in patients to leukemic B cells. In essence, we show that gp350 alone confers B-cell tropism to exosomes and that these exosomes can be further engineered to simultaneously trigger virus- and tumor-specific immune responses. The simultaneous exploitation of gp350 as a tropism molecule for tailored exosomes and as a neo-antigen in malignant B cells provides a novel attractive strategy for immunotherapy of B-CLL and other B-cell malignancies.","output":"EBV-gp350 Confers B-Cell Tropism to Tailored Exosomes and Is a Neo-Antigen in Normal and Malignant B CellsA New Option for the Treatment of B-CLL"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is putting healthcare systems across the world under unprecedented and increasing pressure according to theWorld Health Organization (WHO). With the advances in computer algorithms and especially Artificial Intelligence, the detection of this type of virus in the early stages will help in fast recovery and help in releasing the pressure off healthcare systems. In this paper, a GAN with deep transfer learning for coronavirus detection in chest X-ray images is presented. The lack of datasets for COVID-19 especially in chest X-rays images is the main motivation of this scientific study. The main idea is to collect all the possible images for COVID-19 that exists until the writing of this research and use the GAN network to generate more images to help in the detection of this virus from the available X-rays images with the highest accuracy possible. The dataset used in this research was collected from different sources and it is available for researchers to download and use it. The number of images in the collected dataset is 307 images for four different types of classes. The classes are the COVID-19, normal, pneumonia bacterial, and pneumonia virus. Three deep transfer models are selected in this research for investigation. The models are the Alexnet, Googlenet, and Restnet18. Those models are selected for investigation through this research as it contains a small number of layers on their architectures, this will result in reducing the complexity, the consumed memory and the execution time for the proposed model. Three case scenarios are tested through the paper, the first scenario includes four classes from the dataset, while the second scenario includes 3 classes and the third scenario includes two classes. All the scenarios include the COVID-19 class as it is the main target of this research to be detected. In the first scenario, the Googlenet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 80.6% in testing accuracy. In the second scenario, the Alexnet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 85.2% in testing accuracy, while in the third scenario which includes two classes (COVID-19, and normal), Googlenet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 100% in testing accuracy and 99.9% in the validation accuracy.

Methods: This research has been prepared by descriptive analytical method and its data has been collected by documentary library tools. Results: What makes this relationship meaningful and suable is the existence of fault. By definition, fault refers to any deviation from the normal or conventional behavior. On this basis, a COVID-infected person is considered faulty if he or she does not care about public health and transmits the disease to others by avoiding safety measures and violating hygienic protocols. This lack of care for others is a concrete example of deviation from normal civil behavior. One cannot claim civility unless the safety measures prescribed by the law are taken. Violating the law in this case, which leads to disease transmission, is considered as a fault. Conclusion: If an infected person is incautious enough to make others sick, the law holds him or her faulty;the harm done by the undue lack of causation Based on this obvious causal relationship, the faulty individual is held responsible for the loss or damage compensation, as by incurring the treatment costs.The most important challenges in respect of covid are the non-recognition of certain transporter to the victim of covid 19 and proof of causation. ? 2022 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the lack of economic models for short-run policy relevant research to anticipate local impacts and design effective policy responses. The most direct effects of the pandemic and lockdown tended to be concentrated in urban areas;however, markets quickly transmitted impacts to rural areas as well as among poor and non-poor households. General equilibrium modeling is a tool of choice to capture indirect, spillover effects of exogenous shocks. This article describes an unusual micro general-equilibrium (GE) modeling approach that we developed to quickly simulate impacts of the pandemic and lockdowns on poor and non-poor rural and urban households across sub-Saharan Africa. Monte Carlo bootstrapping was used to construct four stylized regional GE models from 34 existing local economy-wide impact evaluation (LEWIE) models. Simulations revealed that the pandemic and policy responses to curtail its spread were likely to affect rural households at least as severely as urban households. Simulated income losses are greater in poor households in both urban and rural settings. These findings are relatively consistent across models spanning sub-Saharan Africa. Because COVID-19 impacts are so far-reaching, all types of economies experience downturns. Our research underlines the importance of modeling assumptions. We find total annualized impacts of around a 6-percent loss of GDP, smaller than estimates from single-country models that ignore price effects, such as SAM-multiplier models, but in line with The World Bank's baseline forecast of a 5.2% contraction in global GDP in 2020.

In order to evaluate the impact of paediatric COVID-19 among Italian paediatricians, we sent a 20-questions anonymous internet-based survey to 250 Italian paediatricians with particular address to allergic symptoms and those affecting the upper airways Methods: The questionnaire was conceived and pretested in April 2020, by a working group of experts of the Italian Paediatric Society for Allergy and Immunology (SIAIP), and structured into different sections of 20 categorized and multiple choice questions. The first part included questions about epidemiological data follows by a second part assessing the way to manage a suspected COVID-19 infection and personal experiences about that. The third part concerned questions about patients clinical characteristics and clinical manifestations.The survey was emailed once between April and mid-May 2020. Results: A total 99 participants had participated in our survey and provided responses to our electronic questionnaire. The distribution of patients reported per month varies significantly according to the geographical area (P=0.02). Data confirmed that in the North part of Italy the rate of patients referred is higher than in the rest of Italy. Almost all respondents (98%) reported caring for up to a maximum of 10 infected children and the last 2% more than twenty. Among these patients, according to the 75% of responders, a maximum rate of 20% were affected by allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and in particular in the North of Italy while in the Centre and in the South there was a higher incidence (P=0.09).

METHODS: A categorized and comprehensive search in the literature has been conducted by 10 April 2021 using international databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library in line with the PRISMA guidelines recommendations. PICO strategy was used to formulate the research question. The following terms were used: urology, COVID-19, coronavirus, BPH, inflammation, androgen receptors, LUTS, IPSS, PSA, and SARS-CoV-2 or a combination of them. Studies with irrelevant purposes and duplicates were excluded. The selected studies were performed on humans and published in English. RESULTS: The research revealed 89 articles. After title screening and considering exclusion criteria, 52 papers were included for the systematic review. BPH is a common condition affecting older men. SARS-CoV-2 infects the host cell by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A hyperactivated RAS system during infection with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and increased cytokine release. Thus, this virus can lead to exacerbation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and trigger inflammatory processes in the prostate gland. Since androgen receptors (AR) play an important role in the BPH pathophysiology and infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be androgen-mediated, BPH progression and its related symptoms can be a complication of COVID-19 through AR involvement and metabolic disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current findings, SARS-CoV-2 can possibly damage the prostate and worsen BPH and its related LUTS through ACE2 signaling, AR-related mechanisms, inflammation, and metabolic derangement. We encourage future studies to investigate the possible role of COVID-19 in the progression of BPH-related LUTS and examine the prostatic status in susceptible patients with relevant available questionnaires (e.g., IPSS) and serum biomarkers (e.g., PSA).","output":"Is COVID-19 a risk factor for progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia and exacerbation of its related symptoms?: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose In this paper, the authors present insights and findings drawn from the authors' experiences of containing a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in a large prison in northern Italy Within penitentiaries, close-quarter living is ripe terrain for outbreaks of disease among detainees and staff If left unchecked, these outbreaks can easily spill over the prison walls to threaten the general public Moreover, these risks are heightened by preexisting environmental conditions, especially overcrowding It is thus paramount to establish effective protocols for prevention, early detection and outbreak management The purpose of this article is to document a strategy that been at least partially successful in reducing the damage that could potentially be caused by a sustained SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within a correctional facility Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a retrospective analysis on patients' and health-care workers' medical records to obtain demographic and clinical information Descriptive data analysis was then carried out Findings In total, the authors tested 453 people with oropharyngeal swabs from March 15, 2020, to June 30, 2020 Of these people, 58 were positive and 395 were negative, with a prevalence of 12 8% Of the 453 patients, 60 were health workers: 24 tested positive for SARS-CoV2 ribonucleic acid (RNA);18 developed symptoms;and three needed hospitalization Among patients in detention, 34 resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA Two were hospitalized and later died Both had severe preexisting conditions;they were aged 76 and 59 years old, respectively Originality/value In this study, the authors describe the design and effective implementation of prevention and containment measures against SARS-CoV-2 within the walls of a correctional facility The authors describe how they rapidly created clean confinement sections to isolate cases in an environment designed for security at the expense of virus containment and how educational efforts have played a vital role in their strategy","output":"Locking out the virus: management of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in an Italian prison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We want students to have the experiences they expected to have here at the University of Arizona, even if they're having those experiences from afar,? said Kasey Urquidez, Vice President for Enrollment Management at the University of Arizona, describing how incoming students this school year attended virtual days at the university With a click, students signed up for virtual campus tours, academic information sessions with department faculty, conversations with student ambassadors, admissions counseling, and financial aid sessions Although COVID-19 halted the university's robust campus tour program, Urquidez said it was a priority to find ways for students to feel connected to the school community and campus culture","output":"Adaptability, online creativity can connect students to university community, no matter where they are"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, is spreading around the world.

Aerobic and anaerobic fitness were respectively evaluated by time for a 3000-meter run and numbers of 2-minute sit-ups and 2-minute push-ups. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with adjustments for age and sex was used to determine the relationship. RESULTS: The mean time (sec) for a 3000-meter run (standard error) under slight and great stress differed from that under normal stress in the normal weight (881.0 (11.0) and 877.9 (5.8) vs. 862.2 (1.7), p=0.089 and 0.0088, respectively) and in the obesity (928.1 (16.8) and 921.8 (10.7) vs. 895.2 (1.6), p=0.054 and 0.016, respectively), while the differences were not significant in the overweight (877.1 (12.7) and 877.5 (7.1) vs. 867.1 (2.1), both p >0.5).

OBJECTIVE: To assess how well informed consent documents of the COVID-19 vaccine trials achieve the ideal of being succinct and understandable, and to create a shorter, more readable document. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement study collected and analyzed the informed consent documents used in 4 COVID-19 vaccine phase III randomized clinical trials to quantitatively assess readability and length and, based on this analysis, created a measurably more accessible informed consent document. Analysis was conducted from October 2020 to January 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were number of words (measured as word count), time-to-read (measured at reading speeds of 175-300 words per minute), language complexity (measured using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level assessment), and readability (measured using Flesch Reading Ease Score). Secondary outcomes included clarity of how the placebo group could access the vaccine if it is proven safe and effective. The study also examined the length and readability of an improved consent document. RESULTS: The 4 informed consent documents were a mean (range) of 8333 (7821 to 9340) words long, with a mean (range) 35 (32.6 to 38.9) minutes to read at 240 words per minute. All documents exceeded grade 9 language complexity and scored lower than 60 in the formal reading ease metric, which constitutes difficult. Only 1 document specified that participants in the placebo group might receive vaccine. It was possible to write a document in fewer than 3000 words with a grade 7 to 8 reading level and a formal readability score that was not difficult.

The purpose of this study was to examine the implementation process and multilevel contextual factors as an evidence-based diabetes prevention program was implemented into two local community organization sites to inform future scale-up. To build the science of implementation, context and strategies must be identified and explored to understand their impact. METHODS: The program was a brief-counseling diet and exercise modification program for individuals at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A 1-year collaborative planning process with a local not-for-profit community organization co-developed an implementation plan to translate the program. A pragmatic epistemology guided this research. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff who delivered the program (n = 8), and a focus group was completed with implementation support staff (n = 5) at both community sites. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed using a template approach. The consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) is a well-researched multilevel implementation determinant framework and was used to guide the analysis of this study. Within the template approach, salient themes were first inductively identified, then identified themes were deductively linked to CFIR constructs. RESULTS: Implementation strategies used were appropriate, well-received, and promoted effective implementation. The implementation plan had an impact on multiple levels as several CFIR constructs were identified from all five domains of the framework: (a) process, (b) intervention characteristics, (c) outer setting, (d) inner setting, and (e) individual characteristics. Specifically, results revealed the collaborative 1-year planning process, program components and structure, level of support, and synergy between program and context were important factors in the implementation. CONCLUSION: This study offers insights into the process of implementing a community-based diabetes prevention program in two local sites.

Here we combined nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (nESI-MS) and acoustic levitation (AL) techniques to study the chlorination chemistry of three model lipids (DPPE, POPG, DOPG) mediated by HOCl at the air-water interface of levitated water droplet. For DPPE with no CC double bonds, HOCl was insensitive to the alkane chains, and showed considerable delay directing to head amino groups compared to that in aqueous environment. Chlorination chemistry, for POPG and DOPG with CC double bonds, preferentially reacted with double bonds of one chain. The mechanism was discussed in light of these observations, and it is concluded that the increased hydrophilicity of the chlorinated chain disturbed the lipid packing and attracted it toward the water phase. In addition, the reaction rate constant and reactive uptake coefficient suggested that the chlorination of lipids exposed to HOCl at the air-water interface is likely to occur rapidly. These results gain the knowledge of HOCl mediated lipid interface reaction at the molecule level, and would better understand the adverse health effects associated with elevated indoor pollutants.","output":"Hypochlorous acid initiated lipid chlorination at air-water interface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": We performed an observational prospective monocentric study in patients living with HIV (PLWH) diagnosed with COVID-19.

Among them, a UAV can be employed as a relay in a\\"store-carry and forward\\"fashion by uploading data from ground sensors and metering devices and, then, downloading it to a central unit. However, both the uploading and downloading phases can be prone to potential threats and attacks. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, the jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to UAV-aided communications, especially when also the jammer is mobile, e.g., it is mounted on a UAV or inside a terrestrial vehicle. In this paper, we investigate anti-jamming communications for UAV-aided WSNs operating over doubly-selective channels in the downloading phase. In such a scenario, the signals transmitted by the UAV and the malicious mobile jammer undergo both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by their mobility. To suppress high-power jamming signals, we propose a blind physical-layer technique that jointly detects the UAV and jammer symbols through serial disturbance cancellation based on symbol-level post-sorting of the detector output. Amplitudes, phases, time delays, and Doppler shifts - required to implement the proposed detection strategy - are blindly estimated from data through the use of algorithms that exploit the almost-cyclostationarity properties of the received signal and the detailed structure of multicarrier modulation format. Simulation results corroborate the anti-jamming capabilities of the proposed method, for different mobility scenarios of the jammer.","output":"Detection and blind channel estimation for UAV-aided wireless sensor networks in smart cities under mobile jamming attack"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inhalation of Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula causes farmer's lung disease, a classic example of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP).

During this WFH period, some employees encountered health issues related to sprains and neck or back pain owing to poor working conditions at home. As the WFH trend may continue over a prolonged period, the underlying causes and solutions to ergonomic issues must be addressed to reduce injuries. This study aims to identify the ergonomic issues encountered when working from home and suggests several solutions to minimise these issues. Methods: A qualitative ethnographic methodology was adopted. This study used focus group discussion and the panellists were among experts from the fields of higher education, healthcare, human resources (HR), and ergonomics patient in Malaysia. The most common ergonomic issues identified were based on diagnoses and observations in previous studies. Results: The panellists agreed on ergonomics issues, comprising the use of unergonomic chairs, incorrect sitting postures, irregular arrangement of key objects, improper reach distances of the laptop/keyboard/mouse, poor desk designs, footrest absence, distortion/noise, poor lighting, and poor work environment. Over time, WFH ergonomics issues may lead to burnout, carpal tunnel syndrome or other cumulative trauma disorders, high blood pressure, and stress on the cervical spine and neck. The proposed solutions include a complete WFH ergonomics and wellness checklist for employees and employers, webinar sessions on WFH ergonomics, meet-up sessions with ergonomics or HR experts, workspace rentals for co-workers, implementation of the 20-20-20 rule and job-sharing practices, and the involvement of employers or the government in procuring ergonomic equipment for WFH employees.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate the impact of the presence of RV injury on mortality in patients with ARDS. METHOD: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies investigating the association between RV injury and mortality. Two authors independently evaluated whether studies meet eligibility criteria and extracted the selected patients and studies characteristics and outcomes. RV injury was diagnosed by trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE), trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and PAC (pulmonary artery catheter) in the included studies. The primary outcome was the association between mortality and the presence of RV injury in patients with ARDS. The overall reported mortality was defined as either the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, in-hospital mortality, or mortality within 90days, and short-term mortality was defined as ICU-mortality, in-hospital mortality, or mortality within 30days. RESULTS: We included 9 studies (N=1861 patients) in this meta-analysis. RV injury that included RV dysfunction, RV dysfunction with hemodynamic compromise, RV failure, or acute cor-pulmonale was present in 21.0% (391/1,861). In the pooled meta-analysis, the presence of RV injury in patients with ARDS was associated with significantly higher overall mortality (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.131.86, p-value=0.003, I(2)=0%), as well as short-term mortality (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.141.93, p-value=0.003, I(2)=0%).

By using flow cytometry, here we observed the dynamic changes of peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients, with an attempt to explore their roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and their impacts on prognosis. Methods Eighty-nine COVID-19 patients were divided into a moderate group (n=70) and the severe/critical group (n=19) according to the disease severity. Furthermore, the severe/critical patients were divided into the improved group (n=14) and unimproved group (n=5) according to the outcomes. The absolute peripheral blood lymphocytes counts and subsets, including CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+, in the acute phase, and flow cytometry measured the recovery phase for all patients. Then, the results were compared with those in the normal control group. Results The absolute counts of lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and their subsets decreased during the acute phase in COVID-19 patients, especially in the severe/critical group. The T-lymphocyte count reached the lowest point on the 14th day in the severe/critical group. It rose with fluctuations to the normal level in the improved group as the immune function recovered; in the unimproved group, however, the T-lymphocyte count remained at a low level or even continued to decrease. The percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes showed no visible change in the improved group; however, the percentage of CD8+ T cells dropped in the unimproved group, resulting in higher CD4+/CD8+ ratio.

The presence of antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in convalescent donors was established at the first donation. Seropositive donors were asked to donate additional plasma units every six days. Until now, 15 donors have donated at least four times and, in some cases, up to nine times. This allowed us to perform a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in these repeat donors, with the first donation occurring 33-77 days after symptoms onset and donations up to 71-114 days after symptoms onset thereafter. In all donors, the level of antibodies remained relatively stable up to about 76 days after symptoms onset but then started to decrease more rapidly to reach, in some convalescent donors, a seronegative status within 100-110 days after symptoms onset. The decline in anti-RBD antibodies was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the numbers of days after symptoms onset (r = 0.821).

This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the impact of COVID-19 living conditions on infant and parent sleep, as well as infant screen exposure, parent daytime sleepiness, and parent depression levels, using multi-method assessment. METHODS: Infant and parent data collected in 2020 were compared with a matched cohort collected in 2019. The total sample included 1518 US infants aged 1C18 months (M = 8.5, SD = 4.6; 54% boys). Auto-videosomnography metrics were obtained from the 14-day period prior to survey completion (number of analyzed nights: M = 12.11 SD = 2.66 in the 2019 cohort; and M = 11.91 SD = 2.41 in the 2020 cohort). Parents completed online questionnaires regarding their infant's sleep and screen exposure, as well as their own sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and depression levels. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, infants in 2020 slept 40 min more per night on average, as indicated by auto-videosomnography. Infants additionally had earlier sleep timing, and increased parent-reported sleep-onset latency and nocturnal wakefulness. Infant screen time rose by 18.3 min per day for older infants, but remained stable for younger infants. Parents reported lower daytime sleepiness and higher depression symptomology during 2020, whereas no change was apparent in their sleep quality ratings.

Since December 2019, first human cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Wuhan (China) and rapidly has been progressed to a global pandemic declared by the world health organization (WHO) on March 11th 2020. The major complication of COVID-19, is pneumonia, but other presentations like cardiovascular and neurological complications have been reported. Herein, we report a first case of pregnant women presented with bifacial weakness and paraesthesia (BFP) associated to a vestibulocochlear neuritis as post-COVID-19 manifestation. This is a 36-year-old Moroccan female patient with a history of SARS-CoV-2 positive 6 weeks before admission. She presented to the emergency department with rapid bifacial paralysis, bilateral lower extremity paresthesia, vertigo, nausea, vomiting and right auricular pain. An acute stroke was ruled out after neurological examination and brain MRI. Clinical presentation, neurophysiological, audiometry and videonystagmography workup additionally to CSF findings were suggestive of a variant of Guillain Barr Syndrome (GBS), which is BFP associated to right vestibulocochlear neuritis. The patient was treated with Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) therapy associated with intravenous steroids. The patient made a complete recovery of the right facial palsy and the sensorineural hearing loss but still have tingling in lower limbs and left facial palsy at 2 weeks follow-up. BFP can be induced by COVID-19 as a postinfectious immune-mediated complication. Regarding the pathophysiology of vestibular neuritis, is probably similar to other viral infection causing nerve damage. Clinicians should consider the association of vestibulocochlear neuritis and BFP as a post SARS-CoV-2 manifestation.","output":"A unique association of bifacial weakness, paresthesia and vestibulocochlear neuritis as post-COVID-19 manifestation in pregnant women: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Survivors of COVID-19 pneumonia may have residual lung injury and poor physical and mental health even after discharge. We hypothesized that COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients needing mechanical ventilation may be at a greater risk of deterioration in pulmonary function, mental health, and quality of life (QOL). This study analyses the differences in pulmonary function, mental health, and QOL after recovery, in patients having received non-invasive oxygen therapy versus invasive mechanical ventilation during ICU stay. Methods Patients aged >18 years, who had completed 3 months post ICU discharge, with moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS, were consecutively enrolled from May 1 to July 31, 2021. Patients were allocated into Group A - having required high flow nasal cannula (HFNC)/non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and Group B - having received invasive mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary function tests, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), and health-related quality of life were compared. Results Of the 145 eligible patients, 31 were lost to follow-up and 21 died. Seventy-four patients were allocated into Groups A (57 patients) and B (17 patients). In Group A, abnormal forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow in mid-half of FVC (FEF(25-75)), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) values were obtained in 27 (47.37%), 43 (75.44%), 11 (19.3%), and 25 (43.86%) patients, and in Group B, in 13 (76.47%), 17 (100%), 1 (5.88%), and 8 (47%) patients, respectively. No patient had abnormal FEV(1)/FVC. All Group B patients had a restrictive pattern in spirometry as compared to 77% in Group A. Group B had a lower arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) (p=0.0019), % predicted FVC (p<0.0001), % predicted FEV(1) (p=0.001), and 6-MWT distance (p<0.001). The physical component score in the short-form survey 12 questionnaire was higher in group A, p<0.001, whereas the mental component score was comparable. Conclusions Patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) have a greater risk of impaired pulmonary function and reduced QOL post-ICU discharge. This warrants a greater need for following these patients for better rehabilitation.","output":"Pulmonary Function, Mental and Physical Health in Recovered COVID-19 Patients Requiring Invasive Versus Non-invasive Oxygen Therapy: A Prospective Follow-Up Study Post-ICU Discharge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 27 June 2020, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, gave the Ditchley Annual Lecture on the theme of the privilege of public service Although the fact that it took place in the context of the broader Coronavirus crisis meant that it received relatively little publicity or attention, the central argument of this article is that the lecture provides great insight into the ideas shaping government policy, in general, and into the inner mind of Dominic Cummings, in particular As such, we argue that although the lecture was given by Michael Gove, it was clearly floating ideas and themes that were taken, almost directly, from Dominic Cummings website We draw out and explore these themes and suggest that what they combine to offer is a dangerous blend of technocratic populism that is as intellectually splintered as it is politically na?ve ? 2020, Springer Nature Limited","output":"The privilege of public service and the dangers of populist technocracy: a response to Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings 2020 Ditchley annual lecture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) quickly spread worldwide as a once in a century pandemic in the form of a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

A total of 181 HPs (71% physicians) were recruited from Duke University Health Systems in Durham, North Carolina. Internal reliability of the Moral Injury Symptom Scale-Healthcare Professionals version (MISS-HP) was examined, along with factor analytic, discriminant, and convergent validity. A cutoff score was identified from a receiver operator curve (ROC) that best identified individuals with significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. The 10-item MISS-HP measures 10 theoretically grounded dimensions of MI assessing betrayal, guilt, shame, moral concerns, religious struggle, loss of religious/spiritual faith, loss of meaning/purpose, difficulty forgiving, loss of trust, and self-condemnation (score range 10C100). Internal reliability of the MISS-HP was 0.75. PCA identified three factors, which was confirmed by CFA, explaining 56.8% of the variance.

This study compares retinal toxicity and ocular survival between two formulations, with and without propylene glycol (Alkeran vs. Evomela, respectively). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of retinoblastoma patients who received intravitreal injections of Alkeran and Evomela at 30 g from September 2012 to January 2019 at a single tertiary care center were enrolled. Retinal toxicity was measured using electroretinogram (ERG) and compared using a multivariate analysis of 338 injections in 101 eyes of 96 patients. Ocular survival of 163 eyes in 150 patients was compared across formulations using Cox proportional hazards model. Eyes were censored at the time a patient received a dose other than 30 g. RESULTS: Overall, ERG decline (mean, 95% CI) for each injection was -5.58 V (-7.17, -3.99). No significant differences in ERG decrement were found between Alkeran (with alcohol) -5.52uV (-6.99, -4.05). and Evomela (without alcohol) -5.65uV (-8.31 to -2.98) formulations (p = 0.93). Ocular survival at 24 months was 93.6% (95% CI 86.2, 97.1) with alcohol and 91.7% (95% CI 53.9, 98.8) without alcohol. The hazard ratio (HR) for without vs with alcohol was 0.50 (95% CI 0.06 to 4.07); no significant difference in ocular survival was found between formulations (p = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No differences were found in retinal toxicity and ocular survival between 30 g intravitreal injections of Alkeran or Evomela for intraocular retinoblastoma. Given the increased stability of Evomela, intravitreal treatment could be expanded to centers without the ability to supply Alkeran due to its shorter safety window; however, Alkeran is less expensive.

METHODS A survey was disseminated to DBP clinicians through contact with international professional organizations to determine the use of telehealth in DBP care, before and since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics and 2 tests were used for analysis. RESULTS A total of 271 respondents from 38 countries completed the survey. The number of respondents offering telehealth increased from 36% to 88% after the pandemic, with the greatest shift to telehealth among high-income countries (HICs). Among respondents using telehealth, 75.1% were conducting interactive video visits, with HICs using more telehealth modalities embedded in electronic health records. Most patients (98.7%) were at home for the telehealth encounter. Almost half (46.5%) could not include an interpreter in telehealth visits. Barriers reported by telehealth users included concerns about limited patient access to technology (74.3%), home environment distractions (56.5%), preference for in-person care (53.6%), telehealth effectiveness (48.1%), workflow efficiency (42.2%), and cost/reimbursement (32.1%). CONCLUSION Global DBP clinicians rapidly adopted telehealth and continued to have interprofessional practice while doing so, with the largest adoption occurring in HICs. Provider concerns about effectiveness and patient access to technology emerged as key organizational and patient barriers, respectively.

Complex TLR mediated signaling affects vascular and cardiac function including tissue remodeling and repair. Being central components of both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, TLRs interact as pattern recognition receptors with a series of exogenous ligands and endogenous molecules or so-called danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are released upon tissue injury and cellular stress. Besides immune cells, a number of structural cells within the cardiovascular system, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes express TLRs and are able to release or sense DAMPs. Local activation of TLR-mediated signaling cascade induces cardiovascular tissue repair but in a presence of constant stimuli can overshoot and cause chronic inflammation and tissue damage. TLR accessory molecules are essential in guiding and dampening these responses toward an adequate reaction. Furthermore, accessory molecules assure specific and exclusive TLR-mediated signal transduction for distinct cells and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Although much has been learned about TLRs activation in cardiovascular remodeling, the exact role of TLR accessory molecules is not entirely understood. Deeper understanding of the role of TLR accessory molecules in cardiovascular system may open therapeutic avenues aiming at manipulation of inflammatory response in cardiovascular disease. The present review outlines accessory molecules for membrane TLRs that are involved in cardiovascular disease progression. We first summarize the up-to-date knowledge on TLR signaling focusing on membrane TLRs and their ligands that play a key role in cardiovascular system. We then survey the current evidence of the contribution of TLRs accessory molecules in vascular and cardiac remodeling including myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, atherosclerosis, vein graft disease and arterio-venous fistula failure.","output":"The Intriguing Role of TLR Accessory Molecules in Cardiovascular Health and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An Israeli national taskforce performed a multi-center clinical and analytical validation of seven serology assays to determine their utility and limitations for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. METHODS: Serology assays from Roche, Abbott, Diasorin, BioMerieux, Beckman-Coulter, Siemens, and Mt.-Sinai ELISA were included. Negative samples from 2391 individuals representative of the Israeli population, and 698 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients, collected between March and May 2020, were analyzed FINDINGS: Immunoassays sensitivities between 81.5%-89.4% and specificities between 97.7%-100% resulted in a profound impact on the expected Positive Predictive Value (PPV) in low (<15%) prevalence scenarios. No meaningful increase was detected in the false positive rate in children compared to adults. A positive correlation between disease severity and antibody titers, and no decrease in antibody titers in the first 8 weeks after PCR positivity was observed. We identified a subgroup of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (~5% of patients), who remained seronegative across a wide range of antigens, isotypes, and technologies. INTERPRETATION: wThe commercially available automated immunoassays exhibit significant differences in performance and expected PPV in low prevalence scenarios. The low false-positivity rate in under 20s suggests that cross-reactive immunity from previous CoV strains is unlikely to explain the milder disease course in children. Finding no decrease in antibody titers in the first 8 weeks is in contrast to some reports of short half-life for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

PLWD are at greater risk of poor outcomes during and following hospital admission. Compared to those without dementia, they are almost twice as likely to die in hospital and two to three times more likely to experience an adverse event. Although some hospitalizations are clinically necessary, there may be a proportion related to ACSC that could be potentially avoided with additional support and education for PLWD and their carers. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of interventions focused on reducing avoidable hospitalization for PLWD by supporting carers to manage the health care needs of the PLWD, via improved awareness and understanding of health and the healthcare system. METHOD Scientific and gray literature will be searched using a combination of keywords pertaining to dementia, caregivers, education, and support. Included studies will involve community-dwelling PLWD and caregivers, with interventions aimed at improving carer's understanding of the healthcare system and ability to manage the caregiving role.

Results The results showed that the incidence of COVID-19 was consistent with the characteristics of the elderly, and patients with hypertension, diabetes, stroke, hypoalbuminemia and anemia were at increased risk of critical illness ( p < 0.05). The analysis of antibodies results showed that there were no significant difference in antibodies concentration between COVID-19 patients of different ages. While there were no significant difference in antibodies concentration between mild and severe patients, the expression levels of serum IgM and IgG in critically ill patients decreased ( p = 0.000 and 0.013), and high IgM and IgG concentration could reduce the incidence of critical illness ( p = 0.003 and 0.015).

GC B cells exit cell cycle a number of hours before entering LZs; therefore, continued participation in responses requires that they subsequently reenter cell cycle and move back to DZs, a process known as cyclic reentry. Affinity enhancements are thought to arise by B cells having to compete to initiate cyclic reentry each time they enter LZs, with T cell help being a major determinant; however, direct proof is lacking. Using Fucci2 mice, we confirmed an association between B cell receptor affinity and the first step of cyclic reentry, S phase initiation from a resting LZ state. However, neither T cell ablation nor MHCII deletion prevented resting LZ cells from reentering cell cycle, and this late G1-S transition was also not detectably restricted by competition. In contrast, using BATF induction as exemplar, we found that T cells \\"refueled\\" LZ cells in an affinity-dependent manner that was limited by both competition and cells' intrinsic antigen-acquiring abilities. Therefore, cyclic reentry initiation and B cell refueling are independently regulated in GCs, which may contribute to permitting cells of different competencies to be sustained alongside each other and allow T cell support to be provided across a dynamic range commensurate with affinity. We speculate that this less binary selection mechanism could help GCs nurture complex antibody maturation pathways and support the clonal diversity required for countering fast-evolving pathogens.","output":"Competition for refueling rather than cyclic reentry initiation evident in germinal centers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Origanum syriacum (O. syriacum) (L.) belongs to Group B of the genus Origanum from (Lamiaceae), which is rich in essential oils that exhibit antimicrobial efficacy, anti-inflammatory efficacy, antioxidant activity, and antitumor efficacy.

METHODS: The authors queried three biomedical databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) and two preprint servers (MedRxiv and SSRN) to identify literature pertaining to preprints. Additionally, they evaluated 12 preprint servers featuring COVID-19 research through sample submission of six manuscripts. RESULTS: The realm of health sciences research has seen a dramatic increase in the presence and importance of preprint publications. By posting manuscripts on preprint servers, researchers are able to immediately communicate their findings, thereby facilitating prompt feedback and promoting collaboration. In doing so, they may also reduce publication bias and improve methodological transparency. However, by circumventing the peer-review process, academia incurs the risk of disseminating erroneous or misinterpreted data and suffering the downstream consequences. Never have these issues been better highlighted than during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers have flooded the literature with preprint publications as stopgaps to meet the desperate need for knowledge about the disease. These unreviewed articles initially outnumbered those published in conventional journals and helped steer the mainstream scientific community at the start of the pandemic. In surveying select preprint servers, the authors discovered varying usability, review practices, and acceptance polices.

Additionally, since the infection rate was unknown at the beginning, this research aims to propose a multiple sampling approach that enables the pool testing method to be utilized successfully. Design/methodology/approach: The authors verify that the pool testing method of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19 is effective under the situation of the shortage of nucleic acid detection kits based on probabilistic modeling. In this method, the testing is performed on several samples of the cases together as a bunch. If the test result of the bunch is negative, then it is shown that none of the cases in the bunch has been infected with the novel coronavirus. On the contrary, if the test result of the bunch is positive, then the samples are tested one by one to confirm which cases are infected. Findings: If the infection rate is extremely low, while the same number of detection kits is used, the expected number of cases that can be tested by the pool testing method is far more than that by the one-by-one testing method. The pool testing method is effective only when the infection rate is less than 0.3078. The higher the infection rate, the smaller the optimal sample size in one bunch. If N samples are tested by the pool testing method, while the sample size in one bunch is G, the number of detection kits required is in the interval (N/G, N). Originality/value: This research proves that the pool testing method is not only suitable for the situation of the shortage of detection kits but also the situation of the overall or sampling detection for a large population. More importantly, it calculates the optimal sample size in one bunch corresponding to different infection rates. Additionally, a multiple sampling approach is proposed. In this approach, the whole testing process is divided into several rounds in which the sample sizes in one bunch are different. The actual infection rate is estimated gradually precisely by sampling inspection in each round. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Effectiveness and policies analysis of pool testing method for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the whole world is currently observing the global battle against COVID-19, it should not be underestimated that in the next 30 years, approximately 10 million people per year could be exposed to infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria.

Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) uses light and a dye termed a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the field of illumination that eventually kill microorganisms. Over the past few years, hundreds of photomaterials have been investigated, seeking ideal strategies based either on single molecules (e.g., tetrapyrroles, metal complexes) or in combination with various delivery systems. The present work describes some of the most recent advances of PDI, focusing on the design of suitable photosensitizers, their formulations, and their potential to inactivate bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Particular attention is focused on the compounds and materials developed in our laboratories that are capable of killing in the exponential growth phase (up to seven logarithmic units) of bacteria without loss of efficacy or resistance, while being completely safe for human cells. Prospectively, PDI using these photomaterials could potentially cure infected wounds and oral infections caused by various multidrug-resistant bacteria. It is also possible to treat the surfaces of medical equipment with the materials described, in order to disinfect them with light, and reduce the risk of nosocomial infections.","output":"Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) as a promising alternative to current pharmaceuticals for the treatment of resistant microorganisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited data are available for pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2.

We explored interactions between race, BMI, and the risk of hyperfiltration associated with obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG). METHODS We created a cohort of female adolescents from electronic health records. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated in two ways: (A) using standard age recommended formulae and (B) absolute eGFR - adjusted to individual body surface area (BSA). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the contribution of risk factors for ORG-associated hyperfiltration defined as 135 mL/min/1.73 m2 or 135 mL/min, according to BMI group. Pearson's coefficient was used to assess correlation with creatinine clearance (CrCl). RESULTS The final cohort included 7,315 African American and 15,102 non-African American adolescent females, with CrCl available for internal validation in 207 non-African American and 107 African American individuals. Compared with non-African American ethnicity, African American ethnicity was independently associated with a lower risk of hyperfiltration with standard eGFR calculations (odds ratio [OR] = 0.57, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.45-0.71), associations were enhanced for absolute eGFR (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95). Absolute eGFR values agreed better with CrCl (r = 0.63), compared to standard indexed eGFR formulae. Proportions classified as hyperfiltration changed with standard versus absolute eGFR; they were similar across BMI groups with the first and reflected obesity with the later. CONCLUSION Adjusting to individual BSA improves estimation of GFR and identification of obesity-related hyperfiltration.

METHODS The study included 1321 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-year students (full-time bachelor degree course) of Physical Education, Physiotherapy, Pedagogy as well as Tourism and Recreation from 4 universities in Poland. A questionnaire prepared by the authors was applied as a research tool. The 10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain intensity. Prior to the study, the reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by conducting it on the group of 20 participants twice with a shorter interval. No significant differences between the results obtained in the two surveys were revealed (p < 0.05).

For example, some individual genes or operons can be affected by specific horizontal gene transfer and recombination events. Thus, the evolutionary history of each gene should be represented by its own phylogenetic tree which may display different evolutionary patterns from the species tree that accounts for the main patterns of vertical descent. The output of traditional consensus tree or supertree inference methods is a unique consensus tree or supertree. Here, we describe a new efficient method for inferring multiple alternative consensus trees and supertrees to best represent the most important evolutionary patterns of a given set of phylogenetic trees (i.e. additive trees or X-trees). We show how a specific version of the popular k-means clustering algorithm, based on some interesting properties of the Robinson and Foulds topological distance, can be used to partition a given set of trees into one (when the data are homogeneous) or multiple (when the data are heterogeneous) cluster(s) of trees. We adapt the popular Caliski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Ball and Hall, and Gap cluster validity indices to tree clustering with k-means. A special attention is paid to the relevant but very challenging problem of inferring alternative supertrees, built from phylogenies constructed for different, but mutually overlapping, sets of taxa. The use of the Euclidean approximation in the objective function of the method makes it faster than the existing tree clustering techniques, and thus perfectly suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets. In this study, we apply it to discover alternative supertrees characterizing the main patterns of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the related betacoronaviruses.","output":"Building alternative consensus trees and supertrees using k-means and Robinson and Foulds distance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Little detailed sociodemographic information is available about how alcohol use and associated health care visits have changed during COVID-19. Therefore, we assessed how rates of emergency department (ED) visits due to alcohol have changed during COVID-19 by age and sex and for individuals living in urban and rural settings and low and high-income neighborhoods. METHODS Our cohort included 13,660,516 unique Ontario residents between the ages of 10-105. We compared rates and characteristics of ED visits due to alcohol, identified using ICD-10 codes, from March 11-August 31 2020 to the same period in the prior 3 years. We used negative binomial regressions to examine to examine changes is visits during COVID-19 after accounting for temporal and seasonal trends. RESULTS During COVID-19, the average monthly rate of ED visits due to alcohol decreased by 17.2 % (95 % CI -22.7, -11.3) from 50.5-40.9 visits per 100,000 individuals. In contrast, the proportion of all-cause ED visits due to alcohol increased by 11.4 % (95 % CI 7.7, 15.3) from 15.0 visits to 16.3 visits per 1000 all cause ED visits. Changes in ED visits due to alcohol were similar for men in women. Decreases in visits were larger for younger adults compared to older adults and pre-COVID-19 disparities in rates of ED visits due to alcohol between urban and rural settings and low and high-income neighborhoods widened. ED visits related to harms from acute intoxication showed the largest declines during COVID-19, particularly in younger adults and urban and high-income neighborhoods. CONCLUSION ED visits due to alcohol decreased during the first six months of COVID-19, but to a lesser extent than decreases in all-cause ED visits.

Thus, we aimed to investigate associations of VITD status to disease presentation within the CovILD registry. This prospective, multicenter, observational study on long-term sequelae includes patients with COVID-19 after hospitalization or outpatients with persistent symptoms. Eight weeks after PCR confirmed diagnosis, a detailed questionnaire, a clinical examination, and laboratory testing, including VITD status, were evaluated. Furthermore, available laboratory specimens close to hospital admission were used to retrospectively analyze 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at disease onset. A total of 109 patients were included in the analysis (60% males, 40% females), aged 58  14 years. Eight weeks after the onset of COVID-19, a high proportion of patients presented with impaired VITD metabolism and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. PTH concentrations were increased in patients who needed intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, while VITD levels were not significantly different between disease severity groups. Low VITD levels at disease onset or at eight-week follow-up were not related to persistent symptom burden, lung function impairment, ongoing inflammation, or more severe CT abnormalities.

Recently, immunotherapy has achieved favorable effectiveness in the management of multiple cancers. However, there are limited therapeutic options for advanced HC. As the liver is a special immune organ, we intend to uncover potential and effective immunotherapeutic modalities for HC. Our study was designed to develop specific immune-related miRNAs (IRMs) for outcome assessment and individualized strategies for the management of HC. Methods: The miRNA-seq and survival data of TCGA-LIHC dataset was enrolled into this program. We first collected IRMs from Immune-miR website. Differentially expression analysis was applied to screen aberrantly expressed IRMs. In order to set up an IRM-related index (IRMRI) in HC, we conducted the Cox relevant methods. Next, the statistical approaches (survival curve and ROC curve analyses) were utilized to detect the evaluation capacity of our IRMRI. Subsequently, we obtained the target genes of hub miRNAs from IRMRI through three miRNA-related predictive online tools (miRDB, miRTarBase, and TargetScan websites). Results: Five IRMs were determined to develop the IRMRI. It can effectively segregate all HC cases from two different risk subgroups. We identified a marked discrepancy in survival outcome between the two groups by survival analysis and confirmed the reliability of IRMRI in two testing sets. Moreover, we collected 10 hub target genes (ESR1, IGF1, PDGFRB, JUN, MYC, ZWINT, MAD2L1, TOP2A, KIF11, and CDCA8) which were strongly linked to HC progression and malignant behavior. Conclusion: We screened out five hub IRMs with clinical value and constructed a risk index model in HC, which can precisely assess the risk status and outcome of patients to a certain extent.","output":"Development an Immune-Related MicroRNA Risk Index in Hepatocellular Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Fundamento: la lnea de ayuda telefnica es una tcnica y estrategia valiosa para enfrentar problemas de salud, servicio que requiere de una gua prctica psicolgica con orientaciones que apoyen la actuacin frente a una persona que solicita ayuda Objetivo: dise?ar una gua de prcticas psicolgicas para conducir a los psiclogos que prestan ayuda en la lnea CONVIDA Mtodos: investigacin en Sistemas y Servicios de Salud, en modalidad de investigacin aplicada, desarrollada por el Departamento de Psicologa de la Facultad de Ciencias Mdicas de Cienfuegos, durante la segunda quincena de abril a primera semana de mayo 2020 Se emplearon mtodos del nivel terico y emprico (anlisis de contenido y la ponderacin) En un primer momento se realiz revisin de los documentos emitidos por el MINSAP y en segundo momento se reunieron los especialistas (tres) que laboran en la lnea confidencial, a la vez que se consultaron siete psiclogos del Departamento de Psicologa, con experiencia en orientacin psicolgica Resultados: se integraron varios componentes organizados en cuatro fases de la gua: comienzo, recoleccin de la informacin, intervencin y cierre, de utilidad para los psiclogos que atienden la lnea telefnica CONVIDA Las contribuciones de mayor importancia fueron, la determinacin de los componentes, la concepcin sobre la estructura de la gua y la seleccin de las tcnicas de influencia psicolgica Conclusiones: se presenta una gua de prcticas psicolgicas para los profesionales que estn prestando el servicio de ayuda psicolgica telefnica a las personas que lo solicitan, en medio de la pandemia de la COVIC 19 ABSTRACT Foundation: telephone helpline is a valuable technique and strategy to face health problems, a service that requires a practical psychological guide with guidelines that support action in front of a person requesting help Objective: to design a psychological practice guide to orient psychologists who provide help on the CONVIDA line Methods: research in Health Systems and Services, in applied research modality, developed by the Psychology Department of the Faculty of Medical Sciences of Cienfuegos, from the second half of April to the first week of May 2020 Methods of the theoretical and empirical levels were used (content analysis and weighting) At first, it was carried out a review of the documents issued by MINSAP, and second, specialists (three) working in the confidential line met, and seven psychologists from the Department of Psychology, with experience in psychological counseling, were consulted Results: Several components organized into four phases of the guide were integrated: beginning, information collection, intervention and closure, useful for psychologists who attend the CONVIDA telephone line The most important contributions were: components determination, conception on the guide structure and selection of psychological influence Conclusions: a guide for psychological practice is presented for professionals who are providing telephone psychological help to people who request it, in the midst of the COVIC pandemic 19","output":"CONVIDA line.

This investigation was conducted during the period of a COVID pandemic lockdown in Portugal. We explored whether parental support, provided during the lockdown period, was associated with their child?s achievement as reported by their instrumental music teacher. For this study, 39 parent?teacher dyads of first-grade students of an instrument music course were recruited from two public music conservatories. Parents supplied information on the frequency in which they provided student-support-related attitudes and actions in the home context. Simultaneously, teachers provided information about the student?s achievement during the lockdown compared with the previous in-person performance period.

Cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (cellular nanosponges) mimic the host cells to attract and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 through natural cellular receptors, leading to a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy. Herein, we show that increasing surface heparin density on the cellular nanosponges can promote their inhibition against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, cellular nanosponges are made with azido-expressing host cell membranes followed by conjugating heparin to the nanosponge surfaces. Cellular nanosponges with a higher heparin density have a larger binding capacity with viral S proteins and a significantly higher inhibition efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Overall, surface glycan engineering of host-mimicking cellular nanosponges is a facile method to enhance SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.

Importantly, the engrafted Monolayers increased local cell density, something that the clinical-standard single cells in suspension failed to do. These results show that shrink-wrapping cells in ECM dramatically improves engraftment and provides a potential alternative to cornea transplant when low endothelial cell density is the cause of corneal blindness.

This paper analyzes COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes during the first wave of the pandemic in the United States during the spring and early summer 2020. By combining data on facility-level COVID-19 deaths during this period with data on the neighborhoods where nursing home staff reside for a sample of eighteen states, this paper finds that staff neighborhood characteristics were a large and significant predictor of COVID-19 nursing home deaths. Even after controlling for the county where a facility is located, one standard deviation increases in average staff neighborhood (Census tract) population density, public transportation use, and non-white share were associated with 1.3 (p < .001), 1.4 (p < .001), and 0.9 (p < .001) additional deaths per 100 beds, respectively. These effects are larger than all facility management or quality variables, and larger than the effect of the nursing homes own neighborhood characteristics. These results suggest COVID-19 outbreaks in staff communities can have large consequences for the facilities where they work, even in highly-rated facilities, and that disparities in nursing home outbreaks may be related to differences in the types of neighborhoods nursing home staff live in.","output":"Relationship between nursing home COVID-19 outbreaks and staff neighborhood characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence has recently been one of the most commonly discussed topics of discussion in the world.

Learning from failure is important to reach effective quality performance in construction projects. This will, in turn, contribute to the development of the construction industry and the country as a whole. Although quality is an important criterion in project management success, it receives less attention than cost and time in project management literature. Moreover, critical success factors (CSFs) are identified more often than critical failure factors (CFFs) in construction literature. Hence, there is still a lack of attention on critical failure factors affecting quality performance in construction projects. The construction industry is full of uncertainties, especially in the current era of COVID-19 Pandemic. This adds to the necessity of studying critical failure factors in the construction industry. This study aims to identify the critical factors that have an adverse effect on quality performance in construction projects, address their relative importance, and suggest ways to attain good quality performance in construction projects. Based on the literature review, an initial list of failure attributes of quality performance in construction projects was prepared. Then it was refined based on suggestions from experienced professionals in the construction industry in the Jordanian context. A questionnaire was distributed to experts in the construction industry. The responses were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The analyses used here are factor analysis and tests of its appropriateness.

Effect of artesunate on sepsis-induced immunosuppression was investigated in mice and in vitro. VDR was predicted to be an interacted candidate of AS by bioinformatics predict, then identified using PCR and immunoblotting. VDR, ATG16L1 and NF-B p65 were modified to investigate the alteration of ASs effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines release, bacteria clearance and autophagy activities in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. AS significantly reduced the mortality of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis immunosuppression mice challenged with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and enhanced proinflammatory cytokines release and bacterial clearance to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, AS interacted with VDR thereby inhibited the nuclear translocation of VDR, then influencing ATG16L1 transcription and subsequent autophagy activity. In addition, AS inhibited physical interaction between VDR and NF-B p65 in LPS tolerance macrophages, then promoted nuclear translocation of NF-B p65, which activated the transcription of NF-B p65 target genes such as pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In this paper, we discuss the general perspectives, potential research opportunities, and challenges arising in the area of robots in assisted living environments and present our research work pertaining to certain application scenarios, i.e., robots in rehabilitation and robots in hospital environments and pandemics, which, in turn, exhibits the growing prospects and interdisciplinary nature of the field of robots in assisted living environment.","output":"Prospects of Robots in Assisted Living Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Educational institutions worldwide had to shift the teaching delivery mode from face to face to online teaching during COVID-19. Most of the universities in Vietnam were based on face to face learning until the sudden outbreak of COVID-19. This research study was conducted with 145 respondents and Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used for data analysis. The participants were undergraduate and post-graduate students in public and private universities who studied online during the pandemic in Vietnam. The purpose of this study was to understand what factors have an impact on students' intentions to study online. The results show that institutional support and perceived enjoyment (satisfaction) affects the students' intentions to study the course online in the future. Perceived enjoyment (PE) affects the online learning intentions (OLI) and PE is affected by ICT infrastructure and internet speed and access. Hence, this research adds new research variable defined as extrinsic factors (ICT infrastructure and access to the internet), which indirectly influences students' intentions to learn online. Given the increased use of smart phones with this generation, it is advisable to integrate mobile technology in online learning and QR codes can be one of the ways to integrate that in the course materials. It is further recommended that to increase the perceived enjoyment of the students with the online learning, the lecturers might be encouraged to use videos, audios and instant messaging to contact and provide the feedback to the students. It is important for universities to prepare for any such future crisis. This study results will provide a useful insight to design the online courses effectively by considering all the factors impacting students' intention and satisfaction.","output":"Factors affecting students' intentions to undertake online learning: an empirical study in Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The binding of human coronavirus OC43 to human rhabdomyosarcoma cells which are highly susceptible to infection was studied by a solid phase virus binding assay and a receptor blockade assay.

METHODS: Pre-hospital records of RTIs from January to May in 2020 and the same period in 2019 were obtained from the database of Suzhou pre-hospital emergency center, Jiangsu, China. Data were extracted for analysis, including demographic characteristics, pre-hospital vital signs, transport, shock index, consciousness, pre-hospital death. A retrospective study comparing epidemiological characteristics of RTIs in Suzhou during the 5-month period in 2020 to the parallel period in 2019 was performed. RESULTS: A total of 7288 RTIs in 2020 and 8869 in 2019 met inclusion criteria. The overall volume of RTIs has statistical difference between the 2 years (p < 0.001), with fewer RTIs in 2020 compared with 2019. Electric bicycle related RTIs increased during the pandemic (2641, 36.24% vs 2380, 26.84%, p < 0.001), with a higher incidence of RTIs with disorder of consciousness (DOC) (7.22% vs 6.13%, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Under the impact of COVID-19, the total number of RTIs in Suzhou from January to May 2020 decreased. This observation was coupled with a rise in electric bicycle related injuries and an increase in the incidence of RTIs with DOC.

This process included a parental interview by a doctor, a specialist speech and language therapy assessment, an autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) and a feedback clinic slot. All were carried out on hospital sites. These were postponed in March following national guidance. The ADOS which is the gold standard assessment for Autism Spectrum disorder is invalid if delivered when a mask is worn. Alternative methods of assessment had to be explored.ObjectivesOur aim was to continue providing a comprehensive evidence-based service for Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis. We devised a diagnostic toolkit for the assessment of Autism Spectrum disorder for children of 5years and under which is valid for use during the current global pandemic. It brings telehealth to the forefront alongside patient involvement and coproduction. This toolkit results in more prudent healthcare.MethodsWe utilised evidence-based telehealth methods to perform a specialist speech and language assessment in a childs home via video call. Parents were invited to share videos of everyday activities via a secure portal. We could observe the child in a meaningful setting and witness functional impact of their needs. Each case was discussed by a multi-agency panel based on DSM-V criteria.Online training was undertaken by professionals to deliver in clinic the Brief Observation of Autism Symptoms (BOSA) based on the ADOS for covid times. Our clinic room facilities were made fit for purpose to observe assessments by video and audio through an observation window. Equipment was acquired. Parents were coached by the therapist to enable them to become the administrator. The patient journey was revised based on their need. Administrative processes have been streamlined with improved communication to parents who are now supported by specialist health visitors while their children are waiting to complete their assessment.ResultsTelephonic feedback from the first ten parents whose children underwent a telehealth assessment has been positive;the home was deemed more natural and for some less distressing than clinic. Evidence to reach a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder was achieved in seven children out of a sample of eighteen children who underwent a specialist speech and language telehealth assessment. The other eleven children went on to have a BOSA clinic appointment. Of data collected thus far, eighty- six percent of parents were satisfied with their childs telehealth assessment.We have been able to reach an outcome for fifty- three children in the BOSA clinic of which forty-seven fulfilled criteria for a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Surveys from patients indicated that eighty percent agreed with the professionals outcome.ConclusionsOur ASD tool-kit and revised pathway have resulted in more prudent healthcare, reducing the number of assessments and footfall to the hospital sites. We have reduced variation and inequity. We have increased coproduction with parents by utilising telehealth and coaching parents. We have achieved increased patient satisfaction and improved our patients experience and outcomes.","output":"Developing a tool-kit for the assessment of autism spectrum disorder for children under 5 years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article has been withdrawn at the request of the author(s) and/or editor.

Their impact on individuals with neurological conditions, considered vulnerable to COVID-19 complications, remains to be determined. Objective: To investigate associations between physical activity and health-related quality of life outcomes in individuals with a neurological condition during government mandated COVID-19 restrictions. Methods: An e-survey assessing fear of COVID-19, physical activity level and health-related quality of life outcomes (functional disability and pain, anxiety and depression, loneliness, fatigue, and vitality) was distributed to individuals with a neurologically-related mobility disability living in the United Kingdom. Open-ended questions were also included to contextualize barriers and facilitators to engage in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gamma-weighted generalized linear models and tree-structured regression models were employed to determine the associations between physical activity and health-related quality of life. Results: Of 199 responses, 69% reported performing less physical activity compared to pre-pandemic. Tree-structured regression models revealed that lower leisure-time physical activity was significantly associated (p  0.009) with higher depression and fatigue, but lower vitality. The closure of leisure facilities and organized sport (27%) was the most commonly cited barrier to engage in physical activity, while 31% of participants mentioned concerns around their physical and mental health as a facilitator. Conclusion: Our analysis identified homogenous subgroups for depression, fatigue, and vitality based specifically on leisure-time physical activity cut points, irrespective of additional demographic or situational characteristics.

The analysis was limited to reports with at least 10 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that reported on maternal and neonatal outcomes. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic search of the selected databases was performed by implementing a strategy that included the MeSH terms, key words, and word variants for \\"coronavirus,\\" \\"SARS-CoV-2,\\" \\"COVID-19,\\" and \\"pregnancy.r The primary outcomes were maternal admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), critical disease, and death. Secondary outcomes included rate of preterm birth, cesarean delivery, vertical transmission, and neonatal death. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages with number of cases and 95% CIs. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Of the 99 articles identified, 13 included 538 pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, with reported outcomes on 435 (80.9%) deliveries. Maternal ICU admission occurred in 3.0% of cases (8/263, 95% CI 1.6-5.9) and maternal critical disease in 1.4% (3/209, 95% CI 0.5-4.1). No maternal deaths were reported (0/348, 95% CI 0.0-1.1). The preterm birth rate was 20.1% (57/284, 95% CI 15.8-25.1), the cesarean delivery rate was 84.7% (332/392, 95% CI 80.8-87.9), the vertical transmission rate was 0.0% (0/310, 95% CI 0.0-1.2), and the neonatal death rate was 0.3% (1/313, 95% CI 0.1-1.8). CONCLUSION: With data from early in the pandemic, it is reassuring that there are low rates of maternal and neonatal mortality and vertical transmission with SARS-CoV-2.

More recently, a link between smoking and susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was proposed. COVID-19 is due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which uses the receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 for entry into host cells, thereby infecting cells of the respiratory tract and the oral cavity. Here, we examined the effects of cigarette smoke on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and infection in human gingival epithelial cells (GECs). We found that cigarette smoke condensates (CSC) upregulated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in GECs, and that CSC activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling in the oral cells. ACE2 was known to mediate SARS-CoV-2 internalization, and we demonstrate that CSC treatment potentiated the internalization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in GECs in an AhR-dependent manner. AhR depletion using small interference RNA decreased SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus internalization in CSC-treated GECs compared with control GECs. Our study reveals that cigarette smoke upregulates SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression and infection in oral cells.

We develop the Hemodynamic Stability Index (HSI), which highlights situational awareness of possible hemodynamic instability occurring at the bedside and to prompt assessment for potential hemodynamic interventions. METHODS: We used an ensemble of decision trees to obtain a real-time risk score that predicts the initiation of hemodynamic interventions an hour into the future. We developed the model using the eICU Research Institute (eRI) database, based on adult ICU admissions from 2012 to 2016. A total of 208,375 ICU stays met the inclusion criteria, with 32,896 patients (prevalence = 18%) experiencing at least one instability event where they received one of the interventions during their stay. Predictors included vital signs, laboratory measurements, and ventilation settings. RESULTS: HSI showed significantly better performance compared to single parameters like systolic blood pressure and shock index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure) and showed good generalization across patient subgroups. HSI AUC was 0.82 and predicted 52% of all hemodynamic interventions with a lead time of 1-h with a specificity of 92%. In addition to predicting future hemodynamic interventions, our model provides confidence intervals and a ranked list of clinical features that contribute to each prediction. Importantly, HSI can use a sparse set of physiologic variables and abstains from making a prediction when the confidence is below an acceptable threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The HSI algorithm provides a single score that summarizes hemodynamic status in real time using multiple physiologic parameters in patient monitors and electronic medical records (EMR). Importantly, HSI is designed for real-world deployment, demonstrating generalizability, strong performance under different data availability conditions, and providing model explanation in the form of feature importance and prediction confidence.

However, limited information exists about the effectiveness of wound closure using these sutures. OBJECTIVES The authors compare closure times and clinical outcomes of 2-layer wound closure using V-Loc 90 barbed sutures (Covidien, Inc, Mansfield, Massachusetts) with conventional, 3-layer closure with nonbarbed, nonlocking sutures. METHODS The lipoabdominoplasty wounds of 30 consecutive patients were divided into 2 equal halves, and the control and study halves of the wound were randomly assigned for each patient. On the control side, a conventional 3-layer wound closure (Scarpa's fascia, deep dermis, and upper dermis) was performed using polyglactin 910 and polyglecaprone 25 sutures. On the study side, the wound was closed in 2 layers (Scarpa's fascia and upper dermis) using a running suture of V-Loc 90 sutures. Closure of each layer and of the entire half of the wound was performed by a single surgeon and timed. Patients were followed for an average of 13 months postoperatively. Postoperative complications were recorded and scar appearance was evaluated with the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). RESULTS Data were collected from a total of 30 control and 30 study sides. The mean closure time for each layer was faster with barbed sutures than with nonbarbed sutures, and the total average closure time was 4.4 minutes (36.1%) faster using barbed sutures compared with conventional sutures (7.9 vs 12.3 minutes, respectively; P < .0001). Postoperative wound complications occurred in 4 (13.3%) control sides compared with 1 (3.3%) study side of the wound. The VSS scores were similar between the 2 sides. The lateral section of the scar received lower VSS scores than central sections. CONCLUSIONS Two-layer wound closure using V-Loc 90 barbed sutures was safe and faster and resulted in fewer postoperative complications than 3-layer closure with conventional, nonbarbed sutures. V-Loc 90 sutures did not produce better scar cosmesis. Wound closure with barbed sutures may be financially and clinically advantageous in lipoabdominoplasty patients as it requires less wound closure time.

In this review, we elucidate suggested mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of patients with diabetes to infection with SARS-CoV-2 with a more severe COVID-19 disease. The worsened prognosis of COVID-19 patients with DM can be attributed to a facilitated viral uptake assisted by the host's receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It can also be associated with a higher basal level of pro-inflammatory cytokines present in patients with diabetes, which enables a hyperinflammatory \\"cytokine storm\\" in response to the virus. This review also suggests a link between elevated levels of IL-6 and AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and their role in exacerbating diabetes-induced complications and insulin resistance.

Our previous understanding of the phenotypes and functions of microglia has been greatly extended by a dearth of recent investigations. Distinct genetically defined subsets of microglia are now recognized to perform their own independent functions in specific conditions. The molecular profiling of single microglial cells indicates extensively heterogeneous reactions in different neurological disorders, resulting in multiple potentials for crosstalk with other kinds of CNS cells such as astrocytes and neurons. In settings of neurological diseases it could thus be prudent to establish effective cell\\\\based therapies by targeting entire microglial networks. Notably, activated microglial depletion through genetic targeting or pharmacological therapies within a suitable time window can stimulate replenishment of the CNS niche with new microglia. Additionally, enforced repopulation through provision of replacement cells also represents a potential means of exchanging dysfunctional with functional microglia. In each setting the newly repopulated microglia might have the potential to resolve ongoing neuroinflammation. In this review, we aim to summarize the most recent knowledge of microglia and to highlight microglial depletion and subsequent repopulation as a promising cell replacement therapy.

It is also unknown whether the modified Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score is applicable for nutritional risk assessment in intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients. We set out to investigate the applicability of the mNUTRIC score for assessing nutritional risks and predicting outcomes for these critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted in three ICUs which had been specially established and equipped for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The study population was critically ill COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to these ICUs between January 28 and February 21, 2020. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients of 18 years; 2) patients who were pregnant; 3) length of ICU stay of 24 h; 4) insufficient medical information available. Patients' characteristics and clinical information were obtained from electronic medical and nursing records. The nutritional risk for each patient was assessed at their ICU admission using the mNUTRIC score. A score of &#8805;5 indicated high nutritional risk. Mortality was calculated according to patients' outcomes following 28 days of hospitalization in ICU. RESULTS: A total of 136 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a median age of 69 years (IQR: 57-77), 86 (63%) males and 50 (37%) females, were included in the study. Based on the mNUTRIC score at ICU admission, a high nutritional risk (&#8805;5 points) was observed in 61% of the critically ill COVID-19 patients, while a low nutritional risk (<5 points) was observed in 39%. The mortality of ICU 28-day was significantly higher in the high nutritional risk group than in the low nutritional risk group (87% vs 49%, P 0.001). Patients in the high nutritional risk group exhibited significantly higher incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, secondary infection, shock and use of vasopressors. Additionally, use of a multivariate Cox analysis showed that patients with high nutritional risk had a higher probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk (adjusted HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22-3.32, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients had a high nutritional risk, as revealed by their mNUTRIC score. Patients with high nutritional risk at ICU admission exhibited significantly higher mortality of ICU 28-day, as well as twice the probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk. Therefore, the mNUTRIC score may be an appropriate tool for nutritional risk assessment and prognosis prediction for critically ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"The modified NUTRIC score can be used for nutritional risk assessment as well as prognosis prediction in critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharyngeal swab sampling, as an essential link in the detection of COVID-19, is characterized by the large task volume and susceptibility to infection Therefore, it is necessary to use medical robots for remote sampling instead of in-situ sampling However, on one hand, due to the influence of network delay, it is difficult to guarantee the closed-loop performance manipulated remotely by medical practitioners On the other hand, the sampling process controlled by the robot independently is not always successful due to the inaccuracy of the planned trajectory caused by the sensors or the moment of the patients To solve the problems discussed above, this paper proposed a remote human-robot collaborative strategy based on impedance control method, which can integrate the experience of medical practitioners into the automatic sampling process During the sampling process, when the inaccurate scanning trajectory is detected, the medical practitioners can correct the planned trajectory on line according to the sensor information and the reaction of the patients Then, the cooperative robot tracks the adjusted planned-trajectory based on the impedance control method and ensure that the contact force of sampling is maintained within a reasonable range The simulation results show that the proposed human-robot collaborative strategy is effective taking the advantages of both medical practitioners and robots which can deal with the trajectory tracking problem caused by the inaccurate sampling of patients ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Remote Human-robot Collaborative Impedance Control Strategy of Pharyngeal Swab Sampling Robot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An Italian male with no link to China Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) epidemic presented at Emergency Room (ER) with severe respiratory impairment.

Suppressing apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells was shown to alleviate functional damage of lung, and modulator of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis becomes a promising approach to the ALI therapy. Previous little studies showed that DHCR24 possessed anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic property in ALI. Thus, H2O2 was utilized to mimic oxidative damage in vitro in alveolar epithelial cell line A549 in the present study. Our results exhibited that H2O2 treatment of A549 cells reduced the level of SOD and increased the level of ROS. Moreover, H2O2 inhibited Bcl-2 expression in A549 cells, but increased Bax and the activity of Caspase-3. In addition, the apoptosis rate in the H2O2 treatment group also increased significantly. And the expression of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) was markedly reduced in the H2O2 treatment group. Overexpression of DHCR24 can remarkably inhibit H2O2-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. We found that overexpression of DHCR24 increased the phosphorylation level of PI3K and AKT, however, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY) eliminated the protective effect of DHCR24 in ALI. DHCR24 was down-regulated in H2O2-induced ALI, and overexpression of DHCR24 could inhibit H2O2-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of A549 cells by activating the Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. The above exhibited a protective effect of DHCR24 on alveolar epithelial cells exposed to oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis and provided a novel therapeutic method for ALI.","output":"24-Dehydrocholesterol Reductase alleviates oxidative damage-induced apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells via regulating Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase/Protein Kinase B activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 has originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has been affecting the public health system, society, and economy in an unheard\\\\of manner.

There was 98% uptake and no adverse events. ICCs for remote assessments ranged from moderate (8 timed walk = 0.47), to strong (8 get-up-and-go = 0.74), to very strong (30 s chair stand = 0.80; sit-and-reach = 0.86; 2 min step test = 0.87; back scratch = 0.90; weight = 0.93; and waist circumference = 0.98) (p-values < 0.001). One-hundred percent concordance was found for side-by-side and semi-tandem balance and 87.5C90.3% for tandem stances. No significant differences between remote and in-person assessments were found for weight, 8 timed walk, and 8 get-up-and-go. Remote anthropometric and physical performance assessments are reliable, valid, acceptable, and safe among cancer survivors and supportive partners. ABSTRACT: (1) Background: Anthropometric and physical performance testing is commonly done in lifestyle research and is traditionally performed in-person. To expand the scalability of lifestyle interventions among cancer survivors, in-person assessments were adapted to remote means and evaluated for feasibility, safety, validity, and reliability. (2) Methods: Cancer survivors and supportive partners were approached to participate in three anthropometric and physical performance testing sessions (two remote/one in-person). Correlations, concordance, and differences between testing modes were evaluated.

METHODS Thirty-four adult patients with intermediate-/high-risk myelofibrosis who had progression or suboptimal response on stable ruxolitinib dose ( 10 mg twice daily) were administered navitoclax at 50 mg once daily starting dose, followed by escalation to a maximum of 300 mg once daily in once in weekly increments (if platelets were  75  109/L). The primary end point was  35% spleen volume reduction (SVR35) from baseline at week 24. Secondary end points included  50% reduction in total symptom score (TSS50) from baseline at week 24, hemoglobin improvement, change in bone marrow fibrosis (BMF) grade, and safety. RESULTS High molecular risk mutations were identified in 58% of patients, and 52% harbored  3 mutations. SVR35 was achieved by 26.5% of patients at week 24, and by 41%, at any time on study, with an estimated median duration of SVR35 of 13.8 months. TSS50 was achieved by 30% (6 of 20) of patients at week 24, and BMF improved by 1-2 grades in 33% (11 of 33) of evaluable patients.

Methods: Collegiate student-athletes (n = 401;age, 20 +/- 2 yr) completed an 84-question anonymous survey regarding demographics, sport/exercise training, nutrition, sleep habits, and mental health. Response frequencies were calculated for each question, and chi 2 analyses were used to determine statistical significance (alpha = 0.05). Results: Although 80.7% of respondents indicated training for their sport, only 38.7% could fully perform their training programs. More D1 versus D3 athletes reported they could perform their training plan as written (D1: 44.4% [n = 83] vs D3: 27.3% [n = 50];P < 0.01), but there were no differences between sexes. Cardiovascular exercise was the most common mode (87.5%) followed by resistance exercise (78.4%). Although there were no differences for cardiovascular exercise, more males (87.5%) than females (74.8%) indicated resistance training (P < 0.01). Average number of meals consumed per day remained similar before and during SAH, but females reported consuming less food and perceived increased healthfulness of their diets. Although most athletes did not use nutritional supplements, rates were higher among D3 and females. Respondents reported longer sleep durations but increased sleep disturbances, negative psychological states, and overall concerns during SAH. Maintaining fitness and sport-specific skills (similar to 70.0%) were the most common concerns. In addition, similar to 60.6% of females and 41.9% of males indicated increased mental health concerns. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that while attempting to be diligent with training during SAH, many student-athletes reported difficulties regarding limited equipment, motivation, and mental health concerns such as heightened anxiety. Many of these difficulties were division- and sex-specific. Discussions between coaches and student-athletes regarding SAH training and mental stressors may aid in determining student-athletes' readiness to return to sport.","output":"The Impacts of COVID-19 on Collegiate Student-Athlete Training, Health, and Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aimed to describe the potential of outdoor tourism in Poland, with emphasis on kayaking tours.

We sought to test the ability of 7 different decontamination methods: autoclave treatment, ethylene oxide gassing (ETO), low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (LT-HPGP) treatment, vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP) exposure, peracetic acid dry fogging (PAF), ultraviolet C irradiation (UVCI) and moist heat (MH) treatment to decontaminate a variety of different N95 masks following experimental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 or vesicular stomatitis virus as a surrogate. In addition, we sought to determine whether masks would tolerate repeated cycles of decontamination while maintaining structural and functional integrity. All methods except for UVCI were effective in total elimination of viable virus from treated masks. We found that all respirator masks tolerated at least one cycle of all treatment modalities without structural or functional deterioration as assessed by fit testing; filtration efficiency testing results were mostly similar except that a single cycle of LT-HPGP was associated with failures in 3 of 6 masks assessed. VHP, PAF, UVCI, and MH were associated with preserved mask integrity to a minimum of 10 cycles by both fit and filtration testing. A similar result was shown with ethylene oxide gassing to the maximum 3 cycles tested. Pleated, layered non-woven fabric N95 masks retained integrity in fit testing for at least 10 cycles of autoclaving but the molded N95 masks failed after 1 cycle; filtration testing however was intact to 5 cycles for all masks. The successful application of autoclaving for layered, pleated masks may be of particular use to institutions globally due to the virtually universal accessibility of autoclaves in health care settings. Given the ability to modify widely available heating cabinets on hospital wards in well-resourced settings, the application of moist heat may allow local processing of N95 masks.","output":"Decontamination of N95 masks for re-use employing 7 widely available sterilization methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the outset of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was thought to present simply as persistent cough and fever.

Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measured by FibroScan has been shown to be correlated with hepatic steatosis. We aim to validate its usefulness as a novel surrogate marker for evaluating metabolic derangement. Subjects/Methods: Volunteers were recruited from medical staff at our hospital to undergo CAP measurements. Anthropometrics, CAP, and laboratory assessments for metabolic profiles and insulin resistance were collected. CAP < 238 dB/m denoted no hepatic steatosis, 238  CAP  259 dB/m denoted mild, 260  CAP  291 dB/m denoted moderate, and CAP > 291 dB/m denoted severe hepatic steatosis according to previous reports. Results: Data of 824 participants were included for analysis. The age was 53.2  15.4 years, body mass index (BMI) was 23.6  3.1 kg/m2, 24.4% were male subjects, and 22.0% met the criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS). Taking the group with CAP < 238 dB/m as control, subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic steatosis had increased odds of MetS by 3.51-, 3.32-, and 5.12-fold, respectively, after adjusting for multiple confounders (p = 0.020). Metabolic profiles, insulin resistance, and presence of MetS were similar between normal-weight subjects with CAP  238 dB/m and overweight subjects with CAP < 238 dB/m. Even in subjects with no MetS components, those with CAP  238 dB/m had higher BMI, waist circumferences, uric acid, triglyceride, white blood cell count, and insulin resistance, whereas lower adiponectin and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

STUDY DESIGN The included studies were Non-randomized studies and Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) enrolling women at moderate and high-risk for developing preeclampsia. Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Grey literature (including ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched. RESULTS Out of 4762 records, 7 Non-randomized Studies and 12 RCTs (respectively enrolling 545 and 1677 women) were selected. Although the studies were clinically heterogeneous, the conduction of quantitative analysis was feasible. Regarding RCTs, the odds of early-onset preeclampsia was reduced by 89% (pooled OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.93, p=0.04) in women with thrombophilia, the incidence of SGA neonates below the 5th percentile by 48% (pooled OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.96, p=0.04) in women with a history of preeclampsia and/or SGA neonates, and the incidence of SGA neonates below the 10th percentile by 31% (pooled OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.96, p=0.03) in the whole population. CONCLUSION Concerning the whole studied population, combined anticoagulant therapy is not superior to Aspirin alone. However, it may be more effective in preventing early-onset preeclampsia regarding women with thrombophilia, SGA neonates below the 5th percentile regarding women with a history of preeclampsia and/or SGA, and SGA neonates below the 10th percentile in moderate/high-risk women. The above mixed but promising results need to be envisaged with caution due to the clinical heterogeneity of the included studies, which is the main limitation of our research. Nevertheless, the strict and narrow inclusion search criteria, and the appropriate subgroup analysis are its main strengths.

We aimed to characterize lymphocyte subsets' shifts and their correlations with other severity markers of MIS-C. METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, we performed peripheral lymphocyte phenotyping in 32 patients with MIS-C. We analyzed lymphocyte subsets at three time points of the disease: the acute (A), convalescent (B), and recovery (C) phases. Based on age-normalized lymphocyte counts, we distinguished two groups of patients: \\"the mild\\" (higher lymphocyte counts) and \\"the severe\\" (lower lymphocyte counts). In addition, we examined differences between these groups regarding other severity markers. RESULTS: In phase A, 84% of children had lymphopenia. Decreased absolute counts of CD3, CD4, and CD8 cells were observed in, respectively, 88%, 72%, and 84% of patients. The natural killer cells were decreased in 63% and CD19 in 59% of children. \\"The severe\\" group had significantly higher procalcitonin and troponin I levels and lower platelets and albumin. Moreover, \\"the severe\\" group had hypotension more frequently (73% vs. 20%, p = .008). In phase B, all lymphocyte counts increased, and 32% of children had lymphocytosis. The increase of CD3, CD4, and CD8 counts correlated with some laboratory severity markers (hemoglobin, procalcitonin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, albumin), but not with steroid use. In phase C, most children had normal lymphocyte counts. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial shifts in lymphocyte counts during MIS-C apply most to T lymphocytes and correlate with the disease severity markers, particularly hypotension prevalence.

China has proposed that it is an effective way to encourage and guide qualified medical personnel to work in primary health care institutions (PHCIs). However, few studies have been conducted on the willingness and influencing factors of medical personnel to seek employment at PHCIs. METHODS: Based on implicit theory and lexical approach, pre-investigation was conducted to collect the items that influence the medical personnel to seek employment at PHCIs from the perspective of guided objects. Through a three-phase investigation of 1160 doctors in 29 public hospitals in 9 cities, the items were categorized, and a structural equation model was established and verified to explore the interrelationship of influencing factors. RESULTS: A total of 6 factors were rotated, including Sense of Gain (SG), Internal Organization Development (IOD), Remuneration and Development (RD), Condition of the City Where the PHCI Is Located (CCPL), Job Responsibilities (JR) and Family Support (FS). The results of the model showed that IOD, RD, JR and FS had a significantly positive effect on the SG. In addition, the FS, RD and JR significantly mediated the relationship between the internal and external environment of PHCIs and SG. The values of the fit index indicated an acceptable-fitting model. CONCLUSION: Family, remuneration, individual development, and job responsibility are closely related to the willingness of medical personnel to seek employment at PHCIs, and the internal and external environment of PHCIs is also an important factor. Therefore, the development of PHC providers can be promoted by paying attention to the family members of medical personnel, establishing a reasonable remuneration system, providing suitable development opportunities, arranging work rationally and improving the internal construction of PHCIs.","output":"Analysis of factors affecting medical personnel seeking employment at primary health care institutions: developing human resources for primary health care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to a nationwide shutdown of elective medical procedures.

We aimed to investigate the association between brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (bFMD), a potential clinical and non-invasive measure of endothelial function, and in-hospital prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods: Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation was assessed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients within 48 h of hospital admission. The association between bFMD and either intensive care unit (ICU) admission or in-hospital death was explored using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: Four hundred and eight patients were enrolled. Significantly lower bFMD values emerged in COVID-19 patients with either radiographic signs of pneumonia, respiratory distress, or the need for non-invasive ventilation compared with patients without these signs (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Forty-two (10%) patients were admitted to the ICU, 76 (19%) patients died, and 118 (29%) patients met the composite endpoint of ICU admission/in-hospital death. At unadjusted Cox regression analysis showed that low bFMD (<4.4%, the median value) was associated with a higher risk for the composite endpoint of ICU admission/in-hospital death compared with high bFMD (4.4%, the median value) (HR 1.675, 95% CI 1.155C2.428, p = 0.007). Multi-adjusted Cox regression analyses showed that low bFMD was independently associated with a 1.519- to 1.658-fold increased risk for the composite endpoint of ICU admission/in-hospital death.

RESULTS: The first participant (P1) was infected by an  variant and displayed an extended and short period of viral excretion and symptom. Analysis of cellular and humoral response 72 h post-symptom onset revealed that P1 failed at developing neutralizing antibodies and a potent CD4 memory response (lack of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4(+)IL-2(+) cells) and CD8 effector response (CD8(+)IFN(+) cells). The second participant (P2) developed post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection by a  variant, associated with a short period of viral excretion and symptoms.

We aimed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a trivalent vaccine formulation (P2-VP8-P[4],[6],[8]). METHODS A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, phase 1/2 study was done at three South African research sites. Healthy adults (aged 18-45 years), toddlers (aged 2-3 years), and infants (aged 6-8 weeks, 37 weeks' gestation, and without previous receipt of rotavirus vaccination), all without HIV infection, were eligible for enrolment. In the dose-escalation phase, adults and toddlers were randomly assigned in blocks (block size of five) to receive 30 g or 90 g of vaccine, or placebo, and infants were randomly assigned in blocks (block size of four) to receive 15 g, 30 g, or 90 g of vaccine, or placebo. In the expanded phase, infants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 15 g, 30 g, or 90 g of vaccine, or placebo, in block sizes of four. Participants, parents of participants, and clinical, data, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment assignment. Adults received an intramuscular injection of vaccine or placebo in the deltoid muscle on the day of randomisation (day 0), day 28, and day 56; toddlers received a single injection of vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral thigh on day 0. Infants in both phases received an injection of vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral thigh on days 0, 28, and 56, at approximately 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Primary safety endpoints were local and systemic reactions (grade 2 or worse) within 7 days and adverse events and serious adverse events within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one injection. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were analysed in infants in either phase who received all planned injections, had blood samples analysed at the relevant timepoints, and presented no major protocol violations considered to have an effect on the immunogenicity results of the study, and included serum anti-P2-VP8 IgA, IgG, and neutralising antibody geometric mean titres and responses measured 4 weeks after the final injection in vaccine compared with placebo groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02646891. FINDINGS Between Feb 15, 2016, and Dec 22, 2017, 30 adults (12 each in the 30 g and 90 g groups and six in the placebo group), 30 toddlers (12 each in the 30 g and 90 g groups and six in the placebo group), and 557 infants (139 in the 15 g group, 140 in the 30 g group, 139 in the 90 g group, and 139 in the placebo group) were randomly assigned, received at least one dose, and were assessed for safety. There were no significant differences in local or systemic adverse events, or unsolicited adverse events, between vaccine and placebo groups. There were no serious adverse events within 28 days of injection in adults, whereas one serious adverse event occurred in a toddler (febrile convulsion in the 30 g group) and 23 serious adverse events (four in placebo, ten in 15 g, four in 30 g, and five in 90 g groups) occurred among 20 infants, most commonly respiratory tract infections. One death occurred in an infant within 28 days of injection due to pneumococcal meningitis. In 528 infants (130 in placebo, 132 in 15 g, 132 in 30 g, and 134 in 90 g groups), adjusted anti-P2-VP8 IgG seroresponses (4-fold increase from baseline) to P[4], P[6], and P[8] antigens were significantly higher in the 15 g, 30 g, and 90 g groups (99-100%) than in the placebo group (10-29%; p<00001). Although significantly higher than in placebo recipients (9-10%), anti-P2-VP8 IgA seroresponses (4-fold increase from baseline) to each individual antigen were modest (20-34%) across the 15 g, 30 g, and 90 g groups.

Through a qualitative study on how Latino families collaborate to access online health resources, this work frames health literacy as a family-level mechanism. Interviews with parent-child dyads combined with online search tasks reveal how families integrate their individual skillsets to obtain, process, and understand online information about illnesses, symptoms, and even medical diagnoses. As they engage in intergenerational online health information searching and brokering, families creatively navigate information and communication technologies (ICTs) to address a range of health needs. Bilingual children help immigrant parents obtain urgent and non-urgent health information needed to care for other family members. When children are tasked with addressing a health need critical to their parent's wellbeing, they collaborate with their parents to obtain, interpret, and apply online health information. Intergenerational online health information searching and brokering thus reveals family-level strengths that can be leveraged to promote both health and digital literacy among marginalized populations.","output":"Intergenerational Online Health Information Searching and Brokering: Framing Health Literacy as a Family Asset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) required a rapid shift from in-person instruction to remote learning in our second-semester general chemistry course at the United States Military Academy (USMA), a predominantly undergraduate institution that takes pride in faculty accessibility to students The decision to conduct remote instruction took effect when students were on spring break;consequently, most students had limited academic resources in hand This represented a significant paradigm shift for both USMA faculty and students since the institution places an emphasis on in-person engagements with students, as reflected by our low student-to-faculty ratio We adapted our usual in-person, student-driven instructional method to the remote environment within a 7 day period, which impacted 174 students and six faculty course-wide who were new to the technology, resources, and methodology associated with remote instruction and learning This communication discusses lessons learned from the transition to asynchronous remote teaching, with a critical focus on the advantages and disadvantages of the adopted teaching methodologies, and includes a discussion of course design and the corresponding adaptions to this new pedagogical environment We anticipate that these accounts can be leveraged by the broader chemical sciences community to better inform the planning and execution of instruction in future academic terms under remote, in-person, or hybrid (partially remote and partially in-person) environments","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on General Chemistry Education at the United States Military Academy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Rates of anxiety have increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, partially attributable to the experience of COVID-19 related concerns. It remains pivotal to determine the implications of such concerns on the severity of anxiety as they may represent opportune targets for public health preventative or therapeutic efforts. The current study evaluated COVID-19 related concerns as predictors of anxiety symptom severity. It also assessed the relative risk associated with sub-types of COVID-19 concerns, the role of age, sex, and minority status as potential moderators; and the unique contribution of COVID-19 concerns beyond sociodemographics, perceived stress, and self-reported general mental health. Methods The data source was obtained from the publicly available Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians-Your Mental Health survey conducted by Statistics Canada. Participants were Canadians aged 15 and older living in ten provinces or three territories. Only participants that completed the self-reported sociodemographics, COVID-19 concerns, and general anxiety symptoms measures were included (n = 44549). Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate continuous reports of anxiety symptoms, and the relative risk of meeting anxiety cut-off levels was determined using chi-square non-parametric testing. Results Within the sample, 29.1% met cut-off levels of anxiety. Levels of coping and security (R(2) = 0.205, p < 0.001), distal (R(2) = 0.043, p < 0.001), and proximal concerns (R(2) = 0.122, p < 0.001) were found to predict the severity of anxiety experiences, which was determined to be robust to statistical control for sociodemographics, perceived stress and self-reported general mental health (R(2) = 0.0625, p < 0.001). Minority status and sex were significant moderating variables, although the interaction accounted for less than 0.1% of the observed variance. Family stress from confinement, support during and after the crisis and personal health concerns significantly predicted more than a 200% increase in the risk of meeting anxiety cut-off levels. Conclusion The current study represents a novel examination of COVID-19-related concerns as risk factors for the experience of anxiety amongst a sizeable Canadian cohort. Coping and security-related concerns represented robust predictors of anxiety symptom experiences. Participants who experienced concerns relating to their proximal social groups were two times more at risk for meeting cut-off anxiety levels than individuals without such concerns. Longitudinal and evidence synthesis remains essential for identifying therapeutic targets and developing pandemic-related public health prevention and care.","output":"COVID-19-Related Concerns and Symptoms of Anxiety: Does Concern Play a Role in Predicting Severity and Risk?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the development of nanoparticles has expanded into a broad range of clinical applications. Nanoparticles have been developed to overcome the limitations of free therapeutics and navigate biological barriers  systemic, microenvironmental and cellular  that are heterogeneous across patient populations and diseases. Overcoming this patient heterogeneity has also been accomplished through precision therapeutics, in which personalized interventions have enhanced therapeutic efficacy. However, nanoparticle development continues to focus on optimizing delivery platforms with a one-size-fits-all solution. As lipid-based, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles are engineered in increasingly specified ways, they can begin to be optimized for drug delivery in a more personalized manner, entering the era of precision medicine. In this Review, we discuss advanced nanoparticle designs utilized in both non-personalized and precision applications that could be applied to improve precision therapies. We focus on advances in nanoparticle design that overcome heterogeneous barriers to delivery, arguing that intelligent nanoparticle design can improve efficacy in general delivery applications while enabling tailored designs for precision applications, thereby ultimately improving patient outcome overall.","output":"Engineering precision nanoparticles for drug delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Impaired cochlear blood perfusion and microvascular damage can cause sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL), which is a potential risk factor for dementia. This study explored the association between SSHL and dementia. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used a random sample of 1000,000 individuals from Taiwans National Health Insurance Research Database. We identified 3725 patients newly diagnosed with SSHL between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2009, and propensity score matching according to age, sex, index year, comorbidities, and medications was used to select the comparison group of 11,175 patients without SSHL. Participants were stratified by age (<65 and R65 years) and sex for the subgroup analyses. The outcome of interest was all cause dementia (ICD-9-CM codes 290.0, 290.4, 294.1, 331.0). Both groups were followed up until December 31, 2010, for diagnoses of dementia. Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of dementia. RESULTS: During the average 5-year follow-up period, the incidence rate of dementia in the SSHL cohort was 6.5 per 1000 person-years compared with 5.09 per 10,000 person-years in the comparison group. After adjustment for potential confounders, patients with SSHL were 1.39 times more likely to develop dementia than those without SSHL (95% confidence interval = 1.13C1.71). When stratified by patients age and sex, the incidence of dementia was 1.34- and 1.64-fold higher in patients with SSHL aged 65 years (P = .013) and in women (P = .001), respectively, compared with the comparison group. Women with SSHL who were < 65 years old had the highest risk (2.14, 95% CI = 1.17C4.11, P = .022). In addition, a log-rank test revealed that patients with SSHL had significantly higher cumulative incidence of dementia than those without SSHL (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SSHL, especially women aged < 65 years, were associated with higher risk of dementia than those without SSHL.

The unique advantage of far-UVC technology over traditional ultraviolet germicidal irradiation lies in the potential for direct application of far-UVC into occupied spaces since antimicrobial doses of far-UVC are significantly below the recommended daily safe exposure limits. This study used a ceiling-mounted far-UVC fixture emitting at 222 nm to directly irradiate an indoor space and then evaluated the doses received upon a manikin. Radiation sensitive film was affixed to the head, nose, lip, and eyes of the manikin, and the 8-hour equivalent exposure dose was determined. Variables examined included manikin height (sitting or standing position), manikin offset from directly below the fixture, tilt of the manikin, the addition of glasses, the addition of hair, and different anatomical feature sizes.

In this context, machine learning algorithms capable of recognizing histological patterns in kidney biopsy slides have been developed and validated with a view to building computational models capable of accurately identifying renal pathologies. In practice, the use of such algorithms can contribute to the universalization of teaching, allowing quality training even in regions where there is a lack of good nephropathologists. The purpose of this work is to describe and test the functionality of SmartPath(k), a tool to support teaching of glomerulopathies using machine learning. The training for knowledge acquisition was performed automatically by machine learning methods using the J48 algorithm to create a computational model of an appropriate decision tree. RESULTS: An intelligent system, SmartPath(k), was developed as a complementary remote tool in the teaching-learning process for pathology teachers and their students (undergraduate and graduate students), showing 89,47% accuracy using machine learning algorithms based on decision trees.

The pressure to produce drugs and vaccines against the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the use of some drugs such as azithromycin, chloroquine (sulfate and phosphate), hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, favipiravir, remdesivir, ribavirin, ivermectin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. However, reports from some of the clinical trials with these drugs have proved detrimental on some COVID-19 infected patients with side effects more of which cardiomyopathy, cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, macular retinopathy, and hepatotoxicity have been recently reported. Realizing the need for potent and harmless therapeutic compounds to combat COVID-19, we attempted in this study to find promising therapeutic compounds against the imminent threat of this virus. In this current study, 16 derivatives of gallic acid were docked against five selected non-structural proteins of SARS-COV-2 known to be a good target for finding small molecule inhibitors against the virus, namely, nsp3, nsp5, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14. All the protein crystal structures and 3D structures of the small molecules (16 gallic acid derivatives and 3 control drugs) were retrieved from the Protein database (PDB) and PubChem server respectively. The compounds with lower binding energy than the control drugs were selected and subjected to pharmacokinetics screening using AdmetSAR server.

As the disease is spreading rapidly all over the world, it is urgent to find effective drugs to treat the virus. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the potential drug targets. Therefore, in this context, we used rigorous computational methods, including molecular docking, fast pulling of ligand (FPL), and free energy perturbation (FEP), to investigate potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We first tested our approach with three reported inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and our computational results are in good agreement with the respective experimental data. Subsequently, we applied our approach on a database of a??4600 natural compounds, as well as 8 available HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitors and an aza-peptide epoxide. Molecular docking resulted in a short list of 35 natural compounds, which was subsequently refined using the FPL scheme. FPL simulations resulted in five potential inhibitors, including three natural compounds and two available HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Finally, FEP, the most accurate and precise method, was used to determine the absolute binding free energy of these five compounds. FEP results indicate that two natural compounds, cannabisin A and isoacteoside, and an HIV-1 PR inhibitor, darunavir, exhibit a large binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which is larger than that of 13b, the most reliable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor recently reported. The binding free energy largely arises from van der Waals interaction. We also found that Glu166 forms H-bonds to all of the inhibitors. Replacing Glu166 by an alanine residue leads to a??2.0 kcal/mol decreases in the affinity of darunavir to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Numerical studies have been majorly focused on the simulation of CFU using computational fluid dynamics, in order to model the motion inside ORs and the evaluation of factors that influence it.

Interventions Determination of serum nitrate levels at ICU admission. Main variable of interest Mortality at 30 days. Results Non-surviving (n = 11) compared to surviving patients (n = 42) showed higher APACHE-II (p < 0.001) and SOFA scores (p = 0.004), and higher serum nitrate levels (p = 0.001).

We aimed to evaluate an internal quality control (iQC) program that controls the total ANA IIF process in routine practice. METHODS In addition to the kit iQC materials, supplemental quality indicators were integrated in a total quality assurance (QA) program: patient-derived iQC's samples (negative, 1/160 fine speckled and 1/160 homogeneous), median sample FI per run and percentage of ANA IIF positive samples per run.Analytical rejection criteria were based on the imprecision of the positivity index (PI) measure of the Zenit PRO system (Menarini). Clinical rejection criteria were based on changes in FI that correspond to a change in ANA IIF titer of 2. To evaluate the QA program, different artificial errors were introduced during the ANA IIF process. After every run, quality indicators were evaluated and compared to the pre-set target values. RESULTS Rescanning the ANA IIF slides five times, using an old conjugate and a needle obstruction resulted in analytically and even clinically relevant errors in ANA IIF results. All errors were correctly detected by the different defined quality indicators. Traditional Westgard rules, including analytically (and clinically) defined rejection limits were useful in monitoring quality indicators.

Specifically, energy-based devices and lasers require special consideration, as they may emit plume which has been shown to contain tissue debris and aerosolized biological materials. Prior studies have shown transmission of viruses and bacteria via plume (i.e., HIV and papillomavirus). The purpose of this study was to evaluate plume characteristics of the Er:YAG resurfacing laser (Sciton; Palo Alto, CA) and compare it to the Morpheus8 fractional radiofrequency device (InMode; Lake Forest, CA). METHODS: Five patients who underwent aesthetic resurfacing and/or skin tightening of the face and neck were treated with the Er:YAG (Sciton Joule, Palo Alto, CA) and/or fractional radiofrequency (Morpheus8, Lake Forest, CA) between April 1 and May 11, 2020. Data collected included patient demographics, past medical history, treatment parameters, adverse events, particle counter data, as well as high magnification video equiptment. Patients were evaluated during treatment with a calibrated particle meter (PCE; Jupiter, FL). The particle meter was used at a consistent focal distance (6-12 inches) to sample the surrounding environment during treatment at 2.83 L/min to a counting efficiency of 50% at 0.3 m and 100% at >0.45 m. Recordings were obtained with and without a smoke evacuator. RESULTS: Of our cohort (n = 5), average age was 58 years old (STD 7.2). Average Fitzpatrick type was between 2 and 3. Two patients received Er:YAG fractional resurfacing in addition to fractional radiofrequency during the same treatment session. Two patients had fractional radiofrequency only, and one patient had laser treatment with the Er:YAG only. There were no adverse events recorded. The particle counter demonstrated ambient baseline particles/second (pps) at 8 (STD 6). During fractional radiofrequency treatment at 1-mm depth, the mean recording was 8 pps (STD 8). At the more superficial depth of 0.5 mm, recordings showed 10 pps (STD 6). The Er:YAG laser resurfacing laser had mean readings of 44 pps (STD 11). When the particle sizes were broken down by size, the fractional radiofrequency device had overall smaller particle sizes with a count of 251 for 0.3 m (STD 147) compared with Er:YAG laser with a count of 112 for 0.3 m (STD 84). The fractional radiofrequency did not appear to emit particles >5 m throughout the treatment, however, the Er:YAG laser consistently recorded majority of particles in the range of 5-10 m. The addition of the smoke evacuator demonstrated a 50% reduction in both particles per second recorded as well as all particle sizes. CONCLUSION: Re-evaluation of the plume effect from aesthetic devices has become important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies are required to characterize viability of COVID-19 viability and transmissibility in plume specimens. Based on this pilot study, we recommend that devices that generate little to no plume such as fractional radiofrequency devices be used in Phase I reopening of practice while devices that generate a visible plume such as Er:YAG laser resurfacing devices be avoided and only used with appropriate personal protective equipment in addition to a smoke evacuator in Phase IV reopening.","output":"Plume Effect of Fractional Radiofrequency Verus Laser Resurfacing: Considerations in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, we witnessed the apparition of the covid-19 virus.

The suggested models are verified with the example of epitaxial growth of &#945;-, ?3- and ?-FeSi2 silicide thin films on silicon substrates. The density of near-coincidence sites is shown to have a decisive role in the determination of epitaxial thin film orientation and explains the superior quality of ?-FeSi2 thin grown on Si(111) over Si(001) substrates despite larger lattice misfits. Ideal conjunctions for interfaces between the silicide phases are predicted and this allows for utilization of a thin buffer &#945;-FeSi2 layer for oriented growth of ?-FeSi2 nanostructures on Si(001). The thermal expansion coefficients are obtained within quasi-harmonic approximation from the DFT calculations to study the influence of temperature on the lattice strains in the derived interfaces. Faster decrease of misfits at the &#945;-FeSi2(001)||Si(001) interface compared to ?3-FeSi2(001)||Si(001) elucidates the origins of temperature-driven change of the phase growing on silicon substrates. The proposed approach guides from bulk phase unit cells to the construction of the interface atomic structures and appears to be a powerful tool for the prediction of interfaces between arbitrary phases for subsequent theoretical investigation and epitaxial film synthesis.","output":"Prediction of orientation relationships and interface structures between -, ?-, ?3-FeSi2 and Si phases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to assess Analgesia/Nociception Index (ANI) and bispectral index (BIS) variations in supine and prone position during closed-tracheal suction in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring myorelaxation and prone positioning We retrospectively reviewed the data of 15 patients hospitalized in ICU for severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring sedation, myorelaxation and prone positioning The BIS, instant ANI (ANIi), mean ANI (ANIm), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and SpO(2) were retrieved in supine and prone position 1 min before tracheal suction then every minute from the beginning of tracheal suction during 4 min and compared using ANOVA for repeated measures (p &lt; 0 05 considered as statistically significant) Both ANIm and ANIi decreased significantly during tracheal suction with no difference between positions, whereas BIS showed no significant variation within time and between groups The median [Q1-Q3] ANIm value decreased from 87 [68-98] to 79 [63-09] in supine position and from 79 [63-95] to 78 [66-98] in prone position 2 min after the beginning of tracheal suction The median [Q1-Q3] ANIi value decreased earlier 1 min after the beginning of tracheal suction from 84 [69-98] to 73 [60-90] in supine position and from 84 [60-99] to 71 [51-88] in prone position Both HR, SBP and SpO(2) varied modestly but significantly during tracheal suction with no difference between positions Monitoring ANI, but not BIS, may be of interest to detect noxious stimuli such as tracheal suction in ICU myorelaxed patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring prone positioning","output":"ANI and BIS variations in supine and prone position during closed-tracheal suction in sedated and myorelaxed ICU patients with severe COVID-19: A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring provides an objective, non-invasive measurement of the level of consciousness in a sedated patient. Aim In this prospective study, we aimed to investigate the hypothesis that risk of respiratory depression could be reduced and the desired level of sedation with minimal doses of propofol could be achieved by using BIS monitoring in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. Material and methods Sixty patients in the ASA 1-2 category, who were scheduled for an ERCP with sedation, were randomly divided into two groups. The procedure was performed, and sedation was administered so that the patient's Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) would be 4-5 in the first group (group 1) and the patient's BIS value would be 65-75 in the second group (group 2). Cardiopulmonary complications, the total duration of the procedure, and the total amount of propofol administered were recorded. Results The mean SpO2 measurements at the third minute, fifth minute, and 10th minute were higher in the BIS group (p < 0.001) (p < 0.05). The mean number of respirations during the third, fifth, 10th, and 15th minute of sedation was significantly higher in the RSS group than in the BIS group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the groups in terms of recovery time, total propofol amount, and additional doses of bolus propofol. Conclusions BIS monitoring during sedation with propofol for ERCP did not reduce total propofol use, but it may be an efficient guide for the timing of additional dose administration, which could reduce the risk of respiratory depression, and it could be used safely as an objective method in the follow-up of level of sedation.","output":"Evaluation of bispectral index monitoring efficacy in endoscopic patients who underwent retrograde cholangiopancreatography and received sedoanalgesia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, with easy access to information, people are aware of the health benefits of pulses and their significant role in sustainable consumption. Despite this, the consumption of pulses still remains low in many developed and developing countries. The authors of the study attempted to fill the gaps in knowledge about determinants that influence the consumption of pulses. The study was conducted to identify the motives and barriers which, according to a consumer, influence the level of consumption of pulses. An attempt was made to determine to what extent a consumer is influenced by culinary trends (using the multiple linear regression equation). The survey was conducted on a sample of 1067 Polish respondents. The sample was representative and selected to reflect the social demographic distribution of the respondents. In the research, descriptive statistics were used, as well as a t-test, linear regression statistics, and discriminant function analysis. Pulses are more often considered by women to be healthy and nutritious products as well as a good alternative to meat products. The price of pulses products is very important. Men also consider those qualities to be encouraging to consume pulses, but to a lesser extent than women. The lack of knowledge and skills to prepare tasty meals from pulses is one of the most important barriers which, both in the case of women and men, prevents consumers from eating pulses more often. Identified types of diets of the respondents in the research sample showed differences in the regularity of consumption of different selected pulse products. The obtained results indicated that Polish consumers are influenced by other cuisines of the world in their preferences. The most influential cuisines were the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean, with a variety of dishes that are prepared based on pulse products.

The impact of this pandemic on the presentation and invasive management of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is not well described. METHODS This single-center retrospective study compared patients with MI who underwent invasive coronary angiography at New York University from March-April 2020, during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic, with those presenting in March-April 2019. RESULTS Only 35 patients with MI underwent angiography during the study period in 2020 vs 109 patients in 2019. No differences in comorbidities or baseline medications were identified. The proportion of patients with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (48.6% vs 24.8%, respectively; P=.01). Median peak troponin concentration was higher (14.5 ng/mL vs 2.9 ng/mL; P<.01) and left ventricular ejection fraction was lower (43.34% vs 51.1%; P=.02) during the pandemic.

METHOD A video on the use of ICG to assess bowel perfusion after intestinal resection and on the use of intra-ureteral perfusion of ICG. A 6 Fr ureteral catheter was introduced in to each ureters at cystoscopy and 7 ml ICG solution (1,25mg/ml of distilled water) was injected. The catheter was then removed. Using a near- infrared camera (OLYMPUS Medical System Europa and STRYKER Iberia S.L. Madrid,Spain), the fluorescent ureters could be visualized at laparoscopy. After rectal segmental resection, 4ml of ICG solution was injected intravenously to check the vascularity at the site of transection and the anastomosis further checked at ICG-rectoscopy, using a 12 mm- Kii balloon blunt tip (Applied Medical, Europe) RESULTS: The ICG fluorescence may have a role in helping to identify and follow the course of the pelvic ureter especially when the anatomy is distorted. It has the added advantage ureteral fluorescence is detectable for at least 6 hours after injection of ICG. Intravenous ICG also provided a visual assessment of anastomotic perfusion after discoid and segmental bowel resections at laparoscopy and rectoscopy.

Improper treatment of this waste poses serious risks of disease transmission to waste pickers, waste workers, health workers, patients, and the community in general through exposure to infectious agents. Poor management of the waste emits harmful and deleterious contaminants into society. However, contamination of highly contagious agents such as the COVID-19 virus has created enormous instability in healthcare waste handling and subsequent recycling because of the volume of the waste generated and its contagious nature. Several countries have adopted safety measures to combat this contamination and manage healthcare waste; however, these measures are insufficient and vary depending on the context of the country. In addition, the WHO has set out guidelines for management of healthcare waste. These guidelines are helping to manage the highly contagious healthcare waste resulting from the current pandemic. Proper healthcare waste management may add value by reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus and increasing the recyclability of materials instead of sending them to landfill. Disinfecting and sorting out healthcare waste facilitates sustainable management and allows their utilization for valuable purposes.

This technique is expensive and associated with a long learning curve. To avoid these obstacles, we have developed an alternative approach using the Endorec(TM) trocar (Aspide, France), which combines the advantages of local transanal excision and single-port access. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS Fourteen consecutive patients underwent transanal resection using Endorec trocar and standard laparoscopic instruments. A retrospective evaluation of the outcome of this technique was performed. RESULTS Fourteen patients were successfully operated. Rectal lesions included adenoma in ten patients, T1 adenocarcinoma in three and one T2 adenocarcinoma not amenable for abdominal surgery. The average distal margin from the anal verge was 10 cm (range 5-17 cm), and the mean diameter was 3.5 cm (range 1-5 cm). Negative margins were obtained in 13 patients (92,8 %). Median operating time was 60 min (range 20-100). The excisional area was sutured in nine patients. Median postoperative stay was 4 days (range 1-13). Postoperative complications (21 %) included postoperative fever in one patient and two patients were readmitted with rectal blood loss 6 and 15 days postoperatively and were treated with conservative measures.

Adult (age &#8805;18 years) patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed. Up to five non-asthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age (within 5 years), sex, and date of positive test (within 7 days). The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate. Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020. RESULTS: Among 562 asthma patients, 199 (21%) were hospitalized, 15 (3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 7 (1%) died.

COVID-19 infections have been observed to have a high mortality rate, especially in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients over 18 years of age who underwent a maintenance hemodialysis program at our unit, who tested positive for COVID-19 by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and/or who were observed to have disease-related signs in their CTs were included in the study. RESULTS: In this study, 23 of 42 patients receiving hemodialysis support in our clinic were included. The median age was 67 years old (min: 35; max: 91 years), and all of our patients had primary hypertension and other comorbidities. Their clinical evaluation showed that dry cough (47.8%) and shortness of breath (47.8%) were the most common symptoms. Fever was less pronounced (30.4%). The median time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 1 day (min: 0; max:), and the time from hospitalization to death was 18 days (min: 1; max: 22). Transfer from the inpatient ward to the ICU took a median of 7 days (min: 1; max: 13). Among the 23 patients, 3 died during follow-up, and 20 were discharged with full recovery.

This study aimed to evaluate the status of pharmacovigilance in Iran using the World Health Organization (WHO) pharmacovigilance indicators with the prospect of identifying the gaps and areas for improvement. METHODS This study was conducted in 2 parts. The first part included a secondary analysis of the national data obtained from the Iranian National Pharmacovigilance Center (PVC) using a structured data collection form based on WHO core pharmacovigilance indicators. In the second part, a 3-month prospective study was carried out to investigate 2 outcome indicators, ie, length of stay and costs of medicine-related hospitalization in all patients of 2 main referral hospitals in the southeast and north of Iran. RESULTS Iran has a PVC with national policy, trained staff, and a statutory budget. In 2017, the number of ADR reports was 15.0 per 100 000 population, and 262 signals were detected during the preceding 5 years. The average length of stay and costs of medicine-related hospitalization were 5 days and US$817.2 in Afzalipour hospital and 6.6 days and US$306.7 in Razi hospital, respectively.

The potential to reaerate consolidated lung tissue in COVID-19-related ARDS is heavily debated. This study assessed the potential to reaerate lung consolidations in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS under invasive ventilation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19-related ARDS who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) at low positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and after a recruitment maneuver at high PEEP of 20 cm H2O. Lung reaeration, volume, and weight were calculated using both CT scans. CT scans were performed after intubation and start of ventilation (early CT), or after several days of intensive care unit admission (late CT). RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were analyzed. The median percentages of reaerated and nonaerated lung tissue were 19% [interquartile range, IQR: 10 to 33] and 11% [IQR: 4 to 15] for patients with early and late CT scans, respectively (P=0.049). End-expiratory lung volume showed a median increase of 663 mL [IQR: 483 to 865] and 574 mL [IQR: 292 to 670] after recruitment for patients with early and late CT scans, respectively (P=0.43).

This has been standard practice in most maxillofacial units across the UK, including ours. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and emerging guidelines on aerosol-generating procedures required us to revisit the need for a perioperative tracheostomy. METHODS: We present our series of 29 consecutive cases, cared for during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, that were managed either using surgical tracheostomy or overnight tracheal intubation. RESULTS: Out of 29 patients 3 received a surgical tracheostomy. The average duration of tracheostomy use was 8 days. Twenty patients were managed using a period of overnight tracheal intubation. Average duration of tracheal intubation was 1.2 days, with an average intensive care unit stay of 1.7 days. The average duration of hospital stay was 15.8 days for patients managed with overnight tracheal intubation and 30.1 days for patients who received a surgical tracheostomy. The return to theatre rate was 13.8% for reasons including flap failure and neck space infection. There were no airway issues reported in this series of patients.

The fresh properties were explored by slump flow, T50 flow, V-funnel, L-box, and J-ring sieve segregation test. Moreover, the hardened properties of concrete were performed for compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strength and permeability of SCC mixtures. Fresh concrete test results show that even if no viscosity modifier is required, satisfactory fresh concrete properties of SCC can be obtained by replacing the fine aggregate with coal bottom ash content. At 15% replacement of cement with local metakaolin is optimum and gave better results as compared to control SCC. At 30% replacement of fine aggregate is optimum and gave better results as compared to control SCC.

Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a government university in Karachi, Pakistan between April 2020 to September 2021. All participants living in a region where COVID-19 is prevalent, having higher education status, who had access to the internet and were above 18 years of age were included in the study. All those who were younger than 18 years, those who were in primary and secondary education, and students who were already taking any online module before the Covid-19 pandemic were excluded. All findings were recorded in the semi - structured Proforma consisting of closed ended questions. Demographics of the study participant's such as age, gender and occupation were recorded. Furthermore, information to assess the satisfaction towards the online learning were included. Results: Mean age of study participants was 21 years with female dominance. Overall mean scores for learning environment, face-to-face learning, and E-learning were 18.1  4.6, 23.1  6.5, and 15.4  7.1, respectively. The scores for the learning environment were significantly higher for female students as compared to male counterparts (p<0.008). However, no statistical difference was observed between gender and scores on face-to face learning and E-learning. It was further indicated that face-to-face learning was significantly higher in medical students (p=0.0001) while non-medical students score significantly higher in E-learning with a p-value of 0.0002. Conclusion: The present study presented a comparison between modes of teaching (face-to-face learning versus E-learning) from the perspective of the students. The study indicated that medical students preferred faceto- face learning while other non-medical students preferred E-learning. If interactive classes are an option for students in which they can easily interact with the teacher and postulate questions, then E-learning could be as effective as face-to-face learning.

In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in social media-based data analytics for analyzing stock exchange markets. This is due to the fact that the sentiments around major global events like Brexit or COVID-19 significantly affect business decisions and investor perceptions, as well as transactional trading statistics and index values. Hence, in this research, we examined a case study from the Brexit event to assess the influence that feelings on the subject have had on the stock markets of European Union (EU) nations. Brexit has implications for Britain and other countries under the umbrella of the European Union (EU). However, a common point of debate is the EUs contribution preferences and benefit imbalance. For this reason, the Brexit event and its impact on stock markets for major contributors and countries with minimum donations need to be evaluated accurately. As a result, to achieve accurate analysis of the stock exchanges of different EU nations from two different viewpoints, i.e., the major contributors and countries contributing least, in response to the Brexit event, we suggest an optimal deep learning and machine learning model that incorporates social media sentiment analysis regarding Brexit to perform stock market prediction. More precisely, the machine learning-based models include support vector machines (SVM) and linear regression (LR), while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used as a deep learning model. In addition, this method incorporates around 1.82 million tweets regarding the major contributors and countries contributing least to the EU budget. The findings show that sentiment analysis of Brexit events using a deep learning model delivers better results in comparison with machine learning models, in terms of root mean square values (RMSE). The outcomes of stock exchange analysis for the least contributing nations in relation to the Brexit event can aid them in making stock market judgments that will eventually benefit their country and improve their poor economies. Likewise, the results of stock exchange analysis for major contributing nations can assist in lowering the possibility of loss in relation to investments, as well as helping them to make effective decisions.","output":"Analyzing the Stock Exchange Markets of EU Nations: A Case Study of Brexit Social Media Sentiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the global community and continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The development of effective vaccines has represented a major step towards reducing transmission and illness severity but significant challenges remain, particularly in regions where vaccine access has been limited. COVID-19 is associated with hypercoagulability and increased risk of thrombosis, with greatest risk among the critically ill. Interestingly, early observational data suggested that anticoagulant therapy might improve clinical outcomes, aside from thrombotic events, in patients with COVID-19. In this review we summarise data generated from three published randomised clinical trials which have sought to determine the effect of therapeutic heparin anticoagulation on efficacy and safety outcomes in hospitalised patients with COVID-19: the multiplatform REMAP-CAP, ACTIV-4a and ATTACC randomised controlled trials and the RAPID trial. In the multiplatform REMAP-CAP, ACTIV-4a and ATTACC randomised controlled trials, therapeutic heparin was not associated with benefit in critically ill patients with COVID-19 compared with usual care (adjusted proportional odds ratio (OR) for increased organ-support free days up to day 21: 0.83; 95% credible interval, 0.67C1.03, posterior probability of futility 99.9%). Conversely, among hospitalised patients without critical illness, therapeutic heparin was associated with an increased probability of organ support-free days alive (adjusted OR, 1.27; 95% credible interval, 1.03C1.58). The RAPID trial also evaluated the effect of therapeutic heparin compared with prophylactic heparin in non-critically ill patients. In this study, therapeutic heparin did not significantly reduce the odds of the primary composite outcome (death, mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit admission) (OR 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 1.10; p = 0.12) but was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality [OR, 0.22 (95%-CI, 0.07 to 0.65)]. Collectively these studies suggest that therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin may reduce the severity of illness and potentially even confer a survival benefit in hospitalised, non-critically ill patients with COVID-19. No benefit for therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin was evident in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Therefore, while the results of additional studies in this evolving field are pending, it is important to approach decisions regarding therapeutic heparin in moderately ill hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in a measured and individualised manner.","output":"Anticoagulation as a therapeutic strategy for hospitalised patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In 2019, a literature review indicated that more than half of people who try to come off antidepressants experience withdrawal effects.

The report made several recommendations relevant to general practice. Method: In order to facilitate implementation of these recommendations, an online survey was designed to explore United Kingdom general practitioner (GP) experiences, opinions, knowledge and needs in relation to depression, ADs and withdrawal. A total of 66 GPs had completed the survey when COVID-19 occurred. Results: In keeping with previous findings, this small sample of GPs had a predominantly psycho-social perspective on the causes of, and treatments for, depression. They broadly considered ADs effective for moderate/severe depression and ineffective for minimal/mild depression, for which they preferred psychological therapies and social prescribing. There was a marked lack of consistency in GPs knowledge about the incidence and duration of withdrawal effects.

Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) was used for the identification and automated microdilution to determine sensitivity to antimicrobials of the isolates and clonality analysis of genetic relationships was carried out using the DICE coefficient, UPGMA algorithm RESULTS: During the outbreak, 19 patients with R. pickettii bacteremia were identified The global attack rate was 1,9%. 11/19 (58%) were women and 13/19 (68%) of the isolations were from inward patients and 6/19 (32%) were from intensive care unit. Factors that could contribute to the appearance of the outbreak were underlying pathology, 2 patients with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, 10 patients with a diagnosis of arterial hypertension, 5 patients with obesity, 6 patients with heart disease, additionally 7 patients with a diagnosis of SARS COV 2 and 6 patients with the use of corticosteroids. The global attack rate was 1,9% and mortality was 31.5% (6 patients). R. pickettii was identified from two batches of hydromorphone by MALDI-TOF and the clonality study concluded that the isolates analyzed, were clonal with a 100% similarity. The associated mortality rate was 5/29 (26.3%). CONCLUSION: We confirmed an outbreak of R. pickettii due to the contamination of two hydromorphone badges in Colombia. It is crucial to acknowledge the importance of infection control and surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as maintaining adequate quality control of medication production in order to avoid presenting this kind of outbreaks.

Methods: : Using a unified questionnaire, through the combination of field investigation and telephone survey, and with the help of trajectory big data technology to track the infected persons and close contacts for clues and case investigation. All nasal/pharyngeal swabs were collected and detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR method. The propagation relationship was analyzed by using the schematic diagram of transmission chain. Results: : The outbreak involved 21 infected persons (15 confirmed cases and 6 asymptomatic). The first case was only an index case rather than the source of infection. The infected persons were spread through family exposure, workplace exposure, public premises exposure, vehicle exposure, diet exposure and so on. The average incubation period was 4 days, and those who had contact during both the virus incubation period and the symptom period had a higher risk of infection (c 2 =30.688, P<0.001). Unprotected family exposure, diet exposure, and exposure to small spaces, such as within transport, presented a higher risk of infection (c 2 =33.461, P<0.001).

A unique pattern of chronic histiocytic intervillositis (CHI) and/or massive perivillous fibrin deposition (MPFD) has emerged, coined as SARS-CoV-2 placentitis. METHODS: The aim of this study was to describe a cohort of placentas diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 placentitis during October 2020-March 2021. Cases with a histological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 placentitis and confirmatory immunohistochemistry were reported. Maternal demographic data, pregnancy outcomes and placental findings were collected. FINDINGS: 59 mothers delivered 61 infants with SARS-CoV-2 placentitis. The gestational age ranged from 19 to 41 weeks with most cases (78.6%) being third trimester. 30 infants (49.1%) were stillborn or late miscarriages. Obese mothers had higher rates of pregnancy loss when compared with those with a BMI <30 [67% (10/15) versus 41% (14/34)]. 47/59 (79(.)7%) mothers had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test either at the time of labour or in the months before, of which 12 (25(.)5%) were reported to be asymptomatic. Ten reported only CHI, two cases showed MPFD only and in 48 placentas both CHI and MPFD was described. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV2 placentitis is a distinct entity associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss, particularly in the third trimester. Women can be completely asymptomatic and still experience severe placentitis. Unlike classical MPFD, placentas with SARS-CoV-2 are generally normal in size with adequate fetoplacental weight ratios. Further work should establish the significance of the timing of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and placentitis, the significance of SARS-CoV2 variants, and rates of vertical transmission associated with this pattern of placental inflammation.

Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2014. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD in relation to:1. incidence of infection;2. mortality;3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community;4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform. Additionally, we carried out handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of the most recent search: 19 December 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS Five trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials (880 children randomised) met the inclusion criteria. All of the included trials showed a reduced incidence of infection in children with SCD (SS or S0Thal) receiving prophylactic penicillin. In trials which investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-quality evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-quality evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five.Overall, the quality of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The evidence examined suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.","output":"Prophylactic antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we provide guidance on how standard safety analyses and reporting of clinical trial safety data may need to be modified, given the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact could include missed visits, alternative methods for assessments (such as virtual visits), alternative locations for assessments (such as local labs), and study drug interruptions. We focus on safety planning for Phase 2-4 clinical trials and integrated summaries for submissions. Starting from the recommended safety analyses proposed in white papers and a workshop, created as part of an FDA/PHUSE collaboration (PHUSE 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019), we assess what modifications might be needed. Impact from COVID-19 will likely affect treatment arms equally, so analyses of adverse events from controlled data can, to a large extent, remain unchanged. However, interpretation of summaries from uncontrolled data (summaries that include open-label extension data) will require even more caution than usual. Special consideration will be needed for safety topics of interest, especially events expected to have a higher incidence due to a COVID-19 infection or due to quarantine or travel restrictions (e.g., depression).

Despite nearly six decades having passed since its first emergence, different studies have shown that type II FCoV represents only a small portion of the total FCoV seropositivity in cats; hence, there is very limited knowledge of the evolution of type II FCoV. To elucidate the correlation between viral emergence and FIP, a local isolate (NTU156) that was derived from a FIP cat was analyzed along with other worldwide strains. Containing an in-frame deletion of 442 nucleotides in open reading frame 3c, the complete genome size of NTU156 (28,897 nucleotides) appears to be the smallest among the known type II feline coronaviruses. Bootscan analysis revealed that NTU156 evolved from two crossover events between type I FCoV and canine coronavirus, with recombination sites located in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and M genes. With an exchange of nearly one-third of the genome with other members of alphacoronaviruses, the new emerging virus could gain new antigenicity, posing a threat to cats that either have been infected with a type I virus before or never have been infected with FCoV.

A multivariate linear regression model was used to identify factors associated with stress changes relative to pre-outbreak estimates. Results 6,040/6,685 (90.4%) participants filled out at least 1/3 of the survey and were included in the analyses. On average, PSS scores increased from 12.9+6.8 before the outbreak to 14.9+8.3 during the outbreak (p<0.001). The independent factors associated with stress worsening were: having a mental disorder, female sex, having underage children, heavier alcohol consumption, working with the general public, shorter sleep duration, younger age, less time elapsed since the start of the outbreak, lower stress before the outbreak, worse symptoms that could be linked to COVID-19, lower coping skills, worse obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to germs and contamination, personalities loading on extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism, left-wing political views, worse family relationships, and spending less time exercising and doing artistic activities.

The Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) was established to increase situational awareness and capacity for the early detection of emerging public health events. Objective To describe how the GPHIN has used Big Data as an effective early detection technique for infectious disease outbreaks worldwide and to identify potential future directions for the GPHIN. Findings Every day the GPHIN analyzes over more than 20,000 online news reports (over 30,000 sources) in nine languages worldwide. A web-based program aggregates data based on an algorithm that provides potential signals of emerging public health events which are then reviewed by a multilingual, multidisciplinary team. An alert is sent out if a potential risk is identified. This process proved useful during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and was adopted shortly after by a number of countries to meet new International Health Regulations that require each country to have the capacity for early detection and reporting. The GPHIN identified the early SARS outbreak in China, was credited with the first alert on MERS-CoV and has played a significant role in the monitoring of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Future developments are being considered to advance the GPHIN's capacity in light of other Big Data sources such as social media and its analytical capacity in terms of algorithm development. Conclusion The GPHIN's early adoption of Big Data has increased global capacity to detect international infectious disease outbreaks and other public health events.

In contrast, the reciprocal of the binomial proportion, also known as the inverse proportion, is often overlooked, even though it also plays an important role in various fields including clinical studies and random sampling. The maximum likelihood estimator of the inverse proportion suffers from the zero-event problem, and to overcome it, alternative methods have been developed in the literature. Nevertheless, there is little work addressing the optimality of the existing estimators, as well as their practical performance comparison. Inspired by this, we propose to further advance the literature by developing an optimal estimator for the inverse proportion in a family of shrinkage estimators. We further derive the explicit and approximate formulas for the optimal shrinkage parameter under different settings. Simulation studies show that the performance of our new estimator performs better than, or as well as, the existing competitors in most practical settings. Finally, to illustrate the usefulness of our new method, we also revisit a recent meta-analysis on COVID-19 data for assessing the relative risks of physical distancing on the infection of coronavirus, in which six out of seven studies encounter the zero-event problem.","output":"Estimating the reciprocal of a binomial proportion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indoor spread of infectious diseases is well-studied as a common transmission route.

PLpro is released from nsp3 through autocleavage, and then it cleaves the sites between nsp1/2, between nsp2/3 and between nsp3/4 with recognition motif of LXGG, and the sites in the C-terminus of ubiquitin and of protein interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) with recognition motif of RLRGG.

Most studies to date examining outcomes of fresh vs frozen sperm are unable to control for oocyte quality. Studies examining sibling oocytes represent a unique model to control for oocyte quality. A recent small study using this model found worse outcomes in the frozen group. We sought to evaluate, in a large cohort, if fresh and frozen ejaculated sperm are associated with similar pregnancy outcomes by analyzing paired donor egg recipient (DER) cycles. Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort study from 2016-2019 at a large fertility center. Patients who underwent DER cycles where oocytes were split between two couples and one couple used fresh sperm and the other used frozen sperm were included. All patients with uterine factor, male factor or surgically obtained sperm were excluded. Primary outcome was Ongoing pregnancy/Live birth rate (OPR). Secondary outcome included clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and miscarriage rate. GEE analysis was performed to control for confounding factors and donors providing oocytes to both study cohorts. Results: 1255 donor oocytes cycles were screened. A total of 205 unique oocytes donors were identified with oocytes inseminated with discrepant sperm in different recipient cycles. There were 698 recipient transfer cycles, 405 fresh and 293 frozen. Cohorts were similar in baseline characteristics (table 1). There were no differences in OPR/LBR with fresh vs frozen sperm (53.6% vs 55.6%, p=0.7) or clinical pregnancies (66.4% vs 63.5%, p=0.4). Spontaneous miscarriage (<20 weeks) was significantly higher in the fresh cohort (12.3% vs 6.1%, p=0.01). Conclusions: In this large study uniquely controlling for oocyte quality, there are no differences in live birth rate when fresh or frozen sperm was utilized on the same donor oocytes. This type of comparison is important as it helps control as much as possible the oocyte, thus isolating the discrepant sperm state as a determinant of outcome. There was a significant increase in miscarriage rate when fresh sperm was used. Impact Statement: In this large study comparing paired sibling donor oocytes, no difference in live birth rate was seen when couples utilized fresh or frozen sperm. This is particularly important in large donor or international programs especially during the COVID19 pandemic in which it may be difficult for the partner to be present, and a frozen sample may be needed.

According to neurobiological hypotheses, individual differences in cognitive abilities may be attributed to the functioning of genes involved in the regulation of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In addition, genome-wide association studies identified rs17070145 located in the KIBRA gene, which was associated with individual differences in episodic memory. Considering a significant role of genetic and environmental components in cognitive functioning, the present study aimed to estimate the main effect of NGF (rs6330), NRXN1 (rs1045881, rs4971648), KIBRA (rs17070145), NRG1 (rs6994992), BDNF (rs6265), GRIN2B (rs3764030), APOE (rs7412, rs429358), and SNAP25 (rs363050) gene polymorphisms and to assess the effect of gene-environment interactions on individual differences in spatial ability in individuals without cognitive decline aged 18C25 years (N = 1011, 80 % women). Spatial abilities were measured using a battery of cognitive tests including the assessment of 3D shape rotation (mental rotation). Multiple regression analysis, which was carried out in the total sample controlling for sex, ethnicity and the presence of the risk APOE 4 allele, demonstrated the association of the rs17070145 -allele in the KIBRA gene with enhanced spatial ability ( = 1.32; pFDR = 0.037) compared to carriers of the rs17070145 CC-genotype. The analysis of gene-environment interactions revealed that nicotine smoking ( = 3.74; p = 0.010) and urban/rural residency in childhood ( = C6.94; p = 0.0002) modulated the association of KIBRA rs17070145 and  (rs7412, rs429358) gene variants with individual differences in mental rotation, respectively. The data obtained confirm the effect of the KIBRA rs17070145 -allele on improved cognitive functioning and for the first time evidence the association of the mentioned genetic variant with spatial abilities in humans.

Through all the uncertainty, national governments based their responses to COVID-19 on beliefs and political ideas, which was reflected on the diversity of the responses: liberal, authoritarian, centralized, decentralized, transparent, or opaque. In this article we focus on one of these responses, populism, and seek to understand how populist beliefs drive bureaucratic actions taken by a populist government to handle the health crisis. We conducted a comparative case study between the Mexican populist federal government and the non-populist Jalisco state government. Our findings suggest that the administrative actions chosen by the Mexican populist government were based on negative beliefs towards expert scientific knowledge from outside the government; a disinterest in searching for more information from distant or unfamiliar sources; and a strengthening of flagship programs as the main way to address the upcoming economic crisis. We also found that the Mexican government shows a peculiar manifestation of populism, which we refer as downsizing populism.

We report an extremely rare case of acute acalculous cholecystitis on a COVID-19 patient. In our knowledge, this is the first report of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed on a COVID-19 patient. Case presentation: a COVID-19 patient was diagnosed with acute acalculous cholecystitis and a multidisciplinary team decided to perform a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) as the first treatment. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not found in the bile fluid. Because of deterioration of the patients clinical conditions, laparoscopic cholecystectomy had to be performed and since the gallbladder was gangrenous, the severe inflammation made surgery difficult to perform. Conclusions acalculous cholecystitis was related with mechanical ventilation and prolonged total parenteral nutrition, in this case the gangrenous histopathology pattern and the gallbladder wall ischemia was probably caused by vascular insufficiency secondary to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome of COVID-19 pneumonia. The percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTBD) was performed according to Tokyo Guidelines because of high surgical risk. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was next performed due to no clinical improvement. The absence of viral RNA in the bile highlights that SARS-CoV-2 is not eliminated with the bile while it probably infects small intestinal enterocytes which is responsible of gastrointestinal symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Although the lack of evidence and guidelines about the management of patient with acute cholecystitis during COVID-19 pandemic, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, at most preceded by PTGBD on high surgical risk patients, remains the gold standard for the treatment of acute cholecystitis on COVID-19 patients.","output":"Acute acalculous cholecystitis on a COVID-19 patient: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential for the airborne spread of disease has been recognized for many years.

We carried out a systematic review of the literature in January 2020, including major medical databases, and app stores. We used the validated Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to assess the quality of apps, (1 worst score, 3 acceptable score, and 5 best score). We planned to evaluate the accuracy of the mobile apps to detect SCM. We retrieved 335 references through medical databases and 42 from Apple, Google stores and Google Scholar. We finally included two studies of the medical database, 25 apps (eight from the App Store, eight from Google Play, eight from both stores, and one from Google Scholar), and 16 websites. We only found one report on the accuracy of a mobile apps detecting SCMs. Most apps use the imprint, color or shape for pill identification, and only a few offer pill detection through photographs or bar code. The MARS mean score for the apps was 3.17 (acceptable), with a maximum of 4.9 and a minimum of 1.1. The 'functionality' dimension resulted in the highest mean score (3.4), while the 'engagement' and 'information' dimensions showed the lowest one (3.0).

Different scientific societies have published clinical practice guidelines regarding ophthalmic care in the COVID-19 pandemic, but the information is presented inconsistently, which makes decision-making difficult. Methods: We conducted a sensitive bibliographic search in EMBASE and ophthalmic society webpages, of the clinical practice guidelines of ophthalmic care in pandemic COVID-19. We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: \\"Which patients to attend\\", \\"How should the clinic work\\", and \\"What interventions should be avoided\\". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed. Results: Fourteen relevant articles were found. Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table.

These opinions were combined to draw up temporary recommendations to help reorganize practices during the epidemic and prepare the post-critical phase. RESULTS: Most of the recommendations available on career-oriented social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn) or in literature concern cancer or general urology. Eight out of ten propose a cancellation of all functional urology procedures without distinction.

The study's findings suggest that the pandemic-induced lockdown significantly impacted job sectors, increased health risk, anxiety, reduced safety, and income for SE firms. SPs, and SRs worldwide are facing tremendous difficulties operating their activities, frequently changing guidelines to support SPs by financial assistance and SRs by standard services during the COVID-19. This study will help respective authorities and government organizations to determine the appropriate strategies for SE firms to advance their services during critical situations.","output":"A content-based analysis to identify the influence of COVID-19 on sharing economy activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Betamimetics have been used for tocolysis extensively in the past, and one of them, ritodrine is widely used in Japan. Various adverse events have been reported for this agent, including newborn hypoglycemia and hypokalemia, as well as maternal hypokalemia and rebound hyperkalemia; however, cases of neonatal rebound hyperkalemia are not described in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A male infant born at 36 weeks of gestation by cesarean section at a local maternity clinic suddenly entered cardiopulmonary arrest with ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation due to hyperkalemia (K(+), 8.7 mmol/L). No monitoring, examination of blood electrolyte levels, or infusions had been performed prior to this event. Maternal infusion of ritodrine (maximum dose, 170 g/min) had been performed for 7 weeks prior to cesarean section. After resuscitation combined with calcium gluconate, the infant died at 4 months old due to serious respiratory failure accompanied by acute lung injury following shock. No cause of hyperkalemia other than rebound hyperkalemia associated with ritodrine was identified.

The population dynamics of both diseases considers infected individuals of each disease and hosts that are susceptible to one but have recovered from the other. We do not incorporate coinfection. We postulate two main transmission factors affecting the effective contact rates: i) that the virus with higher reproduction number can superinfect the one with lower reproduction number and ii) that there is some protection induced by vaccination against the weaker virus that reduces the probability of infection by the stronger virus. Our results indicate that coexistence of the viruses is possible in the long term. The time-dependent effective contact rate may induce either alternating outbreaks of each disease or synchronous outbreaks.

PARTICIPANTS: Individuals &#8805;18 years with persistent symptoms following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and age-matched healthy controls. INTERVENTION: Assessment of symptoms by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12) and organ-specific metrics by biochemical assessment and quantitative MRI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severe post-COVID-19 syndrome defined as ongoing respiratory symptoms and/or moderate functional impairment in activities of daily living; single-organ and multiorgan impairment (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) by consensus definitions at baseline investigation. RESULTS: 201 individuals (mean age 45, range 21-71 years, 71% female, 88% white, 32% healthcare workers) completed the baseline assessment (median of 141 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection, IQR 110-162). The study population was at low risk of COVID-19 mortality (obesity 20%, hypertension 7%, type 2 diabetes 2%, heart disease 5%), with only 19% hospitalised with COVID-19. 42% of individuals had 10 or more symptoms and 60% had severe post-COVID-19 syndrome. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (87%), breathlessness (88%) and headaches (83%) were most frequently reported. Mild organ impairment was present in the heart (26%), lungs (11%), kidneys (4%), liver (28%), pancreas (40%) and spleen (4%), with single-organ and multiorgan impairment in 70% and 29%, respectively. Hospitalisation was associated with older age (p=0.001), non-white ethnicity (p=0.016), increased liver volume (p<0.0001), pancreatic inflammation (p<0.01), and fat accumulation in the liver (p<0.05) and pancreas (p<0.01). Severe post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with radiological evidence of cardiac damage (myocarditis) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In individuals at low risk of COVID-19 mortality with ongoing symptoms, 70% have impairment in one or more organs 4 months after initial COVID-19 symptoms, with implications for healthcare and public health, which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.

However, the role of endogenous Gln remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the mechanism by which endogenous Gln regulates MKP-1 induction and allergic airway inflammation in an ovalbumin-based murine asthma model. METHODS We depleted endogenous Gln levels using L--glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (GPNA), an inhibitor of the Gln transporter ASCT2, and glutamine synthetase small interfering (si)RNA. Lentivirus expressing MKP-1 was injected to achieve overexpression of MKP-1. Asthmatic phenotypes were assessed using our previously developed ovalbumin-based murine model, which is suitable for examining sequential asthmatic events, including neutrophil infiltration. Gln levels were analyzed using a Gln assay kit. RESULTS GPNA or glutamine synthetase siRNA successfully depleted endogenous Gln levels. Importantly, homeostatic MKP-1 induction did not occur at all, which resulted in prolonged p38 MAPK and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2 ) phosphorylation in Gln-deficient mice. Gln deficiency augmented all examined asthmatic reactions, but it exhibited a strong bias toward increasing the neutrophil count, which was not observed in MKP-1-overexpressing lungs. This neutrophilia was inhibited by a cPLA2 inhibitor and a leukotriene B4 inhibitor, but not by dexamethasone. CONCLUSION Gln deficiency leads to the impairment of MKP-1 induction and activation of p38 MAPK and cPLA2 , resulting in the augmentation of neutrophilic, more so than eosinophilic, airway inflammation.","output":"Glutamine deficiency shifts the asthmatic state toward neutrophilic airway inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Employing recent research results covering cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disorders in frontline medical staff and nurses working with COVID-19 patients, and building my argument by drawing on data collected from ADAA, BMA, Ginger, GWI, MHA, NCAA, NNU, Nursing Times, Pew Research Center, and Statista, I performed analyses and made estimates regarding the mental health of frontline healthcare workers who are caring for COVID-19 patients.

We conducted an empirical qualitative study using semi-structured interviews informed by a cross-disciplinary approach encompassing regulatory science, law, and pharmaceutical policy. In total 25 individuals with experience within biologics participated during September 2018CAugust 2019. Eight participants were EU national medicines authority regulators, and 17 had pharmaceutical industry background: five from two originator-only companies, four from two companies with both biosimilar and originator products, and eight from seven biosimilar-only companies. Two analysts independently conducted inductive content analysis, resulting in data-driven themes capturing the meaning of the data. The participants reported that interchangeability was more than a scientific question of likeness between biosimilar and reference products: it also pertained to regulatory practices and trust. Participants were overall confident in the science behind exchanging biosimilar products for the reference products via switching, i.e., with physician involvement. However, their opinions differed regarding the scientific risk associated with biosimilar substitution, i.e., without physician involvement. Almost all participants saw no need for additional scientific data to support substitution. Moreover, the participants did not believe that switching studies, as required in the US, were appropriate for obtaining scientific certainty due to their small size. It is unclear why biosimilar switching is viewed as scientifically safer than substitution; therefore, we expect greater policy debate on biosimilar substitution in the near future. We urge European and UK policymakers and regulators to clarify their visions for biosimilar substitution; the positions of these two frontrunners are likely to influence other jurisdictions on the future of biosimilar use.","output":"Interchangeability of biosimilars: A study of expert views and visions regarding the science and substitution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has unprecedented implications for public health, social life, and world economy.

We sought to characterize biomarker levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and develop and validate a mortality risk score. Methods and Results An observational cohort study of 1053 patients with COVID-19 was conducted. Patients with all of the following biomarkers measured: troponin-I (TnI), B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, ferritin and D-dimer (n = 446) were identified. Maximum levels for each biomarker were recorded. Primary endpoint was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to construct a mortality risk score. Validation of the risk score was performed using an independent patient cohort (n = 440). Mean age of patients was 65.0  15.2 years and 65.3% were men. Overall, 444 (99.6%) had elevation of any biomarker. Among tested biomarkers, TnI &#8805; 0.34 ng/ml was the only independent predictor of 30-day mortality (adjusted OR 4.38; P < 0.001). Patients with a mortality score using hypoxia on presentation, age and TnI elevation, age (HA2T2) &#8805; 3 had a 30-day mortality of 43.7% while those with a score < 3 had mortality of 5.9%.

As the pandemic spread nationwide, numerous universities shut down with only days notice, and medical students were removed from all patient care settings and restricted from campuses. Yet, the need and curiosity of these future physicians to understand this new disease was great, including how to interpret and integrate rapidly evolving information on the underlying viral and immune mechanisms, pathophysiology, and epidemiology. Time students spent away from patient care settings presented an opportunity to rapidly develop and deliver new curriculum covering SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. METHODS: A team of students and faculty at Indiana University developed a Fundamentals of COVID-19 course that included up-to-date information on the virology, immunology, and pathophysiology of COVID-19. The course was delivered online, with both synchronous and asynchronous activities. Virology and immunology of the coronavirus family, including current knowledge to-date of SARS-CoV-2, were delivered using a series of readings and brief videos, followed by a small group exercise that required students to choose and present to their peers a paper from the scientific literature on COVID-19. A similar approach was used to deliver content about the pathophysiology of COVID-19. To place the COVID-19 experience in context of other pandemics, students researched and educated their small group cohort on another historical pandemic. RESULTS: To measure course effectiveness, we administered a pre-course survey gauging students self-confidence in their knowledge of these topics; the same survey was administered after completion of the course. Surveys from 645 (89% of enrolled) 3(rd) and 4(th) year medical students who completed both surveys were analyzed. Results showed that the course elicited a 57% increase (p< 0.001) in students confidence in their knowledge of COVID-19 virology and immunology and a 64% increase (p< 0.001) in knowledge of the pathophysiology.

COVID-19 strained every aspect of health care to the breaking point, from finances to pharmaceutical supply lines. We can expect more challenges to prescribing in the future, as shown by recent hurricanes in Puerto Rico, fires in California, and ice storms in Texas. When medications become scarce or inaccessible, then clinicians need to make difficult prescribing decisions. We suggest that a culture of deprescribing, a systematic approach to reducing or simplifying medications, could be applied to a wide variety of crises. Deprescribing is defined as the planned reduction of medications to improve patient health or to reduce side effects (see deprescribing.org). It has been used to reduce polypharmacy in geriatric and other complex populations. It provides evidence-based guidance for phasing out many classes of medications. It is part of the larger program to reduce waste in health care and to make pharmacy more rational. Disasters and resource scarcity, however, require a different approach. In contrast to routine care focused on individual patients, crisis standards of care (CSC) shift the clinical focus to the community. Instead of deprescribing guidelines for individual clinicians, CSC deprescribing would be national policies addressing shortages of important medications. We did a scoping review looking for studies of deprescribing in a crisis. METHODS/RESULTS: We extracted 1340 references in Google Scholar 2016 to 2021 using (deprescribing) AND (disaster OR crisis OR climate OR pandemic OR supply lines). A scan of texts found 160 references matching our criteria, and only 19 of them addressed deprescribing as a strategy to strengthen health systems or providers in an emergency. Most of those were related to scarce supplies during COVID, and a few addressed the carbon impact of medications. We also reviewed related literatures on medication supply chain vulnerabilities, WHO Essential Medicines, and healthcare rationing. IMPLICATIONS: Deprescribing gained attention during the COVID pandemic, responding to both disrupted supply lines and improving patient safety. Writers concerned with climate change support deprescribing to reduce the carbon impact of medications. Deprescribing as crisis policy could help streamline national stockpiles, supply chains, and manufacturing. Education could make deprescribing second nature for clinicians, potentially decreasing stress and increasing flexibility in future emergencies. Barriers to deprescribing generally include cultural inertia, industry lobbyists, education, and malpractice fears. In a crisis, deprescribing guidelines could provide clinicians with confidence and flexibility while conserving scarce resources. Research is needed to evaluate deprescribing guidelines for crises, especially ensuring equity in how they reduce polypharmacy and save money.

We report a case of a cancer patient with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC) who manifested SARS-COV-2 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) positivity for at least 54 days after contracting mild COVID-19 illness and propose that deficient mismatch repair (MMR) may have a role in the prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.Case Presentation:A patient with Lynch syndrome was on surveillance for metastatic adenocarcinoma after completion of palliative chemotherapy in October 2019. Between the period of April 2020 to June 2020, he required multiple admissions addressing several clinical needs mainly related to his underlying malignancy. These included progressive disease in the interaortocaval lymph nodes leading to recurrent episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration resulting in acute kidney injury and a short-lived episode of pyrexia. A SARS-COV-2 PCR of the nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was positive at his initial admission with mild COVID-19 symptoms. He remained positive on subsequent admissions when tested routinely for SARS-COV-2 without demonstrating any obvious clinical features of COVID-19 infection.The MMR pathway, a component of DNA damage response (DDR), is impaired in Lynch syndrome due to an inherited genetic mutation. This pathway is also required for viral clearance from the host cells following certain RNA viral infections like influenza virus and other coronaviridae. Here we provide current understanding of the importance of DDR deficiencies in the clearance of RNA virus and suggest how this may play a similar role in the clearance of COVID-19 as evident in our case that demonstrated persistent positivity. Conclusion: The importance of understanding the scientific basis of extended viral shedding during the COVID-19 pandemic is now centre-stage in the establishment of robust track and trace services to allow the recovery and function of societies and economies. We propose that deficient-MMR may contribute to the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Future studies could open new avenues for research and may give rise to epidemiological or early therapeutic interventions.","output":"Deficient DNA mismatch repair and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding: A case report of Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer with COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the synthesis of the dip (di-picolyl-carboxylate) bifunctional chelator system, capable of fast coordination of Cu(2+), (64)Cu(2+) and Co(2+), as well as the [M(CO)(3)](+)-core (M = (99m)Tc, Re); it displays a variety of binding modes--tridentate when protected, tetradentate when deprotected.

Here, we describe an unprecedented \\"ester dance\\" reaction: a predictable translocation of an ester group from one carbon atom to another on an aromatic ring. Specifically, a phenyl carboxylate substituent can be shifted from one carbon to an adjacent carbon on a (hetero) aromatic ring under palladium catalysis to often give a thermodynamically favored, regioisomeric product with modest to good conversions. The obtained ester moiety can be further converted to various aromatic derivatives through the use of classic and state-of-the-art transformations including amidation, acylations, and decarbonylative couplings.","output":"Ester dance reaction on the aromatic ring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, an attempt was made to develop shortcrust pastries containing different amounts of chokeberry pomace (0%, 10%, 30%, 50%), modulating their degree of sweetness via the application of sucrose or erythritol.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on medical services globally and it also affected the field of elective surgery and rehabilitation medicine. Among the most common procedures is the arthroscopic knee surgery, which is an intervention that warrants postoperative physical therapy. METHODS: The study included 105 patients subdivided in three groups, namely those treated before the pandemic, those treated during lockdown and those treated during the pandemic. We compared the decline in the number of patients and the rehabilitation outcome of the referred patients. The rehabilitation outcome was assessed by measuring the range of knee flexion. RESULTS: There were 132 patients included in the analysis of the decline in the number of referred patients during the pandemic. The decline was 36 %. Out of these patients, 105 were included in the analysis of the effectiveness of rehabilitation, and we demonstrated that there were no statistically important differences in improvement among the groups (p=0.246).

Increased home demands, such as caring for young children and remote schooling, interfered with their perceived capacity to meet ideal academic norms, including a singular focus on work, productivity standards, and their ability to signal job competency and commitment. Likewise, work demands reduced their perceived ability to meet ideal mothering norms, such as providing a nurturing presence and focusing on their childrens achievement. Academic fathers experienced increased demands on their time but primarily described intra-role conflict within the work domain.

Purpose of this analysis was to validate this association in a real-world cohort and to find associated factors and confounders for prolonged ATG intervals. METHODS Patients included into the BEYOND-SWIFT cohort (Bernese-European Registry for Ischemic Stroke Patients Treated Outside Current Guidelines With Neurothrombectomy Devices Using the Solitaire FR With the Intention for Thrombectomy; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03496064) were analyzed (n=2386). Association between baseline characteristics and ATG was evaluated using mixed linear regression analysis. The effect of increasing symptom-onset-to-admission and ATG intervals on successful reperfusion (defined as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [TICI] 2b-3) was evaluated using logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS Median ATG was 73 minutes. Prolonged ATG intervals were associated with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (+19.1 [95% CI, +9.1 to +29.1] minutes), general anesthesia (+12.1 [95% CI, +3.7 to +20.4] minutes), and borderline indication criteria, such as lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, late presentations, or not meeting top-tier early time window eligibility criteria (+13.8 [95% CI, +6.1 to +21.6] minutes). There was a 13% relative odds reduction for TICI 2b-3 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79-0.96]) and TICI 2c/3 (aOR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]) per hour ATG delay, while the reduction of TICI 2b-3 per hour increase symptom-onset-to-admission was minor (aOR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94-0.99]) and inconsistent regarding TICI 2c/3 (aOR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97-1.02]). After adjusting for identified factors associated with prolonged ATG intervals, the association of ATG delay and lower rates of TICI 2b-3 remained tangible (aOR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76-0.99]). CONCLUSIONS There is a great potential to reduce ATG, and potential targets for improvement can be deduced from observational data. The association between in-hospital delay and reduced reperfusion rates is evident in real-world clinical data, underscoring the need to optimize in-hospital workflows. Given the only minor association between symptom-onset-to-admission intervals and reperfusion rates, the causal relationship of this association warrants further research.

We conducted a comprehensive search of 11 Chinese and English databases from database inception to January 31, 2020, for eligible papers including empirical studies, reviews, reports, and expert opinion articles. We hand searched references lists and other studies published by the first and corresponding authors of included articles. Two reviewers independently screened articles and extracted data, and three reviewers cross-checked the extracted results. We also conducted quality appraisal for applicable empirical studies. A total of 58 Chinese-language and 63 English-language articles were included, 58 from Taiwan, 44 from Hong Kong, 13 from mainland China, and six from institutions outside China, but none from Macao. The quantitative and qualitative studies described the prevalence and complex nature of IPV, comparable to non-nursing and international studies.

Due to the timeframe involved, these patients may have developed humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 while still testing positive for viral RNA in swabs. Data are lacking on exposure risks in these situations. Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination in an ICU and an isolation ward caring for such COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We collected air and surface samples in a hospital caring for critical and severe COVID-19 cases from common areas and areas proximal to patients. RESULTS: Of the 218 ICU samples, an air sample contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Of the 182 isolation ward samples, nine contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These were collected from a facemask, the floor, mobile phones, and the air in the patient room and bathroom. Serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in these patients at the beginning of the study. CONCLUSIONS: While there is a perception of increased risk in the ICU, our study demonstrates that isolation wards may pose greater risks to healthcare workers and exposure risks remain with clinically improved patients, weeks after their initial diagnoses.

Similarly, brome mosaic virus (BMV) induces two alternate forms of membrane-bound RNA replication complexes: vesicular spherules and stacks of appressed double-membrane layers. The mechanisms by which these membrane rearrangements are induced, however, remain unclear. We report here that host ACB1-encoded acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) binding protein (ACBP) is required for the assembly and activity of both BMV RNA replication complexes. ACBP is highly conserved among eukaryotes, specifically binds to long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, and promotes general lipid synthesis. Deleting ACB1 inhibited BMV RNA replication up to 30-fold and resulted in formation of spherules that were 50% smaller but 4-fold more abundant than those in wild-type (wt) cells, consistent with the idea that BMV 1a invaginates and maintains viral spherules by coating the inner spherule membrane. Furthermore, smaller and more frequent spherules were preferentially formed under conditions that induce layer formation in wt cells. Conversely, cellular karmella structures, which are arrays of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes formed upon overexpression of certain cellular ER membrane proteins, were formed normally, indicating a selective inhibition of 1a-induced membrane rearrangements. Restoring altered lipid composition largely complemented the BMV RNA replication defect, suggesting that ACBP was required for maintaining lipid homeostasis. Smaller and more frequent spherules are also induced by 1a mutants with specific substitutions in a membrane-anchoring amphipathic -helix, implying that the 1a-lipid interactions play critical roles in viral replication complex assembly.","output":"Host acyl coenzyme A binding protein regulates replication complex assembly and activity of a positive-strand RNA virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Methods : England entered its third national lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic on 6th January 2021 with the aim of reducing the daily number of deaths and pressure on healthcare services.

Here, we report data from round 9a of REACT-1 for swabs collected between 4th and 13th February 2021. Results : Out of 85,473 tested-swabs, 378 were positive. Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 0.51%, a fall of more than two thirds since our last report (round 8) in January 2021 when 1.57% of people tested positive. We estimate a halving time of 14.6 days and a reproduction number R of 0.72, based on the difference in prevalence between the end of round 8 and the beginning of round 9. Although prevalence fell in all nine regions of England over the same period, there was greater uncertainty in the trend for North West, North East, and Yorkshire and The Humber. Prevalence fell substantially across all age groups with highest prevalence among 18- to 24-year olds at 0.89% (0.47%, 1.67%) and those aged 5 to12 years at 0.86% (0.60%, 1.24%).

The aim of this study was to identify the perceived barriers to veterinary infection control and HeV management in private veterinary practice in Queensland, where the majority of HeV outbreaks have occurred in Australia. RESULTS: Most participants agreed that a number of key factors had contributed to the slow uptake of adequate infection control measures for the management of HeV amongst private veterinarians: a work culture characterised by suboptimal infection control standards and misconceptions about zoonotic risks; a lack of leadership and support from government authorities; the difficulties of managing biosecurity and public health issues from a private workforce perspective; and the slow pattern of emergence of HeV. By 2010, some infection control and HeV management changes had been implemented. Participants interviewed agreed that further improvements remained necessary; but also cautioned that this was a complex process which would require time. CONCLUSION: Private veterinarians and government authorities prior to 2009 were unprepared to handle new slowly emerging zoonoses, which may explain their mismanagement of HeV. Slowly emerging zoonoses may be of low public health significance but of high significance for specialised groups such as veterinarians. Private veterinarians, who are expected to fulfil an active biosecurity and public health role in the frontline management of such emerging zoonoses, need government agencies to better recognise their contribution, to consult with the veterinary profession when devising guidelines for the management of zoonoses and to provide them with greater leadership and support.

However, the availability of these drugs is limited by their high cost. Infliximab was the first biologic to be approved for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). After its patent expired other manufactures developed biosimilar versions, among which CT-P13, and licensed them thorough an expedite process. AREAS COVERED The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on CT-P13 use in IBD, with particular interest in the phase II trials of a subcutaneous version of CT-P13. EXPERT OPINION Biosimilars, such as CT-P13, are an important resource for health care systems. Although CT-P13 approval in IBD was based on extrapolation, subsequent studies confirmed its clinical equivalence to originator infliximab. A new subcutaneous formulation of CT-P13 showed promising results in phase I and II trials in both CD and UC. Clinical efficacy and safety were comparable and interestingly serum drug doses appeared to be more stable than conventional intravenous CT-P13. If these preliminary results will be confirmed, the first sub-cutaneous version of infliximab could soon be available for IBD.","output":"Evolution of infliximab biosimilar in inflammatory bowel disease: from intravenous to subcutaneous CT-P13."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In human pathology, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes multiple molecular pathways to determine structural and biochemical changes within the different organs and cell types. The clinical picture of patients with COVID-19 is characterized by a very large spectrum. The reason for this variability has not been clarified yet, causing the inability to make a prognosis on the evolution of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed search was performed focusing on the role of ACE 2 receptors in allowing the viral entry into cells, the role of ACE 2 downregulation in triggering the tissue pathology or in accelerating previous disease states, the role of increased levels of Angiotensin II in determining endothelial dysfunction and the enhanced vascular permeability, the role of the dysregulation of the renin angiotensin system in COVID-19 and the role of cytokine storm. RESULTS The pathological changes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the different organs, the correlations between the single cell types targeted by the virus in the different human organs and the clinical consequences, COVID-19 chronic pathologies in liver fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis and atrial arrhythmias, glomerulosclerosis and pulmonary fibrosis, due to the systemic fibroblast activation induced by angiotensin II are discussed. CONCLUSIONS The main pathways involved showed different pathological changes in multiple tissues and the different clinical presentations. Even if ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and the main entry point into cells for the virus, ACE2 expression does not always explain the observed marked inter-individual variability in clinical presentation and outcome, evidencing the complexity of this disorder. The proper interpretation of the growing data available might allow to better classifying COVID-19 in human pathology.","output":"Molecular pathways triggered by COVID-19 in different organs: ACE2 receptor-expressing cells under attack?

The prognostic value of viral load in respiratory specimens remains elusive. In a two-year retrospective study, we determined frequencies of LRTI-D in HM, HSCT and in non-hematological patients, and HPIV-3 levels in respiratory tract secretions. Among 98 patients with HPIV-3 infection, including 31 HSCT and 40 HM, 36 had a diagnosis of LRTI-D.

As an effective framework to quantify the prediction reliability, conformal prediction (CP) was developed with the CPKNN (CP with kNN). However, the conventional CPKNN suffers from high variance and bias and long computational time as the feature dimensionality increases. To address these limitations, a new CP framework-conformal prediction with shrunken centroids (CPSC) is proposed. It regularizes the class centroids to attenuate the irrelevant features and shrink the sample space for predictions and reliability quantification. To compare CPKNN and CPSC, we employed them in the classification of 12 categories of alternative herbal medicine with electronic nose as a case and assessed them in two tasks: 1) offline prediction: the training set was fixed and the accuracy on the testing set was evaluated; 2) online prediction with data augmentation: they filtered unlabeled data to augment the training data based on the prediction reliability and the final accuracy of testing set was compared. The result shows that CPSC significantly outperformed CPKNN in both two tasks: 1) CPSC reached a significantly higher accuracy with lower computation cost, and with the same credibility output, CPSC generally achieves a higher accuracy; 2) the data augmentation process with CPSC robustly manifested a statistically significant improvement in prediction accuracy with different reliability thresholds, and the augmented data were more balanced in classes.

Afterwards, they filled out a questionnaire, which asks the user to answer questions about the experience. These questions were regarding the spatial awareness of the user in the remote location, asking them to estimate different parts of the tour. Their estimations were mapped to the users height, allowing to correlate the difference in height and the users spatial awareness.

Methods: 56 patients underwent emergency trauma upper limb procedures as a day case or with a single overnight stay from 1st March to May 31, 2020 at two central London hospitals that were also key players in the pan-London COVID response. Data was collected retrospectively from clinical and theatre records. Patients were contacted post-operatively and answered a structured questionnaire, including whether patients had experienced any of the symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in the 14 days prior or 30 days following surgery. Results: Of 56 patients, one patient reported COVID-19 symptoms, which were minor and did not require hospitalisation. Five patients experienced minor post-operative complications such as stiffness and scar hypersensitivity; one patient had a superficial wound infection. The mean age was 46 years (20C90) with 68% patients ASA I, 25% ASA II and 4% ASA III. 9% had LA, 30% a regional block and 61% had a GA.

Thirty-seven had a known history of COVID-19 (positive PCR test) in the pregnancy and of those, 17 (47%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 within 30 days of delivery. Fifteen of remaining seventy-six (20%) without a known diagnosis had positive maternal serology. For those with history of COVID-19 we identified robust IgG response in maternal blood to CoV2 nucleocapsid (N), spike (S) full-length and S (RBD) antigens with more modest responses to the S (NTD) antigen. By contrast, the maternal blood IgM response appeared more specific to S (full-length), than N, S (RBD) or S (NTD) epitopes. There were significantly higher maternal and cord blood IgG response not just to CoV2 spike (127.1-fold (SD 2.0, p < .00001)), but also CoV1 spike (21.1 fold higher, SD 1.8, p < .00001) and MERS spike (6.9 fold higher, SD 2.5, p < .00001). By contrast, maternal IgM responses were more specific to CoV2 spike (15.8-fold (SD 2.1, p < .00001)), but to a lesser degree for CoV1 (2.5-fold higher, SD 0.71, p < .00001), and no significant differences for MERS.

Unexpectedly, ACE2 binding enhances dynamics at a distal S1/S2 cleavage site and flanking protease docking site ~27 ? away while dampening dynamics of the stalk hinge (central helix and heptad repeat [HR]) regions ~130 ? away. This highlights that the stalk and proteolysis sites of the S protein are dynamic hotspots in the prefusion state.

Subgroup analysis revealed that the SAA level differences between the severe group and the mild group were associated with age, sample size, and detection method. Sensitivity analyses showed the credibility and robustness of our results. In addition, in six studies involving 1144 patients with severe COVID-19 and 433 patients with critical COVID-19, SAA was significantly higher in patients with critical COVID-19 (SMD=0.476, 95% CI 0.13, 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: High circulating SAA levels were markedly associated with COVID-19 severity, especially for subjects aged less than 50 years, compared with patients with mild COVID-19. SAA concentrations were also significantly higher in patients with critical COVID-19 compared with those with severe COVID-19. Further studies in large cohorts are needed to confirm whether the SAA is a useful tool in discriminating among patients with stable COVID-19, those with acute exacerbations, and subjects without disease.","output":"Association between serum amyloid A levels and predicting disase severity in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study evaluated how news with positive and negative content about COVID-19, as well as a relaxation pause, affect the emotional state.

High coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and aortic valve calcifications (AC) increase cardiovascular risk. Our purpose is to evaluate CACS, measured by Weston Score (WS), and presence of AC in chest CT of COVID-19 patients and possibly to investigate their prognostic role. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study includes 150 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who underwent a chest CT at admission; data were collected from March to May 2020. The case group (Group A) was formed by 50 in-patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) under invasive ventilation (IV), while the matching control group for sex, age and BMI (Group B) was formed by 100 in-patients in non-ICU units, not under IV. After, a second case-control selection was originated from these two Groups: the case group (Group A1) composed by 30 patients selected from Group A, and the matching control group for age, sex, BMI and CT lung severity score (LSS) (Group B1) composed by 60 patients selected from Group B. WS and the presence of AC were compared between Groups A and B, and between Groups A1 and B1. Moreover, LSS and WS were correlated. Parametric tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Among the 150 patients, 105 (70.0%) were male and 45 (30.0%) female. The age was 70.2  13.3 years. LSS was 7.5  3.9, WS was 6.4  3.0; AC was present in 97/150 (64.7%). WS was significantly higher in Group A than in Group B, respectively, 7.4  4.0 and 5.7  2.6 (p=0.0146), and also the presence of AC, respectively, 41/50 (82.0%) vs 56/100 (56.0%) (p=0.0016). In Group B, LSS and WS had a linear positive correlation (r=0.2240, p=0.0405). Finally, WS and AC were significantly higher in Group A1 compared to Group B1. CONCLUSION: Both WS and AC were higher in ICU COVID-19 patients than in non-ICU COVID-19 patients: they could have a predictive role in the worse evolution of the disease. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Coronary artery calcium score and aortic calcification may have a predictive role in the evolution of COVID-19, since both correlate with a higher risk of cardiac disease and this can lead to a worse evolution, with intensive care unit admission and invasive ventilation support.","output":"Coronary arteries and aortic valve calcifications in COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction/Background*With the outbreak of the COVID-19, the National Health Service has had to rapidly adapt many systems.

METHODS: Eighteen untreated early PMR patients and 18 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included. PMR patients received tocilizumab from week 0 to week 12 and glucocorticoids from week 12 to week 24. Leukocytes, neutrophils, platelets, hemoglobin, -globulins, IgG, IgA, and IgM were compared between the PMR patients and HCs and before and after tocilizumab treatment in the PMR group. RESULTS: The mean age was 68  7 and 66  11 years, and the mean serum C-reactive protein level was 82  16 and 5  2 mg/l for PMR patients and HCs, respectively. At inclusion, leukocytes (p < 0.0001), neutrophils (p < 0.0001), and platelets (p < 0.0001) were increased and hemoglobin (p < 0.0001) decreased in the PMR group compared to the HC group. After tocilizumab therapy, leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets decreased, and hemoglobin increased. At inclusion, all four parameters were significantly associated with the serum IL-6 level, though it was not associated after tocilizumab therapy. Levels of -globulin were increased in the PMR patients compared to HCs (p = 0.0087), and PMR patients with -globulins levels over 11 g/l at inclusion responded more quickly to tocilizumab therapy. Autoantibody profiles did not differ between the PMR patients and HCs. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that PMR is more an inflammatory disease than an autoimmune disease. Tocilizumab improves all markers of inflammation. Patients with elevated -globulins respond more quickly to tocilizumab.

Latin American and the Caribbean countries have been harshly affected by the pandemic mainly due to less prepared healthcare systems and fragmented social safety nets. In the region, health status population-based indicators are worse than compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Recent evidence suggests that the progression and severity of COVID-19 are associated with the prior health status of individuals, and studies have shown that the case fatality rate is highly stratified among different populations. This narrative review aims to describe factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in the context of social determinants of health in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In this review, we state that genetic and biological factors interact in a sophisticated way with social determinants of health, impacting the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Behavioral factors, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and unhealthy diets, are related to chronic systemic inflammation. Also, air pollution can prolong inflammation and the hyper-activation of the immune system. Air pollutants could facilitate the spread of the virus. Finally, frailty and comorbidities can be associated with COVID-19 severity through increasing vulnerability to stressors and leading to more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease, including a higher mortality risk. All these factors contribute to increasing the impact of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. We highlight the relevance of considering social determinants of health in Latin American and the Caribbean countries, not only in controlling the likelihood of getting the disease but also its progression and severity. All these social determinants can guide the design and implementation of tailored interventions promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, which should lower the spread of the disease, its severity, and lethality.","output":"Pre-existing conditions in Latin America and factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Community quarantine is controversial, and the decision to use and prepare for it should be informed by specific quantitative evidence of benefit. Case-study reports on 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks have discussed the role of quarantine in the community in transmission. However, this literature has not yielded quantitative estimates of the reduction in secondary cases attributable to quarantine as would be seen in other areas of health policy and cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: Using data from the 2003 Ontario, Canada, SARS outbreak, two novel expressions for the impact of quarantine are presented. Secondary Case Count Difference (SCCD) reflects reduction in the average number of transmissions arising from a SARS case in quarantine, relative to not in quarantine, at onset of symptoms. SCCD was estimated using Poisson and negative binomial regression models (with identity link function) comparing the number of secondary cases to each index case for quarantine relative to non-quarantined index cases. The inverse of this statistic is proposed as the number needed to quarantine (NNQ) to prevent one additional secondary transmission. RESULTS: Our estimated SCCD was 0.133 fewer secondary cases per quarantined versus non-quarantined index case; and a NNQ of 7.5 exposed individuals to be placed in community quarantine to prevent one additional case of transmission in the community. This analysis suggests quarantine can be an effective preventive measure, although these estimates lack statistical precision. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to other health policy areas, literature on quarantine tends to lack in quantitative expressions of effectiveness, or agreement on how best to report differences in outcomes attributable to control measure. We hope to further this discussion through presentation of means to calculate and express the impact of population control measures. The study of quarantine effectiveness presents several methodological and statistical challenges. Further research and discussion are needed to understand the costs and benefits of enacting quarantine, and this includes a discussion of how quantitative benefit should be communicated to decision-makers and the public, and evaluated.","output":"Quantifying the impact of community quarantine on SARS transmission in Ontario: estimation of secondary case count difference and number needed to quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential health and economic value of a vaccine for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is self-evident given nearly 2 million deaths, collateral loss of life as other conditions go untreated, and massive economic damage.

Dedicated incentives and funding focused explicitly on nurturing and advancing competing second and third generation vaccines are essential. This article proposes a collaborative, market-based financing mechanism for the world to incentivize and pay for the development of, and provide equitable access to, second and third generation COVID-19 vaccines. Specifically, we propose consideration of a Benefit-Based Advance Market Commitment (BBAMC). The BBAMC uses health technology assessment to determine value-based prices to guarantee overall market revenues, not revenue for any specific product or company. The poorest countries would not pay a value-based price but a discounted tail-price. Innovators must agree to supply them at this tail price or to facilitate technology transfer to local licensees at low or zero cost to enable them to supply at this price. We expect these purchases to be paid for in full or large part by global donors. The BBAMC therefore sets prices in relation to value, protects intellectual property rights, encourages competition, and ensures all populations get access to vaccines, subject to agreed priority allocation rules.","output":"How Should the World Pay for a Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Vaccine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of third-generation iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) in dual-source, high-pitch chest CT protocol with spectral shaping at 100 kVp in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100 kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the exposure times, and the radiation doses were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (57 M/18F; median age: 63 y.o.) were included, with median pulmonary extension of 13/25 points. The imaging findings were detected in proportion comparable to the available literature. The ADMIRE significantly improved the SNR in LDCT (p < 0.00001) with almost no significant differences in overweight patients. The LDCT had median effective dose of 0.39 mSv and acquisition time of 0.71 s with significantly less motion artifacts than DECT (p < 0.00001). The DECT3 and LDCT3 provided the best image quality and depiction of pulmonary anatomy and imaging findings, with significant differences among all the series (p < 0.00001).

Several specific anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agents are being evaluated by ongoing clinical trials; however, there is currently insufficient evidence for their efficacy and safety in COVID-19 treatment. Given the role of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE) 4 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the inflammatory response, we hypothesize that selective PDE4 inhibition may attenuate the cytokine storm in COVID-19, through the upstream inhibition of pro-inflammatory molecules, particularly TNF-, and the regulation of the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance. Conversely, other anti-cytokine agents lead to the downstream inhibition of specific targets, such as IL-1, IL-6 or TNF-, and may not be efficient in blocking the cytokine storm, once it has been triggered. Due to their mechanism of action targeting an early stage of the inflammatory response and ameliorating lung inflammation, we believe that selective PDE4 inhibitors may represent a promising treatment option for the early phase of COVID-19 pneumonia before the cytokine storm and severe multiorgan dysfunction take place. Furthermore, PDE4 inhibitors present several advantages including an excellent safety profile; the oral route of administration; the convenient dosing; and beneficial metabolic properties. Interestingly, obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2 have been reported to be risk factors for the severity of COVID-19.

The timing of test results and severity of illness has made recruiting study participants a significant challenge. Our pilot study will examine semen from men with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 as well as those in the convalescent phase to determine if SARS-CoV-2 can be detected and its relationship, if any, with the severity of the disease. METHODS: Eighteen men with a median age of 32 (range, 24-57) who tested positive for COVID-19 by rt-PCR analysis were enrolled and provided a semen sample. The study group demonstrated symptoms of COVID-19 ranging from asymptomatic to moderate and none required hospitalization. Samples were subjected to viral RNA extraction and then processed by real-time RT-PCR using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) panel of 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) primers and probes to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Length of time from diagnosis to providing a specimen ranged from 1 to 28 days (median, 6 days). Fifteen participants were symptomatic and three were asymptomatic, including recovering men, at the time of semen collection. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in any of the semen samples. CONCLUSION: Based on these preliminary results and consistent with prior findings, we suggest SARS-CoV-2 is not present in semen during the acute or convalescent phase of COVID-19.","output":"A cohort study of men infected with COVID-19 for presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their semen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we present a robust deep learning pipeline that is capable of identifying correct and incorrect mask-wearing from real-time video streams. To accomplish this goal, we devised two separate approaches and evaluated their performance and run-time efficiency. The first approach leverages a pre-trained face detector in combination with a mask-wearing image classifier trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset. The second approach utilizes a state-of-the-art object detection network to perform localization and classification of faces in one shot, fine-tuned on a small set of labeled real-world images. The first pipeline achieved a test accuracy of 99.97% on the synthetic dataset and maintained 6 FPS running on video data. The second pipeline achieved a mAP(0.5) of 89% on real-world images while sustaining 52 FPS on video data. We have concluded that if a larger dataset with bounding-box labels can be curated, this task is best suited using object detection architectures such as YOLO and SSD due to their superior inference speed and satisfactory performance on key evaluation metrics.","output":"Real-time Face Mask Detection in Video Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Information about the severity of Omicron is scarce. Objective To report the respective risk of ICU admission in patients hospitalized with Delta and Omicron variants and to compare the characteristics and disease severity of critically ill patients infected with both variants according to vaccination status. Design Analysis from the APHP database, called Reality, prospectively recording the following information in consecutive patients admitted in the ICU for COVID-19: age, sex, type of variant, immunosuppression, vaccination, pneumonia, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, time between symptom onset and ICU admission, and in-ICU mortality. Retrospective analysis on an administrative database, Systeme Information pour le Suivi des Victimes (SI-VIC), which lists hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Setting 39 hospitals in the Paris area from APHP group. Participants Patients hospitalized from December 1, 2021 to January 18, 2022 for COVID-19. Main outcomes and measures Risk of ICU admission was evaluated in 3761 patients and Omicron cases were compared to Delta cases in the ICU in 888 consecutive patients. Results On January 18, 45% of patients in the ICU and 63.8% of patients in conventional hospital units were infected with the Omicron variant (p < 0.001). The risk of ICU admission with Omicron was reduced by 64% than with Delta (9.3% versus 25.8% of cases, respectively, p < 0.001). In critically ill patients, 400 had the Delta variant, 229 the Omicron variant, 98 had an uninformative variant screening test and 161 did not have information on variant screening test. 747 patients (84.1%) were admitted for pneumonia. Compared to patients infected with Delta, Omicron patients were more vaccinated (p<0.001), even with 3 doses, more immunocompromised (p<0.001), less admitted for pneumonia (p<0.001), especially when vaccinated (62.1% in vaccinated versus 80.7% in unvaccinated, p<0.001), and less invasively ventilated (p=0.02). Similar results were found in the subgroup of pneumonia but Omicron cases were older. Unadjusted in-ICU mortality did not differ between Omicron and Delta cases, neither in the overall population (20.0% versus 27.9%, p = 0.08), nor in patients with pneumonia (31.6% versus 29.7%, respectively) where adjusted in-ICU mortality did not differ according to the variant (HR 1.43 95%CI [0.89;2.29], p=0.14). Conclusion and relevance Compared to the Delta variant, the Omicron variant is less likely to result in ICU admission and less likely to be associated with pneumonia. However, when patients with the Omicron variant are admitted for pneumonia, the severity seems similar to that of patients with the Delta variant, with more immunocompromised and vaccinated patients and no difference in adjusted in-ICU mortality.

Restricting access to ones own country was a burdensome intervention, but may have been necessary given the global emergency. Thus, the decision restrict citizens entry as a public health intervention warrants ethical analysis to determine its appropriateness. The focus of this paper is on the ethics of the 15-month border closure implemented in Trinidad and Tobago during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology. - Ethical analysis of the COVID-19 border closure in Trinidad and Tobago was done using a six-part ethical framework for public health. Discussion. - The ethical analysis highlights various areas of concern which question the justification for the border closure. The effectiveness, necessity and proportionality of the intervention were justified in the short-term, however, as benefits diminished over time, this did not result in appropriate policy changes. Continuous evaluation of the intervention throughout its use could have improved the balance of benefits and burdens thereby providing stronger ethical validation. Conclusion. - The COVID-19 border closure in Trinidad and Tobago brought substantial burdens upon its citizens without comparable benefits. Data from previous pandemics and the best available data during the current pandemic showed that effectiveness was limited to the initial months, after which it would have been unnecessary to maintain. Thus, the governments decision to prolong the border closure for 15 months, well past its time of effectiveness, was not ethically justified from our analysis.","output":"Locked Out: An Ethical Analysis of Trinidad and Tobagos COVID-19 Border Closure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older multimorbid frail subjects have been severely involved in the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this retrospective study is to compare the clinical features and outcomes of patients admitted in different phases of the outbreak in a COVID-19 hospital hub, with a particular focus on age, multimorbidity, and functional dependency. The clinical records of 1264 patients with clinical and radiological features compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted in February-June, 2020, were analyzed, retrieving demographical, clinical, laboratory data, and outcomes. All variables were compared after stratification by the period of admission (first phase: rising slope of pandemic wave; second phase: plateau and falling slope), age, results of the first reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), multimorbidity (&#8805;2 chronic diseases), and presence of disability. Factors independently associated with hospital mortality were determined by multivariate forward-selection logistic regression. Patients admitted during the second phase were older, more frequently multimorbid, disabled, and of female gender. However, on admission they exhibited milder respiratory impairment (PaO2/FiO2 268, IQR 174-361, vs. 238, IQR 126-327 mmHg, p < 0.001) and lower mortality (22% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). Age, respiratory exchanges, positive RT-PCR test, number of chronic diseases (odds ratio (OR) 1.166, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.036-1.313, p = 0.011), and disability (OR 1.927, 95% CI 1.027-3.618, p = 0.022) were positively associated with mortality, while admission during the second phase exhibited an inverse association (OR 0.427, 95% CI 0.260-0.700, p = 0.001). In conclusion, older multimorbid patients were mainly hospitalized during the second phase of the pandemic wave.

The rapid growth of the epidemic, a health system that had collapsed, and mass gravesites for coping with growing numbers of dead, were broadcast by the media around the world. Moreover, a majority of the local Amazonian indigenous communities were physically distant from appropriate medical services, to the point where warnings of genocide were issued. In a recent Science paper (December 2020), Buss et al. reported that some 76% of the residents of the city of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, had been infected by October 2020. This estimate of the COVID-19 attack rate was based on a seroprevalence analysis of blood donor data, which despite its shortcomings was thought to be a sufficiently reliable proxy of the larger population. An attack rate of this magnitude (76%) implied that herd immunity had already been reached and the community was relatively protected from further infection. Yet in December 2020, a harsh second wave of COVID-19 struck Manaus, and currently appears to be even larger than the first wave. Here we use mathematical modelling of mortality data in Manaus, and in various states of Brazil, to understand why a second wave appeared against all expectations.

The lack of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines, along with the relatively high mortality rate and high contagiousness, has raised strong public concerns over COVID-19, especially for people living in the most severely affected areas. This study aimed to clarify the influencing factors for the anxiety level among the Chinese people during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on the media exposure to different COVID-19 information. METHODS: A total of 4991 respondents were randomly recruited from a national online panel from February 12th, 2020 to February 14th, 2020, a period when the number of COVID-19 cases surpassed 10,000 in a single day, with the total cases in China reaching up to 90,000. The relationships between media exposure of COVID-19 information, social and geographical proximity to COVID-19, risk perceptions were assessed using hierarchical ordinary least squares regression analysis. RESULTS: The media exposure to COVID-19 information was differently associated with anxiety. Meanwhile, the anxiety level was found to be high in respondents who personally knew someone infected with COVID-19 or those who living in an area with reported cases. Respondents who perceived more risks also reported a higher level of anxiety.

Methods: SLE and RA patients aged 18-65 years who completed a series of inactivated, adenoviral vector, or heterogenous adenoviral vector/mRNA vaccines for at least 28 days were enrolled. Immunogenicity assessment was done before and day 15 after each booster vaccination. The third BNT162b2 booster was administered on day 1. Patients with suboptimal humoral response to the third booster dose (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG on day 15 < 2,360 BAU/mL) were given a fourth BNT162b2 booster on day 22. Results: Seventy one SLE and 29 RA patients were enrolled. The third booster raised anti-RBD IgG by 15 fold and patients with positive neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant increased from 0% to 42%. Patients with positive cellular immune response also increased from 55% to 94%. High immunosuppressive load and initial inactivated vaccine were associated with lower anti-RBD IgG titer. Fifty four patients had suboptimal humoral responses to the third booster and 28 received a fourth booster dose. Although anti-RBD IgG increased further by 7 fold, no significant change in neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant was observed. There were 2 severe SLE flares that occurred shortly after the fourth booster dose.

The aim of this retrospective review was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of proactively administered high-dose iron sucrose versus reactively administered low-dose iron sucrose in patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis. METHODS: We analysed the data of 1500 individuals with maintenance haemodialysis who were treated with either high-dose iron sucrose that was proactively administered (Group HD) or low-dose iron sucrose that was reactively administered (Group LD) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from Jan 1, 2008, to Dec 31, 2020. The primary endpoints were the cumulative doses of iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent; the secondary endpoints were the events of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, infection rate, and death from any cause. RESULTS: Of the 2124 individuals, 624 individuals were excluded because they met one or more of the exclusion criteria, thus resulting in 1500 individuals who were eligible for inclusion in the study (Group HD, n = 760 and Group LD, n = 740). The median follow-up for the two cohorts was 32 months (range: 25C36).

The superfamily consists so far of four distinct types of molecules ranging from the simpler low-molecular-weight type I and II cystatins, which function primarily to inhibit lysosomal cysteine proteinases (CPs), to the higher-molecular-weight type III and IV cystatins, which possess additional latent functions expressed only during episodes of injury and inflammation, or have evolved entirely novel inhibitory functions. The role cystatins play in respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD is poorly understood. However, they do modulate the immune response by acting directly on neutrophils, macrophages, and antigen presenting cells. It is also clear that they do not function independently of other proteolytic pathways involved in remodeling of the lung. Limited proteolysis inactivates cystatins allowing lysosomal CP activity to directly contribute to lung tissue degradation and also liberates kinins which signal through G-protein-coupled receptors to cause both constriction and dilation of the bronchioles, pain via stimulation of sensory nerves, mucus secretion, cough, and edema.","output":"PROTEINASE INHIBITORS | Cystatins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pandemics lead to new challenges for healthcare systems and a subsequent shift of the scientific focus, which can partially be seen in alterations in scientific publication activity.

People with physical disabilities might be particularly likely to be negatively affected, but evidence is scarce. Our aim was to evaluate the emotional and social experience of older people with physical disabilities during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected in 2018-19 and June-July, 2020, from participants aged 52 years and older and living in England. Physical disability was defined as impairment in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) and impaired mobility. Depression, anxiety, loneliness, quality of life, sleep quality, and amount of real-time and written social contact were assessed online or by computer-assisted telephone interviews. Comparisons of experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic of people with and without a physical disability were adjusted statistically for pre-pandemic outcome measures, age, sex, wealth, ethnicity, presence of a spouse or partner, number of people in the household, and chronic pain. All participants with full data available for both surveys were included in the analyses. FINDINGS: Between June 3 and July 26, 2020, 5820 participants responded, 4887 of whom had full data available for both the pre-pandemic measures and the COVID-19 survey and were included in the analysis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly more people with ADL impairment had clinically significant symptoms of depression (odds ratio 178 [95% CI 144-219]; p<00001), anxiety (223 [172-289]; p<00001), and loneliness (152 [126-184]; p<00001) than people without ADL impairment. Significantly more people with ADL impairment also had impaired sleep quality (144 [120-172]; p<00001) and poor quality of life than people without ADL impairment. The results were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility. People with ADL impairment had less frequent real-time contact (070 [055-089]; p=00037) and written social contact (054 [045-064]; p<00001) with family than people without ADL impairment.

The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) participants' knowledge, 3) participants' practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Results: The results showed knowledge and practice mean score of (12.911.67) and (21.562.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards 2019-nCoV. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice towards the virus as P<0.05. Conclusions: We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of knowledge and practices towards 2019-nCoV except respondents with socio-demographic characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage adequate preventive practice towards 2019-nCoV should be targeted towards this group.","output":"Socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practice toward novel coronavirus among people living in Mosul-Iraq: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This article provides an overview of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in mainland China and of what we have learned since the outbreak. The epidemics spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two regions: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing and its surrounding areas. The resulting case fatality ratio of 6.4% was less than half of that in other SARS-affected countries and regions, partly due to younger-aged patients and a higher proportion of community-acquired infections. Strong political commitment and a centrally coordinated response were most important for controlling SARS. The long-term economic consequence of the epidemic was limited. Many recovered patients suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, as a consequence of corticosteroid usage during their infection. The SARS epidemic provided valuable experience and lessons relevant in controlling outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, and has led to fundamental reforms of the Chinese health system. Additionally, the epidemic has substantially improved infrastructures, surveillance systems, and capacity to response to health emergencies. In particular, a comprehensive nationwide internet-based disease reporting system was established.","output":"What we have learnt from the SARS epdemics in mainland China?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To analyse the cause of the atmospheric PM(2.5) pollution that occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nanning, Guangxi, China, a single particulate aerosol mass spectrometer, aethalometer, and particulate Lidar coupled with monitoring near-surface gaseous pollutants, meteorological conditions, remote fire spot sensing by satellite and backward trajectory models were utilized during 18C24 February 2020. Three haze stages were identified: the pre-pollution period (PPP), pollution accumulation period (PAP) and pollution dissipation period (PDP). The dominant source of PM(2.5) in the PPP was biomass burning (BB) (40.4%), followed by secondary inorganic sources (28.1%) and motor vehicle exhaust (11.7%). The PAP was characterized by a large abundance of secondary inorganic sources, which contributed 56.1% of the total PM(2.5) concentration, followed by BB (17.4%). The absorption ?ngstr?m exponent (2.2) in the PPP was higher than that in the other two periods. Analysis of fire spots monitored by remote satellite sensing indicated that open BB in regions around Nanning City could be one of the main factors. A planetary boundary layer-relative humidity-secondary particle matter-particulate matter positive feedback mechanism was employed to elucidate the atmospheric processes in this study.

CD8(+) T cell expansions from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were also capable of secreting the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), although in vivo CD8(+) T cell depletion did not significantly alter Mtb burden. Further analysis revealed that pulmonary CD8(+) T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were clonally expanded, preferentially expressing T cell receptor (TcR) V chain 8 (8.2, 8.3) or V 14. Although V8(+) CD8(+) T cells were responsible for the majority of IL-10 production, in vivo depletion of V8(+) did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN- secreting profiles.

Although effective vaccines have been developed, administration has been slow, new variants continue to emerge, and there remains a lack of effective antivirals to treat severe cases. Thus, there remains a significant need to understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication to identify new potential therapeutic targets. To this end, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 might depend on the host cell chaperone system, particularly the essential cytosolic chaperonin, CCT, to fold or assemble any of its proteins. CCT has previously been shown to be required for the replication of several other viruses including reoviruses and zika virus. We screened likely candidates among the SARS-CoV-2 proteins for co-immunoprecipitation with CCT and identified an interaction with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Nsp12. To confirm Nsp12 was a substrate, we depleted cells of CCT, then transfected with Nsp12 and observed a 40% decrease in Nsp12 expression in CCT-depleted cells compared to the control. This decrease is consistent with what we have observed for other known CCT substrates. Additionally, CCT-depleted cells infected with live SARS-CoV-2 produced a 50% decrease in viral titer compared to controls, indicating that CCT is important for viral replication. A preliminary cryo-EM structure of the Nsp12-CCT complex shows a very large mass identifiable as Nsp12 inside of CCT that extends from the equatorial domains up and out through one of the two folding cavities. The structure stands to both reveal an important step in SARS-CoV-2 replication and to answer a long-standing question regarding how CCT can accommodate very large substrates.","output":"Folding of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA Polymerase by the Cytosolic Chaperonin CCT."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate a new therapy for effectively correcting severe hypoxemia in patients with infectious diseases by infusion of oxygen-enriched liquid, in order to raise the partial pressure of blood oxygen without passing through pathologically damaged alveoli of such patients. METHODS Intravenous drip with oxygen-enriched liquids was given to 6 cases suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and 3 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the course of treatment for 1 to 5 days, 500-700 ml per day. RESULTS For all the 9 SARS cases, their hypoxemia was gradually corrected to normal in 20 minutes' or 4 hours' intravenous drip with oxygen-enriched liquid. Respiratory rate decreased from 29-49 breath/min to 18-22 breath/min, heart rate decreased from 89-145 beats/min to 60-79 beats/min, two faint patients regained consciousness, hypoxemia was redressed, partial pressure of oxygen in artery increased from 56 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa) to 87 mm Hg, saturation of oxygen increased from 0.89 to 0.96. CONCLUSION Intravenous drip of the oxygen-enriched liquid effectively helped correct the hypoxemia of SARS and other infectious diseases cases by bypassing the diseased alveoli through which oxygen would not pass into the blood by conventional oxygen inhalation.

Initial analysis suggests that 5% of infected patients will require critical care, and that respiratory failure requiring intubation is associated with high mortality.Sick patients are geographically dispersed: most patients will remain in situ until they are in need of critical care. Additionally, there are likely to be patients who require retrieval for other reasons but who are co-incidentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 or shedding virus.The COVID-19 pandemic therefore poses a challenge to critical care retrieval systems, which often depend on small teams of specialists who live and work together closely. The infection or quarantining of a small absolute number of these staff could catastrophically compromise service delivery.Avoiding occupational exposure to COVID-19, and thereby ensuring service continuity, is the primary objective of aeromedical retrieval services during the pandemic. In this discussion paper we collaborated with helicopter emergency medical services(HEMS) worldwide to identify risks in retrieving COVID-19 patients, and develop strategies to mitigate these.Simulation involving the whole aeromedical retrieval team ensures that safety concerns can be addressed during the development of a standard operating procedure. Some services tested personal protective equipment and protocols in the aeromedical environment with simulation. We also incorporated experiences, standard operating procedures and approaches across several HEMS services internationally.As a result of this collaboration, we outline an approach to the safe aeromedical retrieval of a COVID-19 patient, and describe how this framework can be used to develop a local standard operating procedure.","output":"Decision support tool and suggestions for the development of guidelines for the helicopter transport of patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thymic atrophy or thymus absence causes depressed thyroidCthymus axis (TTA) efficiency in old, young propyl-thiouracil (PTU) (experimental hypothyroidism) and in young-adult thymectomised (Tx) mice, respectively. Altered zinc turnover may be also involved in depressed TTA efficiency. Zinc turnover is under the control of zinc-bound metallothioneins (Zn-MTs) synthesis. Thyroid hormones, corticosterone and nutritional zinc affect Zn-MT induction. Zn-MT releases zinc in young-adult age during transient oxidative stress for prompt immune response. In constant oxidative stress (ageing and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy), high liver Zn-MTs, low zinc ion bioavailability and depressed TTA efficiency appear. This last finding suggested that MT might not release zinc during constant oxidative stress leading to impaired TTA efficiency. The aim of this work/study is to clarify the role of Zn-MTs (I+II) in TTA efficiency during development and ageing. The main results are (1) Old and PTU mice display high corticosterone, enhanced liver MTmRNA, low zinc and depressed TTA efficiency restored by zinc supply. Increased survival and no significant increments in basal liver Zn-MTs proteins occur in old and PTU mice after zinc supply. (2) Lot of zinc ions bound with MT in the liver from old mice than young (HPLC). (3) Young-adult Tx mice, evaluated at 15 days from thymectomy, display high MTmRNA and nutritionalCendocrineCimmune damage restored by zinc supply or by thymus grafts from old zinc-treated mice. (4) Young-adult Tx mice, but evaluated at 40 days from thymectomy, display natural normalisation in MTmRNA and nutritionalCendocrineCimmune profile with survival similar to normal mice. (5) Stressed (constant dark for 10 days) mice overexpressing MT display low zinc, depressed immunity, reduced thymic cortex, high corticosterone, altered thyroid hormones turnover showing a likeness with old mice. These findings, taken altogether, show that corticosterone is pivotal in MTs induction under stress. MTs bind preferentially zinc ions in constant oxidative stress, but with no release of zinc from MT leading to impaired TTA efficiency. Zinc supply restores the defect because zinc has no interference in affecting pre-existing Zn-MTs protein concentrations in old and PTU mice. Therefore, free zinc ions are available for TTA efficiency after zinc supply. Thymus from old zinc-treated mice induces the same restoring effect when transplanted in Tx recipients. However, Tx mice display natural normalisation in MTmRNA and in nutritionalCendocrineCimmune profile in the long run. Therefore, Zn-MTs (I+II) are crucial in zinc homeostasis for endocrineCimmune efficiency during the entire life assuming a role of potential and novel biological clock of ageing.","output":"Metallothioneins (I+II) and thyroidCthymus axis efficiency in old mice: role of corticosterone and zinc supply"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, radiological data and outcome of pediatric cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by neurological involvement. STUDY DESIGN: A computerized search was conducted using PubMed. An article was considered eligible if it reported data on pediatric patient(s) with neurological involvement related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also described a case of an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a 5-year-old girl with SARS-CoV-2 infection: this case was also included in the systematic review. RESULTS: Forty-four articles reporting 59 cases of neurological manifestations in pediatric patients were included in our review. Most (32/59) cases occurred in the course of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Neurological disorders secondary to cerebrovascular involvement were reported in 10 cases: 4 children with an ischemic stroke, 3 with intracerebral hemorrhage, 1 with a cerebral sinus venous thrombosis, 1 with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, 1 with multiple diffuse microhemorrhages. Reversible splenial lesions were recognized in 9 cases, benign intracranial hypertension in 4 patients, meningoencephalitis in 4 cases, autoimmune encephalitis in 1 girl, cranial nerves impairment in 2 patients and transverse myelitis in 1 case. Five cases had Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) and two, including ours, had ADEM. Radiological investigations were performed in almost all cases (45/60): the most recurrent radiological finding was a signal change in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid was proved only in 2 cases. The outcome was favorable in almost all, except in 5 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our research highlights the large range of neurological manifestations and their presumed pathogenic pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Nervous system involvement could be isolated, developing during COVID-19 or after its recovery, or arise in the context of a MIS-C. The most reported neurological manifestations are cerebrovascular accidents, reversible splenial lesions, GBS, benign intracranial hypertension, meningoencephalitis; ADEM is also a possible complication, as we observed in our patient.

Public health agencies need to know that the PHEPR messages sent to HCPs reach their target audience and are effective and informative. We conducted a literature review to investigate the systems and tools used by public health to generate PHEPR communications to HCPs, and to identify specific characteristics of message delivery mechanisms and formats that may be associated with effective PHEPR communications. METHODS: A systematic review of peer- and non-peer-reviewed literature focused on the following questions: 1) What public health systems exist for communicating PHEPR messages from public health agencies to HCPs? 2) Have these systems been evaluated and, if yes, what criteria were used to evaluate these systems? 3) What have these evaluations discovered about characterizations of the most effective ways for public health agencies to communicate PHEPR messages to HCPs? RESULTS: We identified 25 systems or tools for communicating PHEPR messages from public health agencies to HCPs. Few articles assessed PHEPR communication systems or messaging methods or outcomes. Only one study compared the effectiveness of the delivery format, device or message itself. We also discovered that the potential is high for HCPs to experience \\"message overload\\" given redundancy of PHEPR messaging in multiple formats and/or through different delivery systems.

Typically the care coordination for these perioperative homes is run through hospital-funded, on site, pre-anesthesia clinics. Preliminary data from Pediatric Perioperative homes have shown promising results in improved patient outcomes and decreased length of hospital stay. The majority of pediatric surgeries within the country are performed in non-pediatric hospitals. Such centers may not have the infrastructure or financial resources for a free-standing pediatric pre-anesthesia clinic. Faced with this situation at the largest safety net hospital in New England, the authors present their experience designing and implementing a \\"Virtual Pediatric Perioperative Home,\\" a telemedicine-based triage and pre-anesthetic optimization for pediatric patients at Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA. METHODS A retrospective chart review of all pediatric anesthesia cases at Boston Medical Center from February 1st, 2019, to January 31st, 2020, as well as the number of pediatric cases canceled or postponed on the day of surgery for any reason during the same time period was conducted. RESULTS From February 1st, 2019, to January 31st, 2020, 1546 anesthetics were performed in children 18 years and under. Of those, 63 were designated as emergent and hence excluded from our analysis. 153 of the total 1483 (9.4%) of non-emergent bookings were canceled or postponed on the day of surgery. The largest reason for case cancellations (41.8%) was due to the patient suffering from acute illness and thus not medically optimized for surgery. Cancellation rates varied from month to month, with the highest cancellation rate of the year in September 2019 (18.8%). The departments of Podiatry and Gastroenterology represented the highest cancellation rates as a denominator of their case volumes, 15.4% and 15.2% respectively. Younger children had 2.4 times the odds (95% CI: 1.720, 3.4) of cancellation compared to older children. CONCLUSION The authors describe the design and successful implementation of a telemedicine-based pediatric pre-anesthesia triage and medical optimization service at a large safety net hospital. By creating a communication network of pediatric subspecialists, the anesthesiologists were able to, at minimal institutional cost, coordinate care for children with a variety of comorbidities leading up to the day of surgery. This yielded a 9.4% same day cancellation rate in a complex, socioeconomically disadvantaged pediatric patient population at a general hospital.","output":"The Virtual Pediatric Perioperative Home, Experience at a Major Metropolitan Safety Net Hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper postulates the impact of coronavirus on Sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies and resilience to the pandemic.

The underlying economic challenges likely to impede WBG and IMF relief measures in SSA such as health infrastructure and resource deficiency, unsustainable high debt levels and drought effects due to climate change are analysed. Ranking the inadequate doctor-to-population ratio from 2015 to 2017, SSA ratio stood at less than 1 per 1000 population recommended World Health Organisation standard. On the credit front, other creditors such as China have contributed to prevailing economic challenges as China Official Development Assistance (ODA) to SSA debt ratio is depicted at 55% in 2016 from a low ratio of 17% in 2009. The economic challenges are further buttressed by estimated monthly tourism sector loss of US$8.8 billion per month for SSA countries during the pandemic.

Despite the development of effective vaccines, rollout has been slow. We evaluated the impact of accelerated vaccine distribution on curbing the disease burden of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. METHODS: We used an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and vaccination to simulate the spread of novel variants with S-Gene Target Failure (SGTF) in addition to the original strain. We incorporated age-specific risk and contact patterns and implemented a two-dose vaccination campaign in accord with CDC-recommended prioritization. As a base case, we projected hospitalizations and deaths at a daily vaccination rate of 1 million doses in the United States (US) and compared with accelerated campaigns in which daily doses were expanded to 1.5, 2, 2.5, or 3 million. FINDINGS: We found that at a vaccination rate of 1 million doses per day, an emergent SGTF variant that is 20C70% more transmissible than the original variant would become dominant within 2 to 9 weeks, accounting for as much as 99% of cases at the outbreak peak. Our results show that accelerating vaccine delivery would substantially reduce severe health outcomes. For a SGTF with 30% higher transmissibility, increasing vaccine doses from 1 to 3 million per day would avert 152,048 (95% CrI: 134,772C168,696) hospitalizations and 48,448 (95% CrI: 42,042C54,285) deaths over 300 days. Accelerated vaccination would also prevent additional COVID-19 waves that would otherwise be fuelled by waning adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). INTERPRETATION: We found that the current pace of vaccine rollout is insufficient to prevent the exacerbation of the pandemic that will be attributable to the novel, more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants. Accelerating the vaccination rate should be a public health priority for averting the expected surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths that would be associated with widespread dissemination of the SGTF variants. Our results underscore the need to bolster the production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, to rapidly expand vaccination priority groups and distribution sites.","output":"Accelerated vaccine rollout is imperative to mitigate highly transmissible COVID-19 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global health threat. Some COVID-19 patients have exhibited widespread neurological manifestations including stroke. Acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been reported in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is increasingly recognized as a result of acute infection and is likely caused by inflammation, including inflammatory cytokine storm. Recent studies suggest that axonal transport of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain can occur via the cribriform plate adjacent to the olfactory bulb that may lead to symptomatic anosmia. The internalization of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the binding of the spike glycoprotein of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cellular membranes. ACE2 is expressed in several tissues including lung alveolar cells, gastrointestinal tissue, and brain. The aim of this review is to provide insights into the clinical manifestations and pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 can down-regulate ACE2 and, in turn, overactivate the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis and decrease the activation of the alternative RAS pathway in the brain.

Motivated by that, we conducted a simulation study for treatment effect estimation in such scenarios. We compared the performance of two methods for addressing confounding during the process of estimating treatment effects, namely disease risk scores (DRS) and propensity scores (PS) using different machine learning algorithms. Methods: Monte Carlo simulated data with 25 different scenarios of treatment prevalence, outcome risk, data complexity, and sample size were created. PS and DRS matching with 1: 1 ratio were applied with logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XgBoost). Estimation performance was evaluated using relative bias and corresponding confidence intervals. Results: Bias in treatment effect estimation increased with decreasing treatment prevalence regardless of matching method. DRS resulted in lower bias compared to PS when treatment prevalence was less than 10%, under strong confounding and nonlinear nonadditive data setting. However, DRS did not outperform PS under linear data setting and small sample size, even when the treatment prevalence was less than 10%. PS had a comparable or lower bias to DRS when treatment prevalence was common or high (10% - 50%). All three machine learning methods had similar performance, with LASSO and XgBoost yielding the lowest bias in some scenarios. Decreasing sample size or adding nonlinearity and non-additivity in data improved the performance of both PS and DRS. Conclusions: Under strong confounding with large sample size DRS reduced bias compared to PS in scenarios with low treatment prevalence (less than 10%), whilst PS was preferable for the study of treatments with prevalence greater than 10%, regardless of the outcome prevalence.","output":"Use of machine learning for comparing disease risk scores and propensity scores under complex confounding and large sample size scenarios: a simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have demonstrated that female patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) demonstrate more favorable prognosis relative to male patients.

Among HSPCs, we found that the receptor for IL-33, ST2, is expressed preferentially and highly on erythroid progenitors. Induction of inflammatory spondyloarthritis in mice increased IL-33 in BM plasma, and IL-33 was required for inflammation-dependent suppression of erythropoiesis in BM. Conversely, administration of IL-33 in healthy mice suppressed erythropoiesis, decreased hemoglobin expression, and caused anemia. Using purified erythroid progenitors in vitro, we show that IL-33 directly inhibited terminal maturation. This effect was dependent on NF-B activation and associated with altered signaling events downstream of the erythropoietin receptor. Accordingly, IL-33 also suppressed erythropoietin-accelerated erythropoiesis in vivo. These results reveal a role for IL-33 in pathogenesis of anemia during inflammatory disease and define a new target for its treatment.","output":"IL-33 promotes anemia during chronic inflammation by inhibiting differentiation of erythroid progenitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread throughout the globe, affecting millions of people. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this infectious disease a pandemic. At present, several clinical trials are going on to identify possible drugs for treating this infection. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is one of the most critical drug targets for the blockage of viral replication. The aim of this study was to identify potential natural anthraquinones that could bind to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and stop the viral replication. Blind molecular docking studies of 13 anthraquinones and one control drug (Boceprevir) with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were carried out using the SwissDOCK server, and alterporriol-Q that showed the highest binding affinity towards Mpro were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies. This study indicated that several antiviral anthraquinones could prove to be effective inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro of COVID-19 as they bind near the active site having the catalytic dyad, HIS41 and CYS145 through non-covalent forces. The anthraquinones showed less inhibitory potential as compared to the FDA-approved drug, boceprevir. Among the anthraquinones studied, alterporriol-Q was found to be the most potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Further, MD simulation studies for Mpro- alterporriol-Q system suggested that alterporriol-Q does not alter the structure of Mpro to a significant extent. Considering the impact of COVID-19, identification of alternate compounds like alterporriol-Q that could inhibit the viral infection will help in accelerating the process of drug discovery.

This study examined the potential use of catechins, polyphenolic materials derived from green tea, as adjuvants for subunit and inactivated vaccines. Previously, catechins have been documented to have irreversible virucidal function, with the possible applicability in the inactivated viral vaccine platform. In a mouse model, the coadministration of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) with influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigens induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies, comparable to that induced by alum, providing complete protection against the lethal challenge. Adjuvant effects were observed for all types of HA antigens, including recombinant full-length HA and HA1 globular domain, and egg-derived inactivated split influenza vaccines. The combination of alum and EGCG further increased neutralizing (NT) antibody titers with the corresponding hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers, demonstrating a dose-sparing effect. Remarkably, EGCG induced immunoglobulin isotype switching from IgG1 to IgG2a (approximately >64C700 fold increase), exerting a more balanced T(H)1/T(H)2 response compared to alum. The upregulation of IgG2a correlated with significant enhancement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) function (approximately 14 fold increase), providing a potent effector-mediated protection in addition to NT and HI.

We sought to evaluate whether the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to delays in acute stroke management at comprehensive stroke centers. METHODS: Pooled clinical data of consecutive adult stroke patients from 14 US comprehensive stroke centers (January 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020) were queried. The rate of thrombolysis for nontransferred patients within the Target: Stroke goal of 60 minutes was compared between patients admitted from March 1, 2019, and July 31, 2019 (preCCOVID-19), and March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020 (COVID-19). The time from arrival to imaging and treatment with thrombolysis or thrombectomy, as continuous variables, were also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 2955 patients who met inclusion criteria, 1491 were admitted during the preCCOVID-19 period and 1464 were admitted during COVID-19, 15% of whom underwent intravenous thrombolysis. Patients treated during COVID-19 were at lower odds of receiving thrombolysis within 60 minutes of arrival (odds ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.38C0.98]; P=0.04), with a median delay in door-to-needle time of 4 minutes (P=0.03). The lower odds of achieving treatment in the Target: Stroke goal persisted after adjustment for all variables associated with earlier treatment (adjusted odds ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.35C0.85]; P<0.01). The delay in thrombolysis appeared driven by the longer delay from imaging to bolus (median, 29 [interquartile range, 18C41] versus 22 [interquartile range, 13C37] minutes; P=0.02). There was no significant delay in door-to-groin puncture for patients who underwent thrombectomy (median, 83 [interquartile range, 63C133] versus 90 [interquartile range, 73C129] minutes; P=0.30). Delays in thrombolysis were observed in the months of June and July. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation for acute ischemic stroke during the COVID-19 period was associated with a small but significant delay in intravenous thrombolysis but no significant delay in thrombectomy time metrics.

METHODS: An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants taking anxiolytics (n = 163). Participants were randomly assigned using the Qualtrics randomizer algorithm, to a single session of sound-based treatment in one of four parallel arms: combined (music & ABS; n = 39), music-alone (n = 36), ABS-alone (n = 41), or pink noise (control; n = 47). Pre- and post-intervention somatic and cognitive state anxiety measures were collected along with trait anxiety, personality measures and musical preferences. The study was completed online using a custom application. RESULTS: Based on trait anxiety scores participants were separated into moderate and high trait anxiety sub-groups. Among participants with moderate trait anxiety, we observed reductions in somatic anxiety that were greater in combined and music-alone conditions than in the pink noise condition; and reductions in cognitive state anxiety that were greater in the combined condition than in the music-alone, ABS-alone, and pink noise conditions. While we also observed reductions in somatic and cognitive state anxiety in participants with high trait anxiety, the conditions were not well differentiated.

While concentrated research efforts are underway to develop antibody-based vaccines that would neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and several first-generation vaccine candidates are currently in Phase III clinical trials or have received emergency use authorization, it is forecasted that COVID-19 will become an endemic disease requiring second-generation vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike (S) glycoprotein represents a prime target for vaccine development because antibodies that block viral attachment and entry, i.e. neutralizing antibodies, bind almost exclusively to the receptor binding domain (RBD). Here, we develop computational models for a large subset of S proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, implemented through coarse-grained elastic network models and normal mode analysis. We then analyze local protein domain dynamics of the S protein systems and their thermal stability to characterize structural and dynamical variability among them. These results are compared against existing experimental data, and used to elucidate the impact and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations and their associated antibody binding behavior. We construct a SARS-CoV-2 antigenic map and offer predictions about the neutralization capabilities of antibody and S mutant combinations based on protein dynamic signatures. We then compare SARS-CoV-2 S protein dynamics to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to investigate differing antibody binding and cellular fusion mechanisms that may explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks associated with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 over the last two decades suggest that the threat presented by coronaviruses is ever-changing and long-term. Our results provide insights into the dynamics-driven mechanisms of immunogenicity associated with coronavirus S proteins, and present a new approach to characterize and screen potential mutant candidates for immunogen design, as well as to characterize emerging natural variants that may escape vaccine-induced antibody responses. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE We present novel dynamic mechanisms of coronavirus S proteins that encode antibody binding and cellular fusion properties. These mechanisms may offer an explanation for the widespread nature of SARS-CoV-2 and more limited spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. A comprehensive computational characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S protein structures and dynamics provides insights into structural and thermal stability associated with a variety of S protein mutants. These findings allow us to make recommendations about the future mutant design of SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants that are optimized to elicit neutralizing antibodies, resist structural rearrangements that aid cellular fusion, and are thermally stabilized. The integrated computational approach can be applied to optimize vaccine immunogen design and predict escape of vaccine-induced antibody responses by SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Modeling Coronavirus Spike Protein Dynamics: Implications for Immunogenicity and Immune Escape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most common drugs that are consumed by young people are alcohol and tobacco, which are especially prevalent in universities.

The surveyed students demonstrated a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet, which was shown to be associated with less risky alcohol consumption. The Mediterranean diet is a part of healthy lifestyle, and avoiding heavy drinking results in the intention to maintain such a lifestyle. In addition, unhealthy eating habits (skipping breakfast, eating sweets and pastries daily, and fast-food consumption) had a tendency to induce risky alcohol consumption.

COVID-19 is a disease with a very broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic and subclinical infection to severe hyperinflammatory syndrome and death. Methods This study used data from a large longitudinal study of 306 COVID-19 positive patients and 78 COVID-19 negative patients (MGH Emergency Department COVID-19 Cohort with Olink Proteomics). Comprehensive clinical data were collected on this cohort, including 28-day outcomes classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 outcomes scale. The samples were run on the Olink Explore 1536 platform which includes measurement of the ACE2 protein. Findings High baseline levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients were associated with worse WHOmax category at 28 days with OR=0.56, 95%-CI: 0.44-0.71 (P < 0.0001). This association was significant in regression models with correction for baseline characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, and laboratory test results. High levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients were also significantly associated with worse WHO category at the time of blood sampling at both day 0, day 3, and day 7 (P = 0.0004, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.0001, respectively). The levels of ACE2 in plasma from COVID-19 patients with hypertension were significantly higher compared to patients without hypertension (P = 0.0045). The plasma ACE2 levels were also significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing heart conditions and kidney disease compared with patients without these pre-existing conditions (P = 0.0363 and P = 0.0303, respectively). There was no difference in plasma ACE2 levels comparing patients with or without pre-existing lung disease, diabetes, or immunosuppressive conditions (P = 0.953, P = 0.291, and P = 0.237, respectively). The associations between high plasma levels of ACE2 and worse WHOmax category during 28 days were more pronounced in COVID-19 positive patients compared with COVID-19 negative patients but the difference was not significant in the two-way ANOVA analysis. Interpretation This study suggests that measuring ACE2 is potentially valuable in predicting COVID-19 outcomes. Further, ACE2 levels could be a link between severe COVID-19 disease and its risk factors, namely hypertension, pre-existing heart disease and pre-existing kidney disease. The design of the data analysis using the Olink platform does not allow assessment of quantitative differences. However, previous studies have described a positive correlation between plasma ACE2 and ACE1 activity. This is interesting because ACE1 (serum ACE) analysis is a standardized test in most hospital laboratories. Therefore, our study encourages quantitative investigations of both plasma ACE 1 and 2 in COVID-19.","output":"Plasma ACE2 levels predict outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is an unfortunate fact that not only has veterinary education failed to adapt in the face of likely future needs, but it has also failed to respond to societal changes that have already taken place and that have affected the requirements for veterinary services and veterinary capability.

AIM: to estimate the carbon footprint of a Geriatric Medicine clinic, including the effect of virtual consultation and PPE, in order to inform design of a service that addresses both the health of our patients and our environment. METHOD: data from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, NHS Carbon Footprint Plus and UK Government were used to estimate the carbon emissions per consultation. Values were calculated for virtual and face-to-face contact and applied to actual clinics both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: the carbon footprint of a face-to-face clinic consultation is 4.82 kgCO(2)e, most of which is patient travel, followed by staff travel and use of PPE. The footprint of a virtual consultation is 0.99 kgCO(2)e, most of which is staff travel, followed by data use. Using our hybrid model for a single session clinic reduced our annual carbon footprint by an estimated 200 kgCO(2)e, roughly equivalent to a surgical operation.

These sugars act as prebiotics by promoting growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria thereby generating short-chain fatty acids which are critical for gut health. HMOs also directly modulate host-epithelial immune responses and can selectively reduce binding of pathogenic bacteria and viruses to the gut epithelium preventing the emergence of a disease.

This study aimed to elicit and explore the views of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and their ophthalmic care. Methods Between April 29th and September 4th 2020, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with thirty-five patients with nAMD taking part in a larger diagnostic accuracy study of home-monitoring tests. Participants were recruited using maximum variation sampling to capture a range of key characteristics including age, gender and time since initial treatment. Transcribed interview data were analysed using a deductive and inductive thematic approach. Results Three themes emerged from the analysis: i. access to eye clinic care. ii. COVID-19 mitigating factors and care delivery and iii. social and personal circumstances. Participants reported anxieties about cancelled or delayed appointments, limited communication from clinic-based services about appointments, and the impact of this on their ongoing care. Despite these concerns, there was apprehension about attending appointments due to infection risk and a perception that nAMD patients are a high risk group. Views of those who attended clinics during the study period were, however, positive, with social distancing and infection control measures providing reassurance. Conclusions These findings contribute to our understanding about experiences of patients with nAMD during the COVID-19 pandemic and have potential implications for future planning of care services. Innovative approaches may be required to address issues related to access to care, including concerns about delayed or cancelled appointments.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic and ophthalmic care: a qualitative study of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM In patients undergoing congenital cardiac surgery, it is crucial to maintain oxygen demand-consumption balance. Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is a useful indicator of oxygen demand and consumption balance which is an invasive method. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive, continuous monitoring technique that measures regional tissue oxygenation. NIRS that is placed over the internal jugular vein cutaneous area (NIRSijv) has the potential to show ScvO2 indirectly. In this study, we aimed to determine the correlation between ScvO2 with NIRSijv in pediatric patients undergoing congenital cardiac surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty children participated in the study. Four patients were excluded for the inability of internal jugular vein (IJV) catheterization due to technical difficulties. After anesthesia induction, NIRS probes were placed on the IJV site with ultrasound guidance for the measurement of continuous transcutaneous oxygen saturation. The catheter insertion was also done through the IJV from the other side using ultrasound guidance. Cerebral oxygenation monitoring was done using NIRS with a single pediatric probe placed on the right forehead. Values of NIRSijv, cerebral NIRS (NIRSc) and ScvO2, were recorded at certain times until postoperative 24th hour. RESULTS Data were collected at 8 different time points. There was a significant correlation between ScvO2 and NIRSijv in all measurement time points (r = 0.91), (p = 0.001). The mean bias between ScvO2 and NIRSijv was 2.92% and the limits of agreement were 11 to -5.2%. There was a moderate correlation between ScvO2 and NIRSc (r = 0.45), (p = 0.001). The mean bias between ScvO2 and NIRSc was 2.7% and the limits of agreement were +26 to -20%. CONCLUSION In this study, we found a strong correlation between ScvO2 and NIRS measurements taken from the internal jugular vein site. Accordingly, continuous noninvasive monitoring with transcutaneous NIRSijv can be an alternative method as a trend monitor for the central venous oxygen saturation in pediatric cardiac patients undergoing congenital cardiac surgery.","output":"Noninvasive monitoring of venous oxygen saturation by transcutaneous near-infrared spectroscopy in pediatric patients undergoing congenital cardiac surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On Dec. 17, 2020, I woke up with a tickle in my throat.

Due to the significant health and economic burden of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, there is a huge unmet medical need for novel interventions effectively blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unknown details of SARS-CoV-2 cellular biology hamper the development of potent and highly specific SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been reported to be the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. However, emerging scientific evidence suggests the involvement of additional membrane proteins, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Here, we report that syndecans, the evolutionarily conserved family of transmembrane proteoglycans, facilitate the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. Among syndecans, the lung abundant syndecan-4 was the most efficient in mediating SARS-CoV-2 uptake. The S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein plays a dominant role in the viruss interactions with syndecans. Besides the polyanionic heparan sulfate chains, other parts of the syndecan ectodomain, such as the cell-binding domain, also contribute to the interaction with SARS-CoV-2. During virus internalization, syndecans colocalize with ACE2, suggesting a jointly shared internalization pathway. Both ACE2 and syndecan inhibitors exhibited significant efficacy in reducing the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, thus supporting the complex nature of internalization. Data obtained on syndecan specific in vitro assays present syndecans as novel cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 and offer molecularly precise yet simple strategies to overcome the complex nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Contribution of Syndecans to the Cellular Entry of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this rapidly changing and fast-growing world, sustainability is an important paradigm. However, the constantly growing level of uncertainty leads to increased strain in decision making. This results in a growing need for a more effective and extensive approach for identifying project risk in particular events that are not easily detected but can have a severe impact, sometimes referred to as Black Swans or fat tail events. The VUCA meter is a normative approach to identify project risk by assessing in a structured way events that may be volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous and might contribute to the project risk. In this study, the VUCA meter is benchmarked against a traditional risk identification process as recommended by PMI?. Firstly, two workshops, each referring to the respective risk identification method, were conducted. Secondly, a Delphi survey was run to investigate if the VUCA meter would capture Black Swan risk events that are bypassed by the traditional risk identification approach. The results clearly indicate that the VUCA meter can be developed to be a significant addition to the conventional risk identification process for large projects that are at an early stage. The VUCA meter facilitates a discussion that gets people to think beyond the traditional framework for identifying project risk factors.

The association of social support and other factors with uncontrolled blood pressure during the covid-19 pandemic is not well investigated. Therefore, this study explored the determinants of blood pressure control status during the COVID-19 pandemic among patients with hypertension who were on an antihypertensive treatment. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was done from March to May 2021 among adults aged 18 or more patients with hypertension for three months or more on treatment in Dessie City. An interview-administered questionnaire was done using simple random sampling from hypertension follow-up register for 380 patients with hypertension. Blood pressure measurement was taken from their arm using a stethoscope and mercury sphygmomanometer at a sitting position with 90-degree back support. Uncontrolled blood pressure was also computed either the systolic or diastolic blood pressure greater than or less than the limit of uncontrolled blood pressure with regarding the age and diabetic status of patients. The perceived social support-related questionnaire was adopted from the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) -12 item checklist. It was sum-up and transformed into three categories using tertile of their computed raw scores. The adjusted prevalence ratio with a 95 percent confidence interval (CI) was used to calculate the strength of the association between uncontrolled blood pressure and independent predictors using log-binomial regression analysis. A P-value less than 0.05 was declared as statistically significant in multivariable log-binomial regression analysis. RESULT: A total of 360 study participants were included in this study. The prevalence of uncontrolled blood measures in patients with hypertension with a 95% CI was 55.8(50.7, 61.0). In a multivariable analysis adjusted prevalence ratio with 95% CI for poor medication adherence 1.86(1.59,2.19), being male 1.35(1.11,1.64), secondary education 0.52(0.35,0.77), and low social support 1.24(1.01, 1.54) were the predictors of uncontrolled blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Uncontrolled blood pressure for patients with hypertension on treatment is higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being male, poor medication adherence, educational status and low social support are factors that contribute to uncontrolled blood pressure.","output":"Blood pressure control status of patients with hypertension on treatment in Dessie City Northeast Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that exposure to air pollution may increase stroke risk, but the results remain inconsistent. Evidence of more recent studies is highly warranted, especially gas air pollutants. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify studies till February 2020 and conducted a meta-analysis on the association between air pollution (PM(2.5), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 m; PM(10), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 m; NO(2), nitrogen dioxide; SO(2), sulfur dioxide; CO, carbon monoxide; O(3), ozone) and stroke (hospital admission, incidence, and mortality). Fixed- or random-effects model was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR)/hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for a 10 g/m(3) increase in air pollutant concentration. RESULTS: A total of 68 studies conducted from more than 23 million participants were included in our meta-analysis. Meta-analyses showed significant associations of all six air pollutants and stroke hospital admission (e.g., PM(2.5): OR = 1.008 (95% CI 1.005, 1.011); NO(2): OR = 1.023 (95% CI 1.015, 1.030), per 10 g/m(3) increases in air pollutant concentration). Exposure to PM(2.5), SO(2), and NO(2) was associated with increased risks of stroke incidence (PM(2.5): HR = 1.048 (95% CI 1.020, 1.076); SO(2): HR = 1.002 (95% CI 1.000, 1.003); NO(2): HR = 1.002 (95% CI 1.000, 1.003), respectively). However, no significant differences were found in associations of PM(10), CO, O(3), and stroke incidence. Except for CO and O(3), we found that higher level of air pollution (PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), and NO(2)) exposure was associated with higher stroke mortality (e.g., PM(10): OR = 1.006 (95% CI 1.003, 1.010), SO(2): OR = 1.006 (95% CI 1.005, 1.008). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to air pollution was positively associated with an increased risk of stroke hospital admission (PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), CO, and O(3)), incidence (PM(2.5), SO(2), and NO(2)), and mortality (PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), and NO(2)).

The book details content on the methodological facets of undertaking ethnography for prospective researchers to help them to conduct research in both an ethical and safe manner. It highlights important issues such as the role of the researcher as the key research instrument, exploring how one's social behaviours enable the researcher to 'get closer' to his/her participants and thus uncover original phenomena. Furthermore, it invites critical discussion of applied methodological strategies within the global academic community by pushing forward the use of ethnography to enhance the body of knowledge in the field.

ABSTRACT: Vaccination is the primary public health strategy to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although solid tumor and hematologic patients are at higher risk of serious COVID-19-related complications, data on immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines in this patient cohort are particularly scarce. The present study, therefore, aimed at the standardized determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody titers among non-vaccinated versus vaccinated solid tumor and hematologic patients who are under clinical observation or under treatment at the University Hospital Krems. Standardized anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody titers of a total of 441 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Our results show that antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are significantly higher in solid tumor versus hematologic patients. While SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were equal among sexes, an age-dependent decrease was observed. Of note, our studies additionally show that complete vaccination represents a valuable predictor for high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in solid tumor and hematologic patients. In summary, to date, this is one of the largest studies to comprehensively evaluate the impact of various COVID-19 vaccines on anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody production in solid tumor and hematologic patients.

RESULTS The healthcare workers category was placed at the top of the ranking in vaccine allocation priority by 65% of the respondents. Vaccine allocation priority was related to perceived health vulnerability and not economic difficulties. Limited self-preference effects emerged. People who did not consider healthcare workers a priority (1/5 of the sample) had a lower education level, were more worried about COVID-19 infection risk, and did not trust vaccines.

The size limit of cysts and the methodology for a safe and successful minimally invasive surgery has not been established. Here we report a case of a large 10-kg multi-locular ovarian mass, which was successfully laparoscopically removed: Our aim was to innovate the surgical practice in this field by providing a safe, effective, and minimally invasive management method for such complex and rare cases. CASE SUMMARY A 49-year-old nulliparous woman presented with abdominal distension, lasting from six Mo prior to admission; she reported worsening abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, and mild dyspnea. Imaging showed a presumed benign multi-locular (> 10 locules) left ovarian cyst that measured about 30 cm in diameter. Based on the IOTA-ADNEX model the mass had a 27.5% risk of being a borderline or malignant tumor. The patient was successfully treated via a direct laparoscopic approach with salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by the external drainage of the cyst. Tumor spillage was successfully avoided during this procedure. The final volume of the drained mucinous content was 8950 L; the cyst wall, extracted through the minilaparotomy, weighed about 1200 g. The pathologic gross examination revealed a 24 cm  15 cm  10 cm mass; the histologic examination diagnosed a mucinous cystoadenoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a giant multi-locular ovarian cyst treated with a direct laparoscopy with salpingo-oophorectomy followed by external decompression.

The two events were supposed to be correlated, also based on the limited information available about the new virus. Despite that clear indications about the role of particulate matter (PM) in the virus mechanism dispersion cannot be found in literature, some researchers supposed that PM can act as virus carrier, promoting its diffusion through the air.

METHODS: All laboratory\\\\confirmed cases including basic demographic and limited clinical information that were reported to the FluZone surveillance system between April and October 2009 were retrieved. Missing ethnicity data were imputed using the previously developed and validated South Asian Names and Group Recognition Algorithm (SANGRA). Differences between ethnic groups were calculated using chi\\\\square, log\\\\rank and t tests and rate ratios. Geographic clustering was compared using Ripley's K functions. RESULTS: SANGRA identified 2447 (28%) of the total of 8748 reported cases as South Asian. South Asian cases were younger (P < .001), more often male (P = .002) and more often from deprived areas (P < .001) than cases of other ethnic groups.

This review characterizes the course of clinical, laboratory, radiological findings during the primary infection period, and the complications post-recovery. Primary care findings are presented for long-COVID care. METHODS: Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, 4 databases were searched (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Scopus) through December 5, 2020, using the keywords COVID-19 and/or recovered and/or cardiovascular and/or long-term and/or sequelae and/or sub-acute and/or complication. We included published peer-reviewed case reports, case series, and cross-sectional studies providing the clinical course of COVID-19 infection, and cardiopulmonary complications of patients who recovered from COVID-19, while making healthcare considerations for primary care workers. RESULTS: We identified 29 studies across 9 countries including 37.9% Chinese and 24.1% U.S. studies, comprising 655 patients (Mean Age = 45) with various ethnical backgrounds including Asian and European. Based on the WHO COVID-19 severity classification scale, initial disease severity was mild for 377 patients and severe for 52 patients. Treatments during primary infection included corticosteroids, oxygen support, and antivirals. The mean value (in days) for complication onset after acute recovery was 28 days. Complete blood counts and RT-PCR tests were the most common laboratory results described. In 22 of the studies, patients showed signs of clinical improvement and were prescribed medications such as anticoagulants or corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: Post-recovery infectious complications are common in long-COVID-19 patients ranging from mild infections to life-threatening conditions.

The aging lung is transcriptionally characterized by increased cell adhesion and stress responses, with reduced mitochondria and cellular replication. Deconvolution analysis reveals that the proportions of alveolar type 2 cells, proliferating basal cells, goblet cells, and proliferating natural killer/T cells decrease with age, whereas alveolar fibroblasts, pericytes, airway smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and IGSF21+ dendritic cells increase with age. Several age-associated genes directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Age-associated genes are also dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in patients with severe COVID-19.

This report demonstrates a minimal occurrence of adhesions and a low rate of recurrences and other complications related to mesh usage. METHODS Eighty-five re-operated cases after LIVHR were reviewed retrospectively. In every redo surgery, the first trocar was always inserted on a lateral side, external to the previous skin incisions of the transabdominal fixations. Mueller's adhesion scale was used to estimate adhesion severity (Mueller 0 indicates no adhesion; Mueller I indicates adhesion of the omentum; and Mueller II indicates serosal adhesions). The mechanism of recurrence is of paramount interest and is analyzed herein. If recurrence was observed, the defect was closed and a larger mesh of Parietex was implanted under the previous one, with transparietal fixation achieved by pulling the threads with the Endoclose device. RESULTS In all of our \\"second-look\\" surgeries, the neoperitoneum perfectly covered the mesh. In 47.05% of the cases, we observed no adhesions (Mueller 0), 42.3% had adhesions of the omentum (Mueller I), and 10.58% had serosal adhesions (Mueller II). There was no shrinking or wrinkling of the prosthesis in any of the cases, confirming its total peritonization on the anterior abdominal wall. Within the first 3 years, only 4.1% of the controlled patients contracted recurrences, with a mean follow-up of 52 months. CONCLUSION With the double-suturing technique used for LIVHR and the use of a composite mesh, we observed a low rate of recurrences and limited side effects as compared with the use of tacks intra-abdominally. Redo surgeries after LIVHR are feasible, but care must be taken due to unpredictable mesh adhesions.","output":"Eighty-five redo surgeries after 733 laparoscopic treatments for ventral and incisional hernia: adhesion and recurrence analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the effect of the Self-Instructional Guide for Clinical Reasoning on the diagnostic accuracy of undergraduate Nursing students.

Data were collected from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB). This database covers more than 95% of Japanese citizens. Seasonal changes in the number of initiations were determined. Patient claims were also classified according to drugs, districts, gender and ages. RESULTS: The initiation of bDMARDs and MTX administration varied according to the season in a sine curve shape, with the highest numbers in May to July and the lowest numbers in November to January.

MK-p10 S protein had four mutations relative to the original virus S, and one of these (H  R at position 1381, H1381R) in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) was suggested to be responsible for the increased fusion activity. To explore this, we examined fusion activity using recombinant S proteins. We expressed and compared the fusion activity of MK-p10 S, S with the H1381R mutation, S with the three other mutations that were not thought to be involved in high fusion activity, and the original S protein. The MK-p10 and MK-H1381R S proteins induced larger cell fusions than others. We also examined the distribution of these S proteins; the MK-p10 and MK-H1381R S proteins were transported onto the cell surface more efficiently than others. These findings suggest that the H1381R mutation is responsible for enhanced fusion activity, which may be attributed to the efficient transfer of S onto the cell surface. H1381 is a component of the KxHxx motif in the CT region, which is a retrieval signal of the S protein for the endoplasmic reticulumCGolgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC).

Despite the vaccination programmes for a year, hospitalization rates and deaths are still high due to the new variants of COVID-19. Stringent guidelines and COVID-19 screening measures such as temperature check and mask check at all public places are helping reduce the spread of COVID-19. Visual inspections to ensure these screening measures can be taxing and erroneous. Automated inspection ensures an effective and accurate screening. Traditional approaches involve identification of faces and masks from visual camera images followed by extraction of temperature values from thermal imaging cameras. Use of visual imaging as a primary modality limits these applications only for good-lighting conditions. The use of thermal imaging alone for these screening measures makes the system invariant to illumination. However, lack of open source datasets is an issue to develop such systems. In this paper, we discuss our work on using machine learning over thermal video streams for face and mask detection and subsequent temperature screening in a passive non-invasive way that enables an effective automated COVID-19 screening method in public places. We open source our NTIC dataset that was used for training our models and was collected at 8 different locations. Our results show that the use of thermal imaging is as effective as visual imaging in the presence of high illumination. This performance stays the same for thermal images even under low-lighting conditions, whereas the performance with visual trained classifiers show more than 50% degradation.","output":"Automated Thermal Screening for COVID-19 using Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic and its socio-economic impacts have disrupted our health systems and society. We sought to examine informatics and digital health strategies that supported the primary care response to COVID-19 in Australia. Specifically, the review aims to answer: how Australian primary health care responded and adapted to COVID-19, the facilitators and inhibitors of the Primary care informatics and digital health enabled COVID-19 response and virtual models of care observed in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a rapid scoping review complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Two reviewers independently performed the literature search, data extraction, and synthesis of the included studies. Any disagreement in the eligibility screening, data extraction or synthesis was resolved through consensus meeting and if required. was referred to a third reviewer. Evidence was synthesised, summarised, and mapped to several themes that answer the research question s of this review. RESULTS: We identified 377 papers from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Following title, abstract and full-text screening, 29 eligible papers were included. The majority were \\"perspectives\\" papers. The dearth of original research into digital health and COVID-19 in primary care meant limited evidence on effectiveness, access, equity, utility, safety, and quality. Data extraction and evidence synthesis identified 14 themes corresponding to 3 research questions. Telehealth was the key digital health response in primary care, together with mobile applications and national hotlines, to enable the delivery of virtual primary care and support public health. Enablers and barriers such as workforce training, digital resources, patient experience and ethical issues, and business model and management issues were identified as important in the evolution of virtual primary care.

These changes may have overburdened already busy providers with additional administrative tasks, contributing to provider burnout. Our objective was to understand the role of challenges with care coordination in burnout. We analyzed relationships between care coordination challenges with Community Care reported by VA primary care providers (PCPs) and VA PCP burnout. METHODS: Our cross-sectional survey contained five questions about challenges with care coordination. We assessed whether care coordination challenges were associated with two measures of provider burnout, adjusted for provider and facility characteristics. Models were also adjusted for survey nonresponse and clustered by facility. Trainee and executive respondents were excluded. 1,543 PCPs in 129 VA facilities nationwide responded to our survey (13 % response rate). RESULTS: 51 % of our sample reported some level of burnout overall, and 46 % reported feeling burned out at least once a week. PCPs were more likely to be burned out overall if they reported more than average challenges with care coordination (odds ratio [OR] 2.04, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.58 to 2.63). These challenges include managing patients with outside prescriptions or obtaining outside tests or records. CONCLUSIONS: VA primary care providers who reported greater than average care coordination challenges were more likely to be burned out.

As society has embraced technology during the Covid-19 pandemic, the question is: have attitudes towards remote healthcare technology also changed? One particular aspect of healthcare that could be addressed remotely is the collection of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) using a digital voice assistant (DVA) such as the Amazon Echo (Alexa). This could improve both the frequency and quality of data collected. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was developed to evaluate patient and carer opinions on using a DVA to report radiotherapy-related side effects. This was distributed to the adult patients in the radiotherapy department in February 2019 and to the Teenager, Young Adult and Paediatric radiotherapy department in mid 2019. It was redistributed in September 2020, allowing a pre/post Covid-19 comparison. To maximise engagement with the questionnaire, it was decided to ask a small number of simple questions. These four questions sought to ascertain whether the respondent was a patient or carer, respondent age (decade grouping), how knowledgeable they were about the Amazon Echo, and how willing they would be to participate in a hypothetical study in which they would use an Amazon Echo to record the side effects they experienced as a result of their cancer treatment. A comments box was included to allow participants to convey additional information. Results: 85 completed questionnaires were collected in 2019 and 43 in 2020. The median age of the initial survey cohort was 60-69 years old whilst for the second cohort was 50-59 years old. The slight difference in median age of the cohorts is likely a reflection on modifications to clinical practice due to Covid-19. 16% of the initial cohort and 19% of the second cohort were carers. 67% of the initial cohort responded that they had some or good knowledge of Amazon Echo, this increased to 84% in the second cohort (fig. 1). Willingness to participate was highest in the group of patients with good knowledge. 44% of the initial cohort were willing to take part in a study using an Amazon Echo to record side effects, increasing to 58% in the subsequent cohort (fig. 2). However, the percentage of respondents who were not willing to take part also increased from 32% to 37% with a reduction in the number of respondents who didnt know (25% to 5%). Willingness to participate varied with age. Comments were diverse and included concerns about using technology and data security but also positive comments on the potential to reduce hospital visits.

This condition can be more severe if the patient has comorbidities. Failure of viable treatment for such viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is due to lack of identification. Thus, modern and productive biotechnology-based tools are being used to manipulate target genes by introducing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system. Moreover, it has now been used as a tool to inhibit viral replication. Hence, it can be hypothesized that the CRISPR/Cas system can be a viable tool to target both the SARS-CoV-2 genome with specific target RNA sequence and host factors to destroy the SARS-CoV-2 community via inhibition of viral replication and infection. Moreover, comorbidities and COVID-19 escalate the rate of mortality globally, and as a result, we have faced this pandemic. CRISPR/Cas-mediated genetic manipulation to knockdown viral sequences may be a preventive strategy against such pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells (PAC-MAN) along with CRISPR/Cas13d efficiently degrades the specific RNA sequence to inhibit viral replication. Therefore, we suggest that CRISPR/Cas system with PAC-MAN could be a useful tool to fight against such a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Little information is available on the incidence, clinical manifestations and epidemiologic features of HCoV-NL infections. METHODS We performed a prospective study of symptomatic (case subjects with ARTI) and asymptomatic (control subjects undergoing elective surgery) children, <or=3 years of age, hospitalized in Canada during 2 winter seasons (2001-2003), to look at the prevalence of respiratory viruses. Reverse transcription-PCR assays were used to retrospectively detect HCoV-NL and to correlate its presence with clinical symptoms. RESULTS HCoV-NL was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 3.0% of young children (12 of 396 children) hospitalized for treatment of ARTI (case subjects), compared with 1.7% of asymptomatic control subjects (3 of 177 children) (P = 0.6). Nine (75.0%) of the symptomatic children had mixed viral infections. The mean age and mean duration of hospitalization of case subjects were 10.1 months and 4.9 days, respectively. Final diagnoses consisted of bronchiolitis or bronchitis (9 of 12 cases), pneumonitis (1 of 12 cases) and upper respiratory tract infections (2 of 12 cases), although 2 of 3 subjects with single HCoV-NL infections had upper respiratory tract infections only. Sequence analysis of the 1a and spike genes revealed that multiple HCoV-NL strains circulated in the same geographical area in each of the 2 winter seasons. Variability was more pronounced for the spike gene, with 2 clusters of strains.

From these interviews, we learned that participants work was disrupted by dramatic shifts in school and community settings, as well as changes in support needs within their respective school communities. Those disruptions gave way to substantial shifts in practice, which reflect a more prominent role for systemic practice and for traditional social work values in SSW decision-making.

RESULTS: Participants were 316 women (age: 35.9  6.7) with endometriosis, who reported being in an intimate relationship from at least one year. A greater perceived negative impact of the disease on past and current intimate relationships was associated with poorer psychological health, lower relational satisfaction and worse dyadic coping. Women who perceived their partner as more informed about endometriosis, more informed about and interested in their health conditions, and more likely to accompany them to the medical appointments, showed greater relational satisfaction and dyadic coping. Relational satisfaction and dyadic coping were associated with psychological health. A greater perceived negative impact of endometriosis on intimate relationships was associated with more severe pelvic pain (especially dyspareunia). CONCLUSION: Endometriosis has a negative impact on intimate relationships, which is associated with poorer psychological health. For the women with the disease, partner's support is important, and our findings suggest that effort should be made to involve both members of the couple in multidisciplinary treatment.","output":"Quality of intimate relationships, dyadic coping, and psychological health in women with endometriosis: Results from an online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) started to occur in South Korea by means of inflow of the virus from abroad, when a case from Wuhan, China, was first confirmed on January 19, 2020. Although South Korea has drastically reduced the number of new confirmed cases and is stabilizing the situation with its exemplary disease prevention policies, there remains a problem. These are cases that had shown negative results to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (gene amplification) tests as the COVID-19 virus had become undetectable but turned re-positive after a short period. The Central Clinical Committee determined that these re-positive cases after COVID-19 viral clearance are due to the limits of the test method; it is considered that the genetic material of the \\"dead virus\\" remaining in a recovered patient's body is amplified during the test process. Comprehending the above evidence, re-positive cases of COVID-19 are not infectious; the virus is not even reactivated. However, further research is required as we lack research results on this subject.

Understanding and documenting the iterative cycles of improvement can elucidate barriers, enablers and benefits of the process for future adoption and service integration improvements. This project examined the process of local adaptation for a third stage translation of a gestational diabetes dietetic model of care through collaboration with two Queensland (Australia) hospitals. METHODS: Using a hub (research team)-spoke (sites) model, two Queensland Hospital and Health Service Districts were supported to assess and address evidence-practice dietetic model of care gaps in their gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) services. Sites selected demonstrated strong GDM team cohesiveness and project commitment. The project phases were: Consultation; Baseline; Transition; Implementation; and Evaluation. RESULTS: Despite strong site buy-in and use of a previously successful model of care dissemination and adoption strategy, unexpected global, organisational, team and individual barriers prevented successful implementation of the model of care at both sites. Barriers included challenges with ethics and governance requirements for health service research, capacity to influence and engage multidisciplinary teams, staff turnover and coronavirus disease 2019's (COVID-19's) disruption to service delivery. CONCLUSION: This third iteration of the dissemination of a best practice model of nutrition care for GDM in two Queensland Hospital and Health Service Districts did not achieve successful clinical or process outcomes. However, valuable learnings and recommendations regarding future clinical and research health service redesign aligned with best practice are suggested.","output":"Evaluation of the implementation of a best practice gestational diabetes model of care in two Australian metropolitan services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the diagnostic accuracy of CT and initial reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We searched three databases, PubMed, EMBASE, and EMCARE, to identify studies reporting diagnostic accuracy of both CT and RT-PCR in detecting COVID-19 infection between December 2019 and May 2020. For accurate comparison, only those studies that had patients undergoing both CT and RT-PCR were included. Pooled diagnostic accuracy of both the tests was calculated by using a bivariate random effects model. RESULTS: Based on inclusion criteria, only 11 studies consisting of 1834 patients were included in the final analysis that reported diagnostic accuracy of both CT and RT-PCR, in the same set of patients. Sensitivity estimates for CT scan ranged from 0.69 to 1.00 and for RT-PCR varied ranging from 0.47 to 1.00. The pooled estimates of sensitivity for CT and RT-PCR were 0.91 [95% CI (0.84C0.97)] and 0.84 [95% CI (0.71C0.94)], respectively. On subgroup analysis, pooled sensitivity of CT and RT-PCR was 0.95 [95% CI (0.88C0.98)] and 0.91 [95% CI (0.80C0.96), p = o.ooo1]. The pooled specificity of CT and RT-PCR was 0.31 [95% CI (0.035C0.84)] and 1.00 [95% CI (0.96C1.00)]. CONCLUSION: CT is more sensitive than RT-PCR in detecting COVID-19 infection, but has a very low specificity. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Since the results of a CT scan are available quickly, it can be used as an adjunctive initial diagnostic test for patients with a history of positive contact or epidemiological history.","output":"A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic accuracy of initial RT-PCR and CT scan in suspected COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in a large population of adult volunteers from five administrative departments of the Liguria and Lombardia regions.

Participants were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) class antibodies] at three private laboratories (Istituto Diganostico Varelli, Medical Center, and Casa della Salute di Genova). Demographic data, occupational or private exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and prior medical history consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected according to a preplanned analysis. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) was 11.0% [398/3609; confidence interval (CI) 10.0%C12.1%]. Seroprevalence was higher in female inmates than in male inmates (12.5% vs. 9.2%, respectively, p = 0.002), with the highest rate observed among adults aged &gt;55 years (13.2%). A generalized estimating equations model showed that the main risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence were the following: an occupational exposure to the virus [Odd ratio (OR) = 2.36; 95% CI 1.59C3.50, p = 0.001], being a long-term care facility resident (OR = 4.53; 95% CI 3.19C6.45, p = 0.001), and reporting previous symptoms of influenza-like illness (OR = 4.86; 95% CI 3.75C6.30, p = 0.001) or loss of sense of smell or taste (OR = 41.00; 95% CI 18.94C88.71, p = 0.001).

However, the immunoevasive properties of VV have raised safety concerns. VV infection of APCs perturbs MHC class II-mediated Ag presentation. Exposure of human B cell lines to VV induced a substantial reduction in cellular expression of the class II chaperone, invariant chain (Ii), during the late stages (i.e., 8-10 h) of infection. Yet, cell viability and surface expression of MHC class II molecules were maintained up to 24 h after exposure to virus. Reductions in Ii and class II mRNA levels were detected as early as 6 h after VV infection of APCs. To examine whether VV was acting solely to disrupt host protein synthesis, B cells were treated with an inhibitor of translation, cycloheximide (CHX). Within 1 h of B cell CHX treatment, Ii protein expression decreased coupled with a loss of class II presentation. Analysis of Ii degradation in VV- or CHX-treated cells, revealed ongoing Ii proteolysis contributing to reduced steady-state Ii levels in these APC. Yet in contrast with CHX, VV infection of APCs altered lysosomal protease expression and Ii degradation. Virus infection induced cellular cathepsin L expression while reducing the levels of other lysosomal proteases. These results demonstrate that at late stages of VV infection, reductions in cellular Ii levels coupled with changes in lysosomal protease activity, contribute in part to defects in class II presentation.","output":"Diminished intracellular invariant chain expression after vaccinia virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novembre 2019 a marqu un tournant majeur en termes de gestion de crise sanitaire face  la pandmie la plus virulente de lhistoire: la COVID-19.

It is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating, with no compensatory behaviors. BED is often associated with psychiatric comorbidities, and still represents a challenge in terms of treatment strategies. In the last years, neuromodulation has represented a promising approach in the treatment of BED. We report the cases of two women, affected by Bipolar Disorder Type II (BD-II) and comorbid BED, whose BED symptoms improved after a course of accelerated intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS). Methods: We carried out a clinical study, involving neurostimulation on six patients with a treatment-resistant depressive episode. The trial consisted of a 3-week accelerated iTBS treatment, delivered to the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex. Clinical evaluation scales (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Montgomery-?sberg Depression Rating Scale, and Young Mania Rating Scale) were administered at baseline, after 2 weeks, and at the end of the stimulation cycle. Pharmacotherapy was maintained unchanged during iTBS treatment. Patients gave their informed consent both for the protocol and for the publication. Results: The treatment was well-tolerated. Depressive symptoms only slightly improved; however, patients' binge episodes remitted completely, which was a serendipitous finding. BED symptomatology complete remission lasted up to 12 weeks follow-up. Discussion: This is the first study regarding iTBS use in BED in comorbidity with BD-II.

Around the world, researchers are continuously trying to identify small molecule inhibitors or vaccine candidates by targeting different drug targets. The SARs-CoV-2 macrodomain-I, which helps in viral replication and hijacking the host immune system, is also a potential drug target. Hence, this study targeted viral macrodomain-I by using drug similarity, virtual screening, docking and re-docking approaches. A total of 64,043 compounds were screened, and potential hits were identified based on the docking score and interactions with the key residues. The top six hits were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation and Free energy calculations and repeated three times each. The per-residue energy decomposition analysis reported that these compounds significantly interact with Asp22, Ala38, Asn40, Val44, Phe144, Gly46, Gly47, Leu127, Ser128, Gly130, Ile131, Phe132 and Ala155 which are the critical active site residues. Here, we also used ADPr as a positive control to compare our results. Our results suggest that our identified hits by using such a complicated computational pipeline could inhibit the SARs-CoV-2 by targeting the macrodomain-1.

Three different models of thermographic image analyses were used to obtain the mean temperature of 9 ROIs: A) ThermoHuman (automatic definition of ROIs using ThermoHuman? software), B) Manual (manual delimitation of ROIs by proportion criteria), and C) Manual-TH (manual delimitation of ROIs in an attempt to replicate the regions analyzed by ThermoHuman). ThermoHuman resulted in an 86% reduction in time involved compared to manual delimitation. Fourteen of the 120 images (12%) presented some error in one or more of the ROI delimitations. Although the three procedures presented significant differences between them (53% in the comparison between ThermoHuman and Manual, 47% between ThermoHuman and Manual-TH, and 28% between Manual and Manual-TH), all differences had a small effect size (ES 0.2-0.4) or lower (ES < 0.2). Bland-Altman plots showed similar 95% limits of agreement between the three procedures before and after running.

The pandemic disrupted the invitations and participation because of the lockdown and procedures offered because of Covid-19 safety measures since then. Objective: Analysis of the expected impact of the pandemic on early detection of advanced lesions and cancer. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including all invitations 2016-2020 and results estimated (E) and observed (O) in 2020 without and with pandemic. Analysis R v 4.0. Description of measures taken into account to minimize the decrease of activity. RESULTS: Eligible population in BCS O/E were 54.4% (CI 95%: 41.0-41.6; p < 0.05) (85,574 vs 150,534), estimating 202 BC (35 in situ and 167 advanced) not detected.

Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to be transmitted via breastmilk. Moreover, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are presumably contained in breastmilk of mothers with history of COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Direct breastfeeding is the preferred infant feeding option during the pandemic, but conflicting practices have been adopted, which could widen existing disparities in breastfeeding. This study aims to describe how was information about breastfeeding communicated in Mexican media during the pandemic and assess Mexican adults beliefs regarding breastfeeding among mothers infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective content analysis of media coverage on breastfeeding in Mexico between March 1 and September 24, 2020, excluding advertisements, was done. For the content analysis, both a sentiment analysis and an analysis based on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for breastfeeding promotion were performed. Also, we incorporated a descriptive analysis from the July 2020 wave of the ENCOVID-19 survey, which included questions on beliefs about breastfeeding. This information was stratified by gender, age, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: 1014 publications on breastfeeding were identified in internet, newspapers, TV, and magazines. Most information was published during World Breastfeeding Week, celebrated in August. Based on the sentiment analysis, 57.2% of all information was classified as positive, and based on the SWOT analysis, most information was classified either as strengths or opportunities for breastfeeding promotion. However, the ENCOVID-19 data showed that 67.3% of people living in households with children under 3 years of age believe that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed, and 19.8% stated that they simply didnt know. These beliefs showed differences both by gender and by socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: While the Mexican government endorsed the recommendations on breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, communication of those messages was sporadic, inconstant and unequal across types of media. Moreover, there were also negative messages for breastfeeding circulating on the media. There continues to be a widespread notion that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed and, due to differences on beliefs by socioeconomic status, health inequities could be exacerbated.","output":"Breastfeeding Media Coverage and Beliefs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico: Implications for Breastfeeding Equity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face masks have become the bulwark of COVID-19 prevention in the US.

The authors observe that health and education spending coupled with trade-openness stimulate pro-poor growth potentials, whereas conflicts culminate the pervasiveness of poverty in the region. By empirically answering the question of how inclusive is economic growth through the lens of income-distribution and employment, the authors show that growth has been exclusive as per-capita-GDP growth rather dampens income shared by the poorest 20%. Also, it is observed that growth has not been inclusive as the jobless-growth argument remains valid while high inequality further exacerbates unemployment in the region. It is further shown that governance has been generally weak in propelling inclusive growth except where the institutional-component of governance stimulates inclusive growth through improvement in equality and labor employability.Originality/valueThe study jointly examines the metrics of poverty, income distribution and employment to ascertain growth pro-poorness and inclusivity which are key for the achievement of African-union (AU) agenda 2063.

RESULT: In total, 1,560 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study, with a median age of 52 years. The most frequently occurring symptom was fever (67%), followed by cough (37%), malaise/body soreness (11%), pneumonia (11%), and sore throat (8%). Myocardial infarction, heart failure, and renal disease were present in less than 1% of patients. The top ten significant symptom rules (out of 71 generated) showed cough, septic shock, and respiratory distress syndrome as frequent consequents. If a patient had a breathing problem and sputum production, then, there was higher confidence of that patient having a cough; if cardiac disease, renal disease, or pneumonia was present, then there was a higher confidence of septic shock or respiratory distress syndrome. Symptom rules differed between younger and older patients and between male and female patients. Patients who had chronic conditions or died of COVID-19 had more severe symptom rules than those patients who did not have chronic conditions or survived of COVID-19. Concerning chronic condition rules among 147 patients, if a patient had diabetes, prerenal azotemia, and coronary bypass surgery, there was a certainty of hypertension. CONCLUSION: The most frequently reported symptoms in patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough, pneumonia, and sore throat; while 1% had severe symptoms, such as septic shock, respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure. Symptom rules differed by age and sex. Patients with chronic disease and patients who died of COVID-19 had severe symptom rules more specifically, cardiovascular-related symptoms accompanied by pneumonia, fever, and cough as consequents.","output":"Discovering symptom patterns of COVID-19 patients using association rule mining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To summarize the experience of three Chinese cities (Wuhan, Shanghai and Haikou) and provide a reference for global efforts to combat COVID-19 spread among children MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through collecting the measures and outcomes of preventing and controlling COVID-19 in China's three hospitals, we compared the effect of different strategies RESULTS: From January to March 2020, the number of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan increased exponentially, and Wuhan Children's Hospital as a whole was transformed into a designated quarantine and treatment facility, which is the \\"Wuhan Model\\" Shanghai has more children's hospitals with better capabilities to tackle public health emergency Besides, it is far away from Wuhan and had a small caseload Children's Hospital of Fudan University, a facility in Shanghai to treat pediatric infectious diseases, is famous for its well-equipped building for infectious disease treatment and professional medical team, and therefore no major transformation was required That is the \\"Shanghai Model\\" Haikou is located on an island Amid the outbreak, large numbers of tourists and travelers from Hubei had already arrived in Haikou Hainan Women and Children's Medical Center, as the only pediatric care hospital in Hainan Province, did not have a separate building for infectious disease treatment After a citywide survey of the medical resources and facilities available, a temporarily idle hospital 3 kilometers away from Hainan Women and Children's Medical Center was requisitioned as the quarantine and treatment facility for pediatric cases That is the \\"Hainan Model\\" The three models enabled the treatment of all suspected and confirmed cases and no fatality was reported CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 coping strategies for children should be designed according to the existing conditions of the local children's hospitals and the risk levels of the epidemic","output":"China's experience in COVID-19 prevention and control among children in its different regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To assess the role of human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) as a causative agent of non\\\\severe community\\\\acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children.

To uncover mechanisms underlying this adaptative response, RNA-seq and RT-qPCR techniques were employed to reveal global gene expression patterns in S. Enteritidis after sublethal ethanol treatment. It was observed that 811 genes were significantly differentially expressed in ethanol-treated cells compared with control cells, among which 328 were up-regulated and 483 were down-regulated. Functional analysis revealed that these genes were enriched in different pathways, including signal transduction, membrane transport, metabolism, transcription, translation, and cell motility. Specifically, a couple of genes encoding histidine kinases and response regulators in two-component systems were up-regulated to activate sensing and signaling pathways. Membrane function was also influenced by ethanol treatment since ABC transporter genes for transport of glutamate, phosphate, 2-aminoethylphosphonate, and osmoprotectant were up-regulated, while those for transport of iron complex, manganese, and ribose were down-regulated. Accompanied with this, diverse gene expression alterations related to the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and nucleotides were observed, which suggested nutritional requirements for S. Enteritidis to mount the ETR. Furthermore, genes associated with ribosomal units, bacterial chemotaxis, and flagellar assembly were generally repressed as a possible energy conservation strategy. Taken together, this transcriptomic study indicates that S.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utilization of a pharmacist-driven bivalirudin dosing protocol for anticoagulation in the setting of ECMO for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. METHODS This was a single-center retrospective chart review over a 9-month period of patients receiving bivalirudin while on ECMO. All patients with acute respiratory failure requiring ECMO with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction were included. Bivalirudin was dosed via aPTT monitoring after a starting dose of 0.2 or 0.3 mg/kg/h. RESULTS There were 33 patients included in this study, all receiving mechanical ventilation. The most common starting dose of bivalirudin was 0.2 mg/kg/h, with an average time to therapeutic range of 20 hours. Compared to previous reports, rates of bleeding were low at 15.1%, and 6.1% of patients developed a new venous thromboembolic event while on ECMO.

COVID19 was first reported in December, 2019 and after several observations of cutaneous involvement in patients with the disease there was need to document such in literature. The details of the clinical presentation and the pathophysiological mechanisms of these cutaneous lesions are, however, still poorly understood. This is a review of twenty-four published scientific articles summarizing the various cutaneous features observed by the frontline health care givers involved in the management of patients with Covid-19. Maculopapular exanthem was the most common pattern reported, accounting for 44.4% of skin manifestations. The pseudo-chilblain, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid and Kawasaki-like disease patterns accounted for 18.1%, 17.6%, 12.9%, 5.1% and 1.9% respectively. Anumber of the patients (9.5%) developed skin lesions at the time of diagnosis of Covid-19 or at the onset of Covid-19 respiratory symptoms while 75.1% developed the lesions after the onset of Covid-19 respiratory symptoms or after laboratory diagnosis of the disease had been made. There is no gainsaying that apart from the respiratory and other reported systems, Covid-19 also affects the skin. Clinicians, especially dermatologists, should therefore watch out for the already reported skin lesions and for possible yet to be discovered or reported skin lesions in patients with Covid-19.

There are a variety of methods which can be used to develop prognostic models, ranging from logistic regression and survival analysis to more complex machine learning algorithms and deep learning. Despite several models having been created for SARS-CoV-2, most of these have been found to be highly susceptible to bias. We aimed to develop and compare two separate predictive models for death during admission with SARS-CoV-2.MethodBetween March 1 - April 24, 2020, 398 patients were identified with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in a London teaching hospital. Data from electronic health records were extracted and used to create two predictive models using: 1) a Cox regression model and 2) an artificial neural network (ANN). Model performance profiles were assessed by validation, discrimination, and calibration.Results Both the Cox regression and ANN models achieved high accuracy (83.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 73.8 - 91.1 and 90.0%, 95% CI: 81.2 - 95.6, respectively). The area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the ANN (92.6%, 95% CI: 91.1 - 94.1) was significantly greater than that of the Cox regression model (86.9%, 95% CI: 85.7 - 88.2), p=0.0136. Both models achieved acceptable calibration with Brier scores of 0.13 and 0.11 for the Cox model and ANN, respectively. ConclusionWe demonstrate an ANN which is non-inferior to a Cox regression model but with potential for further development such that it can learn as new data becomes available. Deep learning techniques are particularly suited to complex datasets with non-linear solutions, which make them appropriate for use in conditions with a paucity of prior knowledge.

Here, we showed that the Fc fragment display on the polymersome surface resulted in markedly improved interactions with granulocytes, monocytes, and NK cells, while for naked polymersomes, virtually no binding to leukocytes was observed. Moreover, CpG-decorated polymersomes were found to also interact with T and/or B cells. Interestingly, whole blood stimulations with Fc fragment and CpG-decorated polymersomes induced interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and TNF- production, while naked polymersomes did not induce any cytokine production. In conclusion, specific immune induction by polymersomes can be controlled using bimodal targeting of different immune receptors, which is an essential feature for targeted vaccine delivery.","output":"Bimodal Targeting of Human Leukocytes by Fc- and CpG-Decorated Polymersomes to Tune Immune Induction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined respiratory disease short-term disability claims submitted to the Mexican Social Security Institute during 2020.

Eventually, this epidemic was controlled by isolation and there has been no human infection reported since January 2004. However, research on different aspects of the SARS-CoV is not waning, as it is not known if this virus will re-emerge, especially since its origins and potential reservoir(s) are unresolved. The SARS-CoV genome is nearly 30 kb in length and contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs). Some of these ORFs encode for genes that are homologous to proteins found in all known coronaviruses, namely the replicase genes (ORFs 1a and 1b) and the four structural proteins: nucleocapsid, spike, membrane and envelope, and these proteins are expected to be essential for the replication of the virus. The remaining eight ORFs encodes for accessory proteins, varying in length from 39 to 274 amino acids, which are unique to SARS-CoV. This review will summarize the expeditious research on these accessory viral proteins in three major areas: (i) the detection of antibodies against accessory proteins in the serum of infected patients, (ii) the expression, processing and cellular localization of the accessory proteins, and (iii) the effects of the accessory proteins on cellular functions. These in-depth molecular and biochemical characterizations of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, which have no homologues in other coronaviruses, may offer clues as to why the SARS-CoV causes such a severe and rapid attack in humans, while other coronaviruses that infect humans seem to be more forgiving.","output":"Understanding the accessory viral proteins unique to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have performed detailed modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic within the State of Illinois at the population level, and within the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign at a more detailed level of description that follows individual students as they go about their educational and social activities.

Methods: A total of 113 DNA samples from three dog breeds - beagles (BEs), bichons (BIs), and schnauzers (SCs) - were used in subsequent polymorphic tests applying the 14 novel microsatellite markers that were isolated in this study. Results: The results showed that the high level of genetic diversity observed in these novel microsatellite markers provided strong discriminatory power. The estimated probability of identity (P(ID)) and the probability of identity among sibs (P(ID)sib) for the 14 novel microsatellite markers were 1.710-12 and 1.610-5, respectively. Furthermore, the power of exclusion (PE) for the 14 novel microsatellite markers was 99.98%. The neighbor-joining (NJ) trees constructed among the three breeds indicated that the 14 sets of novel microsatellite markers were sufficient to correctly cluster the BEs, BIs, and SCs. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot showed that the dogs could be accurately separated by these 14 loci baled on different breeds; moreover, the Beagles from different sources were also distinguished.

OBJECTIVES: To share our experience in managing SARS-CoV-2 associated pro-coagulant state in hospitalised children. METHODS: D-dimer values were recorded at diagnosis in children hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations. In moderately to critically ill patients and MIS-C cases, coagulation and inflammatory markers were checked at multiple time-points and median results were compared. Pro-thrombotic risk factors were appraised for each child and thromboprophylaxis was started in selected cases. RESULTS: 35 patients were prospectively enrolled. D-dimer values did not discriminate COVID-19 of differing severity, whereas were markedly different between the COVID-19 and the MIS-C cohorts. In both cohorts, D-dimer and C Reactive Protein levels increased upon clinical worsening but were not accompanied by decreased fibrinogen or platelet values, with all parameters returning to normal upon disease resolution. 6 patients had multiple thrombotic risk factors and were started on pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.

Patients with more severe symptoms require intensive management. At our institution, we have had success treating children with severe rumination syndrome using a multidisciplinary intensive outpatient program (IOP) involving multiple treatment sessions daily. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have needed to transition from in-person treatment to telemedicine. The objective of this study is to compare outcomes of patients with rumination syndrome who completed IOP treatment in person versus by telemedicine. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with rumination syndrome by Rome IV criteria and participated in IOP treatment from 2018-2020. IOP consists of intensive medical and behavioral treatment provided by a specialized multidisciplinary team. Until March 2020, this program involved 3 in-person treatment sessions with meals per day for up to a week. Similar treatment sessions were performed during telemedicine visits. We compared outcomes of patients who received IOP treatment in person versus by telemedicine. Families/patients were then asked to complete a survey outlining their child's current rumination symptom severity and review of the IOP. Results: We included 34 patients (79% F, median age 15 years, range 7-19 years) with rumination syndrome who completed IOP treatment. Patients had also been diagnosed with anxiety (17/34, 50%), depression (7/34, 21%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (6/34, 18%), constipation (6/34, 18%), functional abdominal pain (5/34, 15%), eating disorder (5/34, 15%), and superior mesenteric artery syndrome (4/34, 12%). At baseline, 9 patients (26%) required tube feeding or parenteral nutrition compared to 2 patients (6%) at follow up. Twenty-six patients (76%) were treated in person and 8 patients (24%) by telemedicine. There were no significant differences in sex, age, likelihood of anxiety or depression, and duration of IOP treatment between in person and telemedicine groups. The median duration of treatment for both groups was 4 days. Symptom severity at baseline and follow up are described in Table 1. For patients treated in person, 76% (19/25) had improvement in symptoms while 16% (4/25) had complete resolution of symptoms. For patients treated by telemedicine, 88% (7/8) had improvement in their symptoms. There were no significant differences between groups in likelihood of improvement. Of the 34 patients who completed the IOP, 23 (68%) completed both surveys. Overall, 78% (18/23) preferred in person therapy while 17% (4/23) did not have a preference. Of the telemedicine patients, 60% (3/5) would have preferred in-person IOP. All 18 of the in-person cohort preferred in-person management. When asked to elaborate, 4 families expressed similar answers including the need for in-person interaction, having a hands-on approach, and because the psychologist can give body instructions. Other reported strengths of in-person treatment included a majority of families believing this would lead to a stronger connection with the provider (90%, 19/21), fewer distractions (86%, 18/21), and noting treatment would be more effective in person (76%, 16/21). In-person challenges included transportation and parking (63%, 12/19) as well as concerns about time commitment (84%, 16/19). The primary strengths of online treatment were that it saves time (72%,13/18) and some parents felt their child was more comfortable at home (39%,7/18). One family described that it was easier to integrate habits at home after completing the process online. Online challenges included having more distractions (81%, 13/16) and some parents felt their child was more comfortable talking to someone in person (75%, 12/16). Conclusion: Although multidisciplinary intensive outpatient treatment for children and adolescents with severe rumination syndrome is effective and the likelihood of improvement appears similar when completed in person or by telemedicine, the majority of families prefer in-person therapy.","output":"Intensive outpatient treatment of pediatric rumination syndrome in the era of telemedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple preventive COVID-19 vaccines have been developed during the ongoing SARS coronavirus (CoV) 2 pandemic, utilizing a variety of technology platforms, which have different properties, advantages, and disadvantages. The acceleration in vaccine development required to combat the current pandemic is not at the expense of the necessary regulatory requirements, including robust and comprehensive data collection along with clinical product safety and efficacy evaluation. Due to the previous development of vaccine candidates against the related highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the antigen that elicits immune protection is known: the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or specific domains encoded in that protein, e.g., the receptor binding domain. From a scientific point of view and in accordance with legal frameworks and regulatory practices, for the approval of a clinic trial, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut requires preclinical testing of vaccine candidates, including general pharmacology and toxicology as well as immunogenicity. For COVID-19 vaccine candidates, based on existing platform technologies with a sufficiently broad data base, pharmacologicalCtoxicological testing in the case of repeated administration, quantifying systemic distribution, and proof of vaccination protection in animal models can be carried out in parallel to phase 1 or 1/2 clinical trials. To reduce the theoretical risk of an increased respiratory illness through infection-enhancing antibodies or as a result of Th2 polarization and altered cytokine profiles of the immune response following vaccination, which are of specific concern for COVID-19 vaccines, appropriate investigative testing is imperative. In general, phase 1 (vaccine safety) and 2 (dose finding, vaccination schedule) clinical trials can be combined, and combined phase 2/3 trials are recommended to determine safety and efficacy. By applying these fundamental requirements not only for the approval and analysis of clinical trials but also for the regulatory evaluation during the assessment of marketing authorization applications, several efficacious and safe COVID-19 vaccines have been licensed in the EU by unprecedentedly fast and flexible procedures.

Here I argue that a universal mandatory vaccination policy for the general public against the COVID-19 pandemic is ethically preferable when grounded in the concept of solidarity, which is defined by Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx as an enacted commitment to a relevant respect recognized by a group of individuals with equal moral status. This approach is complementary to utilitarian accounts and could better address other reasonable oppositions to mandatory vaccination. From a solidaristic account, the recognized relevant respect is to end the COVID-19 pandemic as soon as possible. This group of individuals would be willing to carry costs to assist each other in this respect, and a mandatory vaccination policy could be their institutionalized mutual assistance. The costs to be carried include both the financial costs of vaccination and the health costs stemming from potential adverse events and scientific uncertainties. The proposed social health insurance similarity test suggests the degree of coercion the mandatory vaccination policy could undertake within each state's specific legal and judicial context.

The eight-week program targeted six resilience factors: cognitive flexibility, coping, self-efficacy, self-esteem, self-care, and mindfulness. Compared to the control group, the intervention group reported a significant improvement in the primary outcome mental health (measured with the General Health Questionnaire) from pre-test (M = 20.79; SD = 9.85) to post-test (M = 15.81; SD = 7.13) with an estimated medium effect size (p = 0.03, (2) = 0.08) at post-test.

Methods: We extracted passenger volume data for the entire global airline network, as well as the dates of the implementation of travel restrictions and the observation of the first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in each country or territory, from publicly available sources. We calculated effective distance between every airport and the city of Wuhan, China. We modelled the risk of SARS-CoV-2 importation by estimating survival probability, expressing median time of importation as a function of effective distance. We calculated the relative change in importation risk under three different hypothetical scenarios that all resulted in different passenger volumes. Findings: We identified 28 countries with imported cases of COVID-19 as at 26 February 2020. The arrival time of the virus at these countries ranged from 39 to 80 days since identification of the first case in Wuhan. Our analysis of relative change in risk indicated that strategies of reducing global passenger volume and imposing travel restrictions at a further 10 hub airports would be equally effective in reducing the risk of importation of SARS-CoV-2; however, this reduction is very limited with a close-to-zero median relative change in risk. Conclusion: The hypothetical variations in observed travel restrictions were not sufficient to prevent the global spread of SARS-CoV-2; further research should also consider travel by land and sea.

In the phase of severe undernutrition, these patients may exhibit disturbances in their immune functions. Based on this observation, many French practitioners had chosen to avoid long hospitalizations during the first wave of COVID-19. They had in mind a risk of contagion between adolescents, in which infections can be frequently asymptomatic. Fear of an increased risk of a severe form of COVID-19 in AN patients has led to early returns home, where they would probably be safer than in our departments. Is this strategy still relevant for the second wave? Has an increased risk of a severe form been identified in the adolescent AN patients? Method: We have recalled the French recommendations on the subject. Then we carried out a review of the international literature via Medline, Google Scholar as well as data from the American organization Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: The evolution of knowledge about the pandemic has clearly established a lower risk of infection in adolescents than in adults. It seems that the virus spares this population, most of them remaining asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic. Reassuringly, AN or low body weight has not been shown to pose a risk for the severe form of COVID-19. Conversely, the literature reports that lockdown worsens the symptoms of AN (food restriction, hyperactivity) in at least a third of these patients. Most of the patients expressed a high level of anxiety during the first lockdown. It may even have been difficult for these patients to continue to access care when they were confined. Conclusion: In the end, it seems wise not to reproduce the strategy of early return home in adolescents with AN. Current data support the need for continuity of care, as well as the continuation of hospital care when necessary, while a too rapid discharge runs the risk of destabilizing the patient in an already long and difficult course of care in the usual time. ? 2021","output":"Second wave: What about patients with anorexia nervosa hospitalized in child and adolescent psychiatry?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the world is being ravaged by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes a severe respiratory disease, Covid-19.

Despite these efforts, the WHO warned that the virus might never be eradicated. Countries around the world have instated non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and wearing of masks in public to curb the spreading of the disease. Antiviral polysaccharides provide the ideal opportunity to combat the pathogen via pharmacotherapeutic applications. However, a layer-by-layer nanocoating approach is also envisioned to coat surfaces to which humans are exposed that could harbor pathogenic coronaviruses. By coating masks, clothing, and work surfaces in wet markets among others, these antiviral polysaccharides can ensure passive prevention of the spreading of the virus. It poses a so-called eradicate-in-place measure against the virus. Antiviral polysaccharides also provide a green chemistry pathway to virus eradication since these molecules are primarily of biological origin and can be modified by minimal synthetic approaches.

Although the severity of new cases of SARS-CoV-2 has progressively decreased, and the pressure on national health systems has declined, the development of de novo glomerular injuries has been suggested. METHODS: This study aimed to examine the patients who were hospitalized in our Unit between April and November 2021 and underwent renal biopsy for new-onset urinary abnormalities (UA) and/or renal impairment within 3 months of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. RESULTS: We identified 17 patients who developed UA and/or renal insufficiency within 3 months of vaccination. Minimal change disease was the most common disease in our cohort (5 patients, 29.4%) followed by acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN; 3 patients, 17.6%), membranous nephropathy (3 patients, 17.6%), and rapidly progressive IgA nephropathy (2 patients, 11.8%). The other 4 patients had a diagnosis of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (1 patient), systemic lupus erythematosus (1 patient), ANCA-associated vasculitis (1 patient), and tip-variant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (1 patient), respectively. Eight out of the 17 patients (47.1%) developed acute kidney injury. Two patients with acute TIN had to start hemodialysis that was discontinued after 1 and 2 months, respectively, due to the recovery of renal function. All patients underwent treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants. DISCUSSION: Although it is not possible to conclusively determine whether there is a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and new-onset nephropathies, based on the appearance of UA and/or renal insufficiency shortly after vaccination, we hypothesize that the immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine may be a trigger of nephropathies. Therefore, our results highlight the need for pharmacovigilance.

To overcome gaps in connecting patients hospitalized with heart failure to DM, we implemented a novel warm handoff referral between hospital providers and payer DM using the Implementation Research Logic Model (IRLM). METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A research and quality improvement team collaborated with champions from one hospital and three payers to build and pilot an inpatient-based referral for hospitalized patients with heart failure who were beneficiaries of one of three payers. The standard process of payers initiating contact with patients by phone was restructured to enable inpatient teams to initiate referrals by screening eligible patients prior to discharge. Between August 2020 and October 2021, 285 patients were hospitalized and eligible for screening. Patient registries were built to track patient referral, eligibility, and enrollment status. Monthly stakeholder meetings were used to collect referral rates and review barriers and facilitators related to implementation. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Of the 63.6% (N=168) patients screened, 31.4% (N=83) were referred, 17.4% (N=46) declined referral, and 14.8% (N=39) were deemed ineligible by payers. Inpatient screenings were challenged by variability across five units with incomplete/missed referrals, primarily attributed to COVID-19-related staff shortages. Payers were challenged by delayed/incomplete referrals and varying access to the hospitals EHRs. Building patient registries helped inpatient champions track eligibility and referral status, and centralizing screening to one champion improved screening rates and reduced incomplete referrals. Additional challenges being addressed include clarifying each payers unique eligibility requirements, refining payers review of referral emails, and creating descriptions of DM for patients. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Implementing inpatient-based DM referrals requires patient and staff engagement, real-time data sharing, and iterative process improvement.

METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted between February 21 and April 16, 2020, in the Padua University Hospital (north-east Italy). The infection control policy adopted consisted of the following: the creation of the \\"Advanced Triage\\" area for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 cases, and the implementation of an integrated infection control surveillance system directed to all the healthcare personnel involved in the Advance Triage area. HCWs were regularly tested with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; body temperature and suggestive symptoms were evaluated at each duty. Demographic and clinical data of both patients and HCWs were collected and analyzed; HCWs' personal protective equipment (PPE) consumption was also recorded. The efficiency of the control strategy among HCWs was evaluated identifying symptomatic infection (primary endpoint) and asymptomatic infection (secondary endpoint) with confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2.

In this regard, we conducted a meta-analysis study of the prevalence of ACE (I/D) genotype in countries most affected by the COVID-19. In the meta-analysis, 48,758 healthy subjects from 30 different countries were evaluated in 116 studies, using the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. The I/D allele frequency ratio was pooled by a random-effect model. The COVID-19 prevalence data of death and recovery rates were evaluated as the latitudes for the meta-regression analysis. Our results demonstrated that with the increase of the I/D allele frequency ratio, the recovery rate significantly increased (point estimate: 0.48, CI 95%: 0.05C0.91, p = 0.027). However, there was no significant difference in the case of death rate (point estimate: 1.74, CI 95%: 4.5C1.04, p = 0.22). This ecological perspective coupled with many limitations does not provide a direct clinical relevance between the COVID-19 and RAS system, but it shows potential pathophysiological associations. Our results raise concerns about ethnic and genetic differences that could affect the effectiveness of the currently investigated RAS-associated medications in different regions.","output":"Worldwide ACE (I/D) polymorphism may affect COVID-19 recovery rate: an ecological meta-regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) plays a role in protecting retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells from oxidative stress (OS), a causative factor of RPE cell death. Genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used to treat critical and incurable retinal diseases. Here, we overexpressed PEDF in placenta-derived MSCs (PD-MSCsPEDF, PEDF+) using a nonviral gene delivery system and evaluated the characteristics of PD-MSCsPEDF and their potential regenerative effects on RPE cells damaged by H2O2-induced OS. PD-MSCsPEDF maintained their stemness, cell surface marker, and differentiation potential characteristics. Compared to naive cells, PD-MSCsPEDF promoted mitochondrial respiration by enhancing biogenesis regulators (e.g., NRF1, PPARGC1A, and TFAM) as well as antioxidant enzymes (e.g., HMOXs, SODs, and GPX1). Compared to OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with naive cells, OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF showed PEDF upregulation and VEGF downregulation. The expression levels of antioxidant genes and RPE-specific genes, such as RPE65, RGR, and RRH, were significantly increased in RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF. Furthermore, OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF had dramatically enhanced mitochondrial functions, and antiapoptotic effects improved due to cell survival signaling pathways. In the H2O2-induced retinal degeneration rat model, compared to administration of the naive counterpart, intravitreal administration of PD-MSCsPEDF alleviated proinflammatory cytokines and restored retinal structure and function by increasing PEDF expression and decreasing VEGF expression. Intravitreal administration of PD-MSCsPEDF also protected retinal degeneration against OS by increasing antioxidant gene expression and regulating the mitochondrial ROS levels and biogenesis. Taken together, PEDF overexpression in PD-MSCs improved the mitochondrial activities and induced OS-damaged RPE cell regeneration by regulating the oxidative status and mitochondrial biogenesis in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that genetic modification of PEDF in PD-MSCs might be a new cell therapy for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.","output":"Overexpression of pigment epithelium-derived factor in placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in retinal cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this observational study was investigating the possible correlation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MeD) and SARS-COV-2 infection rates and severity among healthcare professionals (HCPs).

Watercourses discharging into the marine environment, especially close to designated bathing waters, may expose recreational users to fecal pollution and therefore may increase the likelihood that they will be exposed to ARGs. This study compares the bacterial and bacteriophage ARG profiles of two rivers (River Tolka and Liffey) and two small urban streams (Elm Park and Trimleston Streams) that discharge close to two marine bathing waters in Dublin Bay. Despite the potential differences in pollution pressures experienced by these waterways, microbial source tracking analysis showed that the main source of pollution in both rivers and streams in the urban environment is human contamination. All ARGs included in this study, bla(TEM), bla(SHV), qnrS, and sul1, were present in all four waterways in both the bacterial and bacteriophage fractions, displaying a similar ARG profile. We show that nearshore marine bathing waters are strongly influenced by urban rivers and streams discharging into these, since they shared a similar ARG profile. In comparison to rivers and streams, the levels of bacterial ARGs were significantly reduced in the marine environment.

In this review we examine whether healthcare facility design is a contributing factor to multifaceted infection control strategies. METHODS: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1990 to December 31(st), 2015, with language restriction to English, Spanish, German and French. RESULTS: We identified three studies investigating accessibility of the location of the antiseptic hand rub dispenser. Each of them showed a significant improvement of hand hygiene compliance or agent consumption with the implementation of accessible dispensers near the patient bed. Nine eligible studies evaluated the impact of single-patient rooms on the acquisition of healthcare-associated colonization and infections in comparison to multi-bedrooms or an open ward design. Six of these studies showed a significant benefit of single-patient bedrooms in reducing the healthcare-associated colonization and infection rate, whereas three studies found that single-patient rooms are neither a protective nor risk factor. In meta-analyses, the overall risk ratio for acquisition of healthcare-associated colonization and infection was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.74), for healthcare-associated colonization 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.85) and for bacteremia 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.76), all in favor of patient care in single-patient bedrooms.

Besides the local oxidative damage caused by the parasite, the host reacts by increasing the production of oxidants. The study of thiol-disulphide homeostasis can be of help in the evaluation of the oxidative status of sheep during this type of parasitism. In this study, the thiol-disulphide homeostasis, together with other biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, were assessed in the serum of lambs infected with gastrointestinal nematodes and were evaluated after 70 days of integrated crop-livestock system and anthelmintic treatment. This study showed that the thiol-disulphide balance was impaired in the infected lambs and the changes were correlated with the parasite load, which therefore could indicate their potential use as a tool to evaluate and monitor the disease in sheep. ABSTRACT: This work aimed to evaluate the thiol-disulphide homeostasis in serum of lambs naturally infected by gastrointestinal nematodes presenting different levels of parasite load indirectly indicated by faecal worm egg counts (EPG). Furthermore, the possible changes in the thiol-disulphide dynamic after different procedures to reduce the parasitic charge, such as the integrated crop-livestock system or anthelmintic treatment, were assessed. The results were compared with a panel of various oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers. The lambs were divided into three groups: animals highly infected (EPG higher than 5000) and packed cell volume (PCV) lower than 24% (G1); animals highly infected (EPG higher than 5000) and normal PCV (>24%) (G2); and animals presenting EPG lower than 5000 and normal PCV (>24%) (G3). The highly infected lambs (G1 and G2) showed lower total thiol (TT) and native thiol (SH) (p  0.01) than those from G3. After treatment, TT and SH increased significantly in all groups (p  0.01), and the disulphide (SS)/TT and SS/SH ratios decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in G1 and G2. These results show that the thiol-disulphide balance was impaired in lambs infected by gastrointestinal nematodes and that it could be potentially used as a biomarker to monitor this disease.","output":"Changes in Serum Thiol-Disulphide Homeostasis in Sheep with Gastrointestinal Nematodes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: We developed a clinical proteomics methodology, known as Wise MS Transfer (WiMT), for deep identification of blood proteins in undepleted plasma samples. We applied it to the analysis of undepleted melanoma plasma samples as a proof of principle. Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, and early diagnostic and prognostic predictors are essential to establish the most suitable treatment tailored to the patient. Our results showed the greatest identification of proteins and biological processes to date reported for a dilute and shoot approach within plasma samples from melanoma patients. More than 1200 proteins related to key biological processes in melanoma progression were mapped, including signaling (the PI3KCAkt signaling pathway), immune system processes (complement and coagulation cascade), and secretion (exosome proteins). These proteins and related biological processes constitute the core of blood components that could be monitored by mass spectrometry in clinical proteomic studies from undepleted plasma samples in melanoma. ABSTRACT: Plasma analysis by mass spectrometry-based proteomics remains a challenge due to its large dynamic range of 10 orders in magnitude. We created a methodology for protein identification known as Wise MS Transfer (WiMT). Melanoma plasma samples from biobank archives were directly analyzed using simple sample preparation. WiMT is based on MS1 features between several MS runs together with custom protein databases for ID generation. This entails a multi-level dynamic protein database with different immunodepletion strategies by applying single-shot proteomics. The highest number of melanoma plasma proteins from undepleted and unfractionated plasma was reported, mapping >1200 proteins from >10,000 protein sequences with confirmed significance scoring. Of these, more than 660 proteins were annotated by WiMT from the resulting ~5800 protein sequences. We could verify 4000 proteins by MS1t analysis from HeLA extracts. The WiMT platform provided an output in which 12 previously well-known candidate markers were identified. We also identified low-abundant proteins with functions related to (i) cell signaling, (ii) immune system regulators, and (iii) proteins regulating folding, sorting, and degradation, as well as (iv) vesicular transport proteins. WiMT holds the potential for use in large-scale screening studies with simple sample preparation, and can lead to the discovery of novel proteins with key melanoma disease functions.","output":"Mapping the Melanoma Plasma Proteome (MPP) Using Single-Shot Proteomics Interfaced with the WiMT Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Hypertension is commonly accompanied by many comorbidities that are major determinant factors for the severity of COVID-19.

Despite these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of the human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins drives diversity. Here, we identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different infection efficiencies in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. Consistent results were observed by binding affinity assays between SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV spike proteins and receptor molecules from bats and humans. All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with that of their SARS-CoV counterpart. Structure modeling revealed that the difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular evolution analysis indicates that some key residues were under positive selection. These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics.IMPORTANCE Evolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously, we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoVs in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here, we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These ACE2 variants support SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding affinities to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity for spillover to humans. The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike protein suggests long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between them. Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats is necessary for the prevention of the next SARS-like disease.","output":"Evolutionary Arms Race between Virus and Host Drives Genetic Diversity in Bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus Spike Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the current pandemic situation, glove disinfection is a process that can be used to care for the same patient or when removing personal protective equipment.

The problems mainly stemmed from chronic exposure to the chemicals contained in paint thinner, which is mainly toluene, used during automobile painting. Unfortunately, in Indonesia, there is no study on the reproductive health of male workers in automobile workshops, especially in relation to spermatogenesis. This study aimed to explore the possibility of reproductive problems, namely spermatozoa DNA fragmentation, among male workers in an automobile workshop in Malang. We recruited workers who have worked as automobile painters for years at an automobile workshop in Malang and have been chronically exposed to thinner. Semen samples were collected from 15 automobile workshop workers who were married and had children. Twelve office workers were used as the control group. The two groups of semen samples were tested with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay combined with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed a significant difference between DNA fragmentation of the control group and workshop workers at 14.9% and 47.66%, respectively. Risk factor analysis showed a significant increase in risk factors (p = 0.001). Taken together, chronic exposure to paint thinner in those engaged in painting at the automobile workshop increased the risk of DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa.

OBJECTIVE: To compile individual patient data from randomized clinical trials of CCP and to monitor the data until completion or until accumulated evidence enables reliable conclusions regarding the clinical outcomes associated with CCP. DATA SOURCES: From May to August 2020, a systematic search was performed for trials of CCP in the literature, clinical trial registry sites, and medRxiv. Domain experts at local, national, and international organizations were consulted regularly. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible trials enrolled hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, not receiving mechanical ventilation, and randomized them to CCP or control. The administered CCP was required to have measurable antibodies assessed locally. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A minimal data set was submitted regularly via a secure portal, analyzed using a prespecified bayesian statistical plan, and reviewed frequently by a collective data and safety monitoring board. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prespecified coprimary end pointsthe World Health Organization (WHO) 11-point ordinal scale analyzed using a proportional odds model and a binary indicator of WHO score of 7 or higher capturing the most severe outcomes including mechanical ventilation through death and analyzed using a logistic modelwere assessed clinically at 14 days after randomization. RESULTS: Eight international trials collectively enrolled 2369 participants (1138 randomized to control and 1231 randomized to CCP). A total of 2341 participants (median [IQR] age, 60 [50-72] years; 845 women [35.7%]) had primary outcome data as of April 2021. The median (IQR) of the ordinal WHO scale was 3 (3-6); the cumulative OR was 0.94 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.74-1.19; posterior probability of OR <1 of 71%). A total of 352 patients (15%) had WHO score greater than or equal to 7; the OR was 0.94 (95% CrI, 0.69-1.30; posterior probability of OR <1 of 65%). Adjusted for baseline covariates, the ORs for mortality were 0.88 at day 14 (95% CrI, 0.61-1.26; posterior probability of OR <1 of 77%) and 0.85 at day 28 (95% CrI, 0.62-1.18; posterior probability of OR <1 of 84%). Heterogeneity of treatment effect sizes was observed across an array of baseline characteristics.

The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze the experience of HPSs with outpatient Telepharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic and expose the lessons learned. Measures have been adopted in on-site outpatient pharmacy clinics to prevent exposure of patients and professionals to the virus. These measures are based on national and international recommendations on social distancing and hygiene. With regard to remote outpatient pharmacy services, teleconsultation with drug dispensing has been promoted based on five basic procedures, each with its advantages and limitations: home drug delivery from HPSs, with the advantage of universal access and the limitation of entailing a substantial investment in resources; HPS coordination with primary care pharmacists, which requires no investments but with limited access to some geographic areas; HPS coordination with community pharmacists based on a large network of pharmacies, which requires the patient to go to the pharmacy, without confidentiality being guaranteed for any patient; geolocation and hospital-based medication dispensing, which provides universal access and direct traceability, but entails investment in human resources; and HPS coordination with associations of patients, which does not entail any additional cost but limits the information available on the diseases of society members. Three main lessons have been learned during the pandemic: the satisfactory capacity of HPS to provide outpatient pharmacy consultation services in the setting of a public health crisis; the usefulness of Telepharmacy for the clinical follow-up, healthcare coordination, outpatient counseling, and informed dispensing and delivery of medication (with a high level of satisfaction among patients); and the need to foster Telepharmacy as a complementary tool through a mixed model of outpatient pharmacy consultation service that incorporates the advantages of each procedure and adapts to the individual needs of each patient in a context of humanized healthcare.","output":"Atencin farmacutica al paciente externo durante la pandemia COVID-19.

This review aims to identify the future evolution of Co supply through technologically resilient and environmentally sustainable pathways. The work shows that advances in both primary and secondary sources, Co mining methods and recycling systems are yet to be fully optimised. Moreover, responsible sourcing from both large mines and small artisanal mines will be necessary for a resilient Co supply. Regulatory approaches may increase transparency, support local mining communities, and improve secondary Co recovery. Novel Co supply options, such as deep-sea mining and bio-mining of tailings, are associated with major techno-economic and environmental issues. However, a circular economy, keeping Co in the economic loop for as long as possible, is yet to be optimised at both regional and global scales. To achieve environmental sustainability of Co, economic incentives, regulatory push, and improved public perception are required to drive product innovation and design for circularity.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs were tested via reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Deaths were stratified by covis-19 status, location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors. RESULTS: 372 participants were enrolled between June and September 2020; PCR results were available for 364 (97.8%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 58/364 (15.9%) according to the recommended cycle threshold value of <40 and in 70/364 (19.2%) when expanded to any level of PCR detection. The median age at death among people with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was 48 (interquartile range 36-72) years, and 69% (n=48) were male. Most deaths in people with covid-19 (51/70; 73%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 before death. Among the 19/70 people who died in hospital, six were tested before death. Among the 52/70 people with data on symptoms, 44/52 had typical symptoms of covid-19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only five were tested before death. Covid-19 was identified in seven children, only one of whom had been tested before death. The proportion of deaths with covid-19 increased with age, but 76% (n=53) of people who died were aged under 60 years. The five most common comorbidities among people who died with covid-19 were tuberculosis (22; 31%), hypertension (19; 27%), HIV/AIDS (16; 23%), alcohol misuse (12; 17%), and diabetes (9; 13%). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, deaths with covid-19 were common in Lusaka. Most occurred in the community, where testing capacity is lacking. However, few people who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of covid-19. Therefore, cases of covid-19 were under-reported because testing was rarely done not because covid-19 was rare. If these data are generalizable, the impact of covid-19 in Africa has been vastly underestimated.","output":"Covid-19 deaths in Africa: prospective systematic postmortem surveillance study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Central nervous system (CNS) innate immunity plays essential roles in infections, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain or spinal cord injuries. Astrocytes and microglia are the principal cells that mediate innate immunity in the CNS. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), expressed by astrocytes and microglia, sense pathogen-derived or endogenous ligands released by damaged cells and initiate the innate immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a well-characterized family of PRRs. The contribution of microglial TLR signaling to CNS pathology has been extensively investigated. Even though astrocytes assume a wide variety of key functions, information about the role of astroglial TLRs in CNS disease and injuries is limited. Because astrocytes display heterogeneity and exhibit phenotypic plasticity depending on the effectors present in the local milieu, they can exert both detrimental and beneficial effects. TLRs are modulators of these paradoxical astroglial properties. The goal of the current review is to highlight the essential roles played by astroglial TLRs in CNS infections, injuries and diseases. We discuss the contribution of astroglial TLRs to host defense as well as the dissemination of viral and bacterial infections in the CNS. We examine the link between astroglial TLRs and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and present evidence showing the pivotal influence of astroglial TLR signaling on sterile inflammation in CNS injury. Finally, we define the research questions and areas that warrant further investigations in the context of astrocytes, TLRs, and CNS dysfunction.","output":"Role of astroglial toll-like receptors (TLRs) in central nervous system infections, injury and neurodegenerative diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks have caused universities all across the globe to close their campuses and forced them to initiate online teaching.

However, new cases of paediatric HIV infections still occur. Early diagnosis of new HIV infections is essential to start an appropriate antiretroviral treatment to avoid childhood morbidity and mortality related to infection. The aim of this study was to describe the new cases of MTCT in Latin-American referral hospitals. METHODS: A retrospective, multicentre and descriptive study of the new cases of MTCT diagnosed during 2018 in 13 referral hospitals from 8 Latin-American countries (Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama) belonging to PLANTAIDS (Paediatric Network for Prevention, Early Detection and Treatment of HIV in Children), was conducted. PLANTAIDS is included in CYTED (Ibero-American Programme of Science and Technology for Development). RESULTS: Eighty-one children (40.7% males) were included, median age at diagnosis of 2.33 years (IQR:0.7C4.7). Less than 3% of women knew their HIV diagnosis before pregnancy. More than 80% of them were diagnosed after delivery, 8.7% during pregnancy, and 2.9% at delivery. Only one patient underwent antiretroviral therapy (ART) prior to pregnancy. At diagnosis, 50.0% of the children presented with an advanced stage of disease (stage C following the current CDC classification for HIV infection), and 34.4% had less than 15% CD4(+) cells/mm(3). The time elapsed between delivery and the maternal diagnosis was correlated with the age of children at diagnosis,  = 0.760, p < 0.001. Younger age at diagnosis (p = 0.03), a smaller number of previous hospitalizations (p < 0.01), and better immunovirological status (p < 0.01) were found in children whose mothers knew their HIV status at delivery, compared to mothers who were not aware of it. CONCLUSIONS: Although MTCT in Latin America has declined in recent years, our series shows there are still cases that indicate some failures in prevention, being a critical point to improve an earlier diagnosis of pregnant women. Half of the children were diagnosed in an advanced stage of disease and the delay in maternal diagnosis entailed a worse clinical and immunological child prognosis.","output":"New diagnosis of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in 8 Latin-American countries during 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The renal angina index has been proposed to identify patients at high risk of persistent AKI, based on slight changes in serum creatinine and patient conditions. However, a concise scoring method has only been proposed for pediatric patients, and not for adult patients yet. Here, we developed and validated a concise scoring method using data on patients admitted to ICUs in 21 Japanese hospitals from 2012 to 2014. We randomly assigned to either discovery or validation cohorts, identified the factors significantly associated with persistent AKI using a multivariable logistic regression model in the discovery cohort to establish a scoring system, and assessed the validity of the scoring in the validation cohort using receiver operating characteristic analysis and the calibration slope. Among 8,320 patients admitted to the ICUs, persistent AKI was present in 1,064 (12.8%) patients. In the discovery cohort (n = 4,151), hyperbilirubinemia, sepsis and ventilator and/or vasoactive with small changes in serum creatinine were selected to establish the scoring. In the validation cohort (n = 4,169), the predicting model based on this scoring had a c-statistic of 0.79 (95%CI, 0.77C0.81) and was well calibrated.

Surface functionalization and immobilization of antibodies were performed for the selective detection of PAs. The voltage-related sensitivity (S(V)) showed a constant behavior from the subthreshold regime to the linear regime. The current-related sensitivity (S(I)) was high in the subthreshold regime and then significantly decreased as the drain current increased. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be as low as 25 pg/mL based on S(I) characteristics, which is the lowest value reported to date in the literature for various sensor methodologies. The Si-EGT showed selective detection of PA through a non-specific control test.

Primers of our in-house reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were designed to target conserved regions of the RdRP gene and E gene, selected restriction enzymes EcoRI, Tsp45I, and AluI to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. In this report, a 396-bp fragment of the RdRp gene and 345-bp fragment of the E gene were amplified by one-step RT-PCR. Enzyme Tsp45I cuts the RdRP-amplified product of SARS-CoV-2 generating three fragments of 45, 154, and 197 bp, but it did not cut the amplicon of SARS-CoV. In contrast, the amplified product of SARS-CoV was digested with EcoRI producing two fragments of 76 and 320 bp, whereas the amplicon of SARS-CoV-2 was undigested by Tsp45I help to distinguish clearly SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV on gel electrophoresis. In addition, AluI cut the amplicon of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 generating two fragments of 248 and 97 bp without cutting to SARS-CoV.

Putative risk factors for myocardial injury and arrhythmia were evaluated with logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders. ResultsCOVID-19 patients with myocardial injury had fatigue (66.2%) and dyspnea (63.7%), while those with arrhythmia had dyspnea (71.8%). Patients with myocardial injury and arrhythmia had a significant mortality of 92.5% and 94.4%, respectively.

The adherence to the belief in the priority of rights over duties has motivated some individuals to refrain from social distancing and, as a result, has placed themselves and other individuals at serious risk to health and life. My argument is that the ethical enjoinder of social duty possesses priority over the ethical value of individual rights especially in times of global crisis. I demonstrate this point by arguing that the concept of individual right is derivative from the concept of social duty and through the argument that the concept of social duty is more efficacious in addressing global threats to human life than is the concept of individual rights. What is needed is an in-depth revision of the moral ordering of rights and duties and a vision of the human being as inherently other directed with duties toward others.

Some suggest this emotional response to the pandemic can be explained through death anxiety (DA), a transdiagnostic dimension associated with numerous psychological disorders. However, it remains unclear as to whether DA is a unidimensional or multidimensional construct. The primary aim of this study was to examine the underlying structure of the Death Anxiety Inventory-Revised (DAI-R; Toms-Sbado et al., 2005) and assess its associations with mental health and demographic variables during the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve these aims, we utilized data from Waves 1 (N = 2205: collected between March 23 and March 28, 2020) and 2 (N = 1406: collected between April 22 and May 1, 2020) of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC), a multi-wave nationally representative study. Results showed that a 4-factor model provided the best fit to the data compared to a unidimensional and 4-factor second-order model. Further analyses showed that DA at Wave 1 was positively associated with somatic symptoms, paranoia, depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress symptoms at Wave 2, supporting previous research that suggests that the fear of death is predictive of psychopathology. Significantly, the factor labelled Thoughts about Death at Wave 1 was the strongest predictor of the five main psychological variables at Wave 2, after statistically controlling for the other latent variables. These findings highlight the transdiagnostic nature of DA and support this important diagnostic construct becoming a measure of mental health more generally within the population.

The secondary aim was to capture objective change in disability and coping mechanisms. METHODS: A minimum representative sample of 824 patients was required for quantitative analysis to provide a 3% margin of error. Sampling was stratified by body region (upper/lower limb, spine) and duration on the waiting list. Questionnaires were sent to a random sample of elective orthopaedic waiting list patients with their planned intervention paused due to COVID-19. Analyzed parameters included baseline health, change in physical/mental health status, challenges and coping strategies, preferences/concerns regarding treatment, and objective quality of life (EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item scale (GAD-2)). Qualitative analysis was performed via the Normalization Process Theory. RESULTS: A total of 888 patients responded. Better health, pain, and mood scores were reported by upper limb patients. The longest waiters reported better health but poorer mood and anxiety scores. Overall, 82% had tried self-help measures to ease symptoms; 94% wished to proceed with their intervention; and 21% were prepared to tolerate deferral.

METHODS: We measured antibodies in serum samples from 30,576 persons in Iceland, using six assays (including two pan-immunoglobulin [pan-Ig] assays), and we determined that the appropriate measure of seropositivity was a positive result with both pan-Ig assays. We tested 2102 samples collected from 1237 persons up to 4 months after diagnosis by a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay. We measured antibodies in 4222 quarantined persons who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and in 23,452 persons not known to have been exposed. RESULTS: Of the 1797 persons who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, 1107 of the 1215 who were tested (91.1%) were seropositive; antiviral antibody titers assayed by two pan-Ig assays increased during 2 months after diagnosis by qPCR and remained on a plateau for the remainder of the study.

Accumulating evidence has shown that OLs can be generated by the direct activation of defined transcription factors (TFs) in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs); however, the rapid acquisition of single TF-induced OL progenitor cells (OPCs) as cell therapy for ischemic stroke remains to be thoroughly explored. Methods: A stable, chemically defined protocol was used to generate a substantial number of transplantable and functional OLs through the partial inhibition of sonic hedgehog (Shh) activity by GANT61 during neural induction from hiPSCs and sequential induction of TF Olig2 overexpression. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses further revealed a novel molecular event in which Olig2 regulates OL differentiation from hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Olig2-induced NG2(+) OPCs (Olig2-OPCs) were then evaluated for their therapeutic potential in cell-based therapy for ischemic stroke. Results: GANT61 treatment resulted in a motor neuron (MN)-OL fate switch during neural induction, and induced overexpression of Olig2 accelerated oligodendroglial lineage cell specification. Olig2-OPCs expressed typical oligodendroglial lineage marker genes, including NKX2.2, CSPG4, and ST8SIA1, and displayed superior ability to differentiate into mature OLs in vitro. Mechanistically, Olig2-OPCs showed increased gene expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) signaling pathway, and activated CEPT1-mediated phospholipogenesis. Functionally, inhibiting PPAR and knocking down CEPT1 further compromised the terminal differentiation of Olig2-OPCs. Most importantly, when transplanted into a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), Olig2-OPCs efficiently promoted neurological functional recovery by reducing neuronal death, promoting remyelination, and rescuing spatial memory decline. Conclusions: We developed a stable, chemically defined protocol to generate OPCs/OLs with partial inhibition of Shh activity by GANT61 from hiPSCs and sequentially induced the expression of the single TF Olig2.

Recently, many thrombus-targeted nanoparticles (NPs) have been constructed for detecting thrombi or monitoring thrombolysis, but their thrombus-targeting performance is limited. Considering this drawback, we designed a specific bionic system with enhanced thrombus-targeting ability. Materials and Methods: In the bionic system, gelatin was chosen as a carrier, and Fe3O4 served as a magnetic navigation medium and a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging agent. The CREKA peptide, which targets fibrin, was conjugated to the surface of gelatin to prepare targeted NPs (TNPs), which were then engulfed by macrophages to construct the bionic system. At the targeted site, the bionic system released its interior TNPs under low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) irradiation. Moreover, the targeting performance was further improved by the conjugated CREKA peptide. Results: In this study, we successfully constructed a bionic system and demonstrated its targeting ability in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that most TNPs were released from macrophages under LIFU irradiation at 2 W/cm2 for 10 min in vitro. Additionally, the enhanced thrombus-targeting ability, based on the natural tropism of macrophages toward inflammatory thrombi, magnetic navigation and the CREKA peptide, was verified ex vivo and in vivo. Moreover, compared with the bionic system group, the group treated with TNPs had significantly decreased liver and spleen signals in MR images and significantly enhanced liver and spleen signals in fluorescence images, indicating that the bionic system is less likely to be cleared by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) than TNPs, which may promote the accumulation of the bionic system at the site of the thrombus. Conclusion: These results suggest that the magnet-guided bionic system with LIFU responsiveness is an excellent candidate for targeting thrombi and holds promise as an innovative drug delivery system for thrombolytic therapy.","output":"Magnet-Guided Bionic System with LIFU Responsiveness and Natural Thrombus Tropism for Enhanced Thrombus-Targeting Ability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Corticoid therapy has been recommended in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19, yet its efficacy is currently still under evaluation. We investigated the effect of corticosteroid treatment on 90-day mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in severe patients with COVID-19. METHODS: 294 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were recruited between December 30, 2019 and February 19, 2020. Logistic regression, Cox proportional-hazards model and marginal structural modeling (MSM) were applied to evaluate the associations between corticosteroid use and corresponding outcome variables. RESULTS: Out of the 294 critically ill patients affected by COVID-19, 183 (62.2%) received corticosteroids, with methylprednisolone as the most frequently administered corticosteroid (175 accounting for 96%). Of those treated with corticosteroids, 69.4% received corticosteroid prior to ICU admission. When adjustments and subgroup analysis were not performed, no significant associations between corticosteroids use and 90-day mortality or SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance were found. However, when stratified analysis based on corticosteroid initiation time was performed, there was a significant correlation between corticosteroid use ( 3 day after ICU admission) and 90-day mortality (logistic regression adjusted for baseline: OR 4.49, 95% CI 1.17C17.25, p = 0.025; Cox adjusted for baseline and time varying variables: HR 3.89, 95% CI 1.94C7.82, p < 0.001; MSM adjusted for baseline and time-dependent variants: OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.16C4.65, p = 0.017). No association was found between corticosteroid use and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance even after stratification by initiation time of corticosteroids and adjustments for confounding factors (corticosteroids use  3 days initiation vs no corticosteroids use) using MSM were performed. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of corticosteroid use ( 3 days after ICU admission) was associated with an increased 90-day mortality. Early use of methylprednisolone in the ICU is therefore not recommended in patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"Corticosteroid therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a multicenter, retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visual short-term memory (VSTM) load leads to impaired perception during maintenance. Here, we fitted the contrast response function to psychometric orientation discrimination data while also varying attention demand during maintenance to investigate: (1) whether VSTM load effects on perception are mediated by a modulation of the contrast threshold, consistent with contrast gain accounts, or by the function asymptote (1 lapse rate), consistent with response gain accounts; and (2) whether the VSTM load effects on the contrast response function depend on the availability of attentional resources. We manipulated VSTM load via the number of items in the memory set in a color and location VSTM task and assessed the contrast response function for an orientation discrimination task during maintenance. Attention demand was varied through spatial cuing of the orientation stimulus. Higher VSTM load increased the estimated contrast threshold of the contrast response function without affecting the estimated asymptote, but only when the discrimination task demanded attention. When attentional demand was reduced (in the cued conditions), the VSTM load effects on the contrast threshold were eliminated. The results suggest that VSTM load reduces perceptual sensitivity by increasing contrast thresholds, suggestive of a contrast gain modulation mechanism, as long as the perceptual discrimination task demands attention. These findings support recent claims that attentional resources are shared between perception and VSTM maintenance processes.","output":"Effects of visual short-term memory load and attentional demand on the contrast response function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Information Our complex healthcare systems were dramatically disrupted by COVID-19, an emerging virus that swept the nation in early 2020.

Therefore infections by RNA viruses are a major threat to human health. The infected host cell detects trace amounts of viral RNA and the last years have revealed common principles in the biochemical mechanisms leading to signal amplification that is required for mounting of a powerful antiviral response. Components of the RNA sensing and signaling machinery such as RIG-I-like proteins, MAVS and the inflammasome inducibly form large oligomers or even fibers that exhibit hallmarks of prions. Following a nucleation event triggered by detection of viral RNA, these energetically favorable and irreversible polymerization events trigger signaling cascades leading to the induction of antiviral and inflammatory responses, mediated by interferon and NF-B pathways. Viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate these host cell signaling pathways in order to ensure their replication.

It is known that the elderly or those with concomitant pathologies are at greater risk of a serious evolution of the disease if affected by COVID-19 and that health workers are a category with greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Until now, there has been little information on the epidemiological features and transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak which did not involve health-care professionals or social and health-care facilities. For this reason, this paper aims to describe the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population outside these semi-closed communities. METHODS: The study was designed by analyzing the data of the 1371 SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects observed in Sardinia up to 9 July, 2020 and whose data were available in the public health department. Statistical analysis and graphic representation were performed using STATA and Adobe Illustrator, respectively. RESULTS: Of the positive cases analyzed, 323 (23.5%) are health-care workers and 563 (41.1%) reside in social or health-care facilities. The number of positive cases among the general population (subjects who do not belong to these semi-closed communities), is 399 (29.1%), 208 females and 191 males. The estimated Case Fatality Rate stands at 5.0%, which is almost half the rate reported for all the SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (9.8%). The geographical distribution of positive cases differs considerably from the distribution of the totality of cases in Sardinia. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides an insight into the COVID-19 situation in the general community, ie not involving health-care professionals or social and health-care facilities. Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak outside of these semi-closed communities would provide appropriate information to guide intervention policy. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the vulnerability of our health-care system.

To evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household income, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can use their precautionary savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period, when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level. The San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a lockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance (UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of three months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9% in the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income earners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the combination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero, and reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income loss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is spatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the average and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a first step in quantifying the household-level impacts of COVID-19 at a regional scale.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with poor outcome. RESULTS The most frequent haematological diseases were lymphoma (30%) and multiple myeloma (30%). Eighty-seven % HP developed moderate or severe disease. Patients with haematological malignancies had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to non-cancer patients (35.9% vs 13.2%; P=0.003 (odds ratio 6.652).

Here, we applied a molecular docking method to study the binding stability of these drugs with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. It appeared that the ligand-protein binding stability of the alliin and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex was better than others. The results suggested that alliin may serve as a good candidate as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Therefore, the present research may provide some meaningful guidance for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Discovery of alliin as a putative inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular docking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the development of science and technology, the high-tech industry is developing rapidly, and various new-age technologies continue to appear, and Digital Twins (DT) is one of them.

Therefore, our country is currently actively and extensively implementing the anti-epidemic policy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Methods: Among 2795 consecutive patients (pts) with COVID-19 and cancer registered to OnCovid between 01/2020 and 02/2021, we examined natural seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies (SC2Ab, IgM or IgG) in pts tested post-infection. We analysed prevalence and safety of SARS-Cov-2 vaccine administration in pts who underwent clinical re-assessment at participating institutions. Results: Out of 350 pts tested for SC2Ab, 318 (90.9%) had a positive SC2Ab titre post-convalescence. Neither baseline features (sex, age, comorbidities, smoking history, tumour stage/status, anticancer-therapy and primary tumour) nor COVID-19-specific features (complications, hospitalization, sequelae) were significantly associated SC2Ab status. Receipt of COVID-19 specific therapy was higher among SC2Ab+ pts (62.6% vs 40.6%, p=0.0156). Out of 593 pts with known vaccination status, 178 (30%) had received 1 dose, whilst 38 pts (6.4%) received 2 doses of mRNA based (70.2%) or viral vector vaccine (17.4%). Vaccinated pts were more likely aged 65 years (59% vs 48.3%, p=0.0172), with loco-regional tumour stage (56% vs 40.8%, p=0.0014), on anti-cancer therapy at COVID-19 (49.1% vs 38.2%, p=0.0168) and history of prior hospitalisation due to COVID-19 (61.8% vs 48.3%, p=0.0029). Vaccine-related adverse events were reported for 18/56 evaluable pts (32.1%) and included injection site reactions (50%), fever (44.4%), arthralgias (33.3%), fatigue (33.3%) and allergy (5.5%). No long-term vaccine-related morbidity was reported. Conclusions: We report high seroprevalence (>90%) of SC2Ab in convalescent cancer pts who survived COVID-19 irrespective of baseline demographics, oncological characteristics and COVID-19 severity.

SE status is a strong predictor of premature morbidity and mortality within general health. A lower SE status also has implications of increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and poorer CVD risk factor profiles. CVD comorbidity is associated with a higher case severity and mortality rate from COVID-19, with both CVD and COVID-19 sharing important risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected people of a lower SE status and of ethnic minority group, who in the most deprived regions are suffering double the mortality rate of the least deprived. The acute stress, economic recession and quarantine restrictions in the wake of COVID-19 are also predicted to cause a decline in mental health. This could pose substantial increase to CVD incidence, particularly with acute pathologies such as stroke, acute coronary syndrome and cardiogenic shock among lower SE status individuals and vulnerable elderly populations. Efforts to tackle SE status and CVD may aid in reducing avoidable deaths. The implementation of 'upstream' interventions and policies demonstrates promise in achieving the greatest population impact, aiming to protect and empower individuals. Specific measures may involve risk factor targeting restrictions on the availability and advertisement of tobacco, alcohol and high-fat and salt content food, and targeting SE disparity with healthy and secure workplaces.","output":"Socioeconomic status and cardiovascular health in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Universal mask wearing is recommended to help control the spread of COVID-19 Masks reduce the expulsion of aerosols of respiratory fluids into the environment (called source control) and offer some protection to the wearer Masks are often characterized using filtration efficiency, airflow resistance, and manikin or human fit factors, which are standard metrics used for personal protective devices However, none of these metrics are direct measurements of how effectively a mask blocks coughed and exhaled aerosols We studied the source control performance of 15 cloth masks (face masks, neck gaiters, and bandanas), two medical masks, and two N95 filtering facepiece respirators by measuring their ability to block aerosols 7 m expelled during simulated coughing and exhalation (called source control collection efficiency) These measurements were compared with filtration efficiencies, airflow resistances, and fit factors measured on manikin headforms and humans Collection efficiencies for the cloth masks ranged from 17% to 71% for coughing and 35% to 66% for exhalation Filtration efficiencies for the cloth masks ranged from 1 4% to 98%, while the fit factors were 1 3 to 7 4 on headforms and 1 0 to 4 0 on human subjects The Spearmans rank correlation coefficients between the source control collection efficiencies and the standard metrics ranged from 0 03 to 0 68 and were significant in all but two cases However, none of the standard metrics were strongly correlated with source control performance A better understanding of the relationships between source control collection efficiency, filtration efficiency, airflow resistance, and fit factor is needed [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Aerosol Science & Technology is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"A comparison of performance metrics for cloth masks as source control devices for simulated cough and exhalation aerosols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to wreak havoc worldwide. This study assessed the ability of chest computed tomography (CT) severity score (CSS) to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 192 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia aged more than 20 years and typical CT findings and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction positive admitted in a tertiary hospital were included. Clinical symptoms at admission and short-term outcome were obtained. A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to evaluate the parenchymal involvement. The association between CSS, disease severity, and outcomes were evaluated. Prediction of CSS was assessed with the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The incidence of admission to ICU was 22.8% in men and 14.1% in women. CSS was related to ICU admission and mortality. Areas under the ROC curves were 0.764 for total CSS. Using a stepwise binary logistic regression model, gender, age, oxygen saturation, and CSS had a significant independent relationship with ICU admission and death. Patients with CSS 12.5 had about four-time risk of ICU admission and death (odds ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.66 C 9.25). The multivariate regression analysis showed the superiority of CSS over other clinical information and co-morbidities. CONCLUSION: CSS was a strong predictor of progression to ICU admission and death and there was a substantial role of non-contrast chest CT imaging in the presence of typical features for COVID-19 pneumonia as a reliable predictor of clinical severity and patients outcome.","output":"Chest Computed Tomography Severity Score to Predict Adverse Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Generative machine learning (ML) has been postulated to become a major driver in the computational design of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). However, efforts to confirm this hypothesis have been hindered by the infeasibility of testing arbitrarily large numbers of antibody sequences for their most critical design parameters: paratope, epitope, affinity, and developability. To address this challenge, we leveraged a lattice-based antibody-antigen binding simulation framework, which incorporates a wide range of physiological antibody-binding parameters. The simulation framework enables the computation of synthetic antibody-antigen 3D-structures, and it functions as an oracle for unrestricted prospective evaluation and benchmarking of antibody design parameters of ML-generated antibody sequences. We found that a deep generative model, trained exclusively on antibody sequence (one dimensional: 1D) data can be used to design conformational (three dimensional: 3D) epitope-specific antibodies, matching, or exceeding the training dataset in affinity and developability parameter value variety. Furthermore, we established a lower threshold of sequence diversity necessary for high-accuracy generative antibody ML and demonstrated that this lower threshold also holds on experimental real-world data. Finally, we show that transfer learning enables the generation of high-affinity antibody sequences from low-N training data. Our work establishes a priori feasibility and the theoretical foundation of high-throughput ML-based mAb design.","output":"In silico proof of principle of machine learning-based antibody design at unconstrained scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, associated mitigation measures, and social and economic impacts may affect mental health, suicidal behavior, substance use, and violence. Objective: To examine changes in US emergency department (ED) visits for mental health conditions (MHCs), suicide attempts (SAs), overdose (OD), and violence outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Syndromic Surveillance Program to examine national changes in ED visits for MHCs, SAs, ODs, and violence from December 30, 2018, to October 10, 2020 (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). The National Syndromic Surveillance Program captures approximately 70% of US ED visits from more than 3500 EDs that cover 48 states and Washington, DC. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcome measures were MHCs, SAs, all drug ODs, opioid ODs, intimate partner violence (IPV), and suspected child abuse and neglect (SCAN) ED visit counts and rates. Weekly ED visit counts and rates were computed overall and stratified by sex. Results: From December 30, 2018, to October 10, 2020, a total of 187a?508a?065 total ED visits (53.6% female and 46.1% male) were captured; 6a?018a?318 included at least 1 study outcome (visits not mutually exclusive). Total ED visit volume decreased after COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented in the US beginning on March 16, 2020. Weekly ED visit counts for all 6 outcomes decreased between March 8 and 28, 2020 (March 8: MHCs = 42a?903, SAs = 5212, all ODs = 14a?543, opioid ODs = 4752, IPV = 444, and SCAN = 1090; March 28: MHCs = 17a?574, SAs = 4241, all ODs = 12a?399, opioid ODs = 4306, IPV = 347, and SCAN = 487). Conversely, ED visit rates increased beginning the week of March 22 to 28, 2020. When the median ED visit counts between March 15 and October 10, 2020, were compared with the same period in 2019, the 2020 counts were significantly higher for SAs (n = 4940 vs 4656, P = .02), all ODs (n = 15a?604 vs 13a?371, P < .001), and opioid ODs (n = 5502 vs 4168, P < .001); counts were significantly lower for IPV ED visits (n = 442 vs 484, P < .001) and SCAN ED visits (n = 884 vs 1038, P < .001). Median rates during the same period were significantly higher in 2020 compared with 2019 for all outcomes except IPV. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ED care seeking shifts during a pandemic, underscoring the need to integrate mental health, substance use, and violence screening and prevention services into response activities during public health crises.","output":"Trends in US Emergency Department Visits for Mental Health, Overdose, and Violence Outcomes Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Birds of prey especially eagles and hawks have a visual acuity two to five times better than humans. Among the peculiar characteristics of their biological vision are that they have two types of foveae; one shallow fovea used in their binocular vision, and a deep fovea for monocular vision. The deep fovea allows these birds to see objects at long distances and to identify them as possible prey. Inspired by the biological functioning of the deep fovea a model called DeepFoveaNet is proposed in this paper. DeepFoveaNet is a convolutional neural network model to detect moving objects in video sequences. DeepFoveaNet emulates the monocular vision of birds of prey through two Encoder-Decoder convolutional neural network modules. This model combines the capacity of magnification of the deep fovea and the context information of the peripheral vision. Unlike algorithms to detect moving objects, ranked in the first places of the Change Detection database (CDnet14), DeepFoveaNet does not depend on previously trained neural networks, neither on a huge number of training images for its training. Besides, its architecture allows it to learn spatiotemporal information of the video. DeepFoveaNet was evaluated in the CDnet14 database achieving high performance and was ranked as one of the ten best algorithms. The characteristics and results of DeepFoveaNet demonstrated that the model is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms to detect moving objects, and it can detect very small moving objects through its deep fovea model that other algorithms cannot detect.","output":"DeepFoveaNet: Deep Fovea Eagle-Eye Bioinspired Model to Detect Moving Objects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on the state of mental health of the individuals, no attention has been paid so far in the academia whether there is an association between students inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the study was intended to find out the association between students inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions during this pandemic. Primary data for this study were collected from a total of 157 samples chosen from the undergraduate students of 18 academic departments of the Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh on the basis of snowball sampling. The study reveals that most of the respondents were much inattentive to study during the COVID-19 pandemic and they were much anxious, depressed, tensed, restless, bored and frightened, and thereby their mental health and well-being were affected. The study shows that there is a strong positive association between the students inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions which involve anxiety, depression, tension, restlessness, boredom and fear/panic. The study indicates that the association between the students inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions is statistically significant. Finally, the study suggests that the Government and the authority concerned should undertake proper measures to mitigate the adverse psychological conditions of the NSTU students by means of motivations and psychosocial counselling, and thereby keeping up their attentiveness to study during the pandemic or any other critical situation.

And within the US, red (Republican) states have significantly higher cases per capita than blue (Democratic) states. We use cross-country, state, and county-level data to provide a comprehensive analysis of economic, political, and psychological factors contributing to these differences. An inferior social safety net and American conservatism systematically correlate with the realization and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and mask wearing from April to September. Economic inequality and weak social safety nets drive the economically vulnerable to work outside their homes, increasing mobility and reducing social distancing during early stages of the pandemic. Conservative ideology, anti-intellectualism, and evangelicalism drive people to politicize social distancing and mask wearing. Both factors predict a premature reopening in many states, and have a strong correlation with the drifting of COVID-19 epicenters to red states over the course of 2020. These factors have more explanatory power than partisanship in the first half year of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. However, from October on, closer to the presidential elections, partisanship is a better predictor of anti-COVID measures and explains well the regional variances of confirmed cases across states and counties.

To explore the origin of age-dependent clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we comparatively evaluated the expression in children and adult subjects of the most relevant mediators of the SARS-CoV-2 infection: ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1), transmembrane serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2), and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), at upper respiratory tract and small intestine level. Methods: The expression of ACE2, ACE1, TMPRSS2, and NRP1 in nasal epithelium and in small intestine epithelium was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Results: We found no differences in ACE2, ACE1, and TMPRSS2 expression in the nasal epithelium comparing children and adult subjects. In contrast, nasal epithelium NRP1 expression was lower in children compared to that in adults. Intestinal ACE2 expression was higher in children compared to that in adults, whereas intestinal ACE1 expression was higher in adults. Intestinal TMPRSS2 and NRP1 expression was similar comparing children and adult subjects. Conclusions: The lower severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in children may be due to a different expression of nasal NRP1, that promotes the virus interaction with ACE2. However, the common findings of intestinal symptoms in children could be due to a higher expression of ACE2 at this level. The insights from these data will be useful in determining the treatment policies and preventive measures for COVID-19.","output":"Age-Related Differences in the Expression of Most Relevant Mediators of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Respiratory and Gastrointestinal Tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tissue-engineered intervertebral discs (IVDs) have been proposed as a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). However, most studies have focused on fabrication and assessment of tissue-engineered IVDs in small animal models and the mechanical properties of the scaffolds are far below those of native human IVDs. The aim of this study was to produce a novel tissue-engineered IVD for IDD regeneration in the porcine lumbar spine. Firstly, a novel whole tissue-engineered IVD scaffold was fabricated using chitosan hydrogel to simulate the central nucleus pulposus (NP) structure, surrounded with a poly(butylene succinate-co-terephthalate) (PBST) fiber film for inner annulus fibrosus (IAF). And, a poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) ring was used to stimulate the outer annulus fibrosus (OAF). Then, the scaffolds were seeded with IVD cells and the cell-scaffold hybrids were transplanted into the porcine damaged spine and harvested at 4 and 8 weeks. In vitro cell experiments showed that IVD cells distributed and grew well in the scaffolds including porous hydrogel and PBST fibers. After implantation into pigs, radiographic and MRI images indicated that the tissue-engineered IVD construct could preserve the disc height in the case of discectomy as the normal disc height and maintain a large extracellular matrix and water content in the NP. Combined with the histological and gene expression results, it was concluded that the tissue-engineered IVD had similar morphological and histological structure to the natural IVD. Moreover, after implantation for 8 weeks, the tissue-engineered IVD showed a good compressive stress and elastic moduli, approaching those of natural porcine IVD. Therefore, the prepared tissue-engineered IVD construct had similar morphological and biofunctional properties to the native tissue. Also, the tissue-engineered IVD construct with excellent biocompatibility and mechanical properties provides a promising candidate for human IDD regeneration.","output":"Fabrication of a novel whole tissue-engineered intervertebral disc for intervertebral disc regeneration in the porcine lumbar spine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Using data from electronic health registries, this study intended to estimate the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in the population aged 65 years and more, against symptomatic infection, COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths, overall and by time since complete vaccination. Methods: We stablished a cohort of individuals aged 65 and more years old, resident in Portugal mainland, using the National Health Service unique identifier User number to link eight electronic health registries. Outcomes included were symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 related hospitalizations or deaths. The exposures of interest were the mRNA vaccines (Cominarty or Spikevax) and the viral vector Vaxzevria vaccine. Complete scheme vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratio, for each outcome, estimated by time-dependent Cox regression with time dependent vaccine exposure. Results: For the cohort of individuals aged 65-79 years, complete scheme VE against symptomatic infection varied between 43% (Vaxzevria) and 65% (mRNA vaccines). This estimate was slightly lower in the []80 year cohort (53% for mRNA vaccines. VE against COVID-19 hospitalization varied between 89% (95%CI: 52-94) for Vaxzevria and 95% (95%CI: 93-97) for mRNA vaccines for the cohort aged 65-79 years and was 76% (95%CI: 67-83) for mRNA vaccines in the []80 year cohort. High VE against COVID-19 related deaths were estimated, for both vaccine types, 95% and 81% for the 65-79 years and the []80 year cohort, respectively. We observed a significant waning of VE against symptomatic infection, with VE estimates reaching approximately 34% for both vaccine types and cohorts. Significant waning was observed for the COVID-19 hospitalizations in the []80 year cohort (decay from 83% 14-41 days to 63% 124 days after mRNA second dose). No significant waning effect was observed for COVID-19 related deaths in the period of follow-up of either cohorts. Conclusions: In a population with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications, we observed higher overall VE estimates against more severe outcomes for both age cohorts when compared to symptomatic infections. Considering the analysis of VE according to time since complete vaccination, the results showed a waning effect for both age cohorts in symptomatic infection and COVID-19 hospitalization for the 80 and more yo cohort.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against laboratory confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths, among individuals aged 65 years or more in Portugal: a cohort study based on data-linkage of national registries February-September 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims & Objective: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2) infection is currently in a global outbreak. COVID-19 has posed a huge threat to public health and economic stability worldwide. CR3022, a human monoclonal neutralizing antibody isolated from a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) recovery patient, was confirmed to be able to bind the S protein of HCoV-19 with a certain degree of neutralizing activity. Crystal structural information indicated that CR3022 could bind to the epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of HCoV-19, whose epitope consists of 28 amino acids, and 24 of them are conserved in SARS-CoV of SARS. However, the crystal structure is only a static conformation at a certain moment in time, and it cannot provide dynamic details of the interaction between antigen and antibody. Methods: In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation combined with MM/PBSA and CAS methods were performed to investigate the binding mechanism of binding of CR3022 against SARS-CoV-RBD and HCoV-19-RBD in order to determine their holographic dynamic information. Results: It was found that the CR3022-SARS-CoV-RBD complex was more stable during 100ns MD run than that of the CR3022-HCoV19-RBD system. There were common conservative amino acids on the ?2 sheet of RBD, including Tyr369, Phe377, Lys378, Tyr380, Gly381, Lys386, Leu390 and others. These conservative amino acids play significant roles in the binding process of CR3022 antibody against SARS-CoV-RBD and HCoV-19-RBD. It was also found that the binding mode of CR3022 to its native target SARS-CoV-RBD is more comprehensive and uniform. Moreover, the ?2 sheet residue Thr385 and non-?2 sheet residues Arg408 and Asp428 of the CR3022- SARS-CoV-RBD system were found to be crucial for their binding affinities, thus forming a special conformational epitope. However, these key amino acids are not present in the CR3022-HCoV-19-RBD system. The binding mode of CR3022 and HCoV-19-RBD is similar to that of SARS-CoV-RBD, but the deficiency of crucial hydrogen-bonds and salt-bridges. Therefore, the binding of CR3022 and HCoV19-RBD only draws on the partial mode of the binding of CR3022 and SARS-CoV-RBD, so there is a loss of affinity. Conclusion: Thus, in order to better fight the epidemic of COVID-19 with the CR3022 antibody, this antibody needs to further improve the neutralization efficiency of HCoV-19 through mutation of it's CDR region.","output":"Mechanistic Insights to the Binding of Antibody CR3022 Against RBD from SARS-CoV and HCoV-19/SARS-CoV-2: A Computational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had great effects on health systems worldwide, not only in relation to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases but also affecting patients with other pathologies. METHODS: ECIEN-2020 is an observational study conducted in a tertiary referral hospital in Navarra, Spain. It describes the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures adopted, in pediatric admissions for non-COVID-19 diseases. Admissions during March-June 2020 (first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain) are described and compared with the same quarter in 2019. A sub-analysis was performed delving into epidemiology. Patient characteristics (age, sex, past medical history), disease characteristics (symptoms, duration of symptoms, previous consultation in Primary Care Health Center), and admission characteristics (place and average stay) were analyzed. RESULTS: A 33% reduction in the number of pediatric hospital admissions was observed, decreasing from 529 hospitalizations in 2019 to 353 in 2020 (P < 0.001). This highlights a 48% reduction in patients admitted for pulmonary diseases. There were no significant changes in average hospital-stay, percentage of intensive care unit admissions, or in admissions for other reasons. Percentage of patients admitted among those seen in the emergency department rose from 5.1% in 2019 to 10.9% in 2020, whereas the total number of consultations in the emergency department decreased by 68%. CONCLUSION: The pandemic and the measures adopted due to SARS-CoV-2 have significantly decreased pediatric admissions for non-COVID-19 diseases, especially due to a reduction in the hospitalization for respiratory diseases.","output":"ECIEN-2020 study: the effect of COVID-19 on admissions for non-COVID-19 diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter aims to answer the following questions regarding the incubation period of COVID-19.

METHODS In thisretrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of elderly patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hunan province, China, from January 21 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed. The characteristics of young-old patients and old-old patients were compared. RESULTS Of the 105 elderly patientsconfirmed withCOVID-19, 81.0% were young-old patients, and 19.0% were old-old patients; 54.3% of elderly patients were females. Overall, 69.5% of elderly patients had underlying diseases, and the most common comorbidities included hypertension (43.8%), diabetes (25.7%), and cardiac disease (16.2%). Of the elderly patients, 22.9% were severe and 10.5% were critical severe cases. On admission, the most frequent symptoms in elderly patients included fever (66.7%), cough (64.8%), and fatigue (33.3%). Lymphopenia (31.4%), increased D-dimer (38.1%), depressed albumin (36.2%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (41.0%), and a high level of C-reactive protein (79.0%) were common among elderly patients with COVID-19. The median prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were longer in old-old patients than young-old patients (PT median 12.3 vs. 13.1 s, p = 0.007; APTT median 39.0 vs. 33.5 s, p = 0.045). Young-old patients showed fewer complications (14.1%) than old-old patients (40.0%; p = 0.0014) and fewer received invasive ventilator support (3.5 vs. 25.0%, p = 0.006). As of March 11, 2020, 85.7% of elderly patients had been discharged, 3 deaths had occurred, and 11.4% were still hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS Elderly patients usually have chronic medical illness and are likely to have a severe or critically severe condition. They could show atypical symptoms without fever or cough and multiple organ dysfunction. Old-old patients tend to have more complications than young-old patients during hospitalization.

However, before widespread use of RNA therapeutics becomes a reality, we must overcome a billion years of evolutionary defenses designed to keep invading RNAs from entering cells. Unlike small-molecule therapeutics that are designed to passively diffuse across the cell membrane, macromolecular RNA therapeutics are too large, too charged, and/or too hydrophilic to passively diffuse across the cellular membrane and are instead taken up into cells by endocytosis. However, similar to the cell membrane, endosomes comprise a lipid bilayer that entraps 99% or more of RNA therapeutics, even in semipermissive tissues such as the liver, central nervous system, and muscle.

METHODS Systematic literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases until November 2020. Observational studies in adults (18 years and over) that reported at least two measurements of weight and dietary intake in a year were included. Risk of bias was conducted using the Evidence Analysis Library by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics tool. This review included 16 unique studies after title, abstract, and full-text screening, and findings were narratively synthesised. RESULTS Of the six studies conducted in the farming populations, five were conducted in countries with two seasons (dry vs. rainy seasons) and all studies observed higher body weight during the dry season (up to 3.1 kg difference between seasons). The remaining study was conducted in a sub-tropical country and did not observe temporal weight patterns. Higher dietary intake was also reported during the dry season in the tropical countries. In non-farming populations (n = 10), temporal patterns were also seen, where higher body weight and adiposity was observed during colder seasons (autumn and winter). However, the opposite was found in a study conducted in Iran, where higher weight was seen in summer. Concurrent with higher body weight, higher energy, fat, carbohydrate and soda consumption, and lower fiber and vegetable intake were observed. CONCLUSION Temporal weight and dietary patterns exist, and they were country- and context-specific; these patterns were also related to factors such as activity levels, seasons and occupation.

The changes of S1PR1 expression in response to bacterial infection and blocking treatment were assessed using ex vivo biodistribution and in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) after intravenous injection of an S1PR1-specific radiotracer [(18)F]TZ4877. The specificity of [(18)F]TZ4877 was assessed using S1PR1-specific antagonist, NIBR-0213, and S1PR1-specific DsiRNA pretreated the animals. Immunohistochemical studies were performed to confirm the increase of S1PR1 expression in response to infection. Ex vivo biodistribution data showed that the uptake of [(18)F]TZ4877 was increased 30.6%, 54.3%, 74.3%, and 115.3% in the liver, kidney, pancreas, and thymus of the infected mice, respectively, compared to that in normal control mice, indicating that S1PR1 is involved in the early immune response to bacterial infection. NIBR-0213 or S1PR1-specific DsiRNA pretreatment reduced the tissue uptake of [(18)F]TZ4877, suggesting that uptake of [(18)F]TZ4877 is specific. Our PET/CT study data also confirmed that infected mice have increased [(18)F]TZ4877 uptake in several organs comparing to that in normal control mice. Particularly, compared to control mice, a 39% increase of [(18)F]TZ4877 uptake was observed in the infected muscle of S. aureus mice, indicating that S1PR1 expression was directly involved in the inflammatory response to infection. Overall, our study suggested that S1PR1 plays an important role in the early immune response to bacterial infection. The uptake of [(18)F]TZ4877 is tightly correlated with the S1R1 expression in response to S. aureus infection. PET with S1PR1-specific radiotracer [(18)F]TZ4877 could provide a noninvasive tool for detecting the early S1PR1 immune response to infectious diseases.","output":"PET Study of Sphingosine-1-phosphate Receptor 1 Expression in Response to S. aureus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevention and management of chronic disease primarily requires risk reduction measures, through strategic coordination across various government areas.

Nosocomial incidence is linked with infection control interventions.. METHODS: Viral genome sequence and epidemiological data were analysed for 574 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients including 86 nosocomial cases during the first 19 days of the pandemic. RESULTS: 44 putative transmission clusters were found through epidemiological analysis, which included 234 cases and all 86 nosocomial cases. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was obtained from 168/234 (72%) of these cases in epidemiological clusters, including 77/86 (90%) nosocomial cases. Only 75/168 (45%) linked, sequenced cases were not refuted by applying genomic data, creating 14 final clusters accounting for 59/77 (77%) sequenced nosocomial cases. Viral haplotypes from these clusters were enriched 1-14x (median 4x) compared to the community. Three factors implicated unidentified cases in transmission: i) community-onset or indeterminate cases were absent in 7/14 (50%) of clusters ii) 4 (29%) clusters had additional evidence of cryptic transmission. iii) In 3 (21%) clusters, diagnosis of the earliest case was delayed which may have facilitated transmission. Nosocomial cases decreased to low levels (0-2 per day) despite continuing high numbers of admissions of community-onset SARS-CoV-2 cases (40-50 per day) and before the impact of introducing universal face-masks or banning hospital visitors. CONCLUSION: Genomics was necessary to accurately resolve transmission clusters Our data supports unidentified cases, such as healthcare workers or asymptomatic patients, as important vectors of transmission. Evidence is needed to ascertain whether routine screening increases case ascertainment and limits nosocomial transmission.","output":"Combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection early in the pandemic and the role of unidentified cases in transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES In recent years, 2 modifications of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair-needlescopic (nTAPP) surgery and single-port (sTAPP) surgery-have greatly improved patient outcomes over traditional approaches. For a comparison of these 2 modifications, we sought to investigate and compare the extent of surgical trauma and postoperative consequences for the abdominal wall in these two procedures. METHODS In a retrospective study, 50 nTAPP and 35 sTAPP procedures occurring at a community hospital from November 1, 2009, through July 31, 2012 were reviewed. Intraoperative data, including length of the umbilical skin incision and operative time, were recorded. A follow-up evaluation included investigation of hernia recurrence, postoperative pain, abdominal wall mobility, cosmetic satisfaction, and period of sick leave. RESULTS The mean umbilical skin incision was 13  4 mm in nTAPP vs 27  3 mm in sTAPP (P < .001). The nTAPP procedure required less operating time than the sTAPP procedure (54.8  16.9 minutes vs 85.9  19.7 minutes; P < .001). The mean immediate postoperative pain score on the visual analog scale was 2.7  2.1 in the nTAPP group and 4.4  1.9 in the sTAPP group (P = .016). In addition, patients who underwent nTAPP had a shorter period of sick leave (11.2  8.4 days vs 24.1  20.1 days; P = .02). At the follow-up evaluation after approximately 30 months, abdominal wall mobility and cosmetic satisfaction were equally positive, with no hernia recurrence.

Accordingly, this leukotriene is involved in innate defense actions. OBJECTIVE: To examine if nasal LTB4 can produce neutrophil activity and to explore whether or not LTB4 can condition neutrophils to exert virucidal effects in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: 1. Twenty-three healthy subjects received nasal LTB4 in a randomized and sham-controlled design. Symptoms were scored and nasal lavages carried out. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and -defensins were monitored as indices of neutrophil activity. IL-8, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and (2)-macroglobulin were measured as indices of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, eosinophil activity, and plasma exudation. 2. Supernatants from neutrophils activated by LTB4 in vitro were assayed for virucidal activity against respiratory viruses. 3. In 38 healthy individuals, nasal inoculation with human rhinovirus-16 (HRV-16) was performed. In a preliminary study, intervention with LTB4 was given in a randomized and controlled design. Symptoms, virus replication, and antibody-titres were monitored. RESULTS: 1. LTB4 produced statistically significant increases in MPO and -defensins, whereas IL-8, ECP, and (2)-macroglobulin were unaffected. 2. The supernatants efficiently killed human coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza B virus. 3. HRV-16 replication was lower in subjects receiving LTB4, but this difference failed to reach statistical significance. Common cold symptoms and incidence of seroconversion were unaffected. CONCLUSION: Nasal LTB4 induces a selective recruitment/activation of neutrophils. LTB4 can condition neutrophils to exert virucidal effects in vitro and may reduce virus replication in vivo. We suggest that the condition induced by LTB4 reflects an enhanced state of innate defense.","output":"LTB4 increases nasal neutrophil activity and conditions neutrophils to exert antiviral effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This brief article presents an analysis of the potential consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic for healthcare professionals within a social psychology framework.

Discussions during an International Association for Dental Research symposium in London, United Kingdom, in 2018, followed by a workshop in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2019, concluded that there are few birth cohort studies that consider oral health and that a broader discussion on similarities and differences among those studies would be valuable. This article aims to 1) bring together available long-term data of oral health birth cohort studies from the low, middle, and high-income countries worldwide and 2) describe similarities and differences among these studies. This work comprises 15 studies from all 5 continents. The most studied dental conditions and exposures are identified; findings are summarized; and methodological differences and similarities among studies are presented. Methodological strengths and weaknesses are also highlighted. Findings are summarized in 1) the negative impact of detrimental socioeconomic status on oral health changes over time, 2) the role of unfavorable patterns of dental visiting on oral health, 3) associations between general and oral health, 4) nutritional and dietary effects on oral health, and 5) intergenerational influences on oral health. Dental caries and dental visiting patterns have been recorded in all studies. Sources of fluoride exposure have been documented in most of the more recent studies. Despite some methodological differences in the way that the exposures and outcomes were measured, some findings are consistent. Predictive models have been used with caries risk tools, periodontitis occurrence, and permanent dentition orthodontic treatment need. The next steps of the group's work are as follows: 1) establishing a consortium of oral health birth cohort studies, 2) conducting a scoping review, 3) exploring opportunities for pooled data analyses to answer pressing research questions, and 4) promoting and enabling the development of the next generation of oral health researchers.","output":"Oral Health Birth Cohort Studies: Achievements, Challenges, and Potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We herein report a 72-year-old woman with rheumatoid vasculitis who exhibited a depressed level of consciousness after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA BNT162b COVID-19 vaccine and was diagnosed with meningoencephalitis.

The developed cyp1a1-luciferase assay was highly sensitive to the widely used CYP1A inducers 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126). In the case of TCDD, significant dose-dependent increases in luciferase activity (0.3-300 ng/L) were detected. The assay was more sensitive to PCB 126 than to B[a]P. The assay also involved the highly sensitive expression of luciferase to extracted mixtures of PCBs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) collected from coastal sediments. PCBs were more capable of cyp1a1 induction in the assay system at small doses than PAHs in environmental samples.

We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population.

This information is especially important as pneumonia is the single leading cause of death in children worldwide. This Systematic Review aims to elucidate a better understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 on the pediatric population. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to gain insight into pediatric COVID-19 epidemiology. Specifically, Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify any relevant article with a focus on Pediatric Covid 19, Pediatric Covid-19, Pediatric SARS-COV-2, and Pediatric Coronavirus 19. References within the included articles were reviewed. All articles that met criteria where analyzed for demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, treatment and outcomes data. RESULTS: Ten studies including two case series and 8 retrospective chart reviews, altogether describing a total of 2914 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this systematic review. Of the patients whose data was available, 56% were male, the age range was 1 day to 17 years, 79% were reported to have no comorbidities, and of the 21% with comorbidities, the most common were asthma, immunosupression, and cardiovascular disease. Of pediatric patients that were tested and positive for an infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients were asymptomatic, 14.9% of the time. Patients presented with cough (48%), fever (47%) and sore throat/pharyngitis (28.6%), more commonly than with upper respiratory symptoms/rhinorrhea/sneezing/nasal congestion (13.7%), vomiting/nausea (7.8%) and diarrhea (10.1%). Median lab values including those for WBC, lymphocyte count and CRP, were within the reference ranges with the exception of procalcitonin levels, which were slightly elevated in children with COVID-19 (median procalcitonin levels ranged from 0.07 to 0.5 ng/mL. Computed tomography (CT) results suggest that unilateral CT imaging findings are present 36% of cases while 64% of pediatric patients with COVID-19 had bilateral findings. Of the studies with age specific hospitalization data available, 27.0% of patients hospitalized were infants under 1 year of age. Various treatment regimens including interferon, antivirals, and hydroxychloroquine therapies have been trialed on the pediatric population but there are currently no studies showing efficacy of one regimen over the other. The mortality rate of children that were hospitalized with COVID-19 was 0.18%. CONCLUSION: In contrast to adults, most infected children appear to have a milder course and have better outcomes overall. Additional care may be needed for children with comorbidities and younger children. This review also suggests that unilateral CT chest imaging findings were seen in 36.4% pediatric COVID-19 patients. This is particularly concerning as the work-up of pediatric patients with cough may warrant a bronchoscopy to evaluate for airway foreign bodies. Extra precautions need to be taken with personal protective equipment for these cases, as aerosolizing procedures may be a method of viral transmission.

RESULTS: A total of 813 children and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years admitted to ICUs with DSH were identified among 64 145 patients aged 0 to 17 years in the Australian subset of the registry during the study period. Median (IQR) age was 15.1 (14.3-15.8) years; there were 550 (67.7%) female patients, 261 (32.2%) male patients, and 2 (0.2%) patients with indeterminate sex. At the onset of the pandemic, monthly incidence of DSH ICU admissions per million children and adolescents increased from 7.2 admissions in March 2020 to a peak of 11.4 admissions by August 2020, constituting a significant break in the temporal trend (odds ratio of DSH ICU admissions on or after vs before March 2020, 4.84; 95% CI, 1.09 to 21.53; P = .04). This occurred while the rate of all-cause admissions to pediatric ICUs of children and adolescents of all ages (ie, ages 0-17 years) per 1 million children and adolescents decreased from a long-term monthly median (IQR) of 150.9 (138.1-159.8) admissions to 91.7 admissions in April 2020. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that the coronavirus pandemic in Australia was associated with a significant increase in admissions of children and adolescents to intensive care with DSH.","output":"Admissions of Children and Adolescents With Deliberate Self-harm to Intensive Care During the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Correction for 'Facile synthesis of ultrathin Ni-MOF nanobelts for high-efficiency determination of glucose in human serum' by Xiao Xiao et al., J.

The paper shows that while Tunisia has significantly reduced poverty between 2000 and 2019, the profile of the poor has not changed much: poverty remains concentrated in rural and western regions, mainly among households with younger men without education and headed by someone working in low-productivity sectors such as agriculture and construction. Moreover, the share of the vulnerable Tunisian population at risk of falling into poverty is quite large, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, even though poverty had been declining over the past two decades. Non-monetary dimensions of well-being, such as access to basic services, are also unevenly distributed across regions and population groups. COVID-19 has further aggravated these disparities and is reversing Tunisia's poverty reduction gains.

Since its discovery in December 2019, there have been countless cases of mortality and morbidity due to this virus. Several compounds such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and remdesivir have been tested as potential therapies;however, no effective treatment is currently recommended by regulatory agencies. Some studies on respiratory non-enveloped viruses such as adenoviruses and rhinovirus and some respiratory enveloped viruses including human respiratory syncytial viruses, influenza A, parainfluenza, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have shown the antiviral activity of cardiac glycosides, correlating their effect with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (NKA) modulation. Cardiac glycosides are secondary metabolites used to treat patients with cardiac insufficiency because they are the most potent inotropic agents. The effects of cardiac glycosides on NKA are dependent on cell type, exposure time, and drug concentration. They may also cause blockage of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ionic transport or trigger signaling pathways. The antiviral activity of cardiac glycosides is related to cell signaling activation through NKA inhibition. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) seems to be an essential transcription factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. NFkappaB inhibition by cardiac glycosides interferes directly with SARS-CoV-2 yield and inflammatory cytokine production. Interestingly, the antiviral effect of cardiac glycosides is associated with tyrosine kinase (Src) activation, and NFkappaB appears to be regulated by Src. Src is one of the main signaling targets of the NKA alpha-subunit, modulating other signaling factors that may also impair viral infection. These data suggest that Src-NFkappaB signaling modulated by NKA plays a crucial role in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we discuss the antiviral effects of cardiac glycosides on different respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 pathology, cell signaling pathways, and NKA as a possible molecular target for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Na+/K+-ATPase as a Target of Cardiac Glycosides for the Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic required a thorough re-organization of every sector of the healthcare system.

This was especially true during the first epidemic peak in France, which coincided with the national lockdown. The aim of this study was to identify whether a decrease in stroke admissions occurred in spring 2020, by analyzing the evolution of all stroke admissions in France from January 2019 to June 2020. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cohort study using the French national database of hospital admissions (Information Systems Medicalization Program) to extract exhaustive data on all hospitalizations in France with at least one stroke diagnosis between January 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020. The primary endpoint was the difference in the slope gradients of stroke hospitalizations between pre-epidemic, epidemic peak, and post-epidemic peak phases. Modeling was carried out using Bayesian techniques. RESULTS: Stroke hospitalizations dropped from March 10, 2020 (slope gradient: ?11.70), and began to rise again from March 22 (slope gradient: 2.090) to May 7. In total, there were 23,873 stroke admissions during the period MarchCApril 2020, compared to 29,263 at the same period in 2019, representing a decrease of 18.42%. The percentage change was ?15.63%, ?25.19%, ?18.62% for ischemic strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and hemorrhagic strokes, respectively. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Stroke hospitalizations in France experienced a decline during the first lockdown period, which cannot be explained by a sudden change in stroke incidence. This decline is therefore likely to be a direct, or indirect, result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Impact on Stroke Admissions during France's First Epidemic Peak: An Exhaustive, Nationwide, Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The real-world impact of polarization and toxicity in the online sphere marked the end of 2020 and the beginning of this year in a negative way.

Setting: Yaounde (Cameroon) and Cotonou (Benin). Methods: We used mathematical models of HIV calibrated to city population-specific and risk population-specific demographic/behavioral/ epidemic data. We estimated the relative change in 1-year HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths for various disruption scenarios of HIV prevention/treatment services and decreased casual/commercial partner-ships, compared with a scenario without COVID-19. Results: A 50% reduction in condom use in all partnerships over 6 months would increase 1-year HIV incidence by 39%, 42%, 31%, and 23% among men who have sex with men, FSW, clients, and overall in Yaounde, respectively, and 69%, 49%, and 23% among FSW, clients, and overall, respectively, in Cotonou.

This increase in HIV infections would be halved by a simultaneous 50% reduction in casual and commercial partnerships. Conclusions: Reductions in condom use after COVID-19 would increase infections among key populations disproportionately, particularly FSW in Cotonou, who need uninterrupted condom provision. Disruptions in HIV prevention/treatment services have the biggest impacts on HIV infections and deaths overall, only partially mitigated by equal reductions in casual/commercial sexual partnerships.

Despite improvements in donor screening and laboratory testing, a small risk of viral, bacterial or protozoal contamination of platelets remains. There is also an ongoing risk from newly emerging blood transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) for which laboratory tests may not be available at the time of initial outbreak.One solution to reduce further the risk of TTIs from platelet transfusion is photochemical pathogen reduction, a process by which pathogens are either inactivated or significantly depleted in number, thereby reducing the chance of transmission. This process might offer additional benefits, including platelet shelf-life extension, and negate the requirement for gamma-irradiation of platelets. Although current pathogen-reduction technologies have been proven significantly to reduce pathogen load in platelet concentrates, a number of published clinical studies have raised concerns about the effectiveness of pathogen-reduced platelets for post-transfusion platelet recovery and the prevention of bleeding when compared with standard platelets. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of pathogen-reduced platelets for the prevention of bleeding in patients requiring platelet transfusions. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to 18 February 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 18 February 2013), CINAHL (1982 to 18 February 2013) and the Transfusion Evidence Library (1980 to 18 February 2013). We also searched several international and ongoing trial databases and citation-tracked relevant reference lists. We requested information on possible unpublished trials from known investigators in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the transfusion of pathogen-reduced platelets with standard platelets. We did not identify any RCTs which compared the transfusion of one type of pathogen-reduced platelets with another. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One author screened all references, excluding duplicates and those clearly irrelevant. Two authors then screened the remaining references, confirmed eligibility, extracted data and analysed trial quality independently. We requested and obtained a significant amount of missing data from trial authors. We performed meta-analyses where appropriate using the fixed-effect model for risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and used the I2 statistic to explore heterogeneity, employing the random-effects model when I2 was greater than 30%. MAIN RESULTS We included 10 trials comparing pathogen-reduced platelets with standard platelets. Nine trials assessed Intercept? pathogen-reduced platelets and one trial Mirasol? pathogen-reduced platelets. Two were randomised cross-over trials and the remaining eight were parallel-group RCTs. In total, 1422 participants were available for analysis across the 10 trials, of which 675 participants received Intercept? and 56 Mirasol? platelet transfusions. Four trials assessed the response to a single study platelet transfusion (all Intercept?) and six to multiple study transfusions (Intercept? (N = 5), Mirasol? (N = 1)) compared with standard platelets.We found the trials to be generally at low risk of bias but heterogeneous regarding the nature of the interventions (platelet preparation), protocols for platelet transfusion, definitions of outcomes, methods of outcome assessment and duration of follow-up.Our primary outcomes were mortality, 'any bleeding', 'clinically significant bleeding' and 'severe bleeding', and were grouped by duration of follow-up: short (up to 48 hours), medium (48 hours to seven days) or long (more than seven days). Meta-analysis of data from five trials of multiple platelet transfusions reporting 'any bleeding' over a long follow-up period found an increase in bleeding in those receiving pathogen-reduced platelets compared with standard platelets using the fixed-effect model (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15, I2 = 59%); however, this meta-analysis showed no difference between treatment arms when using the random-effects model (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.38).There was no evidence of a difference between treatment arms in the number of patients with 'clinically significant bleeding' (reported by four out of the same five trials) or 'severe bleeding' (reported by all five trials) (respectively, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21, I2 = 2%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.12, I2 = 51%). We also found no evidence of a difference between treatment arms for all-cause mortality, acute transfusion reactions, adverse events, serious adverse events and red cell transfusion requirements in the trials which reported on these outcomes. No bacterial transfusion-transmitted infections occurred in the six trials that reported this outcome.Although the definition of platelet refractoriness differed between trials, the relative risk of this event was 2.74 higher following pathogen-reduced platelet transfusion (RR 2.74, 95% CI 1.84 to 4.07, I2 = 0%). Participants required 7% more platelet transfusions following pathogen-reduced platelet transfusion when compared with standard platelet transfusion (MD 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.11, I2 = 21%), although the interval between platelet transfusions was only shown to be significantly shorter following multiple Intercept? pathogen-reduced platelet transfusion when compared with standard platelet transfusion (MD -0.51, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.37, I2 = 0%). In trials of multiple pathogen-reduced platelets, our analyses showed the one- and 24-hour count and corrected count increments to be significantly inferior to standard platelets. However, one-hour increments were similar in trials of single platelet transfusions, although the 24-hour count and corrected count increments were again significantly lower. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of a difference in mortality, 'clinically significant' or 'severe bleeding', transfusion reactions or adverse events between pathogen-reduced and standard platelets. For a range of laboratory outcomes the results indicated evidence of some benefits for standard platelets over pathogen-reduced platelets. These conclusions are based on data from 1422 patients included in 10 trials. Results from ongoing or new trials are required to determine if there are clinically important differences in bleeding risk between pathogen-reduced platelet transfusions and standard platelet transfusions. Given the variability in trial design, bleeding assessment and quality of outcome reporting, it is recommended that future trials apply standardised approaches to outcome assessment and follow-up, including safety reporting.","output":"Pathogen-reduced platelets for the prevention of bleeding."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high incidence of thrombotic events suggests a possible role of the contact system pathway in COVID-19 pathology.

In the absence of specific antiviral medication, symptomatic treatment and physical isolation remain the options to control the contagion. The recent clinical trials on antiviral drugs highlighted some promising compounds such as umifenovir (haemagglutinin-mediated fusion inhibitor), remdesivir (RdRp nucleoside inhibitor), and favipiravir (RdRp Inhibitor). WHO launched a multinational clinical trial on several promising analogs as a potential treatment to combat SARS infection. This situation urges a holistic approach to invent safe and specific drugs as a prophylactic and therapeutic cure for SARS-related-viral diseases, including COVID-19. It is significant to note that researchers worldwide have been doing their best to handle the crisis and have produced an extensive and promising literature body. It opens a scope and allows understanding the viral entry at the molecular level. A structure-based approach can reveal the molecular-level understanding of viral entry interaction. The ligand profiling and non-covalent interactions among participating amino-acid residues are critical information to delineate a structural interpretation. The structural investigation of SARS virus entry into host cells will reveal the possible strategy for designing drugs like entry inhibitors. The structure-based approach demonstrates details at the 3D molecular level. It shows specificity about SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction, which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry, and the human protease completes the process of viral fusion and infection. The 3D structural studies reveal the existence of two units, namely S1 and S2. S1 is called a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and responsible for interacting with the host (ACE2), and the S2 unit participates in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. TMPRSS2 mediates the cleavage at S1/S2 subunit interface in S-protein of SARS CoV-2, leading to viral fusion. Conformational difference associated with S1 binding alters ACE2 interaction and inhibits viral fusion. Overall, the detailed 3D structural studies help understand the 3D structural basis of interaction between viruses with host factors and available scope for the new drug discovery process targeting SARS-related virus entry into the host cell.","output":"Structural Basis for the Understanding of Entry Inhibitors Against SARS Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted In various public health responses around the globe Due to the devolved powers of the United Kingdom, the response has been centralized but simultaneously greatly differing across England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland The following article examines the governmental responses to the outbreak, the public health measures taken, data collection and statistics, protective equipment and bed capacity, the societys response, and lastly, the easing of the lockdown restrictions In terms of the governmental response, the COVID-19 pandemic was initially met with less urgency and social distancing, along with the development of herd immunity, were first mentioned As the virus continued to spread, the government started imposing stricter measures and a lockdown was implemented Tests were conducted using a five pillar typology The collection of information, particularly on COVID-19 associated deaths, varied across the United Kingdom and among the governmental organizations due to differing definitions In term of hospital bed availability, the rate of hospitalizations was the highest from late March to early April of 2020 Temporary hospitals were constructed, however, they mostly went unused The United Kingdom society was generally compliant in adapting to the lockdown and trust in the government rose Nonetheless, as the lockdown progressed, trust in the government began to fall After several months, the rate of infection decreased and the lockdown in the United Kingdom was lifted in accordance with Our plan to rebuild: The United Kingdom Governments COVID-19 recovery strategy The slogan Stay at Home Protect the NHS Save Lives was replaced with Stay Alert Control the Virus Save Lives","output":"From 'herd immunity' to 'stay home' to 'stay alert': United Kingdom's response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical students generally express a low interest in Occupational Medicine.

Methods: We retrieved data from the English and Chinese databases with retrieval time from database inception to 30 September 2021. Network meta-analysis was performed, with evaluation of methodological quality among the included studies and assessment of strength of evidence among the outcomes. Results: A total of 77 RCTs with 5,647 patients were included. All the studies were rated as some concerns. In terms of 28-days-mortality, Yiqifumai injection (YQFM)+WM, Shuxuetong injection (SXT)+WM, Xuebijing injection (XBJ)+WM, and Shenfu injection (SF)+WM were better than WM; YQFM + WM and SXT + WM were superior for Shenmai injection (SM)+WM; YQFM + WM was superior for SF + WM; YQFM + WM ranked first. Regarding ICU length of stay, SF + WM and XBJ + WM were better than WM; XBJ + WM was superior for SF + WM; XBJ + WM ranked first. Concerning hospital length of stay, Shenqifuzheng injection (SQFZ)+WM, Shengmai injection (SGM)+WM, and XBJ + WM had greater potential than WM and SF + WM; SQFZ + WM ranked first. As for SOFA score at 7-days, XBJ + WM and SF + WM were superior for WM; XBJ + WM was superior for SF + WM; XBJ + WM ranked first.

It presents with a barky cough, stridor and hoarseness occurring secondary to inflammation of the subglottis and larynx. The clinical course of croup is well-described, however atypical presentations pose a diagnostic and management challenge. OBJECTIVES: This case report and systematic review aims to synthesize the published literature on the definition, diagnosis and treatment of atypical croup. STUDY SELECTION: Peer-reviewed journal publications in Ovid MEDLINE? and EMBASE from inception to January 1, 2019 in English, focusing on pediatric patients (<18 years of age) with diagnoses of atypical croup. DATA EXTRACTION: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Twelve studies involving 670 patients ranging from 6 months to 11 years of age presenting with atypical croup were selected. A variety of definitions of atypical croup were identified based on recurrence, duration of symptoms, severity, and etiology. Data on the incidence of atypical croup, the overall rates of intubation and tracheostomy, and patient characteristics leading to definitive airway management were not clearly characterized. LIMITATIONS: All studies were case series, case reports or retrospective chart reviews. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical croup is a poorly defined clinical entity that is used to describe recurrent, refractory, or croup-like illness that follows an uncharacteristic natural history. Our case presentation and accompanying literature review highlights the variable, but limited, information available on the diagnosis of atypical croup. Given the commonality of its use in clinical practice, we propose some guidelines around the use of the term atypical croup as well as a management algorithm.","output":"Defining atypical croup: A case report and review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There are serious concerns regarding the effectiveness of medical education in its current format during serious crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective To explore academic, financial, psychological, & hygienic impact on medical students. Methods A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study of students at different medical schools in Jordan. It included both basic and clinical years. Results There were 415 responses. Females constituted 51.8%. Around 50% of the participants were from the 6th year (n = 194, 46.7%). University of Jordan students represented around 40% of the responders. 60% of the students have GPA (Grade Point Average) of less than 3 points. Nearly half of the students indicated that their academic grades were affected during the pandemic. Clinical years students (51.0%) were more likely to be negatively affected than students in basic years (36.1%), P value 0.026. Sixty three percent reported that they sanitize their hands before touching eyes, nose, or mouth. More than two thirds (70.4%) of students indicated that their mental health was affected in the pandemic. Financial influence was a major aspect in around 53% of students and 34% of students were not able to pay the university fees due to the pandemic. The pandemic affected the elective training course location of 70.9% of respondents. Mental health was affected in 70.9% of students and 65.1% became more anxious or depressed with no significant difference among gender and academic years (P values 0.256 and 0.516, respectively). Students in the clinical years were more afraid of getting the infection than students in the basic years, however this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.084). Conclusions Covid-19 Pandemic negatively affected the academic course of the medical students especially at the clinical training years level across Jordanian universities.

Healthcare institutions cannot neglect the need to monitor and analyze popular social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook. To have a study success, a healthcare giver needs to be able to engage with their patients and adapt to their preferences effectively. However, data-driven decision-making is no longer enough, as the best-in-class organizations struggle to realize tangible benefits from their data-driven analytics investments. Relying on simplistic textual analytics that use big data technologies to learn consumer/patient insights is no longer sufficient as most of these analytics utilize sort of bag-of-words counting algorithms. The majority of projects utilizing big data analytics have failed due to the obsession with metrics at the expense of capturing the customer's perspective data, as well as the failure in turning consumer insights into actions. Most of the consumer insights can be captured with qualitative research methods that work with small, even statistically insignificant, sample sizes. Employing qualitative analytics provide some kind of actionable intelligence which acquires understanding to broad questions about the consumer needs in tandem with analytical power. Generating insight, on one hand, requires sound techniques to measure consumers' engagement more precisely and offers depth analytics to the consumer data story. On the other hand, turning relevant insights into actions requires incorporating actionable intelligence across the business by verify hypotheses based on qualitative findings by using web analytics to see if these axioms apply to a large number of customers. The first component of our visionary approach is dedicated to identifying the relationships between constituents of the healthcare pain points as echoed by the social media conversation in terms of sociographic network where the elements composing these conversations are described as nodes and their interactions as links. In this part, conversation groups of nodes that are heavily connected will be identified representing what we call conversation communities. By identifying these conversation communities several consumer hidden insights can be inferred from using techniques such as visualizing conversation graphs relevant to given pain point, conversation learning from question answering, conversations summaries, conversation timelines, conversation anomalies and other conversation pattern learning techniques. These techniques will identify and learn the patient insights without forgetting from the context of conversation communities, are tagged as 'thick data analytics'. Additionally machine learning methods can be used as assistive techniques to learn from the identified thick data and build models around identified thick data. With the use of transfer learning we also can fine tune these models with the arrival of new conversations.

Management of risk in care homes requires good evidence on the most important transmission pathways. One hypothesised route at the start of the pandemic, prior to widespread testing, was transfer of patients from hospitals, which were experiencing high levels of nosocomial events. Methods We tested the hypothesis that hospital discharge events increased the intensity of care home cases using a national individually linked health record cohort in Wales, UK. We monitored 186,772 hospital discharge events over the period March to July 2020, tracking individuals to 923 care homes and recording the daily case rate in the homes populated by 15,772 residents. We estimated the risk of an increase in cases rates following exposure to a hospital discharge using multi-level hierarchical logistic regression, and a novel stochastic Hawkes process outbreak model. Findings In regression analysis, after adjusting for care home size, we found no significant association between hospital discharge and subsequent increases in care home case numbers (odds ratio: 0.99, 95% CI 0.82, 1.90). Risk factors for increased cases included care home size, care home resident density, and provision of nursing care. Using our outbreak model, we found a significant effect of hospital discharge on the subsequent intensity of cases. However, the effect was small, and considerably less than the effect of care home size, suggesting the highest risk of introduction came from interaction with the community. We estimated approximately 1.8% of hospital discharged patients may have been infected. Interpretation There is growing evidence in the UK that the risk of transfer of COVID-19 from the high-risk hospital setting to the high-risk care home setting during the early stages of the pandemic was relatively small. Although access to testing was limited to initial symptomatic cases in each care home at this time, our results suggest that reduced numbers of discharges, selection of patients, and action taken within care homes following transfer all may have contributed to mitigation. The precise key transmission routes from the community remain to be quantified.","output":"Intensity of COVID-19 in care homes following Hospital Discharge in the early stages of the UK epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Objective This cross-sectional study was conducted to record post-traumatic stress (PTS) and post-traumatic growth (PTG) of the general population of Chinese, during the first wave of COVID-19 spread Method An online survey was conducted in China during February and March, 2020 to record the Chinese population's PTS (using the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, PCL-C) and PTG (using the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory, PTGI) due to COVID-19 Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs) and a Two-Part Model (TPM) of regression analysis were conducted Results In total, 29,118 Chinese completed the survey (54 2% were in their 20s, 68 0% were males, 60 3% had a college education) CFA results illustrated that bifactor models were better at describing the Chinese participants psychometric traits of PTS and PTG relative to the default models Results of TPM suggested that female, low-educated, and middle-aged individuals were more vulnerable to PTS Remarkably, mutual and positive correlations between PTS and PTG, though small in statistics, were observed through regression analyses Conclusions The current results presented new best-fit structural models, potential predictors, and valuable baseline information on PTS and PTG of the Chinese population in the context of COVID-19 Resumen Antecedentes/Objetivo Este estudio transversal se realiz para registrar el estrs postraumtico (EPT) y el crecimiento de estrs postraumtico (CPT) de la poblacin general de China durante la primera ola de la extensin del COVID-19 Mtodo Se realiz una encuesta en lnea en China durante febrero y marzo del a?o 2020 para registrar EPT de la poblacin (utilizando el Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, PCL-C) y CPT (utilizando el Post-traumatic Growth Inventory, PTGI) Se llevaron a cabo Anlisis Factorial Confirmatorio (AFC) y Modelo de Dos Partes (MDP) de anlisis de regresin Resultados En total, 29 118 chinos completaron la encuesta (54,2% de ellos tenan 2029 a?os, 68% eran hombres, 60,3% tenan una Educacin Secundaria) Los resultados de AFC ilustraron que los modelos de bifactoriales eran mejores para descubrir los rasgos psicomtricos de EPT y CPT de los participantes chinos que los modelos predeterminados Los resultados de MDP sugirieron que las mujeres, las personas con bajo nivel educativo y de mediana edad eran ms vulnerables a PTS Se observaron correlaciones mutuas y positivas entre PTS y PTG, aunque peque?as Conclusiones Los resultados actuales presentaron nuevos modelos estructurales de mejor ajuste, predictores potenciales e informacin de referencia valiosa de EPT y CPT de la poblacin China en el contexto de COVID-19","output":"Impacts of COVID-19 on psychological wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare disease in childhood.

METHODS: Samples were tested between 1996 and 2011 by the Department of Clinical Virology at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. All samples were sent to the university as part of routine diagnostic procedures, either to determine infection in clinically symptomatic individuals or to rule out infection prior to vaccination. To allow for statistical comparison, samples analysed between 2008 and 2011 were pooled into one population (n = 444) and evaluated against samples tested in 1996 (n = 840). Furthermore, analyses of subgroups were undertaken to determine the effect of sex and age on the prevalence of FeLV antigenaemia. RESULTS: With respect to the samples tested at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, it was determined that the level of FeLV antigenaemia in eastern Austria between 1996 and 2011 was 5.6%. The proportion of FeLV antigenaemic cats was highly variable and has not fallen significantly over this period, despite advances in vaccination, and the education of pet owners and animal welfare charities.

Mice deficient for RIPK1, specifically in liver parenchymal cells (Ripk1(LPC-KO)) and their wild-type littermates (Ripk1(fl/fl)), were challenged by either the murine hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) or poly I:C, a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA mimicking viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern.

Similarly, administration of poly I:C only triggered increase of systemic transaminases in Ripk1(LPC-KO) mice, reflecting liver damage through induced apoptosis as illustrated by cleaved-caspase 3 labeling of liver tissue sections. Neutralization of TNF- or prior depletion of macrophages were able to prevent the appearance of apoptosis of hepatocytes in poly I:C-challenged Ripk1(LPC-KO) mice. Moreover, poly I:C never induced direct hepatocyte death in primary culture whatever the murine genotype, while it always stimulated an anti-viral response.

Identification of high-risk cases is critical for early intervention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop deep learning models that can rapidly identify high-risk COVID-19 patients based on computed tomography (CT) images and clinical data. METHODS: We analyzed 297 COVID-19 patients from five hospitals in Daegu, South Korea. A mixed artificial convolutional neural network (ACNN) model, combining an artificial neural network for clinical data and a convolutional neural network for 3D CT imaging data, was developed to classify these cases as either high risk of severe progression (ie, event) or low risk (ie, event-free). RESULTS: Using the mixed ACNN model, we were able to obtain high classification performance using novel coronavirus pneumonia lesion images (ie, 93.9% accuracy, 80.8% sensitivity, 96.9% specificity, and 0.916 area under the curve [AUC] score) and lung segmentation images (ie, 94.3% accuracy, 74.7% sensitivity, 95.9% specificity, and 0.928 AUC score) for event versus event-free groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study successfully differentiated high-risk cases among COVID-19 patients using imaging and clinical features. The developed model can be used as a predictive tool for interventions in aggressive therapies.","output":"Deep Learning Models for Predicting Severe Progression in COVID-19-Infected Patients: Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Analysis of the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection caused SARS-CoV-2 indicates a significant impact of hemorheological disorders on its course and outcomes. It is known that chronic cardiovascular diseases are associated with the risk of severe course and lethal outcomes both in COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Therefore, in each case it is necessary to study the interaction and mutual influence of different components of the treatment program prescribed to such patients.The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of coagulation activity on the course of a novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) and to justify the management of comorbid patients having been received novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in previously selected doses according to indications in concomitant somatic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total 76 cases of confirmed coronavirus infection in patients who had been received initial therapy on an outpatient basis were analyzed. 26 patients who received NOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) made up the main group and 50 - the comparison (control) group in which patients had not been administered any drugs that affect blood clotting until the episode of COVID-19. All patients have been prescribed therapy following the Provisional guidelines ?Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection (COVID-19)? (https://static-0.minzdrav.gov.ru/system/attachments/attaches/). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The number of hospitalizations was significantly fewer in the group of patients who had been received NOACs (19 vs. 66% in the control group). No deaths or cases of severe respiratory and/or renal failure were observed in the main group, while adverse outcomes were noted in 14% of patients who had not been administered these drugs. CONCLUSION: Taking NOACs reduces the probability of severe course and adverse outcomes in the development of coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, which indicates a significant contribution of coagulation mechanisms to the pathogenesis in COVID-19. There were no indications for drug replacement and correction of anticoagulant therapy regimens in patients who received adequate therapy with oral anticoagulants for treating a non-severe form of coronavirus infection in ambulatory patient settings.","output":"[Effect of anticoagulant therapy on the course of COVID-19 in comorbid patients]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a new type of coronavirus that has caused a global pandemic The disease is highly contagious, and all people are susceptible to the disease Therefore, extensive measures were taken to prevent the spread of the disease at the community and hospitals This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on nosocomial infection rate Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an educational hospital, southeast Iran The nosocomial infection rates of critical/intensive care units (CCU/ICUs) and medical-surgical units were assessed during and before the COVID-19 outbreak Results: There was a 19 75-point decrease in the total rate of nosocomial infection during the COVID-19 outbreak (P = 0 02) In addition, there was a 39 12-point decrease in the total rate of CCU/ICUs' nosocomial infection during the COVID-19 outbreak (P &lt; 0 001) A 19 23-point decrease was also observed in the total rate of medical-surgical units' nosocomial infection during the COVID-19 outbreak (P = 0 13) All kinds of CCU/ICUs' nosocomial infections had between 31 22- and 100-point decreases during the COVID-19 outbreak Among medical-surgical units, 33 33- and 30 70-point decreases were observed only in UTI and SSI, respectively, during the COVID-19 outbreak, while BSI had a 40-point increase during the COVID-19 outbreak Conclusions: Proper implementation of infection control protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to reduce nosocomial infections","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Nosocomial Infection Rate: A Case of Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This symposium brings together four papers that address racial health disparities by investigating stressful aspects of social relations at different points in the life course.

Therapy of ALD depends upon the spectrum of liver injury that causes fatty liver, hepatitis, and cirrhosis. The foundation of therapy starts with abstinence from alcohol. Corticosteroids are used for the treatment of ALD but due to poor acceptance, continuing mortality, and identification of tumor necrosis factor-alpha as an integral component in pathogenesis, recent studies focus on pentoxifylline and, antitumor necrosis factor antibody to neutralize cytokines in the therapy of severe alcoholic hepatitis. Antioxidants also play a significant role in the treatment but till today there is no universally accepted therapy available for any stage of ALD. The treatment aspects need to restore the gut functions and require nutrient-based treatments to regulate the functions of the gut system and prevent liver injury. The vital action of saturated fatty acids greatly controls the gut barrier.

In this study, we selected 74 clinical samples from 43 recovering inpatients for qPCR and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) synchronous blind detection, and established a cutoff value for ddPCR diagnosis of COVID-19. The results showed that at a cutoff value of 0.04 copies/L, the ddPCR sensitivity and specificity are 97.6% and 100%, respectively. In addition, we also analyzed 18 retained samples from 9 discharged patients who relapsed. Although qPCR showed all 18 samples to be negative, ddPCR showed 12 to be positive, and there was only one patient with two negative samples; the other eight patients had at least one positive sample.

Using structural equation modeling, this study tested eight developed propositions.FindingsThe findings of this study indicated that the three key factors (i.e. restaurant dining environment, communication and hygiene and contactless features) made customers feel comfortable dining in the restaurant during the pandemic. Out of these three factors, only the restaurant dining environment and communication and hygiene were essential predictors for customers perceived trust toward the restaurant, leading to their willingness to pay more. This study used two moderators, customers perceived risk and support for restaurants to examine how they affected customers perceived trust and willingness to pay, respectively.Practical implicationsThis study provides both theoretical and practical implications to the current body of knowledge in customers dining-out behavior and the development of operational strategies for restaurants to accommodate customers changing dining-out behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To develop a holistic conceptual framework, this study incorporates two COVID-19-focused measurement items, perceived risk and support of the restaurant, to identify their moderating roles in the relationships among the five proposed measurement items.

Since face to face teaching was not possible during the COVID-19 pandemic the programme was delivered online using the same content and format as for prior cohorts. Feedback questionnaires from 128 face to face participants (F2F) and 133 virtual participants (V) were compared.ResultThere was a decrease in Likert scale ratings across all domains in the virtual group. This was most apparent when examining the strongly agreed responses: the venue/remote format was suitable for the session 34% decrease, the course length was appropriate 24% decrease, the pace of the course was appropriate 20% decrease, the simulation was helpful and relevant 15% decrease, the content of the course was organised and easy to follow 13% decrease, the learning objectives were met 10% decrease, the presenters were engaging 6% decrease, the trainers were well prepared 3% decrease. The virtual group included responses in the strongly disagree and disagree categories relating to the virtual format, length and pace, which did not occur in any domain for the F2F group.Combining the strongly agree and agree statements also showed a decrease in satisfaction with 72.5% of responses falling into this category for the V group and 88.3% for the F2F group. Fewer participants in the V group would recommend the course to a colleague (98% V vs 99% F2F).ConclusionProviding the SBL programme using an online format was feasible while also being acceptable to most participants. However, participants did not rate this experience as highly as face to face teaching. The largest decreases in satisfaction were in areas related to the virtual format. An interesting finding is that participants rated the pace and length of the online course as less agreeable, despite the content and scheduling being the same as for the face to face group.Based on these findings face to face teaching should resume when practicable. In the meantime, the virtual delivery may be improved if the course length was reduced.

To handle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel clustering approach for modeling human behavior (named, MTpattern) from time-series data. For mining frequent human behavior patterns effectively, we utilize a three-stage pipeline: (1) represent time series data into a sequence of regularly sampled equal-sized unit time intervals for better analysis, (2) a new distance measure scheme is proposed to cluster similar sequences which can handle temporal variation and uncertainty in the data, and (3) exploit an exemplar-based clustering mechanism and fine-tune its parameters to output minimum number of clusters with given permissible distance constraints and without knowing the number of modes present in the data. Then, the average of all sequences in a cluster is considered as a human behavior pattern.

This study explores the influence of genetic and non-genetic factors on INR normalization in the Arab (major part of Near Eastern) population in preprocedural warfarin management. METHODS: An observational prospective cohort study was designed to recruit Arab patients taking warfarin and scheduled for an elective procedure. Two INR readings were recorded. DNA extraction and genotyping of variants in CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2*3, VKORC1*2, and FII (rs5896) and FVII (rs3093229) genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed. RESULTS: Data from 116 patients were included in the analysis. CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic variants carriers required lower maintenance dose compared to non-carriers. The analysis showed that ciprofloxacin, antiplatelet medications, and INR index (INR at visit 1) are the only factors associated with the INR decline rate. Also, the proportion of CYP2C9*3 carriers with normal INR (1.2) on the day of surgery was significantly lower than those with wild-type genotype (28% vs 60%, p=0.013). In addition, heparin bridging, INR target, and Sudanese nationality are significant predictors of INR normalization (1.2) on the day of the procedure. CONCLUSION: Despite the confirmed effect of genetic factors on warfarin maintenance dose, the study was not able to find a significant effect of any genetic factor on the rate of INR normalization possibly due to the small sample size.

The mechanism that drives this global replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage.

In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monitor discharged patients and manage their recovery. As a result, it is sufficient to state that telemedicine can create a win-win situation. This paper aims to explore the significant capabilities, features with treatment workflow, and barriers to the adoption of telemedicine in Healthcare. The paper identifies seventeen significant applications of telemedicine in Healthcare. Telemedicine is described as a medical practitioner to diagnose and treat patients in a remote area. Using health apps for scheduled follow-up visits makes doctors and patients more effective and improves the probability of follow-up, reducing missing appointments and optimising patient outcomes. Patients should have an accurate medical history and show the doctor any prominent rashes, bruises, or other signs that need attention through the excellent quality audio-video system. Further, practitioners need file management and a payment gateway system. Telemedicine technologies allow patients and doctors both to review the treatment process. However, this technology supplements physical consultation and is in no way a substitute for a physical consultation. Today this technology is a safe choice for patients who cannot go to the doctor or sit at home, especially during a pandemic.","output":"Telemedicine for healthcare: Capabilities, features, barriers, and applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 has deeper effects on our current understanding of business strategy and its implementation.

Despite efforts to carefully monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported number of confirmed cases is likely to underestimate the actual number of infections. We aim to estimate the total number of COVID-19 infections in a straightforward manner using a demographic scaling model. This model is broadly applicable as it is based on little input data: deaths attributable to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection fatality rates, and life tables. As many countries lack reliable estimates of age-specific infection fatality rates, we map them from a reference country onto countries of interest based on remaining life expectancy. This scaling accounts for cross-country differences in the age structure, the health status, and the health care system. We also introduce easy to apply formulas to quantify the bias that would be required in death counts and infection fatality rates in order to reproduce a certain estimate of infections. Across the 10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of April 17, 2020, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 4 times the number of confirmed cases. The uncertainty, however, is high, as the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval suggests on average twice as many infections than confirmed cases, and the upper bound 10 times as many. Comparing our results with findings from local seroprevalence studies and applying our bias formulas shows that some of their infection estimates would only be possible if just a small fraction of COVID-19 related deaths were recorded, indicating that these seroprevalence estimates might not be representative for the total population.","output":"A demographic scaling model for estimating the total number of COVID-19 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brought great disaster to the world.

While depression is more common in females than in males, the associated factors linking depression and sleep-wake disorders in emergency physicians, particularly females, remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence of depression and sleep-wake problems among emergency medicine (EM) residents in South Korea and to identify the gender differences and situations that adversely predispose female residents to mental health problems. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using the data collected from the 2019 National EM Residents Wellness Survey targeting all of 630 EM residents in South Korea. The survey included variables potentially influencing depression and sleep-wake problems, such as personal characteristics, work-related stress, and extrinsic environment. Information regarding medical conditions, depression, job stress, and sleep deprivation was obtained using the self-administered Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Apgar Wellness Score (AWS), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). We analyzed the data using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 and MedCalc version 17. RESULTS: A total of 384 residents participated in the survey. Overall, 27.5% of the EM residents met the criteria for at least moderate depression and 36.9% of the EM residents had sleep-related problems. We found that difficulty in trading the shift schedule and frequent night shifts was associated with depression (p = .001, p = .005; respectively). Female residents demonstrated an increased risk of depression and sleepiness compared to their male counterparts (odds ratio [OR] 1.95, OR 1.81; respectively). In addition, logistic regression analysis revealed significant differences by gender in depression with regards to flexibility of trading shifts (p = .005), level of training in the emergency medical centre (p = .035), and frequent night shifts (p = .010). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately, one-third of EM residents report depression and sleep-wake problems, with female residents showing a higher risk than male residents. Several risk factors were identified, and future strategies should be aimed to address these issues to improve the training environment and overall wellbeing of EM residents.KEY MESSAGESThe prevalence of depression and sleep-related problems were, respectively, 1.95 and 1.81 times higher in female residents compared to their male colleagues.The associated risk factors for depression were flexibility of shift trade, level of training in the emergency medical centre, and frequency of night shifts.Improving the training environment and facilities, as well as offering more flexible duty trading options can provide potential opportunities to reduce the risk.","output":"High prevalence of depression and sleep-wake disorders among female emergency medicine residents in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has compounded the global food insecurity crisis, disproportionately affecting the consumers, farmers, and food workers (UN in Policy brief: impacts of COVID-19 on food security and nutrition, 2020, https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/sg_policy_brief_on_covid_impact_on_food_security.pdf).

Subtype OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is the more prevalent human coronavirus in several parts of the world. Recent studies have suggested these viruses can cause severe lower respiratory tract illnesses in children. OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, outcomes and severity of illness associated with HCoV-OC43 infections in a pediatric population. METHODS We retrospectively identified patients with positive HCoV-OC43 respiratory specimens between December 2009 and December 2010 in a pediatric hospital in Montreal. Each case was compared with 2 controls (tested negative for HCoV-OC43). Clinical characteristics, underlying conditions, outcomes and disease severity were reviewed for both groups. Risk factors and independent predictors of disease severity were also assessed. RESULTS During the study period, 68 patients were identified as infected with HCoV-OC43 (1.8% of specimens tested, 4.2% of all respiratory viruses identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). The majority (77%) occurred in November 2010. Chief symptoms of HCoV-OC43 infection were fever (in 78% of cases), cough (67%) and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (57%). HCoV-OC43 infection was not more frequent in children with preexisting conditions. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses was associated with lower respiratory tract infections in HCoV-OC43-infected cases, but did not lead to increased rates of hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit or death.

As a result, the inactivation prevents viral cell entry to the host's cell. In this work, we screened and identified two potent molecules that interact and inhibit the catalytic reaction by using computational approaches.

Objective: Focusing on these aspects, this manuscript reviews public awareness about COVID-19, myths surrounding it, its symptoms, treatment, transmission, importance of information sources, types of information to be considered in awareness campaigns, promotional channels, and their implications in Saudi Arabia. Methods: An online questionnaire-based survey was used for collecting data related to five major aspects related to COVID-19 and awareness creation process. The survey was accessed by 1,881 people, out of whom 741 people participated in the survey. However, 150 dropouts left the survey in between, as a result of which a final sample of 591 was achieved, indicating the response rate of 39.3% and a completion rate of 79.76%. Results: Awareness levels of the participants related to COVID-19, its means of transmission, preventive measures, symptoms, and treatment were identified to be moderate to high (60C80%). However, reliance on a few myths and violation of certain preventive measures were identified with majority of the participants (more than 60%). The Ministry of Health was identified to be the most reliable source of information followed by family and friends. Moreover, 15 types of information were identified to be highly relevant and important, which need to be effectively disseminated among the public through effective communication channels.

Some of these molecules are designed to bind the ATP side of the kinase domain avoiding protein activation and the subsequent oncogenic activity. A further improvement of these agents relies on the generation of non-allosteric inhibitors that once bound are able to limit the kinase function by producing a conformational change at the protein and, therefore, augmenting the antitumoural potency. Unfortunately, not all oncogenic proteins have enzymatic activity and cannot be chemically targeted with these types of molecular entities.

However, with the introduction of a negatively raked tool, surface fracture can be suppressed such that plastic flow of the material is possible. This paper focuses on the application and evaluation of machine learning methods to better assist the prediction of surface roughness parameters in Ge and provides a comparison with a well-understood ductile material, copper (Cu). Preliminary results show that both classic machine learning (ML) methods and artificial neural network (ANN) models offer improved predictive capability when compared with analytical prediction of surface roughness for both materials. Significantly, ML and ANN models were able to perform well for both Ge, a brittle material prone to surface fracture, and the more ductile Cu. ANN models offered the best prediction tool overall with minimal error. From a computational perspective, both ML and ANN models were able to achieve good results with smaller datasets than typical for many ML applicationswhich is beneficial since diamond turning can be costly.","output":"Application of Machine Learning to the Prediction of Surface Roughness in Diamond Machining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Combination therapy has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for cancer treatment.

Thus, to reduce the application of N fertilizer and keep in view the minimization of GHGs emission, without compromising soil fertility and wheat production, field experiments were performed with treatments included maize straw mulch (S1: 0, S2: 4500, S3: 9000 kg ha-1) and nitrogen fertilizer (N1: 0, N2: 192 and N3: 240 kg ha-1) during 2015-17. Results showed that the cumulative CO2 and N2O emission from 9000 kg ha-1 of maize straw mulch with 192 kg N ha-1 (S3N2) significantly decreased by 0.67% and 33.7%, respectively, averaged over two years compared with that of 9000 kg ha-1 of maize straw mulch with 240 kg N ha-1 (S3N3). Likewise, the average soil moisture content significantly increased by 10% and 10.6% for S3N2 and S3N3 treatments at 0-10 cm soil depth, respectively, compared to S1N1. Similarly, the S3N2 and S3N3 treatments had lowered the soil temperature by 0.2 and 0.1 C, respectively, over S1N1 in wheat grown fields. The grain yield of wheat was increased by 45% and 45% under S3N3 and S3N2 treatments than S1N1, respectively. The S3N2 treatment was more economical than S3N3 for wheat crop. Therefore, maize straw mulch (S3) combined with 20% less N fertilizer (N2) from commercial source were considered as a viable production technology to improve crop yield, and reduce soil CO2 and N2O emissions.","output":"Straw mulching with inorganic nitrogen fertilizer reduces soil CO2 and N2O emissions and improves wheat yield."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung Ultrasound (LUS) is regarded to be potentially useful to diagnose lung injury in older adults living in nursing homes with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia.

Subjects had to have a history of recent onset of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia or have been exposed to the contagion of patients carrying the disease. COVID-19 testing was performed with SARS-CoV-2 nasal-pharyngeal (NP) swabs. Positive subjects to LUS scanning were considered those with non-coascelent B-lines in >3 zones, coalescent B-lines in >3 zones and with iperdensed patchy non-consolidated lungs. Sixty-three percent had positive NP testing and 65% had LUS signs of pulmonary injury. LUS had a sensitivity of 79% in predicting positive NP testing. Sixteen percent of residents tested negative for SARSCoV-2 carried the signs of COVID-19 lung injury at LUS. There were 92 patients (61%) with current or recent symptoms.Positivity to LUS scanning was reported in 73% of residents with symptoms, while it was 53% in those without (P=0.016).

The aim of this study was to examine whether the complete ban on alcohol advertising in Norway in 1975 had any effect on total alcohol sales. METHODS Annual time series of recorded alcohol sales (1960-2006) were analysed. Autoregressive integrated moving average interrupted time series techniques were used to model the effect of the advertising ban, adjusting for alcohol prices and wages. RESULTS The autoregressive integrated moving average analyses showed a negative and statistically significant effect of the ban on total recorded alcohol sales, suggesting an immediate and lasting reduction of 7.4% (P = 0.002). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The complete ban on alcohol advertising in 1975 in Norway reduced recorded alcohol sales. This suggests that the ban had a protective effect by reducing total alcohol consumption.

Infected patients develop a wide range of clinical manifestations - typically presenting with fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue. Severely-ill patients may fall victim to acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart injuries, neurological manifestations, or complications due to secondary infections. These critically-ill patients are also found to have disrupted coagulation function, predisposing them to consumptive coagulopathies, and both venous and thromboembolic complications. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation products, and fibrinogen, all of which have been associated with greater disease severity. Many cases of pulmonary embolism have been noted, along with deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and systemic arterial embolism. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 has not been completely elucidated, but the virus is known to cause excessive inflammation, endothelial injury, hypoxia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, all of which contribute to thrombosis formation. These patients are also faced with prolonged immobilization while staying in the hospital or intensive care unit. It is important to have a high degree of suspicion for thrombotic complications as patients may rapidly deteriorate in severe cases. Evidence suggests that prophylaxis with anticoagulation may lead to a lower risk of mortality, although it does not eliminate the possibility.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of delirium and coma, and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19, to aid the development of strategies to mitigate delirium and associated sequelae. METHODS: This multicentre cohort study included 69 adult intensive care units (ICUs), across 14 countries. We included all patients (aged 18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression. FINDINGS: Between Jan 20 and April 28, 2020, 4530 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 69 ICUs, of whom 2088 patients were included in the study cohort. The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 400 (300 to 530). 1397 (669%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (875%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (640%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 70 days (40 to 120) and 1481 (709%) were given propofol for a median of 70 days (40 to 110). Median Richmond AgitationCSedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was C4 (C5 to C3). 1704 (816%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 100 days (60 to 150) and 1147 (549%) were delirious for a median of 30 days (20 to 60). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all p004), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p<00001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 50 days (00 to 140). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p<001). 601 (288%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU. INTERPRETATION: Acute brain dysfunction was highly prevalent and prolonged in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Benzodiazepine use and lack of family visitation were identified as modifiable risk factors for delirium, and thus these data present an opportunity to reduce acute brain dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.

Methods This was a single center, retrospective study of adults receiving HIV treatment or HIV/STI prevention services from 01/2019 - 12/2020. HIV outpatient visits were identified through HRSAs CareWARE. Visits (in-person, telehealth) only included HIV primary care. HRSA core performance measures were utilized (Table 1). STI positivity rates and descriptive characteristics were calculated. New and refill PrEP prescriptions were tabulated. Chi-square tests compared unmatched non-parametric variables;McNemars test matched non-parametric variables. Multivariable logistic regression identified variables associated with retention in care and viral suppression. Results 1721 patients received care;1234 were seen in both years, 334 only in 2019, 153 only in 2020. The number of telehealth visits increased significantly: video (0% to 31%, < 0.001), phone (0% to 0.4%, p < 0.001). Though the proportion of kept appointments increased (57.2% vs 61.2%), the annual retention in care rate decreased from 74.5% to 70.9% (p = 0.002). Overall, 9.7% of patients had detectable VLs at any point. Compared to 2019, a lower proportion of patients maintained VL suppression in 2020, (91.6% vs 83.5% p = 0.075). More patients did not have a VL drawn in 2020 than in 2019 (10.3% vs 2.0 %, p < 0.001). Patients with detectable VLs in 2019 were more likely than those who were undetectable to have detectable VLs in 2020 (OR 18.2, 95% CI 9.91-33.42). Black race was associated with higher likelihood of lack of VL suppression (OR = 2.0;95% CI 1.10-3.66). There were no significant differences between gender or age groups in rates of viral suppression, number screened for bacterial STIs or positive results. Visits for new and refill PrEP prescriptions decreased by 59% and 7%, respectively. Conclusion Rates of viral load suppression and retention in care decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. The proportion of clinic visits attended increased after the integration of telemedicine in 2020. These data may be used to inform evidence-based interventions to improve the HIV continuum of care through telehealth.

Over 100 million Samsung smartphones containing dedicated biosensors (Maxim Integrated Inc, San Jose, CA) and preloaded Apps to perform pulse oximetry, are in use globally. We performed detailed in human hypoxia testing on the Samsung S9 smartphone to determine if this integrated hardware meets full FDA/ISO requirements for clinical pulse oximetry. METHODS: The accuracy of integrated pulse oximetry in the Samsung 9 smartphone during stable arterial oxygen saturations (SaO(2)) between 70% and 100% was evaluated in 12 healthy subjects. Inspired oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide partial pressures were monitored and adjusted via a partial rebreathing circuit to achieve stable target SaO(2) plateaus between 70% and 100%. Arterial blood samples were taken at each plateau and saturation measured on each blood sample using ABL-90FLEX blood gas analyzer. Bias, calculated from smartphone readings minus the corresponding arterial blood sample, was reported as root mean square deviation (RMSD).

Since it was identified in Hubei, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and been declared a pandemic. Based on data from Hubei, infection and death distributions vary with age. To control the spread of the disease, various preventive and control measures such as community quarantine and social distancing have been widely used. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to develop a model where age is a factor, considering the study area's age stratification. Additionally, we want to account for the effects of quarantine on the SEIR model. METHODS: We use the age-stratified COVID-19 infection and death distributions from Hubei, China (more than 44,672 infections as of February 11, 2020) as an estimate or proxy for a study area's infection and mortality probabilities for each age group. We then apply these probabilities to the actual age-stratified population of Quezon City, Philippines, to predict infectious individuals and deaths at peak. Testing with different countries shows the predicted number of infectious individuals skewing with the country's median age and age stratification, as expected. We added a Q parameter to the SEIR model to include the effects of quarantine (Q-SEIR). RESULTS: The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model. As expected, quarantine tends to delay the peaks for both the exposed and infectious groups, and to \\"flatten\\" the curve or lower the predicted values for each compartment. These two estimates were used as a range to inform the local government's planning and response to the COVID-19 threat. CONCLUSIONS: Age stratification combined with a quarantine-modified model has good qualitative agreement with observations on infections and death rates. That younger populations will have lower death rates due to COVID-19 is a fair expectation for a disease where most fatalities are among older adults.","output":"Age-Stratified Infection Probabilities Combined With a Quarantine-Modified Model for COVID-19 Needs Assessments: Model Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we analyse the measures during the Covid-19 pandemic with which the Nordic countries Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland have placed restrictions based on the Free Movement Directive 2004/38/ec and reintroduced internal border controls stipulated in the Schengen Borders Code (Regulation 2016/399).

Factors associated with a worse COVID-19 prognosis include old age (> 65 years), ethnicity, male sex, obesity, and people with comorbidities. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency was reported as a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. According to a recent clinical case series, vitamin D deficiency is a modifiable risk factor, which has the prospect of reducing hospital stay, intensive care, and fatal outcomes. Vitamin D has potent immunomodulatory properties, and its supplementation might improve important outcomes in critically ill and vitamin D-deficient COVID-19 patients. Despite the evidence that supports an association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity, there is uncertainty about the direct link. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to assess if high-dose vitamin D supplementation has a therapeutic effect in vitamin D-deficient patients with COVID-19. METHODS: As the trial design, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center approach was chosen to compare a high single dose of vitamin D (140,000 IU) followed by treatment as usual (TAU) (VitD + TAU) with treatment as usual only (placebo + TAU) in patients with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency. DISCUSSION: Vitamin D substitution in patients with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency should be investigated for efficacy and safety. The study aim is to test the hypothesis that patients with vitamin D deficiency suffering from COVID-19 treated under standardized conditions in hospital will recover faster when additionally treated with high-dose vitamin D supplementation. Latest studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation in patients with COVID-19 is highly recommended to positively influence the course of the disease.

The survey tool was structured around the eight Pillars of the World Health Organizations (WHO) Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19. We used descriptive statistics to summarize quantitative results and content analysis for qualitative data. RESULTS: Among 88 invited programs, 65 (74%) responded and indicated that FETP residents and graduates have engaged in the COVID-19 response across all six WHO regions. Response efforts focused on country-level coordination (98%), surveillance, rapid response teams, case investigations (97%), activities at points of entry (92%), and risk communication and community engagement (82%). Descriptions of FETP contributions to COVID-19 preparedness and response are categorized into seven main themes: conducting epidemiological activities, managing logistics and coordination, leading risk communication efforts, providing guidance, supporting surveillance activities, training and developing the workforce, and holding leadership positions.

This new vision was developed during the period of online education in 2020-2021. The research shows relevance in the framework of developing high efficiency of professionally-oriented language education. Blended learning is an educational technology that has been theoretically developed in various countries over the past decades. Blended learning was and still is mostly understood as a combination of offline and online education as delivery methods;at present, such training involves a flexible combination of formats, in different proportions. The aim of the rese4arch is combining different types of delivery methods, pedagogical strategies, and tactics according to the needs of a particular student or a group of students. In Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University), we provide teaching of both foreign and native professionally-oriented languages. In the situation of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we started to use new approaches to education. One of the ideas was to use a blended learning technique mixing two language disciplines. This approach turned out to improve the efficiency of the teaching process in unprecedented conditions due to the inclusion of all the skills and systems of languages. We developed general speech culture, intuitive linguistic flair, enlarged students' active vocabulary, improved soft skills (flexible skills) of a non-linguistic type, which include critical thinking, teamwork, and creativity.

Objective: To determine the neurological phenotypes, incidence, and outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients with clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at 28 centers, representing 13 countries and 4 continents. The study was performed by the Global Consortium Study of Neurologic Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID) from March 1 to September 30, 2020, and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Neuro-COVID Registry (ENERGY) from March to October 2020. Three cohorts were included: (1) the GCS-NeuroCOVID all COVID-19 cohort (n = 3055), which included consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with and without neurological manifestations; (2) the GCS-NeuroCOVID COVID-19 neurological cohort (n = 475), which comprised consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had confirmed neurological manifestations; and (3) the ENERGY cohort (n = 214), which included patients with COVID-19 who received formal neurological consultation. Exposures: Clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Neurological phenotypes were classified as self-reported symptoms or neurological signs and/or syndromes assessed by clinical evaluation. Composite incidence was reported for groups with at least 1 neurological manifestation. The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Results: Of the 3055 patients in the all COVID-19 cohort, 1742 (57%) were men, and the mean age was 59.9 years (95% CI, 59.3-60.6 years). Of the 475 patients in the COVID-19 neurological cohort, 262 (55%) were men, and the mean age was 62.6 years (95% CI, 61.1-64.1 years). Of the 214 patients in the ENERGY cohort, 133 (62%) were men, and the mean age was 67 years (95% CI, 52-78 years). A total of 3083 of 3743 patients (82%) across cohorts had any neurological manifestation (self-reported neurological symptoms and/or clinically captured neurological sign and/or syndrome). The most common self-reported symptoms included headache (1385 of 3732 patients [37%]) and anosmia or ageusia (977 of 3700 patients [26%]). The most prevalent neurological signs and/or syndromes were acute encephalopathy (1845 of 3740 patients [49%]), coma (649 of 3737 patients [17%]), and stroke (222 of 3737 patients [6%]), while meningitis and/or encephalitis were rare (19 of 3741 patients [0.5%]). Presence of clinically captured neurologic signs and/or syndromes was associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.99; 95% CI, 4.33-8.28) after adjusting for study site, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Presence of preexisting neurological disorders (aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.80-2.75) was associated with increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or syndromes with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: In this multicohort study, neurological manifestations were prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and were associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Preexisting neurological disorders were associated with increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or syndromes in COVID-19.","output":"Global Incidence of Neurological Manifestations Among Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19-A Report for the GCS-NeuroCOVID Consortium and the ENERGY Consortium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater surveillance for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA can be integrated with COVID-19 case data to inform timely pandemic response. However, more research is needed to apply and develop systematic methods to interpret the true SARS-CoV-2 signal from noise introduced in wastewater samples (e.g., from sewer conditions, sampling and extraction methods, etc.). In this study, raw wastewater was collected weekly from five sewersheds and one residential facility. The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples were compared to geocoded COVID-19 clinical testing data. SARS-CoV-2 was reliably detected (95% positivity) in frozen wastewater samples when reported daily new COVID-19 cases were 2.4 or more per 100,000 people. To adjust for variation in sample fecal content, four normalization biomarkers were evaluated: crAssphage, pepper mild mottle virus, Bacteroides ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and human 18S rRNA. Of these, crAssphage displayed the least spatial and temporal variability. Both unnormalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal and signal normalized to crAssphage had positive and significant correlation with clinical testing data (Kendall's Tau-b ()=0.43 and 0.38, respectively), but no normalization biomarker strengthened the correlation with clinical testing data. Locational dependencies and the date associated with testing data impacted the lead time of wastewater for clinical trends, and no lead time was observed when the sample collection date (versus the result date) was used for both wastewater and clinical testing data. This study supports that trends in wastewater surveillance data reflect trends in COVID-19 disease occurrence and presents tools that could be applied to make wastewater signal more interpretable and comparable across studies.","output":"Tools for interpretation of wastewater SARS-CoV-2 temporal and spatial trends demonstrated with data collected in the San Francisco Bay Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides a literature review of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for disaster and pandemic management Most nations are concerned about disasters and pandemics, which, in general, are highly unlikely events To date, various technologies such as IoT, object sensing, UAV, 5G and cellular networks, smartphone-based system, and satellite-based systems have been used for disaster and pandemic management Machine learning (ML) algorithms can handle multi-dimensional, large volumes of data that occur naturally in environments related to disaster and pandemic management and are particularly well suited for important related tasks such as recognition and classification Machine learning algorithms are useful for predicting disasters and assisting in disaster management tasks such as determining crowd evacuation routes, analyzing social media posts, and handling the post-disaster situation Machine learning algorithms also find great application in pandemic management scenarios such as predicting pandemics, monitoring pandemic spread, disease diagnosis etc This paper first presents a tutorial on machine learning algorithms It then presents a detailed review of several machine learning algorithms and how we can combine these algorithms with other technologies to address disaster and pandemic management It also discusses various challenges, open issues and, directions for future research IEEE","output":"Disaster and Pandemic Management Using Machine Learning: A Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: One of the most vulnerable group to cope with the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic are women, particularly pregnant ones Objective: The aim of this article was to make review of the scientific literature to show clearly that pandemic is not so dangerous neither for mother nor her unborn and newborn children Results and Discussion: It should be stated that most of the scientific papers on COVID-19 are currently being conducted in a way that would probably be completely unacceptable to serious science in any other circumstances Taking into account everything we have learned about the SARS-CoV-2 virus so far it comes as a surprise that there has not been a more intense scientific debate on whether the blind lockdown model, implemented by most national governments, was truly an appropriate response to the challenges posed by the pandemic Conclusion: Deep analysis what science in perinatal medicine did assess and what it recommended to perinatal world it may be followed by principles that the research of the members of the Academy will not be the first to be published, but we certainly aim that the scientific evidence published by Academy is fast, reliable and implementable","output":"Why Not Lose Faith in Science in the Fight Against Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evaluating the stability of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses on human skin and measuring the effectiveness of disinfectants are crucial for preventing contact disease transmission.

The effectiveness of a relatively low ethanol concentration (32%C36% wt/wt) against the H5N1 subtype was substantially reduced compared with other subtypes. Moreover, recombinant viruses with the neuraminidase gene of H5N1 survived longer on plastic and skin surfaces than other recombinant viruses and were resistant to ethanol.

However, the function of PTPRH in asthma remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to access the association of PTPRH with asthma and its underlying mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the PTPRH level in asthma patients (n = 108) and healthy controls (n = 35), and analyzed the correlations between PTPRH and asthma-related indicators. Human bronchial epithelial cell (HBECs) transfected with PTPRH and asthma mouse model were set up to investigate the function of PTPRH. RESULTS: The expression of PTPRH was significantly increased and correlated with pulmonary function parameters, including airway obstruction, and T-helper2 (Th2) associated markers in asthma patients. PTPRH increased in the house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthmatic mice, while Th2 airway inflammation and Muc5ac suppressed when treated with PTPRH. Accordingly, PTPRH expression was markedly increased in IL-13-stimulated HBECs but PTPRH over-expression suppressed MUC5AC. Moreover, HBECs transfected with over-expressed PTPRH inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2 and AKT, while induced against PTPRH in HBECs dephosphorylated of EGFR, ERK1/2 and AKT. CONCLUSION: PTPRH reduces MUC5AC secretion to alleviate airway obstruction in asthma via potential phosphorylating of EGFR/ERK1/2/AKT signaling pathway, which may provide possible therapeutic implications for asthma.","output":"PTPRH Alleviates Airway Obstruction and Th2 Inflammation in Asthma as a Protective Factor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 infection has affected the world from the end of 2019 with pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations.

AIM: To elicit stakeholder views on drivers and barriers of integrated primary care and social services, and highlight opportunities for successful implementation. DESIGN AND SETTING: A qualitative interview study. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews with maximum variation sampling to capture stakeholder views across services and professions. RESULTS: Thirty-seven interviews were conducted across England with people including GPs, nurses, social care staff, commissioners, local government officials, voluntary and private sector workers, patients, and carers. Drivers of integration included groups of like-minded individuals supported by good leadership, expanded interface roles to bridge gaps between systems, and co-location of services. Barriers included structural and interdisciplinary tension between professions, organisational self-interest, and challenges in record sharing. CONCLUSION: Drivers and barriers to integration identified in other contexts are also present in primary care and social services. Benefits of integration are unlikely to be realised if these are not addressed in the design and execution of new initiatives. Efforts should go beyond local- and professional-level change to include wider systems- and policy-level initiatives.

INTRODUCTION: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the management of paediatric appendicitis has changed (open instead of laparoscopic appendectomy, antibiotic treatment). The number of complicated appendicitis cases increased worldwide. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric acute appendicitis: has there been more perforated cases? METHODS: Children operated because of acute appendicitis between 2012 and 2020 were studied. Cases from the year 2020 were analysed monthly. Patients were divided into perforated and non-perforated appendicitis groups according to their histological findings. COVID-19 status of patients in 2020 was studied. Chi2 test for trend and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In the study period, 1343 appendectomies were performed. The majority of our cases were non-perforated (1166/1343). The rate of perforated appendicitis cases has been increasing from 2015 (p = 0.0002). The number of perforated cases was higher in COVID-19 positive patients (5/8) then in negative ones (15/92) (p = 0.0075). DISCUSSION: In line with the international trend, more perforated appendicitis cases were treated in our departement in 2020. However, this increase started in 2015, and there is no correlation with the COVID-19 pandemic. The cause of the increased number of perforated cases in COVID-19 positive appendicitis patients is unknown. CONCLUSION: The causes of the high proportion of perforated cases in COVID-19 positive patients and the rising rate of perforated appendicitis cases since 2015 need further studies.

While methods for silanization of silica (SiO(2)) surfaces are very well developed, less has been done to develop and characterize silanization methods for alternative substrates, such as alumina (Al(2)O(3)). In particular, the behavior of Al(2)O(3) coatings grown on aluminum under ambient conditions has not been studied. To address this issue, we have tested solution-phase deposition of two silanes on Al(2)O(3) (3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane and 3-triethoxysilyl)propylsuccinic anhydride) and their applicability to analyte-specific biosensing. Contact angle measurements and imaging via Scanning Electron Microsopy (SEM) were employed to characterize surfaces.

METHODS: We used a web-based survey, and a convenience sampling method was adopted to collect data from 603 F-HCWs working at different hospitals in Nepal during the first week of June 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was utilized to assess the KAP perceived by the F-HCWs. It was divided into 4-parts consisting of 30-items, demographic characteristics (10-items), knowledge (10-items), attitude (5-items), and practice (5-items). It consisted of both multiple-choice questions and Likert scale items questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the participants, 76% reported adequate knowledge, 54.7% reported positive attitude, and 78.9% reported appropriate practice. Statistically significant differences regarding the perceived level of knowledge among F-HCWs were observed among independent variables, including age, gender, level of education, marital status, profession, work experience, source of information, infection prevention and control (IPC) training, and online course(p < 0.05). Similarly, statistically significant differences regarding the attitude among F-HCWs were observed among independent variables, including age, gender, level of education, profession, and online course(p < 0.05). Moreover, only 2-independent variables, including the profession and online course, showed statistically significant differences with practice(p < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant association between knowledge, attitude and practice at the level of p = 0.01. The factors significantly associated with adequate knowledge were male gender, nurse and doctor, websites and IPC training. Similarly, factors significantly associated with positive attitude were online course related to COVID-19 only. Moreover, factors significantly associated with appropriate practice were master's degree or above and online course related to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: F-HCWs reported adequate overall knowledge with a positive attitude and adopted the appropriate practice. The experienced F-HCWs with higher education and who received IPC training and online course regarding COVID-19 had better KAP. So, the stakeholders must arrange the educational programs and training for F-HCWs for better preparedness tackling with COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19: a National Survey on perceived level of knowledge, attitude and practice among frontline healthcare Workers in Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a member of a family of signaling proteins, was shown to serve as an entry factor and potentiate SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity in vitro.

NRP-1 has been suggested to be an immune checkpoint of T cell memory. It is unknown whether involvement and up-regulation of NRP-1 in COVID-19 may translate into disease outcome and long-term consequences, including possible immune dysfunction.

To this end, as smartphone ownership has become widespread, app-based therapies have become increasingly common. However, the research on app-based therapies is lagging behind. In particular, although experts suggest that human support may be critical for increasing engagement and effectiveness, we have little systematic knowledge about the role that human support plays in app-based therapy. It is critical to address these open questions to optimally design and scale these interventions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to provide a scoping review of the use of human support or coaching in app-based cognitive behavioral therapy for emotional disorders, identify critical knowledge gaps, and offer recommendations for future research. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most well-researched treatment for a wide range of concerns and is understood to be particularly well suited to digital implementations, given its structured, skill-based approach. METHODS: We conducted systematic searches of 3 databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase). Broadly, eligible articles described a cognitive behavioral intervention delivered via smartphone app whose primary target was an emotional disorder or problem and included some level of human involvement or support (coaching). All records were reviewed by 2 authors. Information regarding the qualifications and training of coaches, stated purpose and content of the coaching, method and frequency of communication with users, and relationship between coaching and outcomes was recorded. RESULTS: Of the 2940 titles returned by the searches, 64 (2.18%) were eligible for inclusion. This review found significant heterogeneity across all of the dimensions of coaching considered as well as considerable missing information in the published articles. Moreover, few studies had qualitatively or quantitatively evaluated how the level of coaching impacts treatment engagement or outcomes. Although users tend to self-report that coaching improves their engagement and outcomes, there is limited and mixed supporting quantitative evidence at present. CONCLUSIONS: Digital mental health is a young but rapidly expanding field with great potential to improve the reach of evidence-based care. Researchers across the reviewed articles offered numerous approaches to encouraging and guiding users. However, with the relative infancy of these treatment approaches, this review found that the field has yet to develop standards or consensus for implementing coaching protocols, let alone those for measuring and reporting on the impact. We conclude that coaching remains a significant hole in the growing digital mental health literature and lay out recommendations for future data collection, reporting, experimentation, and analysis.","output":"Human Support in App-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapies for Emotional Disorders: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to spread, several variants have emerged. Variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have attracted significant attention owing to their widespread transmission and possible immune evasion. A total of 19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on original strains have entered clinical studies, including nine vaccines that have obtained emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations. However, newly emerging variants may affect their protective efficacy. Decreased efficacy of the Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca vaccines against B.1.351 has been reported. The spread of variants creates a tremendous challenge for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic via vaccination. Several response strategies, including accelerating massive rollouts of current vaccines, increasing vaccine immunogenicity by increasing vaccination doses, and accelerating next-generation vaccines against variants, have been suggested. AREAS COVERED: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy against variants and response strategies for emerging variants. EXPERT OPINION: Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines authorized for emergency use or under clinical trials have shown certain advantages in providing adequate protection against new variants.

This paper critically examines the South African response through two conceptual frameworks. The first frames an optimal policy response as a solution to an intertemporal welfare-optimisation problem. The need for governments to balance epidemiological considerations and public health measures with the negative consequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions to limit transmission is particularly acute in developing countries. The second considers the use of scientific evidence and expertise through the lens of scientism C undue deference to science. The South African government erred towards drastic action in the face of predictions by some scientific advisors of a catastrophe, but initially without a clear, public long-term plan. Its lockdown has caused serious economic and societal harm across a range of measures. But these costs have not been matched by proportional benefits in health system preparedness or, based on evidence three months into the epidemic, a definitive improvement in expected long-term epidemic outcomes. This failure, and the questionably confident basis for the original lockdown decision, has been obscured by the governments performative scientism C a public performance of deference to science C even in the absence of transparent decision-making. One consequence was a slower correction of strategy than merited by evidence of limited benefits and high costs of the lockdown. Another was an unwillingness to admit and explain errors after the fact.

A leading contributor to these concerning outcomes is a lack of available intensive care unit (intensive care unit) beds and mechanical ventilation support. Poorer health is associated with a higher risk for severe respiratory complications from the coronavirus. We hypothesize that impaired respiratory muscle performance is an underappreciated factor contributing to poor outcomes unfolding during the coronavirus pandemic. While impaired respiratory muscle performance is considered to be rare, it is more frequently encountered in patients with poorer health, in particular obesity. However, measures of respiratory muscle performance are not routinely performed in clinical practice, including those with symptoms such as dyspnea. The purpose of this perspective paper is to discuss the potential role of respiratory muscle performance from the perspective of the coronavirus pandemic. We also provide a theoretical patient management model to screen for impaired respiratory muscle performance and intervene if identified with the goal of unburdening healthcare systems during future pandemic crises. ? Poor baseline health increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus infection and poorer outcomes. ? Patients with poorer baseline health, notably obesity, are more likely to demonstrate impaired respiratory muscle performance, and poorer outcomes following intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. ?

We compared 6 calculations of excess deaths (4 previously published and two new ones that we performed with and without age-adjustment) for 2020-2021. With each approach, we calculated excess deaths metrics and the ratio R of excess deaths over recorded COVID-19 deaths. The main analysis focused on 33 high-income countries with weekly deaths in the Human Mortality Database (HMD at mortality.org) and reliable death registration. Secondary analyses compared calculations for other countries, whenever available. Across the 33 high-income countries, excess deaths were 2.0-2.8 million without age-adjustment, and 1.6-2.1 million with age-adjustment with large differences across countries. In our analyses after age-adjustment, 8 of 33 countries had no overall excess deaths; there was a death deficit in children; and 0.478 million (29.7%) of the excess deaths were in people <65 years old. In countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain excess death estimates differed 2 to 4-fold between highest and lowest figures. The R values range exceeded 0.3 in all 33 countries. In 16 of 33 countries, the range of R exceeded 1. In 25 of 33 countries some calculations suggest R>1 (excess deaths exceeding COVID-19 deaths) while others suggest R<1 (excess deaths smaller than COVID-19 deaths). Inferred data from 4 evaluations for 42 countries and from 3 evaluations for another 98 countries are very tenuous Estimates of excess deaths are analysis-dependent and age-adjustment is important to consider. Excess deaths may be lower than previously calculated. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTExcess deaths are a key metric for assessing the impact of a pandemic. They reflect the composite impact of deaths from infection, from indirect pandemic effects, and from the measures taken. Different modeling approaches can be used to calculate excess deaths for the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we compare four previous calculations of excess deaths and two new ones that we performed with and without adjusting for changing age structure in the estimation. Proper age-adjustment results in substantial reduction in estimates of excess deaths for 2020-2021. While results from different calculation methods are correlated, the absolute differences in estimated excess deaths are very high in most countries.

A Phase 2/3 study with two parts is currently ongoing and data up to Day 28 of Part 1 is available while the data from 1315 patients enrolled in Part 2 are expected in June 2021. METHODS: This phase 2/3, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind study with 2 parts is aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of regdanvimab in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, not requiring supplemental oxygen therapy. Patients aged >18 with the onset of symptoms within 7 days were eligible to be enrolled. RESULTS: In Part 1, 307 patients (101, 103, and 103 patients in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg, regdanvimab 80 mg/kg, and placebo groups, respectively) were confirmed to have COIVD-19 by RT-qPCR at Day 1 (or Day 2). Regdanvimab significantly reduced the proportion of patients who required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen therapy compared to placebo (8.7% in the placebo vs. 4.0% in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg). The difference in events rate was even larger in patients who met the high-risk criteria and confirmed a 66.1% reduction in patients receiving regdanvimab 40 mg/kg (Table 1). The median time to clinical recovery was shortened by 2.9 days (7.18 days for regdanvimab 40 mg/kg and 10.03 days for placebo; high-risk). Also, greater reductions from baseline viral load were shown in regdanvimab groups (Figure 1). The safety results confirmed that the regdanvimab was safe and well-tolerated. Occurrence of adverse events (Table 2) and results of other safety assessments were generally comparable among the 3 groups. The overall rate of infusion-related reaction was low and no serious adverse events or deaths were reported. The anti-drug antibody positive rate was low in the regdanvimab groups (1.4% in regdanvimab vs. 4.5% in placebo), and no antibody-dependent enhancement was reported. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Results from the first part of the study indicate that regdanvimab may lower the rate of hospitalisation or requirement of oxygen supplementation, with the greatest benefit noted in patients at high-risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. The second part of the study remains ongoing and blinded. Therefore, results for the primary endpoint are forthcoming and will be presented at IDWeek. DISCLOSURES: Michael G.

Mutations rapidly expanding frequency in a viral population are candidates for advantageous mutations, but neutral mutations hitchhiking with advantageous mutations are also likely to be included. To distinguish these, we focus on mutations that appear to occur independently in different lineages and expand in frequency in a convergent evolutionary manner. Batch-learning SOM (BLSOM) can separate SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences according by lineage from only providing the oligonucleotide composition. Focusing on remarkably expanding 20-mers, each of which is only represented by one copy in the viral genome, allows us to correlate the expanding 20-mers to mutations. Using visualization functions in BLSOM, we can efficiently identify mutations that have expanded remarkably both in the Omicron lineage, which is phylogenetically distinct from other lineages, and in other lineages. Most of these mutations involved changes in amino acids, but there were a few that did not, such as an intergenic mutation.","output":"AI-based search for convergently expanding, advantageous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 by focusing on oligonucleotide frequencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue virus (DENV) infection can lead to a complex spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening severe dengue. The reasons for thus drastically varying manifestations of the disease remain an enigma. Herein, we reported an original discovery of the synergistic effect between preexisting EpsteinCBarr virus (EBV) infection and DENV superinfection in vitro and of a strong correlation of these two viruses in the clinical samples from dengue patients. We showed that (I) DENV-2 infection of an EBV-positive cell line (EBV + Akata cell) reactivated EBV, and it could be blocked by wortmannin treatment. (II) Examination of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from dengue patients revealed significantly elevated cell-associated EBV DNA copy number at the time of hospitalization vs. at the time of disease recovery in most individuals. (III) EBV infection promoted DENV propagation in both EBV-hosting B cells and indirectly in THP-1 cells, supported by the following evidence: (A) EBV + Akata cells were more permissive to DENV-2 infection compared with Akata cells harboring no EBV virus (EBV- Akata cells). (B) Low-molecular weight fraction secreted from EBV + Akata cells could enhance DENV-2 propagation in monocytic THP-1 cells. (C) While reactivation of EBV in EBV + Akata cells further increased DENV-2 yield from this cell line, pharmacological inhibition of EBV replication by acyclovir had the opposite effect. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation demonstrating a positive correlation between EBV and DENV in vitro and in human biospecimens.","output":"In vitro Studies and Clinical Observations Imply a Synergistic Effect Between Epstein-Barr Virus and Dengue Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scrub typhus is a neglected tropical disease predominantly occurring in Asia.

Carnosine (Car) is an outstanding and safe antioxidant. Herein, the feasibility and efficiency of ultrasmall graphene oxide decorated with carnosine as an alternative immune adjuvant were explored. OVA@GO-Car was prepared by simply mixing ovalbumin (OVA, a model antigen) with ultrasmall GO covalently modified with carnosine (GO-Car).

Results show that OVA@GO-Car can promote robust and durable OVA-specific antibody response, increase lymphocyte proliferation efficiency, and enhance CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cell activation. The presence of Car in GO also probably contributes to enhancing the antigen-specific adaptive immune response through modulating the expression of some cytokines, including IL-6, CXCL1, CCL2, and CSF3. In addition, the safety of GO-Car as an adjuvant was evaluated comprehensively. No symptoms such as allergic response, inflammatory redness swelling, raised surface temperatures, physiological anomalies of blood, and remarkable weight changes were observed. Besides, after modification with carnosine, histological damages caused by GO-Car in lung, muscle, kidney, and spleen became weaken significantly.

There is widespread usage of garlic supplements. The common cold is associated with significant morbidity and economic consequences. On average, children have six to eight colds per year, and adults have two to four. OBJECTIVES To determine whether garlic (allium sativum) is effective for either the prevention or treatment of the common cold, when compared to placebo, no treatment or other treatments. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register; OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March Week 3, 2009); EMBASE (1974 to March 2009); and AMED (1985 to March 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials of common cold prevention and treatment comparing garlic with placebo, no treatment or standard treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently reviewed and selected trials from searches, assessed and rated study quality, and extracted relevant data. MAIN RESULTS Of the five trials identified as potentially relevant from our searches, only one trial met the inclusion criteria. This trial randomly assigned 146 volunteer participants to either a garlic supplement (with 180 mg of allicin content) or a placebo (once daily) for 12 weeks. The trial reported 65 occurrences of the common cold in the placebo group compared with 24 in the garlic intervention group (P < 0.001). The number of days of illness was lower in the garlic group compared with the placebo group (111 versus 366). The number of days to recovery was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63). Because only one trial met the inclusion criteria, limited conclusions can be drawn. The trial relied on self-reported episodes of the common cold, but was of reasonable quality in terms of randomisation and allocation concealment. Adverse effects included rash and odour. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient clinical trial evidence regarding the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold. A single trial suggested that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold, but more studies are needed to validate this finding.

Comparatively, little is known about intern and resident perceptions of upcoming medical intensive care unit (ICU) rotations. The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed both undergraduate and graduate medical education, decreasing the number of in-person patient encounters and teaching opportunities while increasing trainee anxiety. In response to pandemic-associated educational changes, we created an asynchronous, online video curriculum for Internal Medicine (IM) trainees to complete in preparation for their ICU rotation to reduce pre-rotation anxiety, increase confidence, and improve overall sense of preparedness. Methods: A 7-session video curriculum was created and distributed to post-graduate year (PGY) 1-3 IM residents 1 week prior to the start of their ICU rotation. The video series covered core critical care topics including bedside presentations, support devices, shock, and respiratory failure. Overall, the series contained approximately 1.5 hours of critical care-focused content. The impact of the videos on resident anxiety, confidence, and level of preparation prior to the start of their ICU rotation was assessed with a pre-and post-survey with respondents rating their level of agreement on a scale of 0-100. Differences between pre-and post-survey scores were evaluated using a paired t-test. Results: Eighty-five trainees completed the pre-survey and 44 trainees completed the post-survey between June and December 2020. Thirty-six paired responses were obtained (17 PGY-1, 13 PGY-2, 6 PGY-3). Eighty-six percent of paired respondents reported watching all 7 videos.

All patients were severe psittacosis pneumonia developed respiratory failure, accompanied by sepsis in 6/9 patients. mNGS takes 48C72 h to provide the results, and help to identify diagnosis of psittacosis. Laboratory data showed normal or slightly increased leucocytes, neutrophils, and procalcitonin but high C-reactive protein levels. Computed tomography revealed air-space consolidation and ground-glass opacity, which began in the upper lobe of one lung, and spread to both lungs, along with miliary, nodular, or consolidated shadows. One patient died because of secondary infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the other eight patients experienced complete recoveries. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mNGS can improve accuracy and reduce the delay in diagnosis of psittacosis. Severe psittacosis pneumonia responds well to the timely use of appropriate antibiotics.","output":"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of severe pneumonias caused by Chlamydia psittaci"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Reports of tuberculosis involving 4 contiguous spinal levels are rare. Surgery is often required in this population for neurological decompression and stabilization. These patients appear to be particularly predisposed to complications that include incomplete recovery of neurological function after decompression as well as post-treatment kyphosis. In settings with limited available instrumentation, reconstruction of the anterior column can be challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION A 35-year-old woman presented with back pain, progressive weakness in her bilateral lower extremities, and inability to walk for 2 months. Imaging demonstrated anterior destruction of T10, T11, T12, and L1 with severe retropulsion and cord impingement at T11-T12. The patient was taken for anterolateral corpectomies of T10-L1 with decompression of the thoracic spinal cord and fibular strut autograft placement followed by a T8 to L3 posterior spinal fusion. An intramedullary Kirschner-wire (K-wire) was placed during the anterolateral procedure to enhance fibular graft placement and prevent dislodgement before definitive posterior fusion. CONCLUSIONS At follow-up five-and-a-half months after the operation, the patient had recovered full strength and was ambulating without difficulty. Imaging at this time demonstrated stable restoration of alignment without graft dislodgement. Intramedullary fibular K-wire placement in this procedure helped to optimize anterior column reconstruction. The principles used in this report may prove beneficial to surgeons in developing countries who encounter pathology of this extent.","output":"Use of Intramedullary K-Wire to Enhance Fibular Graft Placement in 4-Level Thoracolumbar Corpectomy for Pott Disease: Case Report and Review of Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Micronutrient deficiencies continue to be widespread among children under-five in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), despite the fact that several effective strategies now exist to prevent them. This kind of malnutrition can have several immediate and long-term consequences, including stunted growth, a higher risk of acquiring infections, and poor development outcomes, all of which may lead to a child not achieving his or her full potential. This review systematically synthesizes the available evidence on the strategies used to prevent micronutrient malnutrition among children under-five in LMICs, including single and multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation, lipid-based nutrient supplementation (LNS), targeted and large-scale fortification, and point-of-use-fortification with micronutrient powders (MNPs). We searched relevant databases and grey literature, retrieving 35,924 papers. After application of eligibility criteria, we included 197 unique studies. Of note, we examined the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions. We found that certain outcomes, such as anemia, responded to several intervention types. The risk of anemia was reduced with iron alone, iron-folic acid, MMN supplementation, MNPs, targeted fortification, and large-scale fortification. Stunting and underweight, however, were improved only among children who were provided with LNS, though MMN supplementation also slightly increased length-for-age z-scores. Vitamin A supplementation likely reduced all-cause mortality, while zinc supplementation decreased the incidence of diarrhea. Importantly, many effects of LNS and MNPs held when pooling data from effectiveness studies. Taken together, this evidence further supports the importance of these strategies for reducing the burden of micronutrient malnutrition in children. Population and context should be considered when selecting one or more appropriate interventions for programming.","output":"Micronutrient Supplementation and Fortification Interventions on Health and Development Outcomes among Children Under-Five in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Progressing from postdoctoral training to a STEM faculty appointment at a Research Intensive Institution (RII) is a daunting transition, and may be especially challenging to those who have followed a less-than-conventional path or whose peers have lost interest in academic careers.

Studies have shown that such inflammation and impaired insulin signaling contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed for the treatment of T2DM and T2DM-linked AD. Melatonin is primarily known for its circadian role which conveys message of darkness and induces night-state physiological functions. Besides rhythm-related effects, melatonin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Melatonin levels are downregulated in metabolic disorders with IR, and activation of melatonin signaling delays disease progression. The aim of this Review is to highlight the therapeutic potentials of melatonin in preventing the acceleration of AD in T2DM individuals through its therapeutic mechanisms, including antioxidative effects, anti-inflammatory effects, restoring mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity.","output":"The role of melatonin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spike (S) glycoprotein is one of the major structure proteins of SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV).

For both, pain can be complex with unfamiliar presentations and the pains hard to assign to known disorders. For many survivors, pain and associated disability are overshadowed by psychological distress, often by post-traumatic stress symptoms that can be frightening and isolating. Pain medicine in war can exemplify best techniques and organisation, reducing suffering, but many military veterans have persistent pain that undermines their readjustment. By contrast, survivors of torture rarely have any acute health care; their risk for developing chronic pain is high. Even when settled as refugees in a well-resourced country, their access to healthcare may be restricted. Recent evidence is reviewed that informs assessment and treatment of pain in both groups, with the broader context of psychological distress addressed at the end.

During coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), abnormal liver function is typically observed. However, liver injury may occur because of the treatment as well. Ischemia, cytokine storm, and hypoxia were identified as the three major factors contributing to liver damage during COVID-19. Indeed, raised liver enzymes during hospitalizations may be attributed to medications used, as well as sepsis and shock. As a result, the proportion of hospitalized patients afflicted with COVID-19 and pathological liver biomarkers varies from 14% to 53%. Aminotransferases and bilirubin are found most often elevated. Usually, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and decreased serum albumin levels are demonstrated. Additionally, although there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, many of the drugs used to treat the infection are hepatotoxic.
