Mixing insecticides is a new strategy for accelerating pest control; furthermore, it can overcome insect resistance to insecticides. This study aims to evaluate three insecticides, chlorfenapyr, abamectin, and lambda-cyhalothrin, individually and their binary mixtures against 2nd instar larvae of M. domestica laboratory strain. Chlorfenapyr exhibited the most toxic effect on larvae, followed by abamectin then the lambda-cyhalothrin. The half-lethal concentrations (LC(50)) values were 3.65, 30.6, and 94.89 ppm, respectively. These results revealed that the high potentiation effect was the mixture of abamectin/chlorfenapyr in all the mixing ratios. In contrast, the tested combination of lambda-cyhalothrin/abamectin showed an antagonism effect at all mixing ratios against house fly larvae. The total protein, esterases, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and cytochrome P-450 activity were also measured in the current investigation in the larvae treated with chlorfenapyr. Our results indicate that GST may play a role in detoxifying chlorfenapyr in M. domestica larvae.

Theory indicates that the number of sites needed to accurately reconstruct a fully resolved tree grows at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the length of the shortest edge. However, when inferred trees are partially resolved due to short edges, accuracy should be defined as the rate of discovering false splits (clades on a rooted tree) relative to the actual number found. Thus, accuracy can be high even if short edges are common. Specifically, in a near-perfect parameter space in which trees are large, the tree length  (the sum of all edge lengths), is small, and rate variation is minimal, the expected false positive rate is less than /3; the exact value depends on tree shape and sequence length. This expected false positive rate is far below the false negative rate for small  and often well below 5% even when some assumptions are relaxed. We show this result analytically for maximum parsimony and explore its extension to maximum likelihood using theory and simulations. For hypothesis testing, we show that measures of split support that rely on bootstrap resampling consistently imply weaker support than that implied by the false positive rates in near-perfect trees. The near-perfect parameter space closely fits several empirical studies of human virus diversification during outbreaks and epidemics, including Ebolavirus, Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2, reflecting low substitution rates relative to high transmission/sampling rates in these viruses.","output":"Accuracy in near-perfect virus phylogenies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have utilized MRI to determine the extent to which COVID\\\\19 survivors may experience cardiac sequels after recovery.

Clinical studies suggest that premorbid and early statin use is associated with improved outcome after major stroke. We studied the association between statin therapy and radiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with high-risk TIA and minor stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with high-risk TIA and minor stroke (NIHSS 3) were prospectively enrolled within 24 hours of symptom onset. Patients were followed clinically for 3 months, and a subset had a repeat MR imaging at 90 days. RESULTS Of 418 patients, 23% were prescribed statins before their stroke. Statins were continued in 20% and initiated in 42%. Patients on prior statin therapy were older and more hypertensive, treated with aspirin, and more likely to have symptomatic carotid disease compared with those not on statin. Adjusting for these differences, prior statin treatment was not associated with DWI positivity (adjusted OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 0.77-2.1; P = .32) or smaller median baseline infarct volume, 1.1 mL (interquartile range = 4) versus 1 mL (interquartile range = 2.5; P = .56). Early or continued treatment with statins did not improve the risk of clinical deterioration (adjusted OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.27-1.6; P = .35) or poor functional outcome at 3 months (adjusted OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.35-1.24; P = .19).

We assessed the effects of ANG on markers of organ function. Results: We compared 46 ANGII patients with 53 controls. Compared with controls, ANGII increased MAP (median difference, 9.05 mmHg [95% confidence interval, 1.87 to 16.22];p = 0.013) and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (median difference, 23.17 [95% confidence interval, 3.46 to 42.88];p = 0.021).

Here, we targeted viral pathogens, including carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (genus Protoparvovirus), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), coronaviruses (CoVs), and canine distemper virus (CDV), through molecular screening. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogens were evaluated. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we clarified the phylogenetic relationship of viral pathogens isolated from leopard cats and domestic carnivores. Samples from 23 live-trapped leopard cats and 29 that were found dead were collected from 2015 to 2019 in Miaoli County in northwestern Taiwan. Protoparvoviruses and CoVs were detected in leopard cats, and their prevalence (95% confidence interval) was 63.5% (50.4%C76.6%) and 8.8% (0%C18.4%), respectively. Most of the protoparvovirus sequences amplified from Taiwanese leopard cats and domestic carnivores were identical. All of the CoV sequences amplified from leopard cats were identified as feline CoV. No spatial or temporal aggregation of protoparvovirus infection in leopard cats was found in the sampling area, indicating a wide distribution of protoparvoviruses in the leopard cat habitat. We consider sympatric domestic carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the identified pathogens.

METHODS: This prospective analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) included 7,173 and 8,678 participants [Formula: see text] years of age enrolled in NHANES-III and NHANES 1999C2006, respectively. Associations were evaluated between cadmium and mortality from influenza or pneumonia during a median follow-up of 17.3 y (NHANES-III, based on creatinine-corrected urine cadmium) and 11.4 y (NHANES 1999C2006, based on blood cadmium). Survey-weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) comparing the mortality of individuals at the 80th vs. the 20th percentile of cadmium concentrations. RESULTS: In NHANES-III, after adjustment for sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, serum cholesterol, hypertension, and NHANES phase (or cycle), the HR comparing influenza or pneumonia mortality among participants with creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium in the 80th vs. 20th percentile was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.26; [Formula: see text]) in the population as a whole and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.43; [Formula: see text]) among never smokers.

Currently, most efforts on supporting the uptake of digital mental health tools remain fragmented across organizations and geography. There is a critical need to synthesize these efforts in order to provide a coordinated strategy of supporting the adoption of digital mental health tools. OBJECTIVE: The specific aim of this project is to develop a web-based resource document to support the engagement of mental health providers and patients in the use of digital mental health tools. METHODS: The web-based resource was developed using a multimethod approach. A grey literature review was conducted in 2019 to identify relevant toolkits that are available in the public domain. This was supplemented with an environmental scan where individuals with expertise in the development, acquisition, implementation, and evaluation of digital mental health tools were invited to contribute additional tools or documents not identified in the grey literature search. An engagement workshop was held with stakeholders to explore how the resource document should be developed and delivered. These findings were collectively used to develop the final iteration of the resource document. RESULTS: Based on a gray literature review and environmental scan with 27 experts, 25 resources were identified and included in the resource guide. These resources were developed for patients and providers by organizations from 5 countries. An engagement workshop was held with 14 stakeholders, and barriers related to cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and accessibility of the toolkit were identified. The final iteration of the resource document was developed by the research team using findings from the gray literature review, environmental scan, and engagement workshop. The contents of the 45-page resource guide are directed at mental health care providers, administrators, and patients (inclusive of families and caregivers). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a multimethod approach led to the development of a resource guide that builds on existing evidence on digital mental health tools and was co-designed with stakeholders and end-users. The resource guide is now publicly available online for free and is being promoted through digital health and mental health websites.

First, we conducted differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and obtained 282 DEGs between CUMS (group A) and the control model (group B). Then, we conducted functional and pathway enrichment analyses. In general, the function of upregulated regulated DEGs is related to immune and inflammatory responses. PPI network identified several essential genes, of which ten hub genes were related to the T cell receptor signaling pathway. qRT-PCR results verified the regulatory network of mRNA.

These lysosomal hydrolases degrade proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids into their constituents. Materials to be degraded can reach lysosomes either from inside the cell, by autophagy, or from outside the cell, by different forms of endocytosis. In addition to their degradative functions, lysosomes are also able to extracellularly release their contents by lysosomal exocytosis. These organelles move from the perinuclear region along microtubules towards the proximity of the plasma membrane, then the lysosomal and plasma membrane fuse together via a Ca(2+)-dependent process. The fusion of the lysosomal membrane with plasma membrane plays an important role in plasma membrane repair, while the secretion of lysosomal content is relevant for the remodelling of extracellular matrix and release of functional substrates. Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases, share as a pathological feature the accumulation of undigested material within organelles of the endolysosomal system. Recent studies suggest that lysosomal exocytosis stimulation may have beneficial effects on the accumulation of these unprocessed aggregates, leading to their extracellular elimination.

Given the recognised association of neutrophil activation with SLE pathogenesis, we examined whether there is increased neutrophil activation and inflammation in blood and placenta in SLE relative to healthy pregnancy. METHODS: At delivery, peripheral blood, maternal-derived intervillous blood and placentas were collected from 12 SLE and 10 healthy control pregnancies. The proportion of low-density granulocytes (LDGs) and the activation status of LDG and normal-density granulocytes were examined with flow cytometry. The chemokines CXCL8 and CXCL1 were quantified with a cytometric bead-based assay and interferon alpha (IFN) protein levels with a Simoa method. IFN-stimulated maternal-derived decidual stromal cells were examined for CXCL8 gene expression with qPCR. A pathologist, blinded to the patient background, examined all placentas. RESULTS: Women with SLE had significantly higher proportions of LDG in peripheral blood compared with controls (p=0.02), and LDG in both peripheral and intervillous blood were more activated in SLE relative to healthy pregnancies (peripheral blood: p=0.002 and intervillous blood: p=0.05). There were higher levels of CXCL8 and CXCL1 in intervillous compared with peripheral blood in women with SLE (p=0.004 and p=<0.0001, respectively) but not in controls. In SLE pregnancy, IFN was detectable in 6 out of 10 intervillous blood samples but only in one control. Stimulation with IFN upregulated CXCL8 gene expression in decidual stromal cells from both SLE and healthy pregnancy.

Vigorous, well-designed studies with complete, long-term follow-up of high risk groups including COVID-19 patients, their families and frontline workers are imperative for a comprehensive understanding of the mental health impact of the pandemic. The Nordic-Baltic national registries and biobank resources provide a unique opportunity to gain critical insight into the interplay between mental and somatic health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVIDMENT consortium leverages an extensive research experience and infrastructure from ongoing collaborations between four Nordic countries and Estonia, including national registry resources (est. >24 million individuals) and new COVID-19 cohorts with questionnaire data (est. > 220.000 individuals), to significantly advance current knowledge of mental morbidity trajectories in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Diabetes and hypertension are among top public health priorities, particularly in low and middle-income countries where their health and socioeconomic impact is exacerbated by the quality and accessibility of health care. Moreover, their connection with severe or deadly COVID-19 illness has further increased their societal relevance. Tools for early detection of these chronic diseases enable interventions to prevent high-impact complications, such as loss of sight and kidney failure. Similarly, prognostic tools for COVID-19 help stratify the population to prioritize protection and vaccination of high-risk groups, optimize medical resources and tests, and raise public awareness. METHODS. We developed and validated state-of-the-art risk models for the presence of undiagnosed diabetes, hypertension, visual complications associated with diabetes and hypertension, and the risk of severe COVID-19 illness (if infected). The models were estimated using modern methods from the field of statistical learning (e.g., gradient boosting trees), and were trained on publicly available data containing health and socioeconomic information representative of the Mexican population. Lastly, we assembled a short integrated questionnaire and deployed a free online tool for massifying access to risk assessment. RESULTS. Our results show substantial improvements in accuracy and algorithmic equity (balance of accuracy across population subgroups), compared to established benchmarks. In particular, the models: i) reached state-of-the-art sensitivity and specificity rates of 90% and 56% (0.83 AUC) for diabetes, 80% and 64% (0.79 AUC) for hypertension, 90% and 56% (0.84 AUC) for visual diminution as a complication, and 90% and 60% (0.84 AUC) for development of severe COVID disease; and ii) achieved substantially higher equity in sensitivity across gender, indigenous/non-indigenous, and regional populations. In addition, the most relevant features used by the models were in line with risk factors commonly identified by previous studies. Finally, the online platform was deployed and made accessible to the public on a massive scale. CONCLUSIONS. The use of large databases representative of the Mexican population, coupled with modern statistical learning methods, allowed the development of risk models with state-of-the-art accuracy and equity for two of the most relevant chronic diseases, their eye complications, and COVID-19 severity. These tools can have a meaningful impact on democratizing early detection, enabling large-scale preventive strategies in low-resource health systems, increasing public awareness, and ultimately raising social well-being.","output":"State-of-the-Art Risk Models for Diabetes, Hypertension, Visual Diminution, and COVID-19 Severity in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has put immense pressure on health systems which are further strained due to the misinformation surrounding it.

This was true even though strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control the progression of the epidemic were being enforced. Using a semi-parametric Bayesian model developed for the purpose of this study, we explore if and how the changes in mobility, their timing and the activation of contact tracing can explain the differences in the epidemic progression of the two waves. To fit the model, we use data on daily numbers of deaths, patients in hospitals, intensive care units, etc., and allow transmission intensity to be affected by contact tracing and mobility (data obtained from Google Mobility Reports). Our results imply that though there is some heterogeneity not explained by mobility levels and contact tracing, implementing interventions at a similar stage as in the first wave would keep the death toll and the health system burden low in the second wave as well. On the other hand, sticking to the same timeline of interventions as observed in the second wave and focusing on enforcing a higher decrease in mobility would not be as beneficial. According to our model, the dance strategy, i.e., first allowing the numbers to rise and then implementing strict interventions to make them drop again, has been played at too-late stages of the epidemic. In contrast, a 15C20% reduction of mobility compared to pre-COVID level, if started at the beginning and maintained for the entire duration of the second wave and coupled with contact tracing, could suffice to control the epidemic. A very important factor in this result is the presence of contact tracing; without it, the reduction in mobility needs to be substantially larger. The flexibility of our proposed model allows similar analyses to be conducted for other regions even with slightly different data sources for the progression of the epidemic; the extension to more than two waves is straightforward. The model could help policymakers worldwide to make better decisions in terms of the timing and severity of the adopted NPIs.","output":"COVID-19 in Slovenia, from a Success Story to Disaster: What Lessons Can Be Learned?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the disease or are carriers and have no symptoms.

Therefore, the use of virtual reality (VR)-simulation could be a helpful tool for imparting surgical skills, especially in minimally invasive environments. Visual spatial ability (VSA) might influence the learning curve for laparoscopic surgical skills. However, little is known about the influence of VSA for surgical novices on VR-simulator training regarding the complexity of different tasks over a long-term training period. Our study evaluated prior VSA and VSA development in surgical trainees during VR-simulator training, and its influence on surgical performance in simulator training. METHODS: In our single-center prospective two-arm randomized trial, VSA was measured with a tube figure test before curriculum training. After 1:1 randomization, the training group (TG) participated in the entire curriculum training consisting of 48 different VR-simulator tasks with varying difficulty over a continuous nine-day training session. The control group (CG) performed two of these tasks on day 1 and 9. Correlation and regression analyses were used to assess the influence of VSA on VR-related surgical skills and to measure procedural abilities. RESULTS: Sixty students (33 women) were included. Significant improvements in the TG in surgical performance and faster completion times were observed from days 1 to 9 for the scope orientation 30 right-handed (SOR), and cholecystectomy dissection tasks after the structured 9-day training program. After training, the TG with pre-existing low VSA scores achieved performance levels similar to those with pre-existing high VSA scores for the two VR simulator tasks. Significant correlations between VSA and surgical performance on complex laparoscopic camera navigation SOR tasks were found before training. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that that all trainees improved their surgical skills irrespective of previous VSA during structured VR simulator training. An increase in VSA resulted in improvements in surgical performance and training progress, which was more distinct in complex simulator tasks. Further, we demonstrated a positive relationship between VSA and surgical performance of the TG, especially at the beginning of training. Our results identified pre-existing levels of VSA as a predictor of surgical performance.","output":"The role of virtual reality simulation in surgical training in the light of COVID-19 pandemic: Visual spatial ability as a predictor for improved surgical performance: a randomized trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic viral disease affecting also obstetric patients and uncertainties exist about the prognostic role of inflammatory biomarkers and hemocytometry values in patients with this infection.

Overall, among 62 (27.3%) pregnant women and 165 (72.7%) postpartum women, 21 (9.2%) patients received oxygen supplementation and 2 (0.9%) required admission to intensive care unit but none died.

Lymphocyte values at admission were correlated with oxygen need, with a 26% higher risk of oxygen supplementation for each 1000 cells decreases. Overall, in obstetric patients hospitalized with COVID-19, C reactive protein is the inflammatory biomarker that better mirrors the course of the disease whereas D-dimer or ferritin are not reliable predictors of poor outcome.

In England, the three main models documented over the past fifty years (teams offering crisis assessment and treatment at home; acute day services; and residential crisis services in the community) have recently been augmented by several new service models. These are intended to enhance choice and flexibility within catchment area acute care systems, but remain largely undocumented in the research literature. We therefore aimed to describe the types and distribution of crisis care models across England through a national survey. Methods: We carried out comprehensive mapping of crisis resolution teams (CRTs) using previous surveys, websites and multiple official data sources. Managers of CRTs were invited to participate as key informants who were familiar with the provision and organisation of crisis care services within their catchment area. The survey could be completed online or via telephone interview with a researcher, and elicited details about types of crisis care delivered in the local catchment area. Results: We mapped a total of 200 adult CRTs and completed the survey with 184 (92%). Of the 200 mapped adult CRTs, there was a local (i.e., within the adult CRT catchment area) children and young persons CRT for 84 (42%), and an older adults CRT for 73 (37%). While all but one health region in England provided CRTs for working age adults, there was high variability regarding provision of all other community crisis service models and system configurations. Crisis cafes, street triage teams and separate crisis assessment services have all proliferated since a similar survey in 2016, while provision of acute day units has reduced. Conclusions: The composition of catchment area crisis systems varies greatly across England and popularity of models seems unrelated to strength of evidence.

Whilst lifestyle interventions in pregnancy and postpartum reduce this risk, a research translation gap remains around delivering implementable interventions with adequate population penetration and participation. Impact Diabetes Bump2Baby is an implementation project of an evidence-based system of care for the prevention of overweight and obesity. Bump2Baby and Me is the multicentre randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of a mHealth coaching programme in pregnancy and postpartum for women at high risk of developing GDM. METHODS: Eight hundred women will be recruited in early pregnancy from 4 clinical sites within Ireland, the UK, Spain, and Australia. Women will be screened for eligibility using the validated Monash GDM screening tool. Participants will be enrolled from 12 to 24 weeks gestation and randomised on a 1:1 basis into the intervention or control arm. Alongside usual care, the intervention involves mHealth coaching via a smartphone application, which uses a combination of synchronous and asynchronous video and text messaging, and allows for personalised support and goal setting with a trained health coach. The control arm receives usual care. All women and their children will be followed from early pregnancy until 12 months postpartum. The primary outcome will be a difference in maternal body mass index (BMI) of 0.8 kg/m(2) at 12 months postpartum. Secondary maternal and infant outcomes include the development of GDM, gestational weight gain, pregnancy outcomes, improvements in diet, physical activity, sleep, and neonatal weight and infant growth patterns. The 5-year project is funded by the EU Commission Horizon 2020 and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. Ethical approval has been received. DISCUSSION: Previous interventions have not moved beyond tightly controlled efficacy trials into routine service delivery. This project aims to provide evidence-based, sustainable support that could be incorporated into usual care for women during pregnancy and postpartum. This study will contribute evidence to inform the early prevention of non-communicable diseases like obesity and diabetes in mothers and the next generation.

Progressive cellular accumulation of the AGAL substrate globotriaosylceramide (Gb(3)) leads to endothelial dysfunction. Here, we analyzed endothelial function in vivo and in vitro in an AGAL-deficient genetic background to identify the processes underlying this small vessel disease. Arterial stiffness and endothelial function was prospectively measured in five males carrying GLA variants (control) and 22 FD patients under therapy. AGAL-deficient endothelial cells (EA.hy926) and monocytes (THP1) were used to analyze endothelial glycocalyx structure, function, and underlying inflammatory signals. Glycocalyx thickness and small vessel function improved significantly over time (p<0.05) in patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT, n=16) and chaperones (n=6). AGAL-deficient endothelial cells showed reduced glycocalyx and increased monocyte adhesion (p<0.05). In addition, increased expression of angiopoietin-2, heparanase and NF-B was detected (all p<0.05). Incubation of wild-type endothelial cells with pathological globotriaosylsphingosine concentrations resulted in comparable findings. Treatment of AGAL-deficient cells with recombinant AGAL (p<0.01), heparin (p<0.01), anti-inflammatory (p<0.001) and antioxidant drugs (p<0.05), and a specific inhibitor (razuprotafib) of angiopoietin-1 receptor (Tie2) (p<0.05) improved glycocalyx structure and endothelial function in vitro.

Knowing which variables are involved in anxiety and depressive symptoms could help to prevent young people's psychological problems related to lockdown as early as possible. This cross-sectional study aims to examine anxiety and depressive symptomatology in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese children and adolescents in order to determine which variables are related to poorer well-being during the pandemic. METHOD The parents of 515 children, aged 3-18 years old, completed an online survey. Children's anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale-Parent Version, and depressive symptoms were measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire-Parent Version. RESULTS We found differences in anxiety and depression between countries, with higher anxiety scores in Spanish children, and higher depression scores in Spanish and Italian children compared to the Portuguese. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were more likely in children whose parents reported higher levels of stress.

Here, we report high-throughput identification of genes regulating B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated antigen internalization using genome-wide functional screens. We show that antigen internalization depends both on constitutive, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and on antigen-induced, clathrin-independent endocytosis mediated by endophilin A2. Although endophilin A2-mediated endocytosis is dispensable for antigen presentation, it is selectively required for metabolic support of B-cell proliferation, in part through regulation of iron uptake. Consequently, endophilin A2-deficient mice show defects in GC B-cell responses and production of high-affinity IgG. The requirement for endophilin A2 highlights a unique importance of clathrin-independent intracellular trafficking in GC B-cell clonal expansion and antibody responses.","output":"Endophilin A2 regulates B-cell endocytosis and is required for germinal center and humoral responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 swept across the globe, disrupting people's lives through lockdowns and health concerns, information about how to stay safe and how to identify symptoms spread across media of all forms.

The national COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa resulted in increased levels of poverty and food insecurity. We aimed to explore the relationship between CMDs, food insecurity and experiences of violence among pregnant women during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: Perinatal women, attending 14 healthcare facilities in Cape Town, were enrolled in the study during baseline data collection before the COVID-19 lockdown. During the lockdown period, fieldworkers telephonically contacted the perinatal women who were enrolled in the study and had provided contact details. The following data was collected from those who consented to the study: socio-demographic information, mental health assessment, food insecurity status and experiences of abuse. Poisson regression was used to model the associations of a number of risk factors with the occurrence of CMDs. Results: Of the 2149 women enrolled in the ASSET study, 885 consented to the telephonic interviews. We found that 12.5% of women had probable CMDs and 43% were severely food insecure. Psychological distress increased significantly during the lockdown period, compared to before the COVID-19 outbreak. The strength of the association between key risk factors measured during the lockdown and psychological distress increased during the COVID-19 lockdown. Using multivariate Poisson regression modelling, we showed that the risk of CMDs was almost three times more likely in women who were severely food insecure or who experienced psychological or sexual abuse. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health status of perinatal women living in low resource settings in Cape Town, and highlights how a crisis such as the COVID-19 lockdown amplifies the psycho-social risk factors associated with CMDs in perinatal women.","output":"Domestic violence, food insecurity and mental health of pregnant women in the COVID-19 lockdown in Cape Town, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We described the demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities, and outcomes of patients with a history of cancer and COVID-19. Secondly, we compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients hospitalized with influenza. METHODS We conducted a cohort study using eight routinely-collected healthcare databases from Spain and the US, standardized to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data model. Three cohorts of patients with a history of cancer were included: i) diagnosed with COVID-19, ii) hospitalized with COVID-19, and iii) hospitalized with influenza in 2017-2018. Patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We reported demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities, and 30-day outcomes. RESULTS We included 366,050 and 119,597 patients diagnosed and hospitalized with COVID-19, respectively. Prostate and breast cancers were the most frequent cancers (range: 5-19% and 1-14% in the diagnosed cohort, respectively). Hematological malignancies were also frequent, with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma being among the 5 most common cancer subtypes in the diagnosed cohort. Overall, patients were aged above 65 years and had multiple comorbidities. Occurrence of death ranged from 2% to 14% and from 6% to 26% in the diagnosed and hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts, respectively. Patients hospitalized with influenza (n=67,743) had a similar distribution of cancer subtypes, sex, age and comorbidities but lower occurrence of adverse events.

Five trials on heterogenous populations seem to not demonstrate tocilizumab efficacy, but showed encouraging results in subgroup analysis on severe/critical patients (in favour for tocilizumab). Trials on severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia as REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY showed mortality benefit of tocilizumab administration; CORIMUNO, REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY showed that tocilizumab decreased the incidence of mechanical ventilation. No safety signal about tocilizumab used was noticed in all trials. We concluded that tocilizumab reduces mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement if administered with the right timing in COVID-19 pneumonia. The challenge now is to define the optimal group and timing for tocilizumab benefit and we suggest that: (i) tocilizumab has a place in treatment of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia, with a high level of O2 flow or noninvasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula; (ii) possibly early after intubation in patients on mechanical ventilation. Initiating tocilizumab in critically ill patients early before irreversible respiratory failure, especially in patients at an inflammatory stage could be the key to successful outcome.","output":"Tocilizumab in COVID-19 pneumonia: Practical proposals based on a narrative review of randomised trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cover legend: Kelley et al.

Each medication in this combination has been associated with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Here we report the case of a 56-year-old woman treated for chronic pain with buprenorphine-naloxone, and a history of multiple hospitalizations for pulmonary edema. Her buprenorphine-naloxone was held on admission and her symptoms improved gradually with supportive care. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old woman with past history significant for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic pain treated with buprenorphine-naloxone presented to the emergency department via ambulance for altered mental status and worsening dyspnea for 3 days. Upon arrival to the ED she was tachypneic with a SpO2 of 50% on room air and required non-invasive ventilation. Physical exam revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally and no peripheral edema. Laboratory data was significant for an elevated D-dimer and BNP. Covid-19 screening was negative. Chest x-ray showed diffuse hazy opacities. CTA chest was negative for pulmonary embolism, but did show extensive parenchymal opacities and diffuse ground glass densities bilaterally. Steroids and antibiotics were initiated, and buprenorphine-naloxone was discontinued.She described several similar prior hospitalizations, but denied ever receiving a diagnosis. Echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction and grade II diastolic dysfunction. Infectious and vasculitis etiologies were ruled out. The patient declined bronchoscopy. Records from prior hospitalizations revealed non-diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage and wedge biopsies. Environmental exposure was ruled out via a peer reviewed questionnaire and negative allergen testing. With no clear etiology, the patient's hypoxia improved. We propose that the patient's presentation was secondary to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema induced by buprenorphine-naloxone. DISCUSSION: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is an acute process resulting in hypoxia secondary to an increase in capillary permeability. Major causes include ARDS, pulmonary embolism, TRALI, and opioid overdose, but many other etiologies have been implicated. Buprenorphine, like other opioids, is a known cause of pulmonary edema (1). Naloxone induced pulmonary edema, while rare, has also been described (2). A review of the literature was not able to find buprenorphine-naloxone combination as a cause of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. We believe this patient's pulmonary edema may have been secondary to this medication's opioid effects, naloxone effects, or possibly an allergic reaction. Given the wide use of this medication physicians should be made aware of this possible complication. CONCLUSIONS: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is a potential complication of buprenorphine-naloxone. REFERENCE #1: Thammakumpee G, Sumpatanukule P.

Identifying key predictors of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality among infected cases would help in identifying individuals at risk to optimize their care. We aimed to determine factors of poor outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a large academic hospital in Riyadh, KSA that serves as a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) referral center. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients between March 15 and August 31, 2020. The study was conducted at King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC). COVID-19 infection was confirmed using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-COV-2. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory, radiological features, and length of hospital stay were obtained. Poor outcomes were, admission to ICU, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Out of 16,947 individuals tested in KSUMC, 3480 (20.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and of those 743 patients (21%) were hospitalized. There were 62% males, 77% were younger than 65 years. Of all cases, 204 patients (28%) required ICU admission, 104 (14%) required IMV, and 117 (16%) died in hospital. In bivariate analysis, multiple factors were associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. Further multivariate analysis revealed the following factors were associated with mortality: respiratory rate more than 24/min and systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg in the first 24 h of presentation, lymphocyte count <1  10(9)/L and aspartate transaminase level >37 units/L in the first 48 h of presentation, while a RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value 24 was a predictor for IMV. CONCLUSION: Variable factors were identified as predictors of different outcomes among COVID-19 patients. The only predictor of IMV was a low initial Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 PCR. The presence of tachypnea, hypotension, lymphopenia, and elevated AST in the first 48 h of presentation were independently associated with mortality. This study provides possible independent predictors of mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation.

In this virus-cell interaction study, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection or viral spike protein expression alone inhibited angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor protein expression. The spike protein promoted an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) mediated signaling cascade, induced the transcriptional regulatory molecules NF-B and AP-1/c-Fos via MAPK activation, and increased IL-6 release. SARS-CoV-2 infected patient sera contained elevated levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R. Up-regulated AT1 receptor signaling also influenced the release of extracellular soluble IL-6R by the induction of the ADAM-17 protease. Use of the AT1 receptor antagonist, Candesartan cilexetil, resulted in down-regulation of IL-6/soluble IL-6R release in spike expressing cells. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr705 residue plays an important role as a transcriptional inducer for SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression.

From the time of the first cases (in November 2019, Wuhan, China), to date, a large number of COVID-19 observations have been accumulated in different age groups of patients both in China and abroad. Published scientific data allows us to conclude that children suffer from COVID-19 much less often than adults and tolerate the disease in a milder form, often appear to be asymptomatic. There is currently no final answer why children are less susceptible to this virus;however, scientists are increasingly inclined to consider a complex effect of the immune response and components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which according to recent studies affects not only the cardiovascular system, but is also responsible for the activation of inflammatory reactions. A hypothesis of genetic predisposition to the development of severe forms of COVID-19 has recently been made. We conducted a search for publications in the databases and showed current scientific ideas about COVID-19 pathogenesis and factors influencing the disease development in childhood. Childhood immunity may have several protective features against SARS-CoV-2: immaturity of particular elements of the innate immune response, constitutional lymphocytosis with a shift towards anti-inflammatory Th2-response, as well as \\"trained\\" immunity. The influence of renin-angiotensin system reactions in this review is shown from two perspectives: expression of ACE2 receptors and polymorphisms of certain genes of this system. It was established that ACE2 transmembrane protein is not only the entry point for the virus but also plays a regulatory role, turning the pro-inflammatory vasoconstrictor angiotensin II into anti-inflammatory angiotensin (1-7), which has vasodilating properties. Higher ACE2 content in children compared with adults helps maintain balance in the renin-angiotensin system and prevents the development of complications. It was also shown that the presence of certain genetic polymorphisms (AGTR1, AGTR2, ACE2, ACE) could determine the imbalance inside the RAS, leading to more pronounced reactions of alveolocytes, vascular endothelium and smooth muscle fibers in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to a shift towards vasoconstrictor, proliferative and profibrotic mechanisms.","output":"Why Children Are Less Affected by COVID-19 Than Adults: Potential Immunological Factors and the Renin-Angiotensin System Associated Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Schools, depending on their access to and quality of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and the implementation of healthy behaviours, can be critical for the control and spread of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Schools provide opportunities for pupils to learn about the importance of hygiene and WASH-related practice, and build healthy habits and skills, with beneficial medium- and long-term consequences particularly in low- and middle-income countries: reducing pupils' absenteeism due to diseases, promoting physical, mental and social health, and improving learning outcomes. WASH services alone are often not sufficient and need to be combined with educational programmes. As pupils disseminate their acquired health-promoting knowledge to their (extended) families, improved WASH provisions and education in schools have beneficial effects also on the community. International organisations frequently roll out interventions in schools to improve WASH services and, in some cases, train pupils and teachers on safe WASH behaviours. How such interventions relate to local school education on WASH, health promotion and disease prevention knowledge, whether and how such knowledge and school books are integrated into WASH education interventions in schools, are knowledge gaps we fill. METHODS: We analyzed how Kenyan primary school science text book content supports WASH and health education by a book review including books used from class 1 through class 8, covering the age range from 6 to 13 years. We then conducted a rapid literature review of combined WASH interventions that included a behaviour change or educational component, and a rapid review of international policy guidance documents to contextualise the results and understand the relevance of books and school education for WASH interventions implemented by international organisations. We conducted a content analysis based on five identified thematic categories, including drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, environmental hygiene & health promotion and disease risks, and mapped over time the knowledge about WASH and disease prevention. RESULTS: The books comprehensively address drinking water issues, including sources, quality, treatment, safe storage and water conservation; risks and transmission pathways of various waterborne (Cholera, Typhoid fever), water-based (Bilharzia), vector-related (Malaria) and other communicable diseases (Tuberculosis); and the importance of environmental hygiene and health promotion. The content is broadly in line with internationally recommended WASH topics and learning objectives. Gaps remain on personal hygiene and handwashing, including menstrual hygiene, sanitation education, and related health risks and disease exposures. The depth of content varies greatly over time and across the different classes. Such locally available education materials already used in schools were considered by none of the WASH education interventions in the considered intervention studies. CONCLUSIONS: The thematic gaps/under-representations in books that we identified, namely sanitation, hygiene and menstrual hygiene education, are all high on the international WASH agenda, and need to be filled especially now, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Disconnects exist between school book knowledge and WASH education interventions, between policy and implementation, and between theory and practice, revealing missed opportunities for effective and sustainable behaviour change, and underlining the need for better integration. Considering existing local educational materials and knowledge may facilitate the buy-in and involvement of teachers and school managers in strengthening education and implementing improvements. We suggest opportunities for future research, behaviour change interventions and decision-making to improve WASH in schools.","output":"Kenyan school book knowledge for water, sanitation, hygiene and health education interventions: Disconnect, integration or opportunities?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyses the evolution of COVID-19 and early government responses to the pandemic in eight South American countries. To this aim, this study explores indicators which trace the progression of the pandemic and analyses factors related of state capacity which impacted on the early response of governments of implementing restrictive policies of social distancing associated with a suppression strategy. The pressure on the health systems is evaluated with early projections of the growth-phase of the epidemic, which is incorporated as an indicator in the analysis of early interventions based on Cox proportional hazards models. The results indicate that fiscal expenditure on health, regional and local government capacity, and pressure on the health system accelerate government response with stringent interventions. A counter-intuitive finding is that the economic strength of a country delays these types of reactions. The effect of these interventions is something that should be studied in greater depth, considering, for example, sociocultural factors. Lastly, only cases such as Uruguay and Paraguay show some signs of having the pandemic relatively under control by mid-May, while Brazil and Peru face very adverse scenarios. In this context, considering the characteristics of the states in the region and the level of informal employment, it will be a public policy challenge to keep the equilibrium between restrictive measures and the economic and social problems which these responses imply in the medium term.","output":"Evolution and early government responses to COVID-19 in South America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Three Seas Initiative (TSI) is a new Polish-Croatian initiative of regional cooperation in Central Europe, launched in 2016.

We aimed to see the kidney damages of indoor heat-exposed workers and whether urine specific gravity can predict any kidney damages. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: A shoe-making factory in West Java, Indonesia. PARTICIPANTS: 119 subjects were included. Minimum total sample size was 62. Subjects were indoor heat-exposed workers who were exposed to occupational wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) of 28CC30C for 8 hours daily with 1 hour break, 5 days a week. The inclusion criterion was healthy subjects according to the result from annual medical check-up in 2019. The exclusion criteria were subjects who were taking vitamins and/or supplements that might cause disturbance in urine specific gravity and/or hydration status, pregnant and fasting. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of urine specific gravity for the detection of urinary nephrin and urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) were analysed. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and quantitative albuminuria were also measured. RESULTS: WBGT in the work area of the subject was 28CC30C. There were 15 (12.6%) subjects who had eGFR <90 mL/min, but 60 mL/min. High serum vasopressin levels were found in 79 subjects with a mean of 6.54 (95% CI 5.94 to 7.14) ng/mL. Most subjects had nephrinuria (87.4%) with preserved renal function (87.4%). Several subjects had elevated urinary KIM-1 (10.9%) and albuminuria (7.6%). AUC of urine specific gravity for increased urinary nephrin was 81.7% (95% CI 68.8% to 94.6%) and statistically significant (p<0.001). Cut-off value of 1.018 for urine specific gravity has sensitivity of 71.2% and specificity of 80% for detecting elevation of urinary nephrin levels. CONCLUSION: Urine specific gravity with a cut-off value of 1.018 could be used to detect nephrinuria among heat-exposed workers.","output":"Diagnostic role of urine specific gravity to detect kidney impairment on heat-exposed workers in a shoe factory in Indonesia: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior research and the popular press have anecdotally reported inadequate nursing home staffing levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Maintaining adequate staffing levels is critical to ensuring high-quality nursing home care and an effective response to the pandemic. We therefore sought to examine nursing home staffing levels during the first nine months of 2020 (compared with the same period in 2019), using auditable daily payroll-based staffing data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We found that the total number of hours of direct care nursing declined in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did the average nursing home census. When we accounted for changes in census, the number of nurse staff hours per resident day remained steady or, if anything, increased slightly during the pandemic. The observed increases in staff hours per resident day were small but concentrated in nursing homes operating in counties with high COVID-19 prevalence, in nursing homes with low Medicaid census (which typically have more financial resources), and in not-for-profit nursing homes (which typically invest more in staffing). These findings raise concerns that although the number of staff hours in nursing homes did not decline, the perception of shortages has been driven by increased stresses and demands on staff time due to the pandemic, which are harder to quantify.","output":"Nursing Home Staffing Levels Did Not Change Significantly During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cutaneous injury and irritation among health care workers has substantially risen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

These viruses depend on cathepsin L for entry into their target cells. The viral glycoproteins need to be primed by protease cleavage, rendering them active for fusion with the host cell membrane. In this study, we developed a novel high-throughput screening assay based on peptides, derived from the glycoproteins of the aforementioned viruses, which contain the cathepsin L cleavage site. We screened a library of 5,000 small molecules and discovered a small molecule that can inhibit the cathepsin L cleavage of all viral peptides with minimal inhibition of cleavage of a host protein-derived peptide (pro-neuropeptide Y). The small molecule inhibited the entry of all pseudotyped viruses in vitro and the cleavage of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein in an in vitro cleavage assay. In addition, the Hendra and Nipah virus fusion glycoproteins were not cleaved in the presence of the small molecule in a cell-based cleavage assay. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the small molecule is a mixed inhibitor of cathepsin L. Our broad-spectrum antiviral small molecule appears to be an ideal candidate for future optimization and development into a potent antiviral against SARS-CoV and Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses. IMPORTANCE We developed a novel high-throughput screening assay to identify small molecules that can prevent cathepsin L cleavage of viral glycoproteins derived from SARS-CoV and Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses that are required for their entry into the host cell. We identified a novel broad-spectrum small molecule that could block cathepsin L-mediated cleavage and thus inhibit the entry of pseudotypes bearing the glycoprotein derived from SARS-CoV or Ebola, Hendra, or Nipah virus.

The licensed physician population has grown in number relative to the total population, but concerns about a doctor shortage remain as both the general and physician populations age. Late career physicians generally work fewer hours and retire at higher rates, as younger physicians place more emphasis on work-life balance that may also limit work hours, even as many older physicians have delayed retirement in recent years. The mean age of licensed physicians is now 51.7 years, a year higher than it was in 2010. The physician workforce is increasingly mixed in gender and type of physician, with more women and more individuals with Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degrees, specialty board certification and international medical degrees than a decade ago. The ability to inventory a nation's health care workforce across all specialties and jurisdictions is essential to the delivery of quality health care where it is needed most. This paper marks the FSMB's sixth biennial census of licensed physicians in the United States and the District of Columbia and provides valuable information about the nation's available physician workforce, including information about medical degree type, location of undergraduate medical education, specialty certification, number of active licenses, age and sex.

We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 min, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting. METHODS: This prospective service improvement project piloted an RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents of a high dependency care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of a single swab using RT-LAMP compared with the current standard, RT-PCR, as per Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) guidelines. RESULTS: The novel method accurately detected 8/10 RT-PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a \\"gold standard\\", the sensitivity and specificity of a single novel test were 80 and 73% respectively. PPV was 73% and NPV was 83%. Incorporating retesting of low signal RT-LAMP positives improved the specificity to 100%. We also speculate that hypothermia may be a significant early clinical sign of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: RT-LAMP testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, fast and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods. RT-LAMP has the potential to transform COVID-19 detection, bringing rapid and accurate testing to the PoC.

The current study aims at investigating the load of one such viral pathogen on the surfaces of commonly used materials. METHODS: Based on the cycle threshold (Ct) values in the diagnostic system using gene amplification for the considered viral pathogen, we categorized the positive samples for high (17 to < 24), moderate (24 to < 31), or mild (31 to < 38) viral load. Five randomly selected samples from each of these category were smeared on commonly used cardboard surface (absorbent surface) and stainless steel (non-absorbent surface). After an observation duration of 90 min, samples from the surfaces were analyzed again for gene amplification using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Viral load/titter positively correlated with the viral material on either of these investigated surfaces post-observation duration. Higher viral load (low Ct) samples exhibited higher probability of being detected on the surfaces than those samples with lower/moderate (high Ct) viral load.

A Transfer Learning (TL) method, based on different Deep Convolutional Neural Networks architectures, for Vascular Biometric Recognition (VBR), has been designed and tested, for the first time in a research approach, on a smartphone. TL is a Deep Learning (DL) technique that could be divided into networks as feature extractor, i.e., using a pre-trained (different large-scale dataset) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to obtain unique features that then, are classified with a traditional Machine Learning algorithm, and fine-tuning, i.e., training a CNN that has been initialized with weights of a pre-trained (different large-scale dataset) CNN.

Statistical analyses evaluated patterns in self-reported adoption of mitigation strategies against COVID-19 in the participants' facilities/operations and perceived needs of the industry regarding COVID-19. Responses to open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic analysis. In total 145 responses were received, of which 79 were usable, including 38 (48%) from the dairy, 17 (22%) from the fresh produce, and 24 (30%) from a mixture of other food industry sectors. Only two usable responses were from the beef/pork sector and none from the poultry sector. Findings revealed that several social distancing, biosecurity, and surveillance mitigation strategies against COVID-19 are commonly implemented in the participants' facilities/operations, but their implementation frequency differs by the facility/operation size and industry sector.

The present study, conducted in four high-income countries during the first global wave of COVID-19, examined the association between COVID-19 and: (1) thoughts about quitting smoking; (2) changes in smoking (quit attempt, reduced or increased smoking, or no change); and (3) factors related to a positive change (making a quit attempt or reducing smoking) based on an adapted framework of the Health Belief Model. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 6870 adult smokers participating in the Wave 3 (2020) ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey conducted in Australia, Canada, England, and United States (US). These four countries had varying responses to the pandemic by governments and public health, ranging from advising voluntary social distancing to implementing national and subnational staged lockdowns. Considering these varying responses, and the differences in the number of confirmed cases and deaths (greatest in England and the US and lowest in Australia), smoking behaviours related to COVID-19 may have differed between countries. Other factors that may be related to changes in smoking because of COVID-19 were also explored (e.g., sociodemographics, nicotine dependence, perceptions about personal and general risks of smoking on COVID-19). Regression analyses were conducted on weighted data. RESULTS: Overall, 46.7% of smokers reported thinking about quitting because of COVID-19, which differed by country (p<0.001): England highest (50.9%) and Australia lowest (37.6%). Thinking about quitting smoking because of COVID-19 was more frequent among: females, ethnic minorities, those with financial stress, current vapers, less dependent smokers (non-daily and fewer cigarettes smoked/day), those with greater concern about personal susceptibility of infection, and those who believe COVID-19 is more severe for smokers. Smoking behaviour changes due to COVID-19 were: 1.1% attempted to quit, 14.2% reduced smoking, and 14.6% increased smoking (70.2% reported no change). Positive behaviour change (tried to quit/reduced smoking) was reported by 15.5% of smokers, which differed by country (p = 0.02), where Australia had significantly lower rates than the other three countries. A positive behavioural smoking change was more likely among smokers with: lower dependence, greater concern about personal susceptibility to infection, and believing that COVID-19 is more severe for smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Though nearly half of smokers reported thinking about quitting because of COVID-19, the vast majority did not change their smoking behaviour. Smokers were more likely to try and quit or reduce their smoking if they had greater concern about susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 related to smoking. Smokers in Australia were least likely to reduce or try to quit smoking, which could be related to the significantly lower impact of COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic relative to the other countries.","output":"Smokers' cognitive and behavioural reactions during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from the 2020 ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Frequency of consuming foods prepared away from home has been associated with lower diet quality among adults and adolescents in several earlier studies.

There are sparse data regarding the prognostic value of serum calprotectin in COVID-19 patients. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum calprotectin level and clinical severity of COVID-19 disease in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional cohort study included 80 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The study population was divided into two groups as patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and patients hospitalized but not in the ICU. The serum calprotectin levels, other laboratory, and clinical parameters were compared between groups. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 66.5  15.7 years. Of the patients, 42 were in the ICU and 38 were not. Serum calprotectin level and acute-phase reactants such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, fibrinogen, and white blood cell were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients. ROC curve analysis identified that serum calprotectin level was a predictor for ICU requirement with an area under the curve of 0.641 (p = 0.031). Logistic regression analysis revealed that serum calprotectin was a significant determinant for whether or not patient required the ICU.

It is crucial to monitor their adverse events post vaccination. The present study focuses on cardiovascular adverse events post-COVID-19 vaccination and aims to determine adverse events with the administered vaccine. METHODOLOGY: The cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events were extracted for three broad headings (SOCs) C cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, and investigations. Descriptive statistics were reported in the form of percentage and frequency, and the disproportionality analysis was conducted. RESULTS: For the cardiovascular system, 4863 adverse events (AEs) were reported from BNT162b2 Pfizer, 1222 AstraZeneca, Moderna, and other COVID-19 vaccines. Common adverse events observed with vaccines under study were tachycardia (16.41%), flushing (12.17%), hypertension (5.82%), hypotension (3.60%) and peripheral coldness (2.41%). Based on disproportionality analysis (IC(025) values), acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and circulatory collapse were linked to the vaccines in the age group >75 years. Hypertension, severe hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, and palpitations were associated across all age groups and either gender. Amongst the investigations, abnormal ECG findings raised C-reactive protein, elevated D dimer, and troponin were reported in specific age groups or gender or all subjects. CONCLUSION: Although cardiovascular events have been reported with the COVID-19 vaccines, the causality is yet to be established because such CVS AEs are also usually associated with the general public even without intervention. Hence, people should be administered these vaccines, and sustained monitoring of these AEs should be done.","output":"Cardiovascular Adverse Events Reported from COVID-19 Vaccines: A Study Based on WHO Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our country is suffering the effects of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

We sought to quantify the impact of several public health measures, including non-medical mask-wearing, shelter-in-place, and detection of silent infections to help inform COVID-19 mitigation strategies. Methods We expanded a previously established agent-based disease transmission model and parameterized it with estimates of COVID-19 characteristics and US population demographics. We implemented non-medical mask-wearing, shelter-in-place, and case isolation as control measures and quantified their impact on reducing the attack rate and adverse clinical outcomes. Results We found that non-medical mask-wearing by 75% of the population reduced infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by 37.7% (IQR: 36.1% - 39.4%), 44.2% (IQR: 42.9% - 45.8%), and 47.2% (IQR: 45.5% - 48.7%), respectively, in the absence of a shelter-in-place strategy. Sheltering individuals aged 50 to 64 was the most efficient strategy, decreasing attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths by over 82% when combined with mask-wearing. Under simulated scenarios, outbreak control can be achieved, bringing the attack rate to below 1%, if at least 33% of silent pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections are identified and isolated. Conclusions Mask-wearing, even with the use of non-medical masks with only 20% efficacy in preventing disease transmission, has a substantial impact on outbreak control.

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Lilacs databases were used to identify articles published before June 2019 that met specific inclusion criteria. The search strategy was developed using both controlled and uncontrolled vocabulary related to the following domains: \\"drug interactions,\\" \\"clinically relevant,\\" and \\"hospital.\\" In this review, we discuss original observational studies that detected DDIs in the hospital setting, studies that provided enough data to allow us to calculate the prevalence of clinically manifested DDIs, and studies that described the drugs prescribed or provided DDI adverse reaction reports, published in either English, Portuguese, or Spanish. RESULTS: From the initial 5,999 articles identified, 10 met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of clinically manifested DDIs was 9.2% (CI 95% 4.0-19.7). The mean number of medications per patient reported in six studies ranged from 4.0 to 9.0, with an overall average of 5.47  1.77 drugs per patient. The quality of the included studies was moderate. The main methods used to identify clinically manifested DDIs were evaluating medical records and ward visits (n = 7). Micromedex? (27.7%) and Lexi-Comp?

We compared the risk of severe COVID-19, defined as the use of a high-flow nasal cannula or a mechanical ventilator, between groups that received dexamethasone either within 24 hours of hypoxemia (early dexamethasone group) or 24 hours after hypoxemia (late dexamethasone group). Hypoxemia was defined as room-air SpO(2) <90%. RESULTS: Among 59 patients treated with dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonia, 30 were in the early dexamethasone group and 29 were in the late dexamethasone group. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics, the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis or hospitalization, or the use of antiviral or antibacterial agents between the two groups.

There are increasing expectations and, in many cases, demands that corporations pull off their gloves to actively confront sociopolitical issues bedeviling their communities. Emerging scholarship suggests that corporate activism is influenced by various factors, including the ethical, political, and commercial orientations of corporate minds and the relative political and legal landscape within which corporations operate. Adopting a qualitative research mechanism that reflects on open-source information about relevant actors, collected from blogs, Twitter, and news sites, as complemented by a broad variety of secondary sources, this interdisciplinary research explores the theoretical suppositions of corporate activism in light of corporate intervention in Nigerias youth-led nationwide anti-police brutality (#EndSARS) protests of October 2020. The analysis highlights how Nigerias legal, political, and socioeconomic dynamics factored into the dimensions of corporate activism in that momentous social justice agitation. As a key finding, the paper observes a relatively greater tendency of tech companies to engage in the Nigerian anti-police brutality movement than firms from other sectors, and attributes this relative involvement to the seemingly greater levels of representation of young tech industry employees as victims of police brutality. This tends to ground a crucial supposition in corporate activism theory: that corporations would more likely engage social issues that affect their business.","output":"A law and politics contextualization of corporate activism in Nigerias 2020 anti-police brutality campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION When gastric cancer or carcinoid patients have coexisting diseases such as duodenal adenoma, FAP, or Crohn's disease, periodic observation of the duodenum is necessary. METHODS Between August 2013 and April 2015, we performed four consecutive laparoscopic total gastrectomies with double tract reconstruction for duodenal surveillance. Three of the patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer, while the remaining patient was diagnosed with gastric carcinoid. RESULTS No deaths occurred, and three of the patients showed no early complications. One patient with Crohn's disease developed anastomotic leakage, but it was successfully managed conservatively. On endoscopy three to seven months later, we were able to observe the duodenum via jejunal anastomosis in all of the patients. DISCUSSION Roux-en-Y reconstruction is one of the options after laparoscopic total gastrectomy. However, given that periodical endoscopic examinations of the duodenum are strongly recommended after surgery, double-tract reconstruction may be preferable in these patients. CONCLUSION Although more detailed data are required, double-tract reconstruction may be the best choice for patients requiring total gastrectomy with regular check-up of the duodenum.","output":"Laparoscopic double-tract reconstruction after total gastrectomy for postoperative duodenal surveillance: Case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Compare two approaches for laparoscopic infrarenal lymphadenectomy.

Both groups had similar age, 58years (range 29-80), BMI of 25 (range 18-41), blood loss, 150cm(3) (range 25-1500), and hospital stay, 1day (range 1-6). The extraperitoneal surgery took longer (240 v 202min; p=.001); yielded more nodes (50 v 41; p=.004). Extraperitoneal approach yielded more inframesenteric (14 v 10; p=.036), and infrarenal nodes (14 v 9; p=.001). 25% of cervical, 19% of endometrial and 14% of ovarian cancer patients had metastases in radiographically negative infrarenal nodes. 50% of cervical, 33% of endometrial and 17% of ovarian cancer patients had therapy altered by aortic lymphadenectomy. When the inframesenteric nodes were positive, 63% of endometrial and 80% of ovarian cancer patients had infrarenal metastases. More metastases were identified with increasing aortic node count. Extraperitoneal lymphadenectomy had no learning curve (p=0.320), while transperitoneal lymphadenectomy did (p=0.016). Higher BMI patients had lower aortic node yields by transperitoneal (p=.057) but not extraperitoneal approach (p=.578). Among the 14 patients whose BMI was 35-41, mean extraperitoneal total aortic nodal yield was 30; transperitoneal yield was 6. CONCLUSIONS Infrarenal aortic lymphadenectomy may offer higher aortic nodal yields, even in patients with BMI's of 45.

Patients and methods Data from the outpatient endoscopic unit of the University Hospital Augsburg between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 including the second pandemic wave were reviewed retrospectively. All patients were assessed with a pre-endoscopic risk-stratification questionnaire as well as viral testing using an antigen point-of-care test (Ag-POCT) in conjunction with a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Highly elective procedures were postponed. The theoretically expected number of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was simulated and compared with the actual number. In addition, endoscopy staff was evaluated with a rapid antibody test to determine the number of infections among the personnel. Results In total, 1029 procedures, 591 questionnaires, 591 Ag-POCTs, and 529 standard PCR tests were performed in 591 patients. 247 procedures in 142 patients were postponed. One Ag-POCT was positive but with a negative PCR test, while one PCR test was positive but with a negative Ag-POCT. This was lower than the theoretically expected number of COVID-19-positive patients (n = 15). One of 43 employees (2.3 %) in the outpatient endoscopy unit was seropositive.

Our objective was to determine the compliance with respiratory hygiene of triage nurses at 2 university hospital centers and to identify factors influencing compliance to the respiratory hygiene principles of emergency health care workers. METHODS: A 2-part, cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted at 2 training centers. An anonymous observation of compliance with respiratory hygiene by triage emergency nurses was performed. A self-administered, voluntary questionnaire on attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge of respiratory hygiene guidelines was distributed to the health care workers at the emergency department of the 2 hospital sites. RESULTS: Median objective compliance with respiratory hygiene measures of triage nurses was 22% (interquartile range [IQR], 11%-33%). Median perceived compliance of the health care workers was 68% (IQR, 61%-79%). Median actual knowledge score was 75% (IQR, 75%-100%).

Symptom recurrence which required repeat dilation or surgery was compared between pneumatic dilation and myotomy. RESULTS One hundred and fifty patients (112 myotomy, 38 pneumatic dilation) of similar characteristics were studied. The mean duration of follow-up after initial treatment was 17.5  7.2 years (10-40 years). Symptoms recurrence rate was 60.7% (100% pneumatic dilation patients vs. 47.3% myotomy), hazard ratio 0.24 demonstrating a lower need for repeat dilation or surgery with myotomy than pneumatic dilation (P = 0.008). All pneumatic dilation patients underwent myotomy in 4  4 (0-16 years). Forty of 53 myotomy patients had symptom recurrence prompting further treatment: 16 pneumatic dilation, 11 myotomy and 13 both. The mean time to repeat procedure was 6.9 years (0-40). The myotomy group required fewer dilations and/or surgeries than the pneumatic dilation group (1.6 vs. 3.6, P < 0.001). 13 patients (10.1%) progressed to end-stage achalasia (five myotomy, eight pneumatic dilation) over 40 years.

Parametric maps representing apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), pure diffusion coefficient (D), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), perfusion fraction (FP) and transfer constant (Ktrans), reflux constant (Kep), extra-vascular extra-cellular volume fraction (Ve), and initial area under curve in 60 s (iAUC) have been obtained from multiparametric MRI. RESULTS: Statistically significant (p < 0.001) inter-group differences were found between pleomorphic adenomas (PA) and Warthin tumors (WT) in all tested parameters but iAUC. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to determine the optimal cut-off levels of the most significant parameters allowing differentiation between WT and PA.

Specifically, the study examined the impact of remittance volatility on some macroeconomic variables [real gross domestic product (RGDP), consumption, investment, export and exchange rate] in a panel of seven African countries with the highest remittanceCGDP ratio. This was done within a fixed effects and random effects model, using annual secondary data from 2004 to 2018. Our results show that remittance volatility exerts a negative but insignificant impact on RGDP, consumption, investment, export and exchange rate; while remittances itself has positive significant impact on RGDP, consumption and investment.

During the work process comprehensive experiments were performed and each test was evaluated with the parameters mean square error (MSE), medium absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and R2 score. This study also offers a path for future research using regression models based on machine learning. Precise validation and data analysis can contribute to strategies for healing and disease prevention at an early stage. A systematic comprehensive strategy is a new philosophy in which statistical data for government agencies and community can be forecast.","output":"Performance Evaluation of Regression Models for COVID-19: A Statistical and Predictive Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"General medicine, as the Japanese version of primary care or family medicine, is critical for healthcare in aging societies. Medical students perceptions of general medicine and education might be associated with changes in the number of general physicians. This study aimed to clarify the association between these perceptions and students preferences for general medicine. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Japanese medical students using a questionnaire on their perceptions regarding general medicine, background, and preferences for general medicine (knowledge, interest, motivation, and intention). The response rate was 70.3% (490/697). There was a large percentage gap between interest and motivation; therefore, a logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the cause of this difference. The perceptions that general medicine meets the needs of society and the lack of general medicine educators were positively associated with motivation to become a general physician. In contrast, perceptions of lack of exposure to general medicine beyond the curriculum and inaccessibility were negatively associated with motivation. Medical students motivation to pursue general medicine may increase with improvements in flexible general medicine education and accessibility. Future research should investigate the relationship between students perceptions of general medicine and their motivation to become general physicians through longitudinal studies.","output":"Factors Associated with Motivation for General Medicine among Rural Medical Students: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several lineages of SARS-CoV-2 are currently circulating worldwide. During SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic activities performed in Abruzzo region (central Italy) several strains belonging to the B.1.177.75 lineage tested negative for the N gene but positive for the ORF1ab and S genes (+/+/- pattern) by the TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit manufactured by Thermofisher. By sequencing, a unique mutation, synonymous 28948C > T, was found in the N-negative B.1.177.75 strains. Although we do not have any knowledge upon the nucleotide sequences of the primers and probe adopted by this kit, it is likely that N gene dropout only occurs when 28948C > T is coupled with 28932C > T, this latter present, in turn, in all B.1.177.75 sequences available on public databases. Furthermore, epidemiological analysis was also performed. The majority of the N-negative B.1.177.75 cases belonged to two clusters apparently unrelated to each other and both clusters involved young people. However, the phylogeny for sequences containing the +/+/- pattern strongly supports a genetic connection and one common source for both clusters. Though, genetic comparison suggests a connection rather than indicating the independent emergence of the same mutation in two apparently unrelated clusters. This study highlights once more the importance of sharing genomic data to link apparently unrelated epidemiological clusters and to, remarkably, update molecular tests.","output":"Multiple detection and spread of novel strains of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.177 (B.1.177.75) lineage that test negative by a commercially available nucleocapsid gene real-time RT-PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is debate as to whether olfactory dysfunction should be considered a symptom of COVID-19 infection. We undertook a systematic literature review of the articles indexed in PubMed on olfactory disorders in viral respiratory tract conditions, with special emphasis on COVID-19.

Olfactory disorders in upper respiratory tract infections are frequent, most caused by obstruction due to oedema of the nasal mucosa. Occasionally, post-viral sensorineural olfactory dysfunction occurs, with a variable prognosis. The evidence on anosmia in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited, corresponding to a level 5 or D of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

In addition, sera of VN-positive and VN-negative neonatal pigs were analyzed for immunoglobulin classes by radial immunodiffusion technique. The competence of neonatal pigs to produce VN antibody with increased IgG levels was demonstrated.

We describe a case of iliopsoas hematoma in a tetanus patient who had not been treated with any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old female patient was transferred to our hospital 7 days after the onset of tetanus. An iliopsoas hematoma was identified in her right iliopsoas muscle on computed tomography. There was no extravasation; thus, the hematoma improved with conservative therapy. There were no episodes that suggested a bleeding tendency, or no factors associated with hemorrhagic conditions. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of iliopsoas hematoma as a complication in a tetanus patient who did not received anticoagulation therapy. The possibility of IPH as a complication of tetanus should be considered before and during the administration of anticoagulation therapy.","output":"A case of iliopsoas hematoma as a complication of tetanus in a patient who did not receive anticoagulant therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-coronavirus 2 is the causal agent of the COVID-19 outbreak. SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes.CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in lysosomes). We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinsons disease. It is available as a generic drug.. Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.","output":"Amantadine disrupts lysosomal gene expression; potential therapy for COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The limitations and high false-negative rates (30%) of COVID-19 test kits have been a prominent challenge during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic Manufacturing those kits and performing the tests require extensive resources and time Recent studies show that radiological images like chest X-rays can offer a more efficient solution and faster initial screening of COVID-19 patients In this study, we develop a COVID-19 diagnosis model using Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network (MLP-CNN) for mixed-data (numerical/categorical and image data) The model predicts and differentiates between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, such that early diagnosis of the virus can be initiated, leading to timely isolation and treatments to stop further spread of the disease We also explore the benefits of using numerical/categorical data in association with chest X-ray images for screening COVID-19 patients considering both balanced and imbalanced datasets Three different optimization algorithms are used and tested:adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm (Adam), stochastic gradient descent (Sgd), and root mean square propagation (Rmsprop) Preliminary computational results show that, on a balanced dataset, a model trained with Adam can distinguish between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with a higher accuracy of 96 3% On the imbalanced dataset, the model trained with Rmsprop outperformed all other models by achieving an accuracy of 95 38% Additionally, our proposed model outperformed selected existing deep learning models (considering only chest X-ray or CT scan images) by producing an overall average accuracy of 94 6%  3 42%","output":"Deep MLP-CNN Model Using Mixed-Data to Distinguish between COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding speech in background noise is challenging.

Numerous studies have reported that circular RNAs (circRNAs) have important functions in CRC. It was first thought that circRNAs were non-coding RNA; however, more recently they were discovered to encode peptides and play a pivotal role in cancer development and progression. It was shown that most circRNAs possess coding potential; however, not all of them can truly encode peptides. Therefore, a practical strategy to scan for coding circRNAs is needed. Method: Sequence analyses included open reading frame (ORF) prediction, coding peptide prediction, and the identification of unique sequences. Then, experimental assays were used to verify the coded peptides, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was introduced to detect sequences of circRNAs with coding potential, and Western blot was used to identify the encoded peptides. Finally, the functions of the circRNAs were primarily explored. Result: An efficient strategy for searching circRNAs with coding potential was created. We verified this schedule using public databases and LC-MS/MS, then two of these circRNAs were selected for further verification. We used commercial antibodies that can also identify the predicted peptides to test the coded peptides. The functions of the circRNAs were explored primarily, and the results showed that they were mainly involved in the promotion of proliferation and invasion ability. Discussion: We have constructed an efficient strategy of scanning circRNAs with coding potential. Our strategy helped to provide a more convenient pathway for identifying circRNA-derived peptides, which can be a potential therapeutic target or a diagnostic biomarker.","output":"Strategy for Scanning Peptide-Coding Circular RNAs in Colorectal Cancer Based on Bioinformatics Analysis and Experimental Assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aims to examine the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the relationship between UK universities and professional accounting bodies (PABs) in the context of the accreditation system and how well prepared this relationship was to observe and respond to the pandemic.

Findings The study shows that COVID-19 has highlighted pedagogical and ideological conflicts within the PAB-university relationship. The analysis shows that, in an attempt to resolve these conflicts, universities demonstrate \\"unrequited love\\" for PABs by limiting changes to assessments to meet the PABs' criteria. Indeed, PABs face very little resistance from universities. This further constrains academics by suppressing innovation and limiting their scope to learn and adopt new skills, habits and teaching styles. Originality/value The paper highlights the weakness of the PAB-university relationship. Moreover, it shows that rather than using the pandemic crisis to question this relationship, PABs may seek to promote their accounting pedagogy and retain greater control of the accounting curriculum.

This initiative includes the use of biological control agents, including Laricobius spp. (Insecta: Coleoptera). Laboratory production of these agents is limited by subterranean mortality and early emergence. Therefore, the subterranean survivorship and timing of emergence of a mixture of Laricobius spp. was investigated. PVC traps internally lined with a sticky card and covered with a mesh screen were inserted into the soil to measure the percent emergence of adults based on the number of larvae placed within. The number of emerged adults in the field and laboratory-reared larval treatments was adjusted based on emergence numbers in the control and used as the response variable. Independent variables included in the final model were: treatment (field-collected vs. laboratory-reared), organic layer depth (cm), soil pH, and April-to-December mean soil moisture. No differences were found in survivorship between field-collected and laboratory-reared treatments. As pH and organic layer increased survivorship decreased, significantly.

METHODS At two centers, 129 consecutive stroke patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores 5 were treated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Separator 3D as a component of the Penumbra System within 8 h of symptom onset; modified Treatment in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) revascularization scores, NIHSS score on admission and discharge, mortality rates, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcomes at 90 days were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 129 vessels in 129 patients were treated. Occlusions were located in the middle cerebral artery (MCA, 48%), internal carotid artery (ICA, 33%), cervical ICA-MCA (3%), and vertebrobasilar arteries (16%). Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was given to 78% of patients. Median NIHSS was 15 prior to treatment.

Due to the lack of immediately available vaccines and effective drugs, many policy- and decision-makers have focused on non-pharmacological methods, including social distancing. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of the implementation of this policy in Iran, one of the countries most affected by COVID-19. We conducted a quasi-experimental study, utilizing the interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) approach. Methods: We collected daily data between February 20, 2020 and January 29, 2021, through governmental websites from 954 public hospitals and healthcare settings. The Iranian government launched the social distancing policy on March 27, 2020. Statistical analyses, including ITSA, were carried out with R software Version 3.6.1 (London, UK). Results: During the study period, 1,398,835 confirmed incidence cases and 57,734 deaths occurred. We found a decrease of -179.93 (95% CI: -380.11 to -20.25, P-value=0.078) confirmed incidence cases following the implementation of the social distancing policy, corresponding to a daily decrease in the trend of -31.17 (95% CI: -46.95 to -15.40, P-value=0.08).

The appearance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increased the need for new therapeutic options against these strains. Areas covered: This review covers the in vitro susceptibility, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of bedaquiline, a new drug shown to be active against M. tuberculosis-resistant strains. The authors further review clinical data concerning its use against MDR and XDR strains, discussing recent clinical guidelines from different international societies. Expert opinion: Available data demonstrate the usefulness of bedaquiline against resistant M. tuberculosis. Despite the difficulty in analyzing multidrug therapies, the use of bedaquiline in MDR and XDR tuberculosis increases success rates, allowing shortened treatments and lower drug use than previously recommended regimens. Moreover, the fact that MDR and XDR strains are common in many places creates a need to include this drug in the currently available protocols. It is essential to overcome the substantial barriers that some countries encounter in obtaining bedaquiline, as doing so will make therapeutic regimens including this drug available for all patients.","output":"Evaluating bedaquiline as a treatment option for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to accurately determine when to perform an action is a fundamental brain function and vital to adaptive behavior. The behavioral mechanism and neural circuit for action timing, however, remain largely unknown. Using a new, self-paced action timing task in mice, we found that deprivation of auditory, but not somatosensory or visual input, disrupts learned action timing. The hearing effect was dependent on the auditory feedback derived from the animal's own actions, rather than passive environmental cues. Neuronal activity in the secondary auditory cortex was found to be both correlated with and necessary for the proper execution of learned action timing. Closed-loop, action-dependent optogenetic stimulation of the specific task-related neuronal population within the secondary auditory cortex rescued the key features of learned action timing under auditory deprivation. These results unveil a previously underappreciated sensorimotor mechanism in which the secondary auditory cortex transduces self-generated audiomotor feedback to control action timing.","output":"Secondary auditory cortex mediates a sensorimotor mechanism for action timing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a three-dimensional (3D) point-of-intention (POI) determination method using multimodal fusion between hand pointing and eye gaze for a 3D virtual display.

Addressing the unmet medical need for therapies has been hampered by a lack of suitable cell culture models to investigate the HBV life cycle in a single experimental setup. We sought to develop a platform suitable to investigate all aspects of the entire HBV life cycle. METHODS: HepG2-NTCPsec+ cells were inoculated with HBV. Supernatants of infected cells were transferred to na?ve cells. Inhibition of infection was determined in primary and secondary infected cells by high-content imaging of viral and cellular factors. Novel antivirals were triaged in cells infected with cell culture- or patient-derived HBV and in stably virus replicating cells. HBV internalisation and target-based receptor binding assays were conducted. RESULTS: We developed an HBV platform, screened 2,102 drugs and bioactives, and identified 3 early and 38 late novel HBV life cycle inhibitors using infectious HBV genotype D. Two early inhibitors, pranlukast (EC(50) 4.3 M; 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)] >50 M) and cytochalasin D (EC(50) 0.07 M; CC(50) >50 M), and 2 late inhibitors, fludarabine (EC(50) 0.1 M; CC(50) 13.4 M) and dexmedetomidine (EC(50) 6.2 M; CC(50) >50 M), were further investigated. Pranlukast inhibited HBV preS1 binding, whereas cytochalasin D prevented the internalisation of HBV. Fludarabine inhibited the secretion of HBV progeny DNA, whereas dexmedetomidine interfered with the infectivity of HBV progeny. Patient-derived HBV genotype C was efficiently inhibited by fludarabine (EC(50) 0.08 M) and dexmedetomidine (EC(50) 8.7 M). CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed high-content assay is suitable to screen large-scale drug libraries, enables monitoring of the entire HBV life cycle, and discriminates between inhibition of early and late viral life cycle events. LAY SUMMARY: HBV infection is an incurable, chronic disease with few available treatments. Addressing this unmet medical need has been hampered by a lack of suitable cell culture models to study the entire viral life cycle in a single experimental setup. We developed an image-based approach suitable to screen large numbers of drugs, using a cell line that can be infected by HBV and produces large amounts of virus particles. By transferring viral supernatants from these infected cells to uninfected target cells, we could monitor the entire viral life cycle. We used this system to screen drug libraries and identified novel anti-HBV inhibitors that potently inhibit HBV in various phases of its life cycle. This assay will be an important new tool to study the HBV life cycle and accelerate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","output":"A new high-content screening assay of the entire hepatitis B virus life cycle identifies novel antivirals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made more than 125 million people infected and more than 2.7 million people dead globally. Airborne transmission has been recognized as one of the major transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating the effectiveness of multi-scale IAQ control strategies in mitigating the infection risk in different scenarios. The IAQ control strategies across multiple scales from a whole building to rooms, and to cubical and personal microenvironments and breathing zone, are introduced, including elevated outdoor airflow rates, high-efficiency filters, advanced air distribution strategies, standalone air cleaning technologies, personal ventilation and face masks. The effectiveness of these strategies for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection are evaluated for specific indoor spaces, including long-term care facility, school and college, meat plant, retail stores, hospital, office, correctional facility, hotel, restaurant, casino and transportation spaces like airplane, cruise ship, subway, bus and taxi, where airborne transmission are more likely to occur due to high occupancy densities. The baseline cases of these spaces are established according to the existing standards, guidelines or practices. Several integrated mitigation strategies are recommended and classified based on their relative cost and effort of implementation for each indoor space. They can be applied to help meet the current challenge of ongoing COVID-19, and provide better preparation for other possible epidemics and pandemics of airborne infectious diseases in the future.","output":"A systematic approach to estimating the effectiveness of multi-scale IAQ strategies for reducing the risk of airborne infection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The relationship between procedural volume and outcomes for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) is contentious, with previous reviews suggesting an inverse volume-outcome relationship. The aim of this study was to systematically review contemporary evidence to re-examine this relationship. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to examine the relationship between PCI procedural volume (both at hospital- and operator-levels) and outcomes in adults. The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary outcomes were complications, healthcare utilisation and process outcomes. Searches were conducted from 1 January 2008 to 28 May 2019. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using 'Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations' (GRADE). Screening, data extraction, quality appraisal and GRADE assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers. RESULTS Of 1,154 unique records retrieved, 22 observational studies with 6,432,265 patients were included. No significant association was found between total PCI hospital volume and mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-1.03, I 2 = 86%). A temporal trend from significant to non-significant pooled effect estimates was observed. The pooled effect estimate for mortality was found to be significantly in favour of high-volume operators for total PCI procedures (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63-0.94, I 2 = 93%), and for high-volume hospitals for primary PCI procedures (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.94, I 2 = 78%). Overall, GRADE certainty of evidence was 'very low'. There were mixed findings for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS A volume-outcome relationship may exist in certain situations, although this relationship appears to be attenuating with time, and there is 'very low' certainty of evidence. While volume might be important, it should not be the only standard used to define an acceptable PCI service and a broader evaluation of quality metrics should be considered that encompass patient experience and clinical outcomes.

We evaluated outcomes associated with the use of OR compared with AR in HCT recipients. METHODS: Retrospective review of all HCT recipients with RSV infection treated with OR or AR during three RSV seasons (September 2014 C February 2017). An established immunodeficiency Scoring Index (ISI) was applied to identify patients at high risk for progression and death based on host risk factors. Mortality, progression to lower respiratory infection (LRI), and need for ICU admission was compared among recipients of AR and OR. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were treated with OR (n = 42, 39%) or AR (n = 65, 61%). Recipients of AR and OR were equally likely to be high-risk by ISI scoring (11% vs. 10%, P = 1.00). Fifty-three patients (50%) presented with upper respiratory infection (URI) of whom 13 (25%) progressed to LRI. There was no difference in the rate of progression to LRI between patients who received AR and OR (28% vs. 19%, P = 0.53). No difference was found in 30-day mortality rates based on treatment strategy (8% AR vs. 5% OR, P = 0.70). Interestingly, 90-day mortality was found to be significantly lower among patients who received OR vs. AR (20% vs. 5%, P = 0.04). No differences in rates of ICU admission and requirement for mechanical ventilation were found between the two groups. For the 99 inpatients at time of diagnosis, median (interquartile range) length of stay was 7 (5 C 19) days, and was similar for patients on either treatment modality. Eight patients were treated for RSV on an outpatient basis and all received OR. CONCLUSION: HCT patients with RSV had similar outcomes when treated with AR and OR.

How to control air pollution in megacities is still a challenging issue because of the complex pollutant sources, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorology. There is substantial uncertainty in accurately identifying the contributions of transport and local emissions to the air quality in megacities. The COVID-19 outbreak has prompted a nationwide public lockdown period and provides a valuable opportunity for understanding the sources and factors of air pollutants. The three-month period of continuous field observations for aerosol particles and gaseous pollutants, which extended from January 2020 to March 2020, covered urban, urban-industry, and suburban areas in the typical megacity of Hangzhou in the Yangtze River Delta in eastern China. In general, the concentrations of PM2.5C10, PM2.5, NOx, SO2, and CO reduced 58%, 47%, 83%, 11% and 30%, respectively, in the megacity during the COVID-Lock period.

This is exacerbated by the increasing burden of diseases such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV and AIDS) and more recently the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as advancing technology and changing regulations and policies. Problem-based learning is a student-centred learning strategy, where students are presented with situations drawn from practice, which can be used to bridge the theory-practice gap. OBJECTIVES: To explore the perceptions and views of healthcare educators on how problem-based learning can be facilitated through simulation. METHOD: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was used. Thirteen educators from the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Johannesburg, with 5 years' teaching experience, were purposively selected from the Dean's office, the Nursing Department, emergency medical care and the departments of podiatry, somatology and radiography. The participants were selected based on their extensive knowledge of problem-based learning and the use of simulation. Data were collected through in-depth, individual, semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis provided six themes and 13 related sub-themes. The article focuses on the perceptions and views of educators regarding problem-based learning through simulation. RESULTS: Problem-based learning through simulation allows students to work together in teams, which demonstrates a new modus operandi and renders a holistic approach to patient care. CONCLUSION: Problem-based learning through simulation should be utilised to encourage reflective knowledge exchange. Students from various departments can learn about new innovations, creativity and develop critical thinking when solving complex health-related problems.","output":"Educators' perceptions and views of problem-based learning through simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data essential to public health practice for public health action, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those who need to know. Modern surveillance systems must meet the challenges of a dynamic emergence of infectious diseases and the factors that influence it, including human demographics and behavior, technology, economic development and land use, international travel and commerce, microbial adaptation and change, breakdown of public health measures, and potential acts of bioterrorism. Globally, the use of public health surveillance systems to track occurrences of infectious diseases and other public health threats has never been more important, and all countries have agreed to commit to conduct surveillance under the World Health Organization International Health Regulations (2005). Modern information technology can facilitate linking diverse sources of data, rapid analysis and synthesis of large amounts of information, and development of the communications and networks needed globally for surveillance and response to infectious diseases.

The exact physiologic mechanism is not completely understood. Surgical reversal to the original anatomy and distal or total pancreatectomy are current therapeutic options to reverse the hypoglycemic effect, with substantial associated morbidity. Our group reports a pilot clinical series of a novel surgical technique using one-anastomosis jejunal interposition with gastric remnant resection (Branco-Zorron Switch). METHODS Patients with severe symptomatic hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia refractory to conservative therapy were treated using the technique. The procedure started with resection of the remnant stomach close to pylorus. The alimentary limb was sectioned at 20 cm from the gastrojejunal anastomosis, and the rest of the alimentary limb was resected until the Y-Roux anastomosis. A hand-sutured anastomosis was then performed with the proximal alimentary limb and the remnant antrum. RESULTS Four patients were successfully submitted to the procedure with reversal of the symptomatology and normalization of insulin levels, postprandial glucose levels, and oral glucose tolerance test, with a mean follow-up of 24.3 months. Mean operative time was 188 min, and patients recovered without postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Patients suffering from severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after gastric bypass may be efficiently treated by this innovative procedure, avoiding extreme surgical therapy such as pancreatectomy or restoring the gastric anatomy, while still maintaining sustained weight loss. Studies with larger series and longer follow-up are still needed to define the role of this therapy in managing this entity.","output":"One-Anastomosis Jejunal Interposition with Gastric Remnant Resection (Branco-Zorron Switch) for Severe Recurrent Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia after Gastric Bypass for Morbid Obesity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a valuable home treatment option, even more so during the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. However, the long-term use of PD is limited by unfavourable tissue remodelling in the peritoneal membrane, which is associated with inflammation-induced angiogenesis. This appears to be driven primarily through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), while the involvement of other angiogenic signaling pathways is still poorly understood. Here, we have identified the crucial contribution of mesothelial cell-derived angiogenic CXC chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) to peritoneal angiogenesis in PD. CXCL1 expression and peritoneal microvessel density were analysed in biopsies obtained by the International Peritoneal Biobank (NCT01893710 at www.clinicaltrials.gov), comparing 13 children with end-stage kidney disease before initiating PD to 43 children on chronic PD. The angiogenic potential of mesothelial cell-derived CXCL1 was assessed in vitro by measuring endothelial tube formation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) treated with conditioned medium from human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) stimulated to release CXCL1 by treatment with either recombinant IL-17 or PD effluent. We found that the capillary density in the human peritoneum correlated with local CXCL1 expression. Both CXCL1 expression and microvessel density were higher in PD patients than in the age-matched patients prior to initiation of PD. Exposure of HMECs to recombinant CXCL1 or conditioned medium from IL-17-stimulated HPMCs resulted in increased endothelial tube formation, while selective inhibition of mesothelial CXCL1 production by specific antibodies or through silencing of relevant transcription factors abolished the proangiogenic effect of HPMC-conditioned medium. In conclusion, peritoneal mesothelium-derived CXCL1 promotes endothelial tube formation in vitro and associates with peritoneal microvessel density in uremic patients undergoing PD, thus providing novel targets for therapeutic intervention to prolong PD therapy.","output":"Angiogenic Role of Mesothelium-Derived Chemokine CXCL1 During Unfavorable Peritoneal Tissue Remodeling in Patients Receiving Peritoneal Dialysis as Renal Replacement Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB family) possess a wide distribution and diverse functions ranging from cellular growth to migration and apoptosis.

METHODS The intervention was a transvaginal sleeve gastrectomy in a 67-year-old woman who was hypertensive, noninsulin-dependent with diabetes with morbid obesity (BMI, 37). Operative field view was maintained at all times with a gastroscope introduced through a transvaginal trocar. The surgeon positioned himself at the right side of the patient using a 2-mm needle port/mini-grasper placed in the left upper quadrant for traction of the greater curvature of the stomach. A 12-mm umbilical trocar was used as the port for insertion of the LigaSure device used for division of the short gastric vessels and the Endo-GIA stapler for creation of the gastric tube. The first assistant used a second mini-grasper for liver retraction and stomach positioning. The resected stomach was retrieved through the vagina. There were no intraoperative complications. The operative time was 150 minutes. RESULTS The advantages of minimally invasive surgery seemed to be enhanced with this hybrid laparoscopic approach. Postoperative course was uneventful. All component steps of a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) were reproduced. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS Transvaginal hybrid MA-NOS sleeve gastrectomy is both feasible and safe. The hybrid technique ensured safety during the performance of the procedure. MA-NOS is a potential option to avoid abdominal incisions and related complications for the laparoscopic resection of large intra-abdominal organs. Combined hybrid laparoscopic NOS for humans is currently a safe and reliable approach for major surgery through the NOS approach in female patients. Hybrid surgery allows controlled implementation of NOS techniques in clinical practice, providing a stepwise progression to the pure NOS approach once the appropriate technology has been developed. Additionally, it is the best way to stimulate the active development and evaluation of the underpinning technologies and instruments for these novel endoscopic surgical approaches. Appropriate clinical indications for these new procedures are yet to be defined. LSG is associated with short-term excess weight loss and resolution of comorbidities comparable to those obtained with other restrictive procedures. The performance of sleeve gastrectomy is an option in selected patients undergoing bariatric surgical treatment, particularly in the super obese and those who are considered high risk because of comorbid disease.","output":"Hybrid vaginal MA-NOS sleeve gastrectomy: technical note on the procedure in a patient."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Introduccin Avances en el diagnstico molecular han hecho posible la deteccin de agentes virales desconocidos en infecciones de las vas respiratorias inferiores (IVRI).

Abstract Introduction Advances in molecular diagnosis have made it possible to detect previously unknown viral agents as causative agents of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). The frequency and relevance of viral coinfections is still debatable. Objective compare clinical presentation and severity between single virus infection and viral coinfection in children admitted for LRTI. Methods A 3-year period observational study (2012-2015) included children younger than two years admitted for LRTI. Viral identification was performed using PCR technique for 16 viruses. Clinical data and use of health resources was gathered during hospital stay using a standard collection form and we compared single virus infection and viral coinfections. Results The study included 524 samples (451 patients); 448 (85,5%) had at least one virus identified. Viral coinfections were found in 159 (35,5%). RSV and HRV were the most commonly identified virus; bronchiolitis and pneumonia the most frequent diagnosis. Patients with viral coinfections were older, attended day-care centers, had previous recurrent wheezing more frequently and were more symptomatic at admission. These patients did not have more complementary exams performed but were prescribed medications more often. Viral coinfection group did not show longer length of hospital stay and oxygen need, more need for ICU nor ventilatory support. Discussion Our study showed a significant proportion of viral coinfections in young infants admitted with LRTI and confirmed previous data showing that prescription was more frequent in inpatients with viral coinfections, without an association with worst clinical outcome.","output":"Relevancia a corto plazo de la coinfeccin viral en pacientes menores de 2 a?os hospitalizados con infecciones de las vas respiratorias inferiores"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Determine the targets and methods of psychological and pedagogical work that aimed increasing the specific normativity of students' behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, on compliance with the mask regime Background Due to the situation with COVID-19 pandemic many countries all over the world, including in Russia, introduced the number of tough measures which restricted the behavior and interaction of people The study focuses on such acute issues as the attitudes of different social groups toward both the disease itself and the measures to combat it, clarification of the reasons and motivations for individuals' compliance/non-compliance with normative behavior during the pandemic The coronavirus pandemic actualizes the problems of providing practical psychological assistance to people, including young people, who experience stress and who have difficulties with coping with this situation Study design The study was conducted during the increasing spread of the disease and the introduction of an isolation regime The data obtained was analyzed with reference to the time of the research participants' questionnaire completion: the first group of students filled the Google forms from 9th to 23rd November 2020 (stage 1);the second group -

Objective: To compare safety, reactogenicity, and changes in HRQOL scores after aIIV3 vs HD-IIV3. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized blinded clinical trial was a multicenter US study conducted during the 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019 influenza seasons. Among 778 community-dwelling adults aged at least 65 years and assessed for eligibility, 13 were ineligible and 8 withdrew before randomization. Statistical analysis was performed from August 2019 to August 2020. Interventions: Intramuscular administration of aIIV3 or HD-IIV3 after age-stratification (65-79 years; &#8805;80 years) and randomization. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportions of participants with moderate-to-severe injection-site pain and 14 other solicited reactions during days 1 to 8, using a noninferiority test (5% noninferiority margin), and serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse events of clinical interest (AECI), including new-onset immune-mediated conditions, during days 1 to 43. Changes in HRQOL scores before and after vaccination (days 1, 3) were also compared between study groups. Results: A total of 757 adults were randomized, 378 to receive aIIV3 and 379 to receive HD-IIV3. Of these participants, there were 420 women (55%) and 589 White individuals (78%) with a median (range) age of 72 (65-97) years. The proportion reporting moderate-to-severe injection-site pain, limiting or preventing activity, after aIIV3 (12 participants [3.2%]) (primary outcome) was noninferior compared with HD-IIV3 (22 participants [5.8%]) (difference -2.7%; 95% CI, -5.8 to 0.4). Ten reactions met noninferiority criteria for aIIV3; 4 (moderate-to-severe injection-site tenderness, arthralgia, fatigue, malaise) did not. It was inconclusive whether these 4 reactions occurred in higher proportions of participants after aIIV3. No participant sought medical care for a vaccine reaction. No AECI was observed. Nine participants had at least SAE after aIIV3 (2.4%; 95% CI,1.1% to 4.5%); 3 had at least 1 SAE after HD-IIV3 (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 2.2%). No SAE was associated with vaccination. Changes in prevaccination and postvaccination HRQOL scores were not clinically meaningful and not different between the groups.

It is also unknown if e-consult utilization during the pandemic replaced or merely deferred the need for a specialty appointment. We evaluated if primary care providers' (PCPs) e-consult utilization and specialists' recommendations for specialty appointments changed after the transition to telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cohort study used an interrupted time series analysis of e-consult utilization in a large, urban academic health care system between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020; the post-telemedicine time period began March 15, 2020. The primary outcome measure was the odds of an e-consult ordered during a PCP appointment; the secondary outcome measure was the odds of a specialist recommending a specialty appointment in an e-consult. Results: During 193,263 PCP appointments, 1,318 e-consults were placed to internal medicine subspecialties. Compared to the pre-telemedicine time period, the odds of a PCP ordering an e-consult increased (OR 1.04, 95% CI [1.02-1.07]) and the odds of specialists recommending specialty appointments increased (OR 1.11, 95% CI [1.06-1.15]). Conclusions: E-consult use increased following the transition to telemedicine in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that PCPs consider the e-consult a valuable tool for patient care when there is limited availability of specialty appointments.

However, there are no clear guidelines regarding the optimal ventilation strategy. We hypothesized that airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) would mitigate lung injury in a preterm porcine neonatal model. METHODS Preterm piglets were delivered on gestational day 98 (85% of 115day term), instrumented, and randomized to volume guarantee (VG; n=10) with low tidal volumes (5.5cm3kg-1) and PEEP 4cmH2O or APRV (n=10) with initial ventilator settings: PHigh 18cmH2O, PLow 0cmH2O, THigh 1.30s, TLow 0.15s. Ventilator setting changes were made in response to clinical parameters in both groups. Animals were monitored continuously for 24hours. RESULTS The mortality rates between the two groups were not significantly different (p>0.05). The VG group had relatively increased oxygen requirements (FiO2 50%9%) compared with the APRV group (FiO2 28%5%; p>0.05) and a decrease in PaO2/FiO2 ratio (VG 16233mmHg; APRV 25145mmHg; p<0.05). The compliance of the VG group (0.510.07LcmH2O-1) was significantly less than the APRV group (0.900.06LcmH2O-1; p<0.05). CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that APRV improves oxygenation and compliance as compared with VG.

The same OAS1 locus has been recently associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, linking risk for both diseases. The single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1131454(A) and rs4766676(T) are associated with Alzheimers disease, and rs10735079(A) and rs6489867(T) are associated with severe COVID-19, where the risk alleles are linked with decreased OAS1 expression.

In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia with lowered OAS1 expression, we show exaggerated production of TNF- with IFN- stimulation, indicating OAS1 is required to limit the pro-inflammatory response of myeloid cells.

AIM: To evaluate the clinical profile and outcome of the patients presenting with OPC poisoning and to study the prognostic value of Peradeniya Organophosphorus Poisoning Scale (POPS) in predicting the clinical outcomes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was a prospective study involving 100 patients of OPC poisoning admitted to Tata Main Hospital from June 2018 to May 2020 based on the inclusion criteria. Demographic profile, clinical features, treatment details, and need for ventilatory support were noted. POPS was applied on admission, and the patients were followed up for the outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality. OBSERVATIONS: Of the 100 patients, most patients were between 20 and 29 years with male to female ratio being 1.2:1. Vomiting (94%), followed by excessive secretions (84%) were the most common symptoms. Overall mortality was 22%. On grading of severity as per the POP scale, 27% of the patients had mild poisoning, 37% patients had moderate, whereas 36% had severe poisoning. Only 11.11% of the patients with POPS 0C3 required ventilator support, whereas 16.2% of the patients with POPS 4C7, and 100% of patients with POPS 8C11 required ventilator assistance (P < 0.0001). Similarly, the total dose of atropine required (P < 0.0001), length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, complications, and mortality (P < 0.0001) were significantly associated with higher POPS. CONCLUSION: POPS at admission, correlated well with the need for ventilator support, the total dose of atropine required, length of stay in the ICU, complications, and mortality. It can thus be used for prognostication and risk stratification of patients with OPC poisoning.","output":"Study of organophosphorus compound poisoning in a tertiary care hospital and the role of Peradeniya Organophosphorus Poisoning scale as a prognostic marker of the outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a model of optimal training of a rational, sluggish agent.

The identification of ACE2 in as many as 72 tissues suggests that extrapulmonary invasion and damage is likely, which indeed has already been demonstrated by cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms. On the other hand, identifying ACE2 dysregulation in patients with comorbidities may offer insight as to why COVID-19 symptoms are often more severe in these individuals. This may be attributed to a pre-existing proinflammatory state that is further propelled with the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or the loss of functional ACE2 expression as a result of viral internalization.

The current literature presented different measurement methods and reported the results of utilisation of new technologies for measuring COVE. However, previous papers used different technology applications covering only a part of the monitoring process with its own limitations. Since technologies are advancing and offering novel solutions, there is an urgent need to identify the gaps, re-evaluate the current methods, and develop a critical agenda for automating the entire process of collecting emissions data from construction sites, and monitoring the emission contributors across cities. This paper systematically identifies relevant papers through a search of three key databases-Web of Science, Engineering Valley and Scopus-covering the publications in the last decade from 2008 to 2017. An innovative robust research method was designed to select and analyse the relevant papers. The identified papers were stored in a data set, and a thematic algorithm employed to find the clusters of papers which might be potentially relevant. The selected papers were used for further micro-thematic analysis to find key relevant papers on COVE, and the gap in the literature. A sample of relevant papers was found relevant to COVE and critically reviewed by coding and content analysis. This paper critically reviews the selected papers and also shows that there is a considerable gap in the applications of new technologies for measuring in-use COVE in real time based on real activities toward automated methods.

During March 6-July 11, MDH and 1,217 partnering health care facilities assessed 21,406 HCP exposures; among these, 5,374 (25%) were classified as higher-risk (3). Higher-risk exposures involved direct patient care (66%) and nonpatient care interactions (e.g., with coworkers and social and household contacts) (34%). Within 14 days following a higher-risk exposure, nearly one third (31%) of HCP who were enrolled in monitoring reported COVID-19-like symptoms,? and more than one half (52%) of enrolled HCP with symptoms received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. Among all HCP with higher-risk exposures, irrespective of monitoring enrollment, 7% received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. Compared with HCP with higher-risk exposures working in acute care settings, those working in congregate living or long-term care settings more often returned to work (57%), worked while symptomatic (5%), and received a positive test result (10%) during 14-day postexposure monitoring than did HCP working outside of such settings. These data highlight the need for awareness of nonpatient care SARS-CoV-2 exposure risks and for targeted interventions to protect HCP, in addition to residents, in congregate living and long-term care settings. To minimize exposure risk among HCP, health care facilities need improved infection prevention and control, consistent personal protective equipment (PPE) availability and use, flexible sick leave, and SARS-CoV-2 testing access.

It remains unclear, however, if maladaptive exercise behaviors are on the rise among non-clinical samples. The objective of this study was to examine college students engagement in exercise behaviors (both adaptive and maladaptive) before and during COVID-19. METHOD: This study compared reports of compulsive exercise, weight and shape exercise, and positive and healthy exercise in two separate samples recruited from a large southeastern university. Sample 1 was collected pre-COVID-19 (August 2019CFebruary 2020) and Sample 2 was collected during COVID-19 (August 2020CApril 2021).

Our objective is to identify individual-level factors associated with ones personal risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of adult participants from 26 March 2020 to 8 October 2020. SETTING: The COVID-19 Citizen Science Study, an international, community and mobile-based study collecting daily, weekly and monthly surveys in a prospective and time-updated manner. PARTICIPANTS: All adult participants over the age of 18 years were eligible for enrolment.

The isolation of Sertoli cells is essential to study their functions. However, the close contact of Sertoli cells with other testicular cell types and the high proliferation of contaminating cells are obstacles to obtain pure primary cultures. Current rodent Sertoli cell isolation protocols result in enriched, rather than pure Sertoli cells. Therefore, novel approaches are necessary to improve the purity of Sertoli cell primary cultures. The goal of this study is to obtain pure mouse Sertoli cells using lineage tracing and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We bred the Amh-Cre mouse line with tdTomato line to generate mice constitutively expressing red fluorescence specifically in Sertoli cells. Primary cultures of Sertoli cells isolated from prepubertal mice showed that 79% of cells expressed tdTomato, as evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry; however, nearly all adherent cells were positive for vimentin. Most of the tomato-negative cells expressed &#945;-smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA), a peritubular myoid cell marker, but double-negative populations were also present. These findings suggest that vimentin lacks Sertoli cell-specificity and that &#945;-SMA is not adequate to identify all of the contaminating cells. Upon FACS sorting; however, virtually 100% of the cells were tdTomato positive, expressed vimentin, but not &#945;-SMA. Prepubertal mice yielded a higher number of Sertoli cells compared to adults, but both could be adequately sorted.

Given the major implications for the field and for World Health Organization (WHO) member states, it is important to examine the impact of these new categories during the early phase of the ICD-11 implementation. This paper focuses on four disorders: complex post-traumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder, gaming disorder, and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. These categories were selected because they have been the focus of considerable activity and/or controversy and because their inclusion in the ICD-11 represents a different decision than was made for the DSM-5. The lead authors invited experts on each of these disorders to provide insight into why it was considered important to add it to the ICD-11, implications for care of not having that diagnostic category, important controversies about adding the disorder, and a review of the evidence generated and other developments related to the category since the WHO signaled its intention to include it in the ICD-11. Each of the four diagnostic categories appears to describe a population with clinically important and distinctive features that had previously gone unrecognized as well as specific treatment needs that would otherwise likely go unmet. The introduction of these categories in the ICD-11 has been followed by a substantial expansion of research in each area, which has generally supported their validity and utility, and by a significant increase in the availability of appropriate services.","output":"Emerging experience with selected new categories in the ICD-11: complex PTSD, prolonged grief disorder, gaming disorder, and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined how mood states affect nursing students' performance on a treatment procedure consisting of a novel combination of familiar clinical steps.

Further functional characterizations suggest that specific interactions between the nsp8(I) and nsp7, together with the rearrangement of nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface, ensure the efficient and processive RNA synthesis by the RdRp complex. Our findings provide a mechanistic insight into how nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors regulate the polymerase activity of nsp12 and suggest a potential new intervention interface, in addition to the canonical polymerase active center, in RdRp for antiviral design. Author summary Since it was first discovered and reported in late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus is wreaking havoc around the world. Currently, no highly effective and specific antiviral drug is available for clinical treatment. Therefore, the threat of COVID-19 transmission necessitates the discovery of more effective antiviral strategies. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important antiviral drug target. Here, our cryo-EM structure of a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/RNA replicating complex reveals a previously uncharacterized overall shift of the cofactor nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface, leading to its rearrangement. Through in vitro functional test, we found that the specific interactions on the interface are important to the efficient RNA polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. These observations let us to suggest this interface as a potential new drug intervention site, outside of the canonical polymerase active center, in RdRp for antiviral design. Our findings would provide new insights into regulatory mechanism of this novel SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, contribute to the design of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, and benefit the global public health.","output":"A dynamic regulatory interface on SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To clarify the association between serum vitamin D levels and its receptor polymorphisms with glaucoma risk. METHODS A meta-analysis was performed from available studies investigating serum vitamin D levels and vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms in glaucoma patients and controls. RESULTS Twelve studies in total, including 130,676 and 476 subjects, were analysed for the association between serum vitamin D levels and VDR polymorphisms with glaucoma, respectively. Collectively, it was found that glaucoma patients have lower levels of vitamin D compared to controls (SMD=-1.16, 95% CI=-1.56--0.76, P<0.00001). In parallel, the pooled results showed a significant association between glaucoma and allelic (b vs. B, OR=1.84, 95% CI=1.37-2.46, P=0.00001) and recessive (bb vs. Bb+BB, OR=3.16, 95% CI=1.30-7.66, P=0.001) models of VDR BsmI (rs1544410) polymorphism, but not with VDR TaqI (rs731236) or FokI (rs2228570) polymorphisms. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis suggests that patients with glaucoma may have vitamin D deficiency. In addition, the vitamin D signalling cascade may be a contributing factor in developing glaucoma, which is supported by the evidence that b allele carriers of VDR BsmI exhibited an increase in the risk of glaucoma. Thus, dietary supplementation of vitamin D may become an important approach as an additional treatment for glaucoma.","output":"Vitamin D and its receptor polymorphisms are associated with glaucoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Several comments and recommendations called to embed better the patients and public voice in healthcare policymaking. Still, no studies captured patients bottom-up perspectives regarding healthcare at the time of COVID-19 at a micro-level in a range of different countries. We, therefore, explored the perspectives of patient representatives in all six World Health Organisation (WHO) regions and extracted suggestions for care redesign after the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with patient representatives until saturation. Thematic analysis followed a modified form of meaning condensation. We established rigour by transcript checking, inter-coder agreement, quote variation and standardised reporting. RESULTS: Disadvantaged people experienced an unprecedented inequity in healthcare from limited access to physical violence. The narratives revealed the extent of this inequity, but also opportunities for health workers to act and improve. Stigmatisation from COVID-19 differed between cultures and countries and ranged from none to feeling ashamed and totally bashed. While experienced as indispensable in the future, patients refused telehealth when they were given bad news, such as having an eye removed because of melanoma, and in end-of-life care. Patient representatives redefined their role and became indispensable influencers throughout the pandemic and beyond. CONCLUSION: We reached out to patient representatives with diverse perspectives, including those who represent minorities and marginalised patient populations. Since preferences and personal meanings drive behaviour and could be foundations for targeted interventions, they must be considered in all groups of people to increase societys resilience as a whole. Future healthcare should tackle inequity, address stigmatisation and consider patients narratives to optimize telemedicine.","output":"Patient Representatives Perspectives on Healthcare at the Time of COVID-19 and Suggestions for Care Redesign After the Pandemic: A Qualitative Study in Twenty-Four Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Orienta na campanha para aes de combate ao Coronavrus (Covid-19) no municpio de Porto Nacional no Tocantins Apresenta quais as definies de casos de infeco humana pelo COVID-19 Orientaes de como notificar ao Centro de Informaes Estratgicas de Vigilancia em Sade (CIEVS) Quais os perodos de incubao da doen?a Fatores sobre a transmiss?o e tratamento Investigao epidemiolgica Quais atribuies da Vigilancia em Sade Orientaes para a coleta de amostras no Laboratrio Central de Sade Pblica do Tocantins (LACEN-TO) bem como a tcnica de coleta de Swabde nasofaringe e orofaringe (swabs combinados), o acondicionamento, transporte e envio das amostras Traz as recomendaes para a coleta de amostras em situao de bito Mostra as medidas de preveno e controle Precaues padr?o, as medidas de isolamento Transporte do paciente Como se d a Limpeza e desinfeco de superfcies He guides in the campaign for actions to fight the Coronavirus (Covid-19) in the municipality of Porto Nacional in Tocantins It presents the definitions of cases of human infection by COVID-19 Guidelines on how to notify the Health Surveillance Strategic Information Center (CIEVS) What are the disease incubation periods Factors about transmission and treatment Epidemiological investigation Which attributions of Health Surveillance Guidelines for the collection of samples at the Central Laboratory of Public Health of Tocantins (LACEN-TO) as well as the technique of collecting Swabde nasopharynx and oropharynx (combined swabs), packaging, transport and sending of samples It provides recommendations for the collection of samples in situations of death Shows prevention and control measures Standard precautions, isolation measures Transporting the patient How to clean and disinfect surfaces Orienta en la campa?a de acciones de combate al Coronavirus (Covid-19) en el municipio de Porto Nacional en Tocantins Presenta las definiciones de casos de infeccin humana por COVID-19 Directrices sobre cmo notificar al Centro de Informacin Estratgica de Vigilancia Sanitaria (CIEVS) Cules son los perodos de incubacin de la enfermedad Factores de transmisin y tratamiento Investigacin epidemiolgica Qu atribuciones de la Vigilancia Sanitaria Lineamientos para la recoleccin de muestras en el Laboratorio Central de Salud Pblica de Tocantins (LACEN-TO) as como la tcnica de recoleccin de Swabde nasofaringe y orofaringe (hisopos combinados), el empaque, transporte y envo de las muestras Proporciona recomendaciones para la recoleccin de muestras en situaciones de muerte Muestra medidas de prevencin y control Precauciones estndar, medidas de aislamiento Transporte del paciente Cmo limpiar y desinfectar superficies Il guide dans la campagne d&#039;actions de lutte contre le Coronavirus (Covid-19) dans la commune de Porto Nacional  Tocantins Il prsente les dfinitions des cas d&#039;infection humaine par COVID-19 Lignes directrices sur la notification du Centre d&#039;information stratgique de surveillance sanitaire (CIEVS) Quelles sont les priodes d&#039;incubation de la maladie Facteurs de transmission et de traitement Enqute pidmiologique Quelles attributions de Surveillance de la Sant Directives pour le prlvement d&#039;chantillons au Laboratoire Central de Sant Publique de Tocantins (LACEN-TO) ainsi que la technique de prlvement Swabde rhinopharynx et oropharynx (couvillons combins), emballage, transport et envoi des chantillons Il fournit des recommandations pour le prlvement d&#039;chantillons en cas de dcs Affiche les mesures de prvention et de contr?le Prcautions standard, mesures d&#039;isolement Transport du patient Comment nettoyer et dsinfecter les surfaces","output":"Plano de contingncia do municpio de Porto Nacional para infeco humana pelo novo coronavrus (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Published comparisons of the different available laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) devices focused on its economic cost and technical aspects. With this study, we aimed to objectively compare the use of three different LESS access devices in controlled experimental tasks. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty subjects participated in simulator trials. A cut and an intracorporeal suturing task were carried out. Three single access devices (SILS: SILS(TM) Port, GPN. GelPOINT Advanced Access Platform, and XCN: XCONE) were used according to a randomized nine-session schedule. Completion time was registered and performance objectively assessed with task-specific rating scales. Two blinded expert raters worked over video recordings of the hands-on sessions. RESULTS Participants showed improvement with all devices on total cut completion times and significantly for SILS (P = 0.017). The GPN decreased its adapted Global Rating Scale score (P = 0.002) from the first (W1) to the last week (W9). On the suture task, XCN constituted the device with longer completion times compared with SILS (P < 0.001) and to GPN (P < 0.001). There was significant improvement in times from W1 to W9 with XCN (P < 0.001), SILS (P = 0.003), and GPN (P < 0.001). On average summative score, we observed significant improvement in performance with all devices from W1 to W9 (SILS: P = 0.003; GPN: P = 0.001; and XCN: P < 0.001).

With the significant decline in the number of patients served since the start of the pandemic, the ITAWAG program aimed to bridge the physical distance between patients and clinicians after a set of eligibility criteria for teleconsultation or teletherapy and a step-by-step process used before, during, and after each virtual encounter. However, because many physical medicine and rehabilitation consultants, residents, and therapists were not trained for the virtual approach to patient care, a telerehabilitation curriculum was developed to help in providing quality and competent services.

Although Chinese officials announced in December 2014 that the country would completely cease using organs harvested from prisoners, no regulatory adjustments or changes in Chinas organ donation laws followed. As a result, the use of prisoner organs remains legal in China if consent is obtained. DISCUSSION: We have collected and analysed available evidence on human rights violations in the organ procurement practice in China. We demonstrate that the practice not only violates international ethics standards, it is also associated with a large scale neglect of fundamental human rights. This includes organ procurement without consent from prisoners or their families as well as procurement of organs from incompletely executed, still-living prisoners. The human rights critique of these practices will also address the specific situatedness of prisoners, often conditioned and traumatized by a cascade of human rights abuses in judicial structures. CONCLUSION: To end the unethical practice and the abuse associated with it, we suggest to inextricably bind the use of human organs procured in the Chinese transplant system to enacting Chinese legislation prohibiting the use of organs from executed prisoners and making explicit rules for law enforcement. Other than that, the international community must cease to abet the continuation of the present system by demanding an authoritative ban on the use of organs from executed Chinese prisoners.

Sensors of the unfolded protein response (UPR) monitor the unfolded protein load in the ER and convey effector functions for maintaining ER homeostasis. Aberrant compositions of the ER membrane, referred to as lipid bilayer stress, are equally potent activators of the UPR. How the distinct signals from lipid bilayer stress and unfolded proteins are processed by the conserved UPR transducer Ire1 remains unknown. Here, we have generated a functional, cysteine-less variant of Ire1 and performed systematic cysteine cross-linking experiments in native membranes to establish its transmembrane architecture in signaling-active clusters. We show that the transmembrane helices of two neighboring Ire1 molecules adopt an X-shaped configuration independent of the primary cause for ER stress. This suggests that different forms of stress converge in a common, signaling-active transmembrane architecture of Ire1.","output":"Cysteine cross-linking in native membranes establishes the transmembrane architecture of Ire1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US has recentlyand belatedlycome to recognize opioid addiction as a public health crisis. What has gone mostly unrecognized is the degree to which this crisis is intertwined with US intellectual property law and related elements of US innovation policy. Innovation institutionsthe legal arrangements that structure incentives for production and allocation of knowledge goodsencouraged the development and commercialization of addictive painkillers, restricted access to opioid antidotes, and (perhaps most importantly) failed to facilitate investments in alternative, nonaddictive treatments for chronic pain.

Transplantation is fortunate to have large data sets upon which machine learning algorithms can be constructed.

RECENT FINDINGS: Changes in patient and donor characteristics warrant new approaches to listing and organ acceptance practices. Machine learning has been employed to optimize donor selection to identify patients likely to benefit from transplantation of higher risk organs, increasing organ discard and reducing waitlist mortality. These models have greater precisions and predictive ability than currently employed metrics including the Kidney Donor Profile Index and the expected posttransplant survival models. After transplant, AI tools have been developed to optimize immunosuppression management, track patients adherence, and assess graft survival.

The current healthcare system around the world faces the potential problem of lacking resources to assist a large number of patients at the same time; then, the non-critical patients are mostly referred to perform self-isolation/quarantine at home. This pandemic has placed new demands on the health systems world, asking for novel, rapid and secure ways to monitor patients in order to detect and quickly report patient's symptoms to the healthcare provider, even if they are not in the hospital. While tremendous efforts have been done to develop technologies to detect the virus, create the vaccine, and stop the spread of the disease, it is also important to develop IoT technologies that can help track and monitor diagnosed COVID-19 patients from their homes.

The purpose of this study was (1) to set a passing score through a psychometrically sound process and (2) to determine what pretest factors predicted passing the FUSE examination. METHODS Beta-testing of multiple-choice questions on 62 topics of importance to the safe use of surgical energy-based devices was performed. Eligible test takers were physicians with a minimum of 1 year of surgical training who were recruited by FUSE task force members. A pretest survey collected baseline information. RESULTS A total of 227 individuals completed the FUSE beta-test, and 208 completed the pretest survey. The passing/cut score for the first test form of the FUSE multiple-choice examination was determined using the modified Angoff methodology and for the second test form was determined using a linear equating methodology. The overall passing rate across the two examination forms was 81.5%. Self-reported time studying the FUSE Web-based curriculum for a minimum of >2 h was associated with a passing examination score (p < 0.001). Performance was not different based on increased years of surgical practice (p = 0.363), self-reported expertise on one or more types of energy-based devices (p = 0.683), participation in the FUSE postgraduate course (p = 0.426), or having reviewed the FUSE manual (p = 0.428). Logistic regression found that studying the FUSE didactics for >2 h predicted a passing score (OR 3.61; 95% CI 1.44-9.05; p = 0.006) independent of the other baseline characteristics recorded.

This included stay-at-home orders that prevented people from leaving their homes for work or study, except for urgent medical care or buying essential items. This practice could have both short and long-term implications for health and wellbeing of people in the UK. Using longitudinal data of 10,630 UK adults, this study prospectively examined the association between home confinement status during the stringent lockdown in the UK (March 23-May 13, 2020) and 20 indicators of subjective well-being, social well-being, pro-social/altruistic behaviors, psychological distress, and health behaviors assessed approximately one month after the stringent lockdown ended. All analyses adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics and social isolation status in the beginning of the pandemic. Home confinement during the lockdown was associated with greater subsequent compliance with COVID-19 rules, more perceived major stressors, and a lower prevalence of physical activity. There was modest evidence of associations with lower life satisfaction, greater loneliness, greater depressive symptoms, greater anxiety symptoms, and more perceived minor stressors post-lockdown.

Exploring these indirect impacts in the context of a socially deprived UK coastal town will help identify priority areas to focus COVID-19 recovery efforts on. MethodsData on primary care diagnosis, hospital admissions, and several socioeconomic outcomes between 2016 and Spring 2021 in the UK town of Fleetwood were collected and analysed in an exploratory analysis looking at pre- and post-COVID-19 patterns in health and social outcomes. Weekly and monthly trends were plotted by time and differences between periods examined using Chi-squared and t-tests. ResultsInitial falls in hospital admissions and diagnoses of conditions in primary care in March 2020 were followed by sustained changes to health service activity for specific diagnostic and demographic groups, including for chronic kidney disease and young people. Increases in the number of people receiving Universal Credit and children eligible for free school meals appear to be greater for those in the least deprived areas of the town.

This compound is a carboxylic polyether ionophore that exchanges monovalent ions for protons across lipid bilayer membranes. Monitoring the time course of viral infection showed that salinomycin blocked nuclear migration of viral nuclear protein (NP), the most abundant component of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. It caused cytoplasmic accumulation of NP, particularly within perinuclear endosomes, during virus entry. This was primarily associated with failure to acidify the endosomal-lysosomal compartments. Similar to the case with amantadine (AMT), proton channel activity of viral matrix protein 2 (M2) was blocked by salinomycin. Using purified retroviral Gag-based virus-like particles (VLPs) with M2, it was proved that salinomycin directly affects the kinetics of a proton influx into the particles but in a manner different from that of AMT. Notably, oral administration of salinomycin together with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir phosphate (OSV-P) led to enhanced antiviral effect over that with either compound used alone in influenza A virus-infected mouse models. These results provide a new paradigm for developing antivirals and their combination therapy that control both host and viral factors.IMPORTANCE Influenza virus is a main cause of viral respiratory infection in humans as well as animals, occasionally with high mortality. Circulation of influenza viruses resistant to the matrix protein 2 (M2) inhibitor, amantadine, is highly prevalent. Moreover, the frequency of detection of viruses resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir phosphate (OSV-P) or zanamivir, is also increasing. These issues highlight the need for discovery of new antiviral agents with different mechanisms. Salinomycin as the monovalent cation-proton antiporter exhibited consistent inhibitory effects against influenza A and B viruses. It plays multifunctional roles by blocking endosomal acidification and by inactivating the proton transport function of M2, the key steps for influenza virus uncoating. Notably, salinomycin resulted in marked therapeutic effects in influenza virus-infected mice when combined with OSV-P, suggesting that its chemical derivatives could be developed as an adjuvant antiviral therapy to treat influenza infections resistant or less sensitive to existing drugs.","output":"Salinomycin Inhibits Influenza Virus Infection by Disrupting Endosomal Acidification and Viral Matrix Protein 2 Function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The emergence and rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have revealed the limitations in current healthcare systems to handle patient records securely and transparently, and novel protocols are required to address these shortcomings. An attractive option is the use of Ethereum smart contracts to secure the storage of medical records and concomitant data logs. Ethereum is an open-source platform that can be used to construct smart contracts, which are collections of code that allow transactions under certain parameters and are self-executable. Methods The present study developed a proof-of-concept smart contract that stores COVID-19 patient data such as the patient identifier (ID), variant, chest CT grade, and significant comorbidities. A sample, fictitious patient data for the purpose of testing was configured to a private network. A smart contract was created in the Ethereum state and tested by measuring the time to insert and query patient data. Results Testing with a private, Proof of Authority (PoA) network required only 191 milliseconds and 890 MB of memory per insertion to insert 50 records while inserting 350 records required 674 milliseconds and similar memory per insertion, as memory per insertion was nearly constant with the increasing number of records inserted. Retrieving required 912 MB for a query involving all three fields and no wildcards in a 350-record database. Only 883 MB was needed to procure a similar observation from a 50-record database.

This study aimed to estimate the ICS dose-response relationship for oral corticosteroid sparing effects in oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma, and to determine the proportion of oral corticosteroid sparing effect due to their systemic effects, based on the comparative dose-response relationship of ICS versus oral corticosteroids on adrenal suppression. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials reporting oral corticosteroid sparing effects of high dose ICS in oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Reports of oral corticosteroid to ICS dose-equivalence in terms of adrenal suppression were additionally retrieved. The primary outcome was the proportion of the oral corticosteroid sparing effect of ICS that could be attributed to systemic absorption, per 1000 g increase of ICS, expressed as a ratio. This ratio estimates the oral corticosteroid sparing effect of ICS due to systemic effects. RESULTS Eleven studies including 1283 participants reporting oral corticosteroid sparing effects of ICS were identified. The prednisone dose decrease per 1000 g increase in ICS varied from 2.1 mg to 4.9 mg, depending on the type of ICS. The ratio of the prednisone sparing effect due to the systemic effects per 1000 g of fluticasone propionate was 1.02 (95% CI 0.68-2.08) and for budesonide was 0.93 (95% CI 0.63-1.89).

Moreover, lots of research is going on to find out effective vaccines or medicine, but still, no potent vaccine or drug is discovered to cure COVID-19. As a consequence, many types of research have designated that computer-based studies, such as protein-ligand interactions, structural dynamics, and chembio modeling are the finest choice due to its low cost and time-saving features. Here, oxindole derivatives have been chosen for docking because of their immense pharmacological applications like antiviral, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and so on.

METHODS The process of docking, interaction, and binding the structure of ligand with protein has executed using Molegro Virtual Docker v.7.0.0 (MVD) and visualized the usage by Molegro Molecular Viewer v.7.0.0 (MMV). RESULTS Among the 30 derivatives, the outcomes depicted better steric interaction and hydrogen bonding amongst OD-22 ligand, OD-16 ligand, OD-4 ligand, and OD-9 ligand (oxindole derivatives) with COVID-19. In addition to this, the comparative study of these four compounds with existing drugs that are under clinical trials shows comparatively good results in terms of its MolDock scores, H-bonding and steric interactions.

Therefore, binding to the enzyme may interfere the enzyme function. Before, we found that sulfated polysaccharide binding to 3CLpro might block the virus replication. Hence, we hypothesize that negative charged pectin glycan may also impede the virus replication. Here we show that 922 crude polysaccharide from Syzygium aromaticum may near completely block SARS-CoV-2 replication. The inhibition rate was 99.9% (EC50 : 0.90 M). Interestingly, 922 can associates with 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp. We further show that the homogeneous glycan 922211 from 922 may specifically attenuate 3CL protease activity. The IC50s of 922 and 922211 against 3CLpro are 4.73 {+/-} 1.05 {micro}M and 0.18 {+/-} 0.01 {micro}M, respectively.

Nevertheless, specialised mental health care may be required for specific patients. Notably, the accessibility of mental health specialist care is mainly complicated by (a) long waiting times for an appointment with specialists, (b) long travel distances to specialists, particularly in rural and remote areas, and (c) patients reservations about mental health specialist care (including fear of being stigmatised by seeking such care). To mitigate those barriers, technology-based integrated care models have been proposed. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a mental health specialist video consultations model versus treatment as usual in patients with depression or anxiety disorders in primary care. METHODS: In an individually randomised, prospective, two-arm superiority trial with parallel group design, N = 320 patients with anxiety and/or depressive disorder will be recruited in general practices in Germany. The intervention includes a newly developed treatment model based on video consultations with focus on diagnostics, treatment planning, and short-term intervention by mental health specialists. We will systematically compare the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and adverse effects of this new model with usual care by the GP: the primary outcome is the absolute change in the mean depressive and anxiety symptom severity measured on the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS) from baseline to 6 months after baseline assessment. Follow-up in both groups will be conducted by blinded outcome assessors at 6 months and 12 months after baseline. The main analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. We will optimise the likelihood of treatment effectiveness by strict inclusion criteria for patients, enhanced intervention integrity, and conducting a process evaluation.

We first designed a deep learning model, named DeepCas13, to predict the on-target activity of a gRNA with high accuracy from its sequence and secondary structure. DeepCas13 outperforms existing methods and accurately predicts the efficiency of guides targeting both protein-coding and non-coding RNAs (e.g., circRNAs and lncRNAs). Next, we systematically studied guides targeting non-essential genes, and found that the off-target viability effect, defined as the unintended effect of guides on cell viability, is closely related to their on-target RNA cleavage efficiency. This finding suggests that these gRNAs should be used as negative controls in proliferation screens to reduce false positives, possibly coming from the unwanted off-target viability effect of efficient guides. Finally, we applied these models to our screens that included guides targeting 234 lncRNAs, and identified lncRNAs that affect cell viability and proliferation in multiple cell lines.

Results The number of subjects in the 2020 cohort (n = 212) was 4.2% higher than the 2019 cohort (n = 203). Volume decreased 24.5% during the initial phase of the pandemic with a 36.1% increase in volume occurring during the reopening phase (P = .003). Volume related to interpersonal decreased 52.4% during the initial phase of the pandemic with a rebound increase of 30% during reopening (P = .005). Conclusion The first case of COVID-19 presented in Nashville, Tennessee in early March 2020. Over the next 6 months, periods of lockdown and reopening transpired. The volume of maxillofacial trauma decreased during the initial 3-months of the pandemic and rebounded to volumes greater than the year prior.","output":"Maxillofacial Trauma and COVID-19: A Review of the First 6 Months of the Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this column, we will share the results of our analysis of stakeholders' usage of the library's services and collections during three phases: pre-pandemic, the start of the pandemic, and during the pandemic.

Using a high-density transposon screen in the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, we find that the bacterium requires amino acid biosynthesis pathways to colonize conventionally raised mice, but not germ-free or antibiotic-treated animals. These metabolic pathways are induced during infection by the presence of the gut microbiota. Reduced amounts of amino acids are found in the guts of conventionally raised mice compared with germ-free animals. Dietary administration of high protein increases amino acid levels in the gut and promotes pathogen colonization. Thus, the depletion of amino acids by the microbiota limits pathogen colonization, and in turn, the pathogen activates amino acid biosynthesis to expand in the presence of the microbiota.","output":"An Enteric Pathogen Subverts Colonization Resistance by Evading Competition for Amino Acids in the Gut"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 crisis, the governmental restrictions seriously affected the daily lives of adolescents (aged 12C25).

Italy was the first of many other western countries to implement extended containment measures. Health workers and others employed in essential sectors have continued their activity, reporting high infection rate with many fatalities. The epidemiological trend highlighted the importance of work as a substantial factor to consider both when implementing strategies aimed at containing the pandemic and shaping the lockdown mitigation strategy required for sustained economic recovery. To support the decision-making process, we have developed a strategy to predict the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace based on the analysis of the working process and proximity between employees; risk of infection connected to the type of activity; involvement of third parties in the working processes and risk of social aggregation. We applied this approach to outline a risk index for each economic activity sector, with different levels of detail, also considering the impact on mobility of the working population. This method was implemented into the national epidemiological surveillance model in order to estimate the impact of re-activation of specific activities on the reproduction number. It has also been adopted by the national scientific committee set up by the Italian Government for action-oriented policy advice on the COVID-19 emergency in the post lockdown phase. This approach may play a key role for public health if associated with measures for risk mitigation in enterprises through strategies of business process re-engineering. Furthermore, it will make a contribution to reconsidering the organization of work, including also innovation and fostering the integration with the national occupational safety and health (OSH) system.","output":"Risk assessment at work and prevention strategies on COVID-19 in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of simulators has been described in a variety of fields as a training tool to gain technical skills through repeating and rehearsing procedures in a safe environment.

The use of simulation in neurointervention to acquire and enhance skills before treating a patient is a newer concept, but its utilization has been limited due to the lack of good models and deficient haptics. The advent of 3D printing technology and the development of new training models has changed this landscape. The prevalence of aneurysms in the pediatric population is much lower than in adults, and concepts and tools sometimes have to be adapted from one population to another. Neuroendovascular rehearsal is a valid strategy for the treatment of complex aneurysms, especially for the pediatric population.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with clinical suspicion of mild to moderate respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 who were treated at an outpatient clinic. Patients were randomly recruited to take 10 days of TDF (300 mg/day), TDF (300 mg/day) combined with FTC (200 mg/day) or placebo Vitamin C (500 mg/day). The primary parameter was the score of symptoms and predictive signs of COVID-19, assessed on the seventh day of patient follow-up. From a total of 309 patients with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2, 227 met the inclusion criteria and were randomly distributed into the following groups: (a) 75 (one did not initiate treatment) in the TDF group; (b) 74 in the TDF combined with FTC group; and (c) 77 in the Vitamin C group (placebo). Of the 226 patients, 139 (62%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Fever (37.8oC), ageusia or dysgeusia, anosmia or dysosmia, and two or more clinical symptoms or signs were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no significant change in clinical score based on clinical symptoms and signs between treatment groups. Patients with mild to moderate infection by SARS-CoV-2 had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IL-1{beta}, IL-6 and TNF- compared to patients without infection. Patients with mild to moderate respiratory infection, with fever (37.8oC), loss of smell, loss of taste and two or more symptoms, have a better prediction for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 showed higher and more persistent proinflammatory cytokines profile compared to patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Our aim was to determine whether intrabolus pressure (IBP) can identify structural EGJ processes when IRP is normal. In this observational cohort study, adult patients with dysphagia and undergoing HRM were evaluated for endoscopic evidence of structural EGJ processes (strictures, rings, hiatus hernia) in the setting of normal IRP. HRM metrics [IRP, distal contractile integral (DCI), distal latency (DL), IBP, and EGJ contractile integral (EGJ-CI)] were compared among 74 patients with structural EGJ findings (62.8  1.6 yr, 67.6% women), 27 patients with normal EGD (52.9  3.2 yr, 70.3% women), and 21 healthy controls (27.6  0.6 yr, 52.4% women). Findings were validated in 85 consecutive symptomatic patients to address clinical utility. In the primary cohort, mean IBP (18.4  0.9 mmHg) was higher with structural EGJ findings compared with dysphagia with normal EGD (13.5  1.1 mmHg, P = 0.002) and healthy controls (10.9  0.9 mmHg, P < 0.001). However, mean IRP, DCI, DL, and EGJ-CI were similar across groups (P > 0.05 for each comparison). During multiple rapid swallows, IBP remained higher in the structural findings group compared with controls (P = 0.02). Similar analysis of the prospective validation cohort confirmed IBP elevation in structural EGJ processes, but correlation with dysphagia could not be demonstrated. We conclude that elevated IBP predicts the presence of structural EGJ processes even when IRP is normal, but correlation with dysphagia is suboptimal.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) above the upper limit of normal defines esophageal outflow obstruction using high-resolution manometry. In patients with normal IRP, elevated intrabolus pressure (IBP) can be a surrogate marker for a structural restrictive or obstructive process at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). This has the potential to augment the clinical value of esophageal HRM by raising suspicion for a structural EGJ process when IBP is elevated.","output":"Elevated intrabolus pressure identifies obstructive processes when integrated relaxation pressure is normal on esophageal high-resolution manometry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Murine coronavirus MHV-A59 normally infects only murine cells in vitro and causes transmissible infection only in mice. In the 17 C1 1 line of murine cells, the receptor for MHV-A59 is MHVR, a biliary glycoprotein in the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family of glycoproteins. We found that virus released from the 600th passage of 17 C1 1 cells persistently infected with MHV-A59 (MHV/pi600) replicated in hamster (BHK-21) cells. The virus was passaged and plaque-purified in BHK-21 cells, yielding the MHV/BHK strain. Because murine cells persistently infected with MHV-A59 express a markedly reduced level of MHVR (Sawicki, et al., 1995), we tested whether virus with altered receptor interactions was selected in the persistently infected culture. Infection of 17 C1 1 cells by MHV-A59 can be blocked by treating the cells with anti-MHVR MAb-CC1, while infection by MHV/BHK was only partially blocked by MAb-CC1. MHV/BHK virus was also more resistant than wild-type MHV-A59 to neutralization by purified, recombinant, soluble MHVR glycoprotein (sMHVR). Cells in the persistently infected culture may also express reduced levels of and have altered interactions with some of the Bgp-related glycoproteins that can serve as alternative receptors for MHV-A59. Unlike the parental MHV-A59 which only infects murine cells, MHV/BHK virus was able to infect cell lines derived from mice, hamsters, rats, cats, cows, monkeys and humans. However, MHV/BHK was not able to infect all mammalian species, because a pig (ST) cell line and a dog cell line (MDCK I) were not susceptible to infection. MHV/pi600 and MHV/BHK replicated in murine cells more slowly than MHV-A59 and formed smaller plaques. Thus, in the persistently infected murine cells which expressed a markedly reduced level of MHVR, virus variants were selected that have altered interactions with MHVR and an extended host range. In vivo, in mice infected with coronavirus, virus variants with altered receptor recognition and extended host range might be selected in tissues that have low levels of receptors. Depending upon the tissue in which such a virus variant was selected, it might be shed from the infected animal or eaten by a predator, thus presenting a possible means for initiating the transition of a variant virus into a new host as a model for an emerging virus disease.","output":"Selection in persistently infected murine cells of an MHV-A59 variant with extended host range."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pneumonia is a newly recognized lung infection. Initially, CT imaging was demonstrated to be one of the most sensitive tests for the detection of infection. Currently, with broader availability of polymerase chain reaction for disease diagnosis, CT is mainly used for the identification of complications and other defined clinical indications in hospitalized patients. Nonetheless, radiologists are interpreting lung imaging in unsuspected patients as well as in suspected patients with imaging obtained to rule out other relevant clinical indications. The knowledge of pathological findings is also crucial for imagers to better interpret various imaging findings. Identification of the imaging findings that are commonly seen with the disease is important to diagnose and suggest confirmatory testing in unsuspected cases. Proper precautionary measures will be important in such unsuspected patients to prevent further spread. In addition to understanding the imaging findings for the diagnosis of the disease, it is important to understand the growing set of tools provided by artificial intelligence. The goal of this review is to highlight common imaging findings using illustrative examples, describe the evolution of disease over time, discuss differences in imaging appearance of adult and pediatric patients and review the available literature on quantitative CT for COVID-19.

Imatinib Mesylate (IM) blocks Colony Stimulating Factor1 Receptor (CSF1R), the driver mechanism in TGCT. The aim of this study was to determine if IM reduces the tumour metabolic activity evaluated by PET-CT and to compare this response with the response seen on MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 25 Consecutive patients treated with IM (off label use) for locally advanced (N = 12) or recurrent (N = 13) diffuse-type TGCT were included, 15 male and median age at diagnosis 39 (IQR 31-47) years. The knee was most frequently affected (n = 16; 64%). The effect of IM was assessed pre- and post-IM treatment by comparing MR scans and PET-CT. MR scans were assessed by Tumour Volume Score (TVS), an estimation of the tumour volume as a percentage of the total synovial cavity. PET-CT scans were evaluated based on maximum standardized uptake value (SUV-max). Partial response was defined as more than 50% tumour reduction with TVS and a decrease of at least 30% on SUV-max. RESULTS: Median duration of IM treatment was 7.0 (IQR 4.2-11.5) months. Twenty patients (80%) discontinued IM treatment for poor response or intended surgery. Twenty patients experienced an adverse event grade 1-2, three patients grade 3 (creatinine increment, neutropenic sepsis, liver dysfunction). MR assessment of all joints showed 32% (6/19) partial response and 63% (12/19) stable disease, with a mean difference of 12% (P = 0.467; CI -22.4-46.0) TVS between pre- and post-IM and a significant mean difference of 23% (P = 0.021; CI 4.2-21.6) in all knee lesions. PET-CT, all joints, showed a significantly decreased mean difference of 5.3 (P = 0.004; CI 1.9-8.7) SUV-max between pre- and post-IM treatment (58% (11/19) partial response, 37% (7/19) stable disease). No correlation between MR imaging and PET-CT could be appreciated in 15 patients with complete radiological data. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the moderate radiological response of IM in diffuse-type TGCT. PET-CT is a valuable additional diagnostic tool to quantify response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Its value should be assessed further to validate its efficacy in the objective measurement of biological response in targeted systemic treatment of TGCT.","output":"The effect of Imatinib Mesylate in diffuse-type Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumours on MR imaging and PET-CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innovative technologies offer potential benefits for the health and care needs of an ageing population, but the processes by which these innovations are developed and implemented are not well understood.

Flow diversion represents a feasible treatment, but no consensus exists as to which stent deployment technique is more suitable. METHODS All patients with ACoA aneurysms treated with flow diverters between April 2014 and November 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Aneurysm characteristics, follow-up results, and clinical outcome data were recorded, and a new classification comparing the diameters of both A1 segments is proposed: H1=same diameters; H2=<50% difference in diameters; H3= 50% difference; and Y=no A1 segment. RESULTS We analyzed 30 procedures in 30 patients with ACoA aneurysms, including 16 ruptured aneurysms treated with coiling embolization and 4 previously unruptured aneurysms (two Medina and two Woven EndoBridge devices). Adequate aneurysm occlusion occurred in 86.9%; one patient (3.3%) experienced symptomatic ischemic stroke. The global thromboembolic complications for each group were 17.6% (H1), 25% (H2), and 60% (H3). CONCLUSION Flow diversion treatment in this region is safe, feasible, and effective. The most suitable anatomical configuration for flow diverter treatment seems to be the H1 configuration where the 'I technique' is suitable (from an A1 segment to the ipsilateral A2). There is a tendency that the H3 configuration is not a good indication for flow diverter treatment. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility of this anatomical classification and the reproducibility of our findings.","output":"Flow diversion treatment of aneurysms of the complex region of the anterior communicating artery: which stent placement strategy should 'I' use?

These systems have been associated with diverse physiological functions, but also with inflammation, fibrosis and target-organ damage. Pharmacological modulation of the RAAS has brought about important advances in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Yet, traditional RAAS blockers such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) only reduce the risk of disease progression in patients with established cardiovascular or renal disease by 20% compared with other therapies.

This study aimed to incorporate TiO(2)-anatase into PLA for use as a photocatalyst using the blown film method. Photocatalytic oxidation, an advanced oxidative process, has been recognized as an economical technique providing convenience and efficiency with indoor air treatment. Therefore, the use of new environmentally friendly biodegradable polymers provides an alternative way to address the severe environmental concerns caused by non-decomposable plastics. UVCvis spectrophotometry and scanning electron microscopyCenergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEMCEDX) were used to observe the dispersibility and mixing capacity of the TiO(2)-anatase PLA matrix. TiO(2) dosages were 5, 10, and 15% (wt/wt), and they were incorporated with a twin-screw extruder. SEMCEDX images demonstrated the homogeneity of TiO(2) distribution in the PLA matrix. The energy band gaps of TiO(2) in the PLA/TiO(2)-composite films were between 3.14 and 3.22 eV. The relationship between the photocatalytic oxidation rate and the TiO(2) dosage in the PLA/TiO(2)-composite films was determined. A prototype reactor model is geared toward the development of air purifiers for indoor air conditioning.

Wearing a mask is the most effective way to prevent infections. However, some Malaysians refuse to wear a face mask for a variety of reasons. This work proposes a real-time face and face mask detection method using image processing technique to promote wearing face mask. Haar Cascade is used for the face detection to extract the features of the human faces as a method of approach. On the other hand, the face mask detection utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN) to train a model using the MobileNetV2 training model designed using Python, Keras and Tensorflow. OpenCV package was used as the interface for the algorithms to be connected to a web camera. Based on the performance metric calculation of detection rate analysis of the experimental results, the face detection rate is at 90% true and 10% false detection, which shows very good detection rate. Furthermore, the training accuracy and validation accuracy for the face mask detector are efficiently near to 1.0, proving a steady accuracy over the time.

Four experiments were conducted to: 1) determine if medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are effective mitigants when applied to feed both pre- and post-porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) inoculation measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), 2) evaluate varying levels and combinations of MCFA measured by qRT-PCR, and 3) evaluate selected treatments in bioassay to determine infectivity. In exp. 1, treatments were arranged in a 2  2 + 1 factorial with main effects of treatment (0.3% commercial formaldehyde [CF] product, Sal CURB [Kemin Industries, Inc.; Des Moines, IA], or 1% MCFA blend (Blend) of 1:1:1 C6:C8:C10 [PMI, Arden Hills, MN]) and timing of application (pre- or post-inoculation with PEDV) plus a positive control (PC; feed inoculated with PEDV and no treatment). All combinations of treatment and timing decreased detectable PEDV compared with the PC (P < 0.05). Pre-inoculation treatment elicited decreased magnitude of PEDV detection (cycle threshold value) compared with post-inoculation (P = 0.009). Magnitude of PEDV detection was decreased for CF compared with Blend (P < 0.0001).

In exp. 4, feed was treated pre-inoculation with: 1) no treatment (PC), 2) 0.3% CF, 3) 0.5% Blend, or 4) 0.3% C8:0 and analyzed via qRT-PCR and bioassay. Adding 0.5% Blend or 0.3% C8:0 resulted in decreased PEDV compared with PC and only PC resulted in a positive bioassay. Therefore, MCFA can decrease detection of PEDV in feed.

METHOD: We performed a systemic literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC and Cochrane library. Keywords used for searching included medical student, online education, online teaching, online learning, distance learning, electronic learning, virtual learning and surgical. Medical education research study quality instrument (MERSQI) was used for the evaluation of the quality of the searched articles. RESULTS: From 1240 studies retrieved from the databases, 13 articles were included in this study after screening. The publication year was from 2007 to 2021. The mean MERSQI score of the 13 searched articles was 12.5 +/? 1.7 (range 10.0-14.5). There were totally 2023 medical students who attended online surgical curriculum. By online course, improvement of understanding and knowledge on the studied topics could be reached. The confidence in patient encounters could be improved by online curriculum with sharing experiences, discussing, and role playing. However, students felt concentration was poor during online course. Medical students studying through video platform could get better test scores than those studying with textbooks. Regarding basic surgical skills, online teaching of suturing and knot-tying could be possible and was appreciated by the students who could practice away from the hospital and get feedbacks by instructors through online environment. The scores for the clinical competence assessment for incision, suturing and knot-tying were found to be no significant difference between the online teaching group and face-to-face teaching group.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) has shown to be beneficial in patients in hemorrhagic shock, although widespread adoption might result in incorrect TXA administration leading to increased morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A 7-year prospective cohort study with consecutive trauma patients admitted to a Level-1 Trauma Center ICU was performed to investigate administration of both pre- and in-hospital TXA and its relation to morbidity and mortality. Indication for prehospital and in-hospital TXA administration was (suspicion of) hemorrhagic shock, and/or systolic blood pressure (SBP)  90 mmHg. Demographics, data on physiology, resuscitation and outcomes were prospectively collected. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-two patients (71% males, median ISS 29, 95% blunt injuries) were included. Even though TXA patients were more severely injured with more deranged physiology, no differences in outcome were noted. Overall, thrombo-embolic complication rate was 8%. In half the patients, hemorrhagic shock was the indication for prehospital TXA, whereas 79% of in-hospital TXA was given based on suspicion of hemorrhagic shock. Thirteen percent of patients with SBP  90 mmHg in ED received no TXA at all. Based on SBP alone, 22% of prehospital TXA and 25% of in-hospital TXA were justified. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being more severely injured, TXA patients had similar outcome compared to patients without TXA. Thrombo-embolic complication rate was low despite liberal use of both prehospital and in-hospital TXA. Caution should be exercised in selecting patients for TXA, although this might be challenging based on SBP alone in patients who do not yet show signs of deranged physiology on arrival in ED.

In this article we propose a novel increasing shrinkage prior, called the cumulative shrinkage process, for the parameters that control the dimension in overcomplete formulations. Our construction has broad applicability and is based on an interpretable sequence of spike-and-slab distributions which assign increasing mass to the spike as the model complexity grows. Using factor analysis as an illustrative example, we show that this formulation has theoretical and practical advantages relative to current competitors, including an improved ability to recover the model dimension.

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to test the scale's psychometric properties using Rasch analysis and modify the scale based on analysis findings, emerging information on essential PCS symptoms, and feedback from a working group of patients and professionals. METHODS Data from 370 PCS patients were assessed using a Rasch Measurement Theory framework to test model fit, local dependency, response category functioning, differential item functioning, targeting, reliability, and unidimensionality. The working group undertook iterative changes to the scale based on the psychometric results and including essential symptoms. RESULTS Symptom severity and functional disability subscales showed good targeting and reliability. Post hoc rescoring suggested that a 4-point response category structure would be more appropriate than an 11-point response for both subscales.

A study of ICU HCW from France revealed symptoms of anxiety and depression in 50.4% and 30.4% of workers at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. The level of COVID-19 exposure of these ICU HCW was very high. In Canada, ICU HCW experienced variable exposure to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, with some hospitals seeing large numbers of patients while others saw few or none. In this study we examined the relationship between COVID-19 exposure and mental health in Canadian ICU HCW. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of Canadian ICU HCW in April 2020, during the acceleration phase of the first wave of the pandemic. Psychosocial distress was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Participants were asked about sources of stress as well as about exposure to COVID-19 patients and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Factors associated with clinically-relevant psychosocial distress were identified. Responses were received from 310 Canadian ICU HCW affiliated with more than 30 institutions. Of these, 64.5% scored  3 points on the GHQ-12 questionnaire, indicating clinically-relevant psychosocial distress. The frequency of psychosocial distress was highest amongst registered nurses (75.7%) and lowest amongst physicians (49.4%). It was also higher amongst females (64.9%) than males (47.6%). Although PPE availability was good (> 80% of participants reported adequate availability), there was significant anxiety with respect to PPE availability, with respect to the risk of being infected with COVID-19, and with respect to the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to others. In multivariable regression analysis, Anxiety with respect to being infected with COVID-19 (OR 1.53, CI 1.31C1.81) was the strongest positive predictor of clinically-relevant psychosocial distress while the Number of shifts with COVID-19 exposure (OR 0.86, CI 0.75C0.95) was the strongest negative predictor. In summary, clinically-relevant psychosocial distress was identified amongst a majority of ICU HCW during the acceleration phase of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those with minimal or no exposure to COVID-19.

RESULTS: This meta-analysis included eight RCTs which enrolled a total of 6314 patients for randomization, in which 3267 and 3047 patients were assigned to the tocilizumab and control groups, respectively. The mortality at day 28 was 24.4% and 29.9% in patients in the tocilizumab and control groups, respectively, meaning there was no significant difference observed between these two groups (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.66-1.28; I2 = 62). This finding did not change in the subgroup analysis according to the initial use of MV or steroid while enrollment. The patients receiving tocilizumab had a lower rate of mechanical ventilation (MV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission at day 28 compared with the control group (MV use: OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.90; I2 = 11; ICU admission: OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.92; I2 = 30). There were no significant differences between these two treatment groups in terms of the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.71-1.49; I2 = 43), serious AEs (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67-1.12; I2 = 0) or infection (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.63-1.20; I2 = 0). CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab does not provide a survival benefit for patients with COVID-19, but it may help reduce the risk of MV and ICU admission. In addition, tocilizumab is a safe agent to use for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"The effect of tocilizumab on COVID-19 patient mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has spread to Bangladesh since early March of 2020, and people are getting daily updates from the social and electronic media. We aimed at assessing the prevalence of anxiety among Bangladeshi people during the pandemic in connection with social media exposure (SME) and electronic media exposure (EME). For this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 880 participants by a self-administered online-based questionnaire relating personal characteristics, self-rate health (SRH), SME, and EME with anxiety. Findings show that around half of the surveyed population experienced a spike of anxiety (49.1%) during the pandemic, ten times higher than the national anxiety rate in 2019. The participants with an increased SME of over four hours per day experienced a higher level of anxiety than individuals with < = 2 hours exposure to social media. Similarly, the anxiety was higher among people with fair/bad SRH compared to individuals with excellent SRH. It is highly recommended to develop active surveillance and effective monitoring systems to reduce the spread of misinformation from both social and electronic media to improve the state of mental health conditions during the pandemic.","output":"Social and electronic media exposure and generalized anxiety disorder among people during COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh: A preliminary observation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the impacts of COVID-19 on household energy use. Some of these impacts are associated with longer-term energy demand changes and some could just be temporary. The study intends to present the results of a small pilot study conducted in China, by addressing household energy use. The samples are from 352 households and particularly focus on primary energy use in three periods of pre-pandemic (and pre-lockdown), start of COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, and post lockdown. Each period is identified as a timeframe of 2.5 months, from November 2019 to late June 2020. The samples of this study highlight the primary implications of energy use, some that are understood as interim changes and some that may appear to be more prolonged. The results from the study highlight a variety of impacts on household energy use as well as prolonged impacts on transportation use. The primary household energy use are assessed in six fundamental elements of (1) transportation for commuting and leisure (for both private and public modes), (2) cooking, (3) entertainment, (4) heating and cooling, (5) lighting, and (6) the others. The results are summarized in three sections focused on major impacts on transportation use (comparison between private and public modes), cooking and entertainment, heating/cooling and lighting. The results could provide early suggestions for cities/regions that are experiencing longer lockdown.

The use of IMV without ICU admission (non-ICU) in acute care hospitals in the US and its impact on patients' outcomes were not examined. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using statewide inpatient data in Texas to identify hospitalizations aged &#8805;18 years receiving IMV in acute care hospitals with ICU care capability during January 2014 through September 2015. Use of non-ICU IMV, patient characteristics, and hospital mortality were examined. RESULTS: Among 136,728 IMV hospitalizations, 4531 (3.3%) were non-ICU. As compared to ICU admissions, non-ICU IMV hospitalizations were younger (age 18-44 years: 24.9% vs. 17.2%), with lower burden of major comorbidities (no major comorbidity: 24.7% vs. 14.5%), and lower occurrence of non-respiratory organ failures (no non-respiratory organ failure: 32.7% vs. 19.8%).

This study aimed to assess assess how different instrument settings may affect detectable droplet spread and the patterns of aerosolised droplet spread during simulated sinonasal surgery with powered instrumentation in order to identify mitigation strategies. DESIGN: Simulation series using three-dimensional (3D) printed sinonasal model. Fluorescein droplet spread was assessed following microdebriding and drilling of fluorescein-soaked grapes and bones respectively. SETTING: University dry lab. PARTICIPANTS: 3-D printed sinonasal model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patterns of aerosolised droplet spread. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There were no observable fluorescein droplets or splatter in the measured surgical field after microdebridement of nasal polyps at a specific irrigation rate and suction pressure. Droplet splatter occurred when suction pressure was reduced; simulating a surgical condition where there was excessive fluid in the nasal cavity irrigation. Drilling with either coarse diamond or cutting burr resulted in detectable droplets. Greater droplet spread was observed when drilling within the anterior nasal cavity. The addition of a suction catheter reduces droplet spread when drilling. Activation of the microdebrider when there is fluid excess fluid (reduced or blocked suction pressure, excessive mucosal bleeding or irrigation fluid) accumulating in the nasal cavity resulted in detectable droplet spread. High-speed drilling is a high-risk AGP especially when drilling in the anterior nasal cavity, but the addition of suction reduces detectable droplet spread outside the nasal cavity.","output":"Reducing the risks of endoscopic sino-nasal surgery in the Covid-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease was declared a pandemic in March 2020, which necessitated adaptations to medical education. This systematic review synthesises published reports of medical educational developments and innovations that pivot to online learning from workplace-based clinical learning in response to the pandemic. The objectives were to synthesise what adaptations/innovation were implemented (description), their impact (justification), and 'how' and 'why' these were selected (explanation and rationale). METHODS: The authors systematically searched four online databases up to December 21, 2020. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-texts, performed data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias. Our findings are reported in alignment with the STORIES (STructured apprOach to the Reporting in healthcare education of Evidence Synthesis) statement and BEME guidance. RESULTS: Fifty-five articles were included. Most were from North America (n = 40), and nearly 70% focused on undergraduate medical education (UGME). Key developments were rapid shifts from workplace-based learning to virtual spaces, including online electives, telesimulation, telehealth, radiology, and pathology image repositories, live-streaming or pre-recorded videos of surgical procedures, stepping up of medical students to support clinical services, remote adaptations for clinical visits, multidisciplinary team meetings and ward rounds. Challenges included lack of personal interactions, lack of standardised telemedicine curricula and need for faculty time, technical resources, and devices. Assessment of risk of bias revealed poor reporting of underpinning theory, resources, setting, educational methods, and content. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the response of medical educators in deploying adaptations and innovations. Whilst few are new, the complexity, concomitant use of multiple methods and the specific pragmatic choices of educators offers useful insight to clinical teachers who wish to deploy such methods within their own practice. Future works that offer more specific details to allow replication and understanding of conceptual underpinnings are likely to justify an update to this review.","output":"Pivot to online learning for adapting or continuing workplace-based clinical learning in medical education following the COVID-19 pandemic: A BEME systematic review: BEME Guide No. 70"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes mellitus is a major debilitating disease whose global incidence is progressively increasing with currently over 463 million adult sufferers and this figure will likely reach over 700 million by the year 2045. It is the complications of diabetes such as cardiovascular, renal, neuronal and ocular dysfunction that lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality. Of these, cardiovascular complications that can result in stroke and cardiomyopathies are 2- to 5-fold more likely in diabetes but the underlying mechanisms involved in their development are not fully understood. Emerging research suggests that members of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR/ErbB/HER) family of tyrosine kinases can have a dual role in that they are beneficially required for normal development and physiological functioning of the cardiovascular system (CVS) as well as in salvage pathways following acute cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury but their chronic dysregulation may also be intricately involved in mediating diabetes-induced cardiovascular pathologies. Here we review the evidence for EGFR/ErbB/HER receptors in mediating these dual roles in the CVS and also discuss their potential interplay with the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System heptapeptide, Angiotensin-(1-7), as well the arachidonic acid metabolite, 20-HETE (20-hydroxy-5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraenoic acid). A greater understanding of the multi-faceted roles of EGFR/ErbB/HER family of tyrosine kinases and their interplay with other key modulators of cardiovascular function could facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating diabetes-induced cardiovascular complications.","output":"The Role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Family of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases in Mediating Diabetes-Induced Cardiovascular Complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic struck the U.S. aviation sector in March 2020, reducing air passenger volumes by more than 50 percent versus March 2019.

These mutations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, virulence, or resistance to some neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the accurate detection of spike mutants is crucial for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission and identifying neutralizing antibody-resistance caused by amino acid changes in the receptor-binding domain. Here, we developed five SARS-CoV-2 spike gene primer pairs (5-SSG primer assay; 69S, 144S, 417S, 484S, and 570S) and verified their ability to detect nine key spike mutations (H69/V70, T95I, G142D, Y144, K417T/N, L452R, E484K/Q, N501Y, and H655Y) using a Sanger sequencing-based assay. The 5-SSG primer assay showed 100% specificity and a conservative limit of detection with a median tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50)) values of 1.4  10(2) TCID(50)/mL. The accuracy of the 5-SSG primer assay was confirmed by next generation sequencing. The results of these two approaches showed 100% consistency. Taken together, the ability of the 5-SSG primer assay to accurately detect key SARS-CoV-2 spike mutants is reliable. Thus, it is a useful tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike gene mutants in a clinical setting, thereby helping to improve the management of patients with COVID-19.","output":"Development of an efficient Sanger sequencing-based assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Distance education has a long history.

Saliva is an easily accessible alternative specimen type to overcome some of these challenges. In this study, we first used paired saliva and NP swab specimens (n = 128) to compare test performance characteristics with three RNA extraction platforms, i.e., Maxwell RSC (Promega), MagNA Pure 96 (Roche), and KingFisher Flex (Thermo Fisher Scientific), together with two PCR chemistries, i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2019-nCoV) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) quantitative PCR (qPCR) probe assay (Integrated DNA Technologies) and TagPath COVID-19 combination kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This study demonstrated that both saliva and NP swab specimens performed well, with 97% agreement when tested by the CDC qPCR chemistry using Maxwell and MagNA Pure RNA extraction platforms. We then compared 12 weeks of saliva and NP swab testing results using two independent asymptomatic populations, including a community surveillance program using saliva samples only (n = 466) and preoperative screening using NP swab samples only (n = 8,461). The positive detection rates among participants with either saliva or NP swab samples were 1.07% and 1.12%, respectively, which confirms the low pretest probabilities for COVID-19 infections in asymptomatic populations. Notably, there was no increased proportion of low-titer cases (inconclusive results) reported in the asymptomatic groups, compared with the all-comers groups (0.21% and 0.66%, respectively, in the community population and 0.25% and 0.49%, respectively, in the preoperative population); this suggests that low-viral-titer carriers can be found similarly in both groups with saliva or NP swab specimens. In summary, saliva can be considered a good alternative for noninvasive but well-instructed self-collection. IMPORTANCE Our study shows that saliva is a noninvasive respiratory secretion sample type that contains equal or more host materials (RNase P), compared with those contained in the corresponding NP swab specimens, in 103 paired samples. SARS-CoV-2 detection with two RNA extraction platforms, Maxwell and MagNA Pure, with CDC qPCR chemistry showed similar test sensitivities for paired specimens. We then analyzed SARS-CoV-2 detections rates in two independent groups of asymptomatic participants, i.e., a group at a community screening station with supervised saliva collection only (n = 466) and a preoperative screening group (n = 8,461) with NP swabbing only. Similar detection rates of 1.07% for the community group and 1.12% for the preoperative group supported the similar test performances in these groups predicted to have low pretest probabilities of infection. With mindful preparation, saliva can be considered for schools and clinical participants when adequate collection education can be provided and compliance can be established.","output":"Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-Based Detection Using Saliva or Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens in Asymptomatic Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growth of the Internet has increased multi-folds in recent years.

The recurrent spreading of CoVs imposes an ongoing threat to global health and the economy. Since no specific therapy for these CoVs is available, any beneficial approach (including nutritional and dietary approach) is worth investigation. Based on recent advances in nutrients and phytonutrients research, a novel combination of vitamin C, curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid (VCG Plus) was developed that has potential against CoV infection. System biology tools were applied to explore the potential of VCG Plus in modulating targets and pathways relevant to immune and inflammation responses. Gene target acquisition, gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were conducted consecutively along with network analysis. The results show that VCG Plus can act on 88 hub targets which are closely connected and associated with immune and inflammatory responses. Specifically, VCG Plus has the potential to regulate innate immune response by acting on NOD-like and Toll-like signaling pathways to promote interferons production, activate and balance T-cells, and regulate the inflammatory response by inhibiting PI3K/AKT, NF-&#954;B and MAPK signaling pathways. All these biological processes and pathways have been well documented in CoV infections studies. Therefore, our findings suggest that VCG Plus may be helpful in regulating immune response to combat CoV infections and inhibit excessive inflammatory responses to prevent the onset of cytokine storm. However, further in vitro and in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings with system biology tools.

Although people with HIV seeking care in DC have access to a range of supportive services, innovative strategies are needed to enhance patient engagement in this setting. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have shown promise in reaching previously underengaged groups and improving HIV-related outcomes in various settings. OBJECTIVE: This study will evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a clinic-deployed, multifeature mHealth intervention called PositiveLinks (PL) among people with HIV enrolled in the DC Cohort, a longitudinal cohort of people with HIV receiving care in DC. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design and will compare HIV-related outcomes between clinics randomized to PL versus usual care. METHODS: The study aims are threefold: (1) We will perform a formative evaluation of PL in the context of DC Cohort clinics to test the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of PL and tailor the platform for use in this context. (2) We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial with 12 DC Cohort clinics randomized to PL or usual care (n=6 [50%] per arm) and measure the effectiveness of PL by the primary outcomes of patient visit constancy, retention in care, and HIV viral load suppression. We aim to enroll a total of 482 participants from DC Cohort clinic sites, specifically including people with HIV who show evidence of inconsistent retention in care or lack of viral suppression. (3) We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to measure implementation success and identify site, patient, provider, and system factors associated with successful implementation. Evaluation activities will occur pre-, mid-, and postimplementation. RESULTS: Formative data collection was completed between April 2021 and January 2022. Preliminary mHealth platform modifications have been performed, and the first round of user testing has been completed. A preimplementation evaluation was performed to identify relevant implementation outcomes and design a suite of instruments to guide data collection for evaluation of PL implementation throughout the trial period. Instruments include those already developed to support DC Cohort Study activities and PL implementation in other cohorts, which required modification for use in the study, as well as novel instruments designed to complete data collection, as guided by the CFIR and RE-AIM frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Formative and preimplementation evaluations will be completed in spring 2022 when the trial is planned to launch. Specifically, comprehensive formative data analysis will be completed following data collection, coding, preliminary review, and synthesis.

There is evidence that Chinese herbal medicine has an effect on RTIs. Reynoutria japonica Houtt (better known under its synonym Fallopia japonica (Houtt.) Ronse Decr.) (F. japonica), a commonly used Chinese herbal medicine, has a high content of resveratrol and glycosides. In traditional Chinese medicine theory, F. japonica has the effect of clearing heat in the body, improving blood and qi circulation, eliminating phlegm, and relieving cough, so it may have an effect on RTIs. Methods: This systematic review was registered under PROSPERO CRD42020188604. Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of F. japonica as a single herb, or as a component of a complex herbal formula for RTIs. Quality of methodology was assessed by two reviewers independently using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The primary outcome was symptom improvement rate. The secondary outcome measures were fever clearance time, Murray lung injury score and incidence of adverse effects. The extracted data were pooled and meta-analysed by RevMan 5.3 software. Results: Eight RCTs with 1,123 participants with acute RTIs were included in this systematic review, and all the RCTs used F. japonica as part of a herbal mixture. Only one included trial used F. japonica in a herbal mixture without antibiotics in the treatment group. The findings showed that herbal remedies that included F. japonica could increase the symptom improvement rate (risk ratio 1.14, 95% confidence intervals [1.09, 1.20], I(2) = 0%, p < 0.00001, n = 7 trials, 1,013 participants), shorten fever duration, reduce Murray lung injury score and did not increase adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI [0.11, 1.00], I(2) = 0%, p = 0.05, n = 5 trials, 676 participants). Conclusion: There is limited but some evidence that F. japonica as part of a herbal mixture may be an effective and safe intervention for acute RTIs in clinical practice.

Our goal was to leverage real-world data spanning two COVID-19 surges over the first year of the pandemic to determine the temporal trend of in-hospital mortality. Design: This was an observational, retrospective study based on real-world data for patients admitted with COVID-19. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to evaluate the association of covariates with the composite outcome over time. Setting and Population: We identified a retrospective cohort of all patients who were hospitalized within the Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) system with an admission diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. Main outcome: The primary outcome for the study was a composite endpoint of in-hospital mortality, defined as death during the index hospitalization or discharge to hospice. Results: Among 6,477 discharges over the study period, the mean age was 66.2 years (SD=17.6), 52.5% (n=3,401) were male and the overall composite mortality was 14.2% (n=920). Composite in-hospital mortality was significantly associated with increased age, comorbidity index, respiratory rate, and heart rate; decreased systolic blood pressure; male sex; and admission from a long-term care facility (LTCF). The significant temporal decrease in mortality that was observed for patients admitted from a location other than a LTCF was not seen in those admitted from a LTCF. Conclusions: We found that the adjusted in-hospital mortality rate declined over the first year of the pandemic, despite a second surge in COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Importantly, the decrease in mortality appeared to be driven by declines in risk in those not admitted from a LTCF. The observed decrease in mortality over time suggests that improved outcomes may be due to progressive, incremental learning and continuous evolution in hospital practice and policy over the course of the pandemic.","output":"Longitudinal Changes in COVID-19 Associated In-Hospital Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a worldwide human health crisis, causing respiratory illness with a high mortality rate.

The analysis includes RSCU analysis, GC content calculation, ENC analysis, dinucleotide frequency and neutrality plot analysis. We were motivated to conduct the study to fulfil two primary aims: first, to identify the difference in codon usage bias amongst all SARS-CoV-2 genomes and, secondly, to compare their CUBs properties with other respiratory viruses. A biased nucleotide composition was found as most of the highly preferred codons were A/U-ending in all the respiratory viruses studied here. Compared with the human host, the RSCU analysis led to the identification of 11 over-represented codons and 9 under-represented codons in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Correlation analysis of ENC and GC3s revealed that mutational pressure is the leading force determining the CUBs. The present study results yield a better understanding of codon usage preferences for SARS-CoV-2 genomes and discover the possible evolutionary determinants responsible for the biases found among the respiratory viruses, thus unveils a unique feature of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and adaptation.

Understanding the factors that impact influenza vaccination behaviors among underserved older African-Americans could lead to more effective communication and delivery strategies. Aims: We aimed to investigate rate and factors associated with seasonal influenza vaccination among underserved African-American older adults. We were particularly interested in the roles of demographic factors, socioeconomic status, and continuity and patient satisfaction with medical care, as well as physical and mental health status. Methods: This community-based cross-sectional study recruited 620 African-American older adults residing in South Los Angeles, one of the most under-resources areas within Los Angeles County, with a population of over one million. Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to document independent correlates of influenza vaccination. Results: One out of three underserved African-American older adults aged 65 years and older residing in South Los Angeles had never been vaccinated against the influenza. Only 49% of participants reported being vaccinated within the 12 months prior to the interview. One out of five participants admitted that their health care provider recommended influenza vaccination. However, only 45% followed their provider's recommendations. Multivariate logistic regression shows that old-old (&#8805;75 years), participants who lived alone, those with a lower level of continuity of care and satisfaction with the accessibility, availability, and quality of care, and participants with a higher number of depression symptoms were less likely to be vaccinated. As expected, participants who indicated that their physician had advised them to obtain a flu vaccination were more likely to be vaccinated. Our data shows that only gender was associated with self-report of being advised to have a flu shot. Discussion. One of the most striking aspects of this study is that no association between influenza vaccination and being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other major chronic condition was detected. Our study confirmed that both continuity of care and satisfaction with access, availability, and quality of medical care are strongly associated with current influenza vaccinations. We documented that participants with a higher number of depression symptoms were less likely to be vaccinated. Conclusion: These findings highlight the role that culturally acceptable and accessible usual source of care van play as a gatekeeper to facilitate and implement flu vaccination among underserved minority older adults. Consistent disparities in influenza vaccine uptake among underserved African-American older adults, coupled with a disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, places them at high risk for undesired outcomes associated with influenza. As depression is more chronic/disabling and is less likely to be treated in African-Americans, there is a need to screen and treat depression as a strategy to enhance preventive care management such as vaccination of underserved African-American older adults. Quantification of associations between lower vaccine uptake and both depression symptoms as well as living alone should enable health professionals target underserved African-American older adults who are isolated and suffer from depression to reduce vaccine-related inequalities.","output":"Influenza Vaccination among Underserved African-American Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Migrant and refugee populations have been identified as among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 due to what medical anthropologists have described as structural vulnerability We argue significant differences exist between migrant groups and offer lessons for society at large We develop the concept of viral encounters to frame an analysis of social narratives, representations, and practices involved in coping with threats of transmission and practices of prevention Specifically, the globalized city of Prato offers a case study due to its unique relationship with COVID-19 Instead of a COVID-19 epicenter, however, Prato emerged as a contagion exception particularly as related to its Chinese migrant community We use a place-based framework to argue that the threat of xenophobia, preparedness with quarantine, and the will of solidarity motivated an entire migrant community to take actionwell before the nationwide lockdown began and extending beyond its conclusion We combine virtual ethnography with health data as well as evidence of xenophobia and solidarity to offer an analysis We argue that the effects of solidarity reconfigure dominant ideologies of individualism, open space for collective orientation toward a human economy, and offer potential to alleviate detrimental impacts of pandemics Copyright ? 2020 by the Society for Applied Anthropology","output":"Viral encounters: Xenophobia, solidarity, and place-based lessons from Chinese Migrants in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most significant public health disaster since the 1918 influenza pandemic.

According to the most recent Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) survey data, 12.4% of general practice encounters are mental health-related, and most of these encounters are managed with medication (61.6%).7 Clinical guidelines recommend psychological therapies for mild depression and anxiety, and 6-12 months of antidepressant therapy for a single episode of moderateto-severe depression.8'9 Yet in Australia the average duration of therapy is now approximately four years,4 and half of users are long-term users.5 There is also concerning variation in antidepressant prescribing, with rates higher for people in lower socioeconomic or inner regional areas and nearly double in older (>65 years) when compared with younger people.10 Nearly one in three older Australians admitted to residential care in 2008-15 was taking antidepressants on admission, and this only increased after admission.11 There remains ongoing debate about what constitutes appropriate prescribing, but every GP knows that antidepressants cannot treat common social issues such as grief, loneliness, unemployment or poverty. Reviewing and stopping medication when it is no longer indicated is an essential part of good prescribing practice, but in the time-pressured context of general practice it is sometimes overlooked and has been described as 'swimming against the tide'.25 Barriers for GPs include time constraints, reluctance to destabilise a stable situation and poor access to non-pharmaceutical alternatives;barriers for patients include an expectation that doctors would suggest stopping if it were warranted, fear of relapse and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.24 Ready access to social, financial and psychological supports will be part of the equation, but helping patients to stop antidepressants is also important, especially as the withdrawal process can be complex, often requiring slow tapering, tailored support and regular follow-up (Table 2).26-28 The Productivity Commission recommends 'more research focused in these areas, and uptake of its resulting lessons among treating clinicians'.1 As the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there has never been a more pressing time to address the issue of unnecessary and potentially harmful prescribing of antidepressants in general practice.

We evaluated the effectiveness of the FETP-Frontline which was introduced in Ethiopia in 2016. METHODS: We conducted a comparative, randomized cross-sectional study to assess surveillance-related knowledge, skills, and performance among trained and untrained officers using a structured questionnaire and observation checklist. We compared the knowledge, skills, and performance scores of trained and untrained officers using the Fishers Exact test, chi-square test, and t-test at p-value < 0.05 for statistical significance. RESULTS: We conducted the study among 74 trained and 76 untrained surveillance officers. About three-quarters of all participants were male, and the average age was 34 ( 8.6) years. Completeness and timeliness of surveillance reports were significantly higher among trained than untrained surveillance officers. The trained officers were more likely to have produced epidemiologic bulletins (55% vs 33%), conducted active surveillance six months before the survey (88% vs 72%), provided surveillance training (88% vs 65%), conducted strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis (55% vs 17%), and utilized Microsoft Excel to manage surveillance data (87% vs 47%).

Participants with CAI had greater acceleration (mean difference = 55.6 cm/s2; 95% confidence interval, 10.3 to 100.90; P = .017) and jerk compared with the uninjured controls (mean difference = 1804.5 cm/s3; 95% confidence interval, 98.7 to 3510.3; P = .039). These results suggest that individuals with CAI made faster and more frequent active postural control corrections to regain balance following a jump compared with the uninjured controls.","output":"Acceleration and Jerk After a Jump Stabilization Task in Individuals With and Without Chronic Ankle Instability."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study introduces an innovative device for the noninvasive sampling and chromatographic analysis of different compounds present in exhaled breath aerosol (EBA). The new sampling device, especially in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that forced many countries to impose mandatory facemasks, allows an easy monitoring of the subject's exposure to different compounds they may come in contact with, actively or passively. The project combines the advantages of a fabric-phase sorptive membrane (FPSM) as an in vivo sampling device with a validated LC-MS/MS screening procedure able to monitor more than 739 chemicals with an overall analysis time of 18 min. The project involves the noninvasive in vivo sampling of the EBA using an FPSM array inserted inside an FFP2 mask. The study involved 15 healthy volunteers, and no restrictions were imposed during or prior to the sampling process regarding the consumption of drinks, food, or drugs. The FPSM array-LC-MS/MS approach allowed us to effectively exploit the advantages of the two complementary procedures (the convenient sampling by an FPSM array and the rapid analysis by LC-MS/MS), obtaining a powerful and green tool to carry out rapid screening analyses for human exposure to different compounds. The flexible fabric substrate, the sponge-like porous architecture of the high-efficiency sol-gel sorbent coating, the availability of a large cache of sorbent coatings, including polar, nonpolar, mixed mode, and zwitterionic phases, the easy installation into the facemask, and the possibility of sampling without interrupting regular activities provide FPSMs unparalleled advantages over other sampling techniques, and their applications are expected to expand to many other clinical or toxicological studies.","output":"Fabric-Phase Sorptive Membrane Array As a Noninvasive In Vivo Sampling Device For Human Exposure To Different Compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses the importance and effectiveness of viscoelastic hemostatic assays (VHAs) in assessing hemostatic competence and guiding blood component therapy (BCT) in patients with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).

The three pillars of identifying hemostatic competence include clinical observation, common coagulation tests, and VHAs. VHAs are advantageous because they assess the cumulative contribution of all components of the blood throughout the entire formation of a clot, have fast turnaround times, and are point-of-care tests that can be followed serially. Despite these advantages, VHAs are underused due to poor understanding of correct technique and result interpretation, a paucity of widespread standardization, and a lack of large clinical trials. These VHAs can also be used in cases of uterine atony, preeclampsia, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, amniotic fluid embolism, placental abruption, genital tract trauma, surgical trauma, and inherited and prepartum acquired coagulopathies. There exists an immediate need for a point-of-care test that can equip obstetricians with rapid results on developing coagulopathic states.

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the operation of outpatient care worldwide for months. The new framework was set in Hungary by the health emergency regulations that existed from 11. 03. 2020 to 17. 06. 2020. OBJECTIVE In the second half of the emergency period, between 22. 04. 2020 and 05. 05. 2020, we surveyed the opinion of physicians involved in epilepsy care about the extent to which patient care had changed and how they experienced the changes in person. METHOD An internet questionnaire survey was conducted among neurologists registered for the annual congress of the Hungarian Chapter of the International League Against Epilepsy. Nine single- or multiple-choice questions and 'free comment' fields were available. RESULTS Of 116 neurologists contacted, 33 responded (28%), and a total of 30 comments were recorded. 73% said the changes caused a serious difficulty, 15% thought it would have serious consequences. Reception of new patients was stopped in 53%, and 25% encountered great difficulties. In 49%, the problems of the cared patients could be solved using remote visits, but 24% could not solve them properly. 68% of outpatient visits took the form of documented telephone conversations. Two-thirds of doctors feared catching the virus, 40% of whom felt they were not getting enough protection. 6% caught the infection. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has mostly affected the issuance of new expert opinions, but care tasks have not always been adequately addressed. The damage was significantly mitigated by the flexibility of the care staff. Telephone visits, if necessary, can replace personal doctor-patient encounters in epileptology. The technical development of remote visit applications and their documentation issues are important. During the pandemic period, great care must be taken to protect staff in order to avoid infection and increase the sense of safety of doctors.

We aimed to describe antibiotic resistance (ABR) trends and their association with the influenza season in ambulatory and inpatient settings in the United States. METHODS: We used the BD Insights Research Database to evaluate antibiotic susceptibility profiles in 30-day nonduplicate bacterial isolates collected from patients >17 years old at 257 US healthcare institutions from 2011 to 2019. We investigated ABR in Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Gram-negative (Enterobacterales [ENT], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [PSA], and Acinetobacter baumannii spp [ACB]) bacteria expressed as the proportion of isolates not susceptible ([NS], intermediate or resistant) and resistance per 100 admissions (inpatients only). Antibiotics included carbapenems (Carb), fluoroquinolones (FQ), macrolides, penicillin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC), and methicillin. Generalized estimating equations models were used to evaluate monthly trends in ABR outcomes and associations with community influenza rates. RESULTS: We identified 8 250 860 nonduplicate pathogens, including 154 841 Gram-negative Carb-NS, 1 502 796 Gram-negative FQ-NS, 498 012 methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), and 44 131 NS S pneumoniae. All S pneumoniae rates per 100 admissions (macrolide-, penicillin-, and ESC-NS) were associated with influenza rates. Respiratory, but not nonrespiratory, MRSA was also associated with influenza. For Gram-negative pathogens, influenza rates were associated with the percentage of FQ-NS ENT, FQ-NS PSA, and Carb-NS ACB. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed expected increases in rates of ABR Gram-positive and identified small but surprising increases in ABR Gram-negative pathogens associated with influenza activity. These insights may help inform antimicrobial stewardship initiatives.","output":"Antibiotic Resistance Patterns and Association With the Influenza Season in the United States: A Multicenter Evaluation Reveals Surprising Associations Between Influenza Season and Resistance in Gram-Negative Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The contributions of T cells infiltrating the lungs to SARS-CoV-2 clearance and disease progression are poorly understood. Although studies of CD8+ T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage and blood have suggested that these cells are exhausted in severe COVID-19, CD4+ T cells have not been systematically interrogated within the lung parenchyma. We establish here that cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (CD4+CTLs) are prominently expanded in the COVID-19 lung infiltrate. CD4+CTL numbers in the lung increase with disease severity and progression is accompanied by widespread HLA-DR expression on lung epithelial and endothelial cells, increased apoptosis of epithelial cells and tissue remodeling. Based on quantitative evidence for re-activation in the lung milieu, CD4+ CTLs are as likely to drive viral clearance as CD8+ T cells and may also be contributors to lung inflammation and eventually to fibrosis in severe COVID-19.","output":"Expansion of Cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in the lungs in severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the present note is to draw attention to the potential role of a recently discovered visual illusion in creating traffic accidents. The illusion consists in a compelling and immediate experience that the space behind an occluding object in the foreground is empty. Although the illusion refers to a region of space, which is invisible due to occlusion (a blind spot), there is evidence to suggest that it is nevertheless driven by visual mechanisms and that it can be just as deceptive and powerful as ordinary visual illusions. We suggest that this novel illusion can make situations involving blind spots in a road user's field of view even more dangerous than one would expect based on the lack of visibility by itself. This could be because it erroneously makes the road user feel that (s)he has actually seen everything there is to see, and thus has verified that the blind spot is empty. This hypothesis requires further testing before definitive conclusions can be drawn, but we wish to make researchers and authorities involved in the analysis of traffic accidents and on-the-spot crash investigations aware of its potential role in order to encourage registration of relevant data and facilitate further research.","output":"The illusion of absence: how a common feature of magic shows can explain a class of road accidents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To evaluate the usage, safety, and efficacy of high-dose intravenous metoprolol for heart rate reduction in computer tomographic (CT) coronary angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS As this was retrospective analysis of anonymous data, medical ethics committee approval was waived by the regional health research authority. Patients, who had known iodinated contrast medium allergy, contraindications to -blockers, atrial fibrillation, and indications other than suspected coronary artery disease, were excluded from analysis. The ultimate study population of 662 were analysed with details of intravenous metoprolol doses, complications, heart rate before administration of intravenous metoprolol (resting heart rate, RHR), heart rate at acquisition of scan (acquisition heart rate, AHR), and usage of low radiation dose protocols. RESULTS Of the ultimate study population of 662 patients, 183 had no intravenous metoprolol with mean acquisition heart rate (AHR) of 58 beats per minute (bpm), 257 had 1-15 mg intravenous metoprolol with mean AHR of 57 bpm, 114 had 16-29 mg intravenous metoprolol with mean AHR of 62 bpm and 108 had 30 mg intravenous metoprolol with mean AHR of 66 bpm. In the group receiving intravenous metoprolol, average usage was 19 mg (maximum 67 mg) with average reduction in HR of 15 bpm. There were no clinical incidents in relation to the use of high-dose intravenous metoprolol. CONCLUSION Higher doses of intravenous metoprolol are beneficial in achieving target heart rates to facilitate usage of low radiation dose protocols. With appropriate exclusion criteria, higher doses of intravenous metoprolol, well in excess of 15 mg, can be safely administered when carefully titrated.","output":"High-dose intravenous metoprolol usage for reducing heart rate at CT coronary angiography: efficacy and safety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, guidelines on reduced fractionation for patients treated with curative-intent radiotherapy were published, with the aim to reduce the number of hospital attendances and potential exposure of vulnerable patients to minimise the risk of COVID-19 infection. We describe the changes that took place in the management of patients with stage ICIII lung cancer from April to October 2020. Materials and methods Lung Radiotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic (COVID-RT Lung) is a prospective multicentre UK cohort study. The inclusion criteria were: patients with stage ICIII lung cancer referred for and/or treated with radical radiotherapy between 2 April and 2 October 2020. Patients who had had a change in their management and those who continued with standard management were included. Data on demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, diagnostic work-up, radiotherapy and systemic treatment were collected and analysed using adjusted odds ratios. Results In total, 1553 patients were included (median age 72 years, 49% female); 93 (12%) had a change to their diagnostic investigation and 528 (34%) had a change to their treatment from their centres standard of care as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Age  70 years, male gender and stage III disease were associated with a change in treatment on multivariable analysis. Patients who had their treatment changed had a median of 15 fractions of radiotherapy compared with a median of 20 fractions in those who did not have their treatment changed. Low rates of COVID-19 infection were seen during or after radiotherapy, with only 21 patients (1.4%) developing the disease. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes to patient treatment in line with national recommendations. The main change was an increase in hypofractionation.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, no study has yet estimated the effect of this pandemic on university students in the UAE or its impact on the psychological well-being of medical students. Methods: In this study, we surveyed 1485 medical (comprising medical and dental) and non-medical university students across 4 emirates within the UAE. We used an online platform to assess knowledge, sources of information, changes in hygienic behavior, perceptions of fear and worry and anxiety levels using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. The GAD-7 score was measured at three time points; during hospital visits for medical/dental students, before the introduction of online learning and after online learning for all students. Results: The majority of students demonstrated high levels of knowledge and utilized reliable sources of information. Non-medical students exercised higher compliance with social restrictions, while medical students practiced better hand hygiene. Almost half of students reported anxiety levels ranging from mild to severe with females reporting higher anxiety scores during hospital visits (OR=2.02, 95% CI,1.41 to 2.91) and medical students reporting lower anxiety levels in comparison to dental students (OR=0.61, 95% CI,0.45 to 0.84). Medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased with the introduction of online learning, yet, non-medical student's anxiety levels increased with online learning. Conclusions: This is the first study to provide important information on the initial response and anxiety levels in university students across the UAE during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from our study can be used to support the development of effective screening strategies and interventions to build psychological resilience among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergencies in the future.","output":"Increased levels of anxiety among medical and non-medical university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Arab Emirates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital technologies can be a critical channel in boosting economic growth and achieving Sustainable Development Goals.

Here, we found that human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the uncoating receptor for major EV-B. FcRn binds to the virus particles in the canyon through its FCGRT subunit. By obtaining multiple cryo-electron microscopy structures at different stages of virus entry at atomic or near-atomic resolution, we deciphered the underlying mechanisms of enterovirus attachment and uncoating. These structures revealed that different from the attachment receptor CD55, binding of FcRn to the virions induces efficient release of pocket factor under acidic conditions and initiates the conformational changes in viral particle, providing a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of enterovirus entry.","output":"Human Neonatal Fc Receptor Is the Cellular Uncoating Receptor for Enterovirus B"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition of the central nervous system (CNS) that presents with severe communication problems, impairment of social interactions, and stereotypic behaviours. Emerging studies indicate possible associations between viral infections and neurodegenerative and neurobehavioural conditions including autism. Viral infection during critical periods of early in utero neurodevelopment may lead to increased risk of autism in the offspring. This review is aimed at highlighting the association between viral infections, including viruses similar to COVID-19, and the aetiology of autism. A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Ovid/Medline, and Google Scholar database. Relevant search terms included \\"rubella and autism\\", \\"cytomegalovirus and autism\\", \\"influenza virus and autism\\", \\"Zika virus and autism\\", \\"COVID-19 and autism\\". Based on the search terms, a total of 141 articles were obtained and studies on infants or children with congenital or perinatal viral infection and autistic behaviour were evaluated. The possible mechanisms by which viral infections could lead to autism include direct teratogenic effects and indirect effects of inflammation or maternal immune activation on the developing brain. Brain imaging studies have shown that the ensuing immune response from these viral infections could lead to disruption of the development of brain regions and structures. Hence, long-term follow up is necessary for infants whose mothers report an inflammatory event due to viral infection at any time during pregnancy to monitor for signs of autism. Research into the role of viral infection in the development of ASD may be one avenue of improving ASD outcomes in the future. Early screening and diagnosis to detect, and maybe even prevent ASD are essential to reduce the burden of this condition.","output":"Association between Viral Infections and Risk of Autistic Disorder: An Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a recognized public health problem and key determinant of poor health outcomes.

Early progression of this disease starts in the lung airways with an exaggerated inflammation, triggered by the viral infection and characterized by a cytokine stormthat can lead to lethal lung injuries. In the absence of an effective anti-viral molecule and until the formulation of a successful vaccine, anti-inflammatory drugs might offer a complementary tool for controlling the associated complications and thus decreasing the subsequent fatalities. Drug repurposing for several molecules has emerged as a rapid temporary solution for COVID-19. Among these drugs, Thalidomide, a historically emblematic controversial molecule that harbors an FDA approval for treating Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Based on only one-case report of positive outcomes in a patient treated amongst others with Thalidomide, two clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of Thalidomide in treating severe respiratory complications in COVID-19 patients were registered. Conversely, the absence of any substantial, promising evidence on Thalidomide usage in that context along with the discontinued studies on the efficiency of this drug in similar pulmonary diseases might cause a significant obstacle for carrying on clinical studies. In this review, we will discuss the theoretical effectiveness of this drug in attenuating inflammatory complications that are encountered in patients with COVID-19 while pinpointing the lack of evidence that is needed to move forward with this drug.","output":"Thalidomide-Revisited: Are COVID-19 Patients Going to be the Latest Victims of Yet Another Theoretical Drug-Repurposing?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Due to its high impact on society, several efforts have been made to design practical ways to support COVID-19 diagnosis. In this context, automated solutions based on chest x-rays (CXR) images and deep learning are among the popular ones. Although these techniques achieved exciting results in the literature, the use of regions that do not support pneumonia diagnosis, i.e., regions outside the lung area, may bias the recognition model. A strategy to avoid this issue is to use segmentation techniques to isolate the lung area before the classification process. In this work, we investigate the impact of three CNN segmentation architectures on COVID-19 identification: U-Net, MultiResUnet, and BCDU-NET. We also investigate which portions of the CXR most influence each models predictions, using Explainable Artificial Intelligence. The BCDU-NET architecture achieved a Jaccard Index of 0.91 and a Dice Coefficient of 0.95.

Initial interaction between DCs and viruses facilitates cell activation and migration to secondary lymphoid tissues, where these antigen presenting cells (APCs) prime specific adaptive immune responses. Some viruses, however, have evolved strategies to subvert the migratory capacity of DCs as a way to disseminate infection systemically. Here we focus on the role of Siglec-1, a sialic acid-binding type I lectin receptor potently upregulated by type I interferons on DCs, that acts as a double edge sword, containing viral replication through the induction of antiviral immunity, but also favoring viral spread within tissues. Such is the case for distant enveloped viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or Ebola virus (EBOV), which incorporate sialic acid-containing gangliosides on their viral membrane and are effectively recognized by Siglec-1. Here we review how Siglec-1 is highly induced on the surface of human DCs upon viral infection, the way this impacts different antigen presentation pathways, and how enveloped viruses have evolved to exploit these APC functions as a potent dissemination strategy in different anatomical compartments.","output":"When Dendritic Cells Go Viral: The Role of Siglec-1 in Host Defense and Dissemination of Enveloped Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initial situation: The threat imposed by Covid-19 has a significant impact on the world - especially that of substance-users Drugs suddenly became poorly available, the access to substitution-therapy, addiction-help and addiction-medicine underwent restrictions Close living-conditions, lockdown and poor health-conditions of substance-users led to serious concerns within patients, counselors and doctors Measures: After briefly hesitating decisive action followed and self- and third party protection was installed - where scarce material-supply allowed it Professional institutions improved political and medical framework, infection protection, take-home-prescriptions, test-capacities and virtual consultations as well as team conferences were expanded - and so far bigger infection-clusters could be avoided in this group of patients Conclusions: Some of the current changes will remain - and will have an ongoing impact on our living together We gained a lot of experience in crisis-management - and we improved the trustful relation to our patients Good addiction-work is relationship-work: this crisis has just confirmed that!","output":"Corona Crisis and Addiction Medicine: A Field Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across Africa, there is some evidence of COVID-19 private sector activities to tackle COVID-19 which include the development of rapid diagnostic kits, deployment of e-health platforms for bespoke health workforce training, disease surveillance, reporting, auto-screening and advisories.

The present study was performed to evaluate the in vitro MMP and TIMP expression in astrocytes and microglia following TMEV infection. Brain cell cultures from SJL/J mice were infected with the BeAn strain of TMEV and the expressions of 11 MMPs and 4 TIMPs were evaluated by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) at different time points post infection (p.i.). In control astrocytes and microglia, a constitutive expression of MMP-2, -3, -9, -10, -12, -13,-14, -15, -24 and TIMP-2 to -4 was detected. In addition, TIMP-1 and MMP-11 was found in astrocytes only, and MMP-7 was absent in both cells cultures. RT-qPCR demonstrated high virus RNA copy numbers in astrocytes and a low amount in microglia. In accordance, TMEV antigen was detected in astrocytes, whereas it was below the limit of detection in microglia. MMP-3, -9, -10, -12, and -13 as well as TIMP-1 were the enzymes most prominently up-regulated in TMEV-infected astrocytes. In contrast, TMEV infection was associated with a down-regulation of MMPs and TIMPs in microglia.

Additionally, they evaluated 12 preprint servers featuring COVID-19 research through sample submission of six manuscripts. RESULTS The realm of health sciences research has seen a dramatic increase in the presence and importance of preprint publications. By posting manuscripts on preprint servers, researchers are able to immediately communicate their findings, thereby facilitating prompt feedback and promoting collaboration. In doing so, they may also reduce publication bias and improve methodological transparency. However, by circumventing the peer-review process, academia incurs the risk of disseminating erroneous or misinterpreted data and suffering the downstream consequences.

The mean stricture length was 2.5 cm. Stricture formation was secondary to impacted ureteric stones in three patients and failed pyeloplasty for congenital pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in the remaining three. Each patient had ipsilateral flank pain before surgery. RESULTS The mean operating time, estimated blood loss and hospital stay were 244 min, 175 mL and 3.2 days, respectively. No intra- or peri-operative complications were noted. The objective success rate was 100% (all patients had radiographic and/or endoscopic resolution of their ureteric strictures). The subjective success rate was 66%, (two patients developed recurrent discomfort, which upon exploration was found to be attributable to fibrosis away from the appendiceal onlay graft, where the gonadal vessels crossed the ureter). Both patients with recurrent pain underwent laparoscopic ureterolysis and bladder advancement flap proximal to the appendiceal onlay, which markedly improved one patient's pain but the other patient continued to have discomfort, ultimately resulting in a laparoscopic nephroureterectomy.

In the findings, there is a close association between purinergic signaling and the immune response. Then, this study aimed to evaluate alterations in the purinergic signaling in COVID-19 patients according to range severity. We divided the COVID-19 patients into moderate and severe cases following the guideless of NIH and WHO, together with clinical characteristics. The blood samples were collected to obtain PBMCs and platelets. We analyzed the ectonucleotidase activities through ATP, ADP, AMP, Ado hydrolysis, E-NTPDase1 (CD39), and 5-NT (CD73) expression by flow cytometry in total leukocytes. The extracellular ATP was measured by bioluminescence, and cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry. We observed a decrease in ATP hydrolysis and increased AMP hydrolysis in PBMCs for both groups. In severe cases, ATP hydrolysis was raised for the platelets, while ADP and AMP hydrolysis have risen significantly in both groups. Additionally, there was a significant increase in ADP hydrolysis in severe cases compared to moderate cases. In addition, we observed an increase in the ADA activity in platelets of moderate patients. Moderate and severe cases showed increased expression of CD39 and CD73 in total leukocytes. To finalize the purinergic signaling, extracellular ATP was increased in both groups. Furthermore, there was an increase in IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 in moderate and severe groups. Thus, for the first time, our findings confirm the changes in purinergic signaling and immune response in COVID-19, in addition to making it more evident that the severity range directly impacts these changes. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of the purinergic system must be highlighted and studied as a possible target for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 disease. KEY MESSAGES: COVID-19 patients exhibit alterations in purinergic system and immune response. High levels of extracellular ATP lead to different inflammatory responses. CD39 and CD73 expression were increased in COVID-19 patients. Cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 also were altered in these patients. The purinergic system may be a possibility target to SARS-CoV-2 treatments.

Methods >9,000 respondents in an ongoing cross-sectional participatory longitudinal epidemiology study (LoC-19, n=18,581) completed a questionnaire within their personal electronic health record in the week reporting first effective Covid-19 vaccines, and then again after widespread publicity of the increased transmissibility of a new variant (November 13th and December 31st 2020 respectively). Questions covered willingness to receive Covid-19 vaccination and attitudes to prioritisation. Descriptive statistics, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and natural language processing of free-text responses are reported, and how changes over the first 50 days of both vaccination roll-out and new-variant impact modelling of anticipated transmission rates and the likelihood and time to herd immunity. Findings Compared with the week reporting the first efficacious vaccine there was a 15% increase in acceptance of Covid-19 vaccination, attributable in one third to the impact of the new variant, with 75% of respondents \\"shielding\\" -- staying at home and not leaving unless essential -- regardless of health status or tier rules. 12.5% of respondents plan to change their behaviour two weeks after completing vaccination compared with 45% intending to do so only when cases have reduced to a low level. Despite the increase from 71% to 86% over this critical 50-day period, modelling of planned uptake of vaccination remains below that required for rapid effective herd immunity -- now estimated to be 90 percent in the presence of a new variant escalating R0 to levels requiring further lockdowns. To inform the public messaging essential therefore to improve uptake, age and female gender were, respectively, strongly positively and negatively associated with wanting a vaccine. 22.7% disagreed with the prioritisation list, though 70.3% were against being able to expedite vaccination through payment. Teachers (988, 12.6%) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) (837, 10.7%) groups were most cited by respondents for prioritisation. Interpretation In this sample, the growing impact of personal choice among the increasingly informed public highlights a decrease in Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy over time, with news of a new variant motivating increased willingness for vaccination but at levels below what may be required for effective herd immunity. We identify public preferences for next-in-line priorities, headed by teachers and BAME groups, consideration of which will help build trust and community engagement critical for maximising compliance with not only the vaccination programme but also all other public health measures.","output":"Increasing but inadequate intention to receive Covid-19 vaccination over the first 50 days of impact of the more infectious variant and roll-out of vaccination in UK: indicators for public health messaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A key question concerning coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is how effective and long lasting immunity against this disease is in individuals who were previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections in the general population in Austria. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study using national SARS-CoV-2 infection data from the Austrian epidemiological reporting system. As the primary outcome, we aim to compare the odds of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections of COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (February to April 30, 2020) versus the odds of first infections in the remainder general population by tracking polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed infections of both groups during the second wave from September 1 to November 30, 2020. Re-infection counts are tentative, since it cannot be excluded that the positive PCR in the first and/or second wave might have been a false positive. RESULTS: We recorded 40 tentative re-infections in 14 840 COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (0.27%) and 253 581 infections in 8 885 640 individuals of the remaining general population (2.85%) translating into an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.09 (0.07 to 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a relatively low re-infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria. Protection against SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection is comparable with the highest available estimates on vaccine efficacies.

OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic ear surgery training can be carried out using a papaya petiole, enabling the practice of grommet insertion, tympanomeatal flap elevation and foreign body removal from the external auditory canal. This model does not need any laboratory setup. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The hollow structure of the papaya petiole model is very similar to that of the external auditory canal, making training in endoscopic ear surgery easy. Use of the model helps a beginner to train in endoscopic handling and microsurgical instrumentation, and improves depth perception.

A secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of government responses to the early inflow of infected cases. METHODS: Data on government responses week 8C14 were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Regional data on total all-cause mortality during week 14C23 in 2020 were retrieved from Eurostat and national statistical agencies and compared with the average mortality during same period 2015C2019. Variance-weighted least square regression was used with mortality difference as dependent variable with adjustment for country, population density and age distribution. RESULTS: Being a region with winter holiday exclusively in week 9 was in the adjusted analysis associated with 16 weekly excess deaths (95% confidence interval 13 to 20) per million inhabitants during week 14C23, which corresponds to 38% of the excess mortality in these regions. A more stringent response implemented in week 11, corresponding to 10 additional units on the 0C100 ordinal scale, was associated with 20 fewer weekly deaths (95% confidence interval 18 to 22) per million inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: Winter holiday in week 9 was an amplifying event that contributed importantly to the excess mortality observed in the study regions during the spring 2020.

Sanitary and social distancing requirements, the interruption of supply to institutional markets, the closure of local farmers' markets, or people's declining food demand are hampering family farming food production's flow and shrinking family farmers' income. This situation can jeopardize the food sovereignty and nutritional security of the population in the medium and long term. Access to Personal Protective Equipment, the reorganization of local farmers' markets, investment in new technologies for direct commercialization, guarantee of minimum income, and the strengthening/expansion of institutional food purchases are some of the strategies that can contribute to overcome the new challenges imposed on family farming as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Given the novelty of SARS-CoV-2, there is recent interest in the pandemic and its relationship to orthopedic operative outcomes. This retrospective cohort study compared outcomes for operative hip fractures in patients prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic at a level 1 academic center. Materials and Methods: Data was collected on patients age 18 years or older who underwent operative management for hip fractures performed from January 21, 2019 to July 1, 2019 (pre-pandemic) or from January 21, 2020 to July 1, 2020 (pandemic). COVID-19 status, demographics and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 159 patients with hip fractures were included in this study, 103 in the 2019 group and 56 in the 2020 group. Within the 2019 group, there was a significantly greater proportion of female patients compared to 2020 (p = 0.0128). The length of hospital stay was shorter for the 2020 group by 1.84 days (p = 0.0138).

There were no other significant differences in demographics or outcomes between the 2019 and 2020 groups. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly alter most aspects of care for hip fracture patients at our institution. Interestingly, postoperative pulmonary outcomes were not affected by the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a significantly higher proportion of males presented with hip fractures in the pandemic group.

Hypertension is a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. In South Africa, the government has employed a whole systems approach to address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. We used a novel incident care cascade approach to measure changes in the South African health system's ability to manage hypertension between 2008 and 2017. Methods. We used data from Waves 1-5 of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) to estimate trends in the hypertension care cascade and unmet treatment need across four successive cohorts with incident hypertension. We used a negative binomial regression to identify factors that may predict higher rates of hypertension control, controlling for socio-demographic and healthcare factors. The largest cascade attrition occurred prior to diagnosis. Results. In 2011, 19.6% (95%CI 14.2, 26.2) of individuals with incident hypertension were diagnosed, 15.4% (95% CI 10.8, 21.4) were on treatment and 7.1% had controlled blood pressure. By 2017, the proportion of individuals with diagnosed incident hypertension had increased to 24.4% (95% CI 15.9, 35.4) with increases in treatment (23.3%, 95% CI 15.0, 34.3) and control (22.1%, 95% CI 14.1, 33.0) were also observed, translating to a decrease in unmet need from 92.9% in 2011 to 77.9% in 2017.

We sought to look at the effect of pre-transfer intubation (PTI) on patient flow and outcome. Methods A system wide stroke program was implemented during the COVID pandemic;the program consists of a comprehensive stroke center with 10 network hospitals, 8 referring for thrombectomy. Patients were referred for mechanical thrombectomy based on AHA guidelines and VIZ AI software processing performed at the sending facilities. All patients were transferred directly to the endovascular suite. PTI was implemented for patients with high NIHSS. Data was collected from November 2020 through mid-March 2021 during the peak months of the COVID-19 surge in Georgia. Results 52 patients underwent mechanical thrombectomy. 38 patients were from network hospital emergency departments;19% were COVID positive. 16 patients underwent PTI, and 22 patients were intubated in the endovascular suite. Initial NIHSS was significantly higher in PTI patients (17 versus 11, p < 0.05). The Door-in-Door-Out time was not significantly different;176  68 min with PTI and 140  37 min for those intubated at the CSC (p = 0.065). Door to groin puncture at the CSC was significantly shorter for PTI, 18  6 min, compared to those intubated at the CSC, 32  19 min (p < 0.05). Despite a higher initial NIHSS, there was no significant difference in the NIHSS at discharge nor the percent of patients that were independent at discharge, mRS 0-2. There was a trend toward a larger change in NIHSS in the PTI group. There were no adverse events associated with PTI and all patients had a persistent LVO on the initial angiogram.

The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates.

Aims The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Methods A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science through February 25, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 1 576 infected patients. The results showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever (91.3%, 95% CI: 86-97%), followed by cough (67.7%, 95% CI: 59-76%), fatigue (51.0%, 95% CI: 34-68%) and dyspnea (30.4%, 95% CI: 21-40%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (21.1%, 95% CI: 13.0-27.2%) and diabetes (9.7%, 95% CI: 7.2-12.2%), followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4%, 95% CI: 3.8-13.8%) and respiratory system disease (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-2.1%). When compared between severe and non-severe patients, the pooled OR of hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease were 2.36 (95% CI: 1.46-3.83), 2.46 (95% CI: 1.76-3.44) and 3.42 (95% CI: 1.88-6.22) respectively.

We aimed at testing the feasibility of this approach for use in a long-term study focusing on infections in children in Germany. METHODS: Parents of 1- to 3-year-old children (n = 75) were recruited in nursery schools. They were asked to complete a symptom diary on a daily basis and to take monthly and symptom-triggered nasal swabs and stool samples from their child over the study period of three months. Feasibility was measured by means of the return proportions of symptom diaries and bio samples; acceptance was assessed by a questionnaire delivered to participants at the end of the study. RESULTS: The majority of the participants filled in the symptom diary during the three months study for 75 or more days (77.3 %), and provided the monthly nasal swabs (62.7 %) and stool samples (65.3 %). The time needed for the tasks was acceptable for most participants (symptom diary: 92.3 %, nasal swabs: 98.5 %, stool samples: 100.0 %). In 64.3 % of the symptom-triggered nasal swabs, respiratory viruses were found compared to 55.5 % in throat swabs taken by health-care professionals within the ARE surveillance Lower Saxony, a special project by the Governmental Institute of Public Health of Lower Saxony to investigate causal pathogens for acute respiratory infections in children.

Efficient AAV serotypes for the transduction of the conducting airways have been identified for several species; however, efficient serotypes for human lung parenchyma have not yet been identified. Here, we screened the ability of multiple AAV serotypes to transduce lung bud organoids (LBOs)-a model of human lung parenchyma generated from human embryonic stem cells. Microinjection of LBOs allowed us to model transduction from the luminal surface, similar to dosing via vector inhalation. We identified the naturally occurring rAAV2 and rAAV6 serotypes, along with synthetic rAAV6 variants, as having tropism for the human lung parenchyma. Positive staining of LBOs for surfactant proteins B and C confirmed distal lung identity and suggested the suitability of these vectors for the transduction of alveolar type II cells. Our findings establish LBOs as a new model for pulmonary gene therapy and stress the relevance of LBOs as a viral infection model of the lung parenchyma as relevant in SARS-CoV-2 research.","output":"Identification of AAV serotypes for lung gene therapy in human embryonic stem cell-derived lung organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study aimed to characterize sources of knowledge on the means of prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as to assess the methods of preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among police employees in Poland and their potential impact on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy in terms of morbidity, mortality, and perinatal maternal and fetal outcomes is essential to propose strategies for prevention and infection control. Here, we conducted a systematic review to investigate pregnant women infected with COVID-19 in terms of signs and symptoms, type of delivery, comorbidities, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and the possibility of vertical transmission. A search on Embase and PubMed databases was performed on 31 October 2020. Observational studies and case reports on pregnant women infected with COVID-19 were included without language restrictions. The 70 selected studies included a total of 1457 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. The most common signs and symptoms were fever, cough, and nausea. The most frequent comorbidities were obesity, hypertensive disorders, and gestational diabetes. Among maternal and fetal outcomes, premature birth (n = 64), maternal death (n = 15), intrauterine fetal death or neonatal death (n = 16), cases of intrauterine fetal distress (n = 28), miscarriage (n = 7), decreased fetal movements (n = 19), and severe neonatal asphyxia (n = 5) were the most frequent.

The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety, distress and subjective measures of stress were also recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burnout, depression, anxiety and distress. RESULTS: A total of 539 persons responded to the survey; 90% female and 53% nurses.

The exact prevalence, etiology, and outcomes are not well known. We report a case series of patients in our institution with COVID-19 related pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax and address these questions. Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective chart review of patients admitted at our institution with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19. A cohort of 500 potential study candidates was identified, of whom eight were investigated. Demographic data, hospital course, patient co-morbidities, and outcome data were collected. Results Eight patients were included in our study who were identified as having an event (i.e., pneumomediastinum and/or pneumothorax) during the specified timeframe. Overall, 62% of patients were on high-flow nasal cannula with an average FiO(2) of >70%. The average oxygen saturation//fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio leading up to an event was 113.7286 (range: 101.11-130.66), and all of the patients not on mechanical ventilation met the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on the Kigali definition with SpO(2)/FiO(2) < 315. The three patients who developed an event while requiring mechanical ventilation both had PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 100, consistent with severe ARDS at the time of an event. The mean time in days, counted from the day of hospital admission until an event, was 10 days (range: 3-23 days). None of the cases had documented pulmonary parenchymal disease prior to developing COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, these events were not iatrogenic in nature. Conclusion Secondary spontaneous pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax are rare albeit well-documented phenomena in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the majority of patients in our study were on high-flow nasal cannula at the time of an event. The majority of previously published data on this topic are on those who required positive pressure ventilation; however, there have been more recent papers that also describe these events in non-mechanically ventilated patients.

To understand HCWs' fears and concerns surrounding PPE, their experiences following its guidance and how these affected their perceived ability to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A rapid qualitative appraisal study combining three sources of data: semistructured in-depth telephone interviews with frontline HCWs (n=46), media reports (n=39 newspaper articles and 145 000 social media posts) and government PPE policies (n=25). PARTICIPANTS: Interview participants were HCWs purposively sampled from critical care, emergency and respiratory departments as well as redeployed HCWs from primary, secondary and tertiary care centres across the UK. RESULTS: A major concern was running out of PPE, putting HCWs and patients at risk of infection. Following national level guidance was often not feasible when there were shortages, leading to reuse and improvisation of PPE. Frequently changing guidelines generated confusion and distrust. PPE was reserved for high-risk secondary care settings and this translated into HCWs outside these settings feeling inadequately protected. Participants were concerned about differential access to adequate PPE, particularly for women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic HCWs. Participants continued delivering care despite the physical discomfort, practical problems and communication barriers associated with PPE use. CONCLUSION: This study found that frontline HCWs persisted in caring for their patients despite multiple challenges including inappropriate provision of PPE, inadequate training and inconsistent guidance. In order to effectively care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline HCWs need appropriate provision of PPE, training in its use as well as comprehensive and consistent guidance.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted with 343 blood donors. Chi-square and logistic regression were calculated to predict the independent variable for SARS-CoV-2 infection and deemed significant when p < 0.05. RESULTS: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was 4.7%.

Furthermore, we contribute an early-stage design of a cloud broker framework that considers cloud-service consumers sourcing preferences while making new cloud-sourcing decisions and that can be used in the selection and adoption phase of implementing cloud services and/or as part of a multicloud strategy.","output":"A Broker-Based Framework for the Recommendation of Cloud Services: A Research Proposal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks associated with air travel to a COVID-19-free country [New Zealand (NZ)]. A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. We first considered historical data for Australia before it eliminated COVID-19 (equivalent to an outbreak generating 74 new cases/day) and one flight per day to NZ with no interventions in place. This gave a median time to an outbreak of 0.2 years (95% range of simulation results: 3 days to 1.1 years) or a mean of 110 flights per outbreak. However, the combined use of a pre-flight PCR test of saliva, three subsequent PCR tests (on days 1, 3 and 12 in NZ), and various other interventions (mask use and contact tracing) reduced this risk to one outbreak after a median of 1.5 years (20 days to 8.1 years). A pre-flight test plus 14 days quarantine was an even more effective strategy (4.9 years; 2,594 flights). For a much lower prevalence (representing only two new community cases per week in the whole of Australia), the annual risk of an outbreak with no interventions was 1.2% and had a median time to an outbreak of 56 years. In contrast the risks associated with travellers from Japan and the United States was very much higher and would need quarantine or other restrictions. Collectively, these results suggest that multi-layered interventions can markedly reduce the risk of importing the pandemic virus via air travel into a COVID-19-free nation. For some low-risk source countries, there is the potential to replace 14-day quarantine with alternative interventions. However, all approaches require public and policy deliberation about acceptable risks, and continuous careful management and evaluation.","output":"Estimating the impact of control measures to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19 associated with air travel into a COVID-19-free country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess how newspapers from 25 countries are comparing and presenting COVID-19 epidemiological data to their readers.

Healthcare workers have previously been shown to have experienced higher rates of infection than the general population. We aimed to assess the extent of infection in staff working in our healthcare setting. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of antibody results, compared with staff demographic data, and exposure to patients with COVID-19 infection. SETTING: A large teaching hospital in the North West of England. PARTICIPANTS: 4474 staff in diverse clinical and non-patient facing roles who volunteered for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing by the Roche Elecsys assay between 29 May and 4 July 2020. RESULTS: Seroprevalence was 17.4%. Higher rates were seen in Asian/Asian British (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.04) and Black/Black British (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.45) staff. Staff working in any clinical location were more likely to be seropositive (OR 2.68, 95% 2.27 to 3.15). Staff were at an increased risk of seropositivity as the 'per 100 COVID-19 bed-days change' increased in the clinical area in which they worked (OR 1.12, 95% 1.10 to 1.14). Staff working in critical care were no more likely to have detectable antibodies than staff working in non-clinical areas. Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were reported in 41.8% and antibodies were detected in 30.7% of these individuals. In staff who reported no symptoms, antibodies were detected in 7.7%. In all staff who had detectable antibodies, 25.2% reported no symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Staff working in clinical areas where patients with COVID-19 were nursed were more likely to have detectable antibodies. The relationship between seropositivity in healthcare workers and the increase in 'per 100 COVID-19 bed-days' of the area in which they worked, although statistically significant, was weak, suggesting other contributing factors to the risk profile. Of staff with detectable antibodies and therefore evidence of prior infection, a quarter self-reported that they had experienced no compatible symptoms. This has implications for potential unrecorded transmission in both staff and patients.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers in a large teaching hospital in the North West of England: a period prevalence survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed the performance of Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test device for the diagnosis of either active or cured COVID-19.

Case Description: A 55-year-old immunocompromised female (i.e., history 17 years ago of Hodgkins lymphoma, nodular sclerosis variant) recently developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. She then reported the sudden onset of cervicodorsalgia after a slight cervical flexion/extension maneuver. The brain and cervicothoracic spine MRI studies documented a clival anterior spinal epidural hematoma with maximum spinal compression at the T1-T2 level;it also extended inferiorly to the T6 level. Two weeks later, the follow-up MRI showed a remarkable reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the hematoma that correlated with significant neurological improvement and almost complete pain regression.

However, many studies using mHealth apps are hampered by substantial participant dropout or attrition, which may impact the representativeness of the sample and the effectiveness of the study. Therefore, it is imperative for researchers to understand what makes participants stay with mHealth apps or studies using mHealth apps. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review the current peer-reviewed research literature to identify the notable factors and strategies used in adult participant engagement and retention. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases for mHealth studies that evaluated and assessed issues or strategies to improve the engagement and retention of adults from 2015 to 2020. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Notable themes were identified and narratively compared among different studies. A binomial regression model was generated to examine the factors affecting retention. RESULTS: Of the 389 identified studies, 62 (15.9%) were included in this review. Overall, most studies were partially successful in maintaining participant engagement. Factors related to particular elements of the app (eg, feedback, appropriate reminders, and in-app support from peers or coaches) and research strategies (eg, compensation and niche samples) that promote retention were identified. Factors that obstructed retention were also identified (eg, lack of support features, technical difficulties, and usefulness of the app). The regression model results showed that a participant is more likely to drop out than to be retained. CONCLUSIONS: Retaining participants is an omnipresent challenge in mHealth studies.

As there is no specific treatment prescribed to treat COVID-19, the seeking of suitable therapeutics among existing drugs seems valuable. The structure availability of coronavirus macromolecules has encouraged the finding of conceivable anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics through in silico analysis. The results reveal that quinoline,1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-[(2-phenylcyclopropyl)sulfonyl]-trans-(8CI) and saquinavir strongly interact with the active site (Cys-His catalytic dyad), thereby are predicted to hinder the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Out of 113 quinoline-drugs, elvitegravir and oxolinic acid are able to interact with the NTP entry-channel and thus interfere with the RNA-directed 5-3 polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The bioactivity-prediction results also validate the outcome of the docking study. Moreover, as SARS-CoV-2 Spike-glycoprotein uses human ACE2-receptor for viral entry, targeting the Spike-RBD-ACE2 has been viewed as a promising strategy to control the infection. The result shows rilapladib is the only quinoline that can interrupt the Spike-RBD-ACE2 complex. In conclusion, owing to their ability to target functional macromolecules of SARS-CoV-2, along with positive ADMET properties, quinoline,1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-[(2-phenylcyclopropyl)sulfonyl]-trans-(8CI), saquinavir, elvitegravir, oxolinic acid, and rilapladib are suggested for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Quinolines-Based SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp Inhibitors and Spike-RBD-ACE2 Inhibitor for Drug-Repurposing Against COVID-19: An in silico Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the protective measures among health-care workers (HCWs) in a war-torn area during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The questions aimed to assess the HCWs' application of safety, hygiene, and necessary protection considerations while attending to suspected or proven COVID-19 cases. Unpaired t-test and 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 290 participants included in the statistical analysis, 250 were medical doctors.

METHODS: Ultraviolet B (144 mJ/cm2) was used to irradiate rat corneal epithelial cells for 2 h. Cell morphology was observed on differential interference contrast microscopy, and the numbers of the different kinds of apoptotic cells were counted using the ImageJ software. Cell viability was measured with the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5- diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide method. Cell apoptotic rate and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were detected using flow cytometric analyses. The expression levels of 3 apoptotic genes were measured with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction at different time points within 0-24 h after irradiation. RESULTS: After 144-mJ/cm2 ultraviolet B irradiation for 2 h, the expression levels of caspase-8 and Bax were highest at 0 h; furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased at 0 h and remained constant for 6 h in a subsequent culture. At 6 h, caspase-3 was activated. The decrease in cell viability and increase in apoptotic rate peaked at 6 h. The caspase-3 expression level decreased within 12-24 h, which led to a decline in apoptotic rate and change in apoptotic stage.

Some data suggest that early administration of diuretics would shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation. However, this strategy may expose patients to a higher risk of haemodynamic and metabolic complications. Currently, there is no recommendation for the use of diuretics during weaning and there is an equipoise on the timing of their initiation in this context. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing two strategies of fluid removal during weaning in 13 French intensive care units (ICU). The preventive strategy is initiated systematically when the fluid balance or weight change is positive and the patients have criteria for clinical stability; the curative strategy is initiated only in case of weaning failure documented as of cardiac origin. Four hundred and ten patients will be randomised with a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation, defined as the number of days between randomisation and successful extubation (alive without reintubation nor tracheostomy within the 7 days after extubation) at day 28. Secondary outcomes include daily and cumulated fluid balance, metabolic and haemodynamic complications, ventilator-associated pneumonia, weaning complications, number of ventilator-free days, total duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in ICU and mortality in ICU, in hospital and, at day 28. A subgroup analysis for the primary outcome is planned in patients with kidney injury (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes class 2 or more) at the time of randomisation.

This article outlines the development of a remote-facilitated mental simulation (RFMS) delivered to second-year paramedic science students at a UK university. This was created using Sprick et al's simulation design model: preparation, briefing, simulation activity, debriefing, reflection and evaluation. Mental simulation is a teaching modality where participants mentally rehearse processes rather than practical skills. Speaking thoughts aloud helps learners to reflect on their thought processes and decision-making.

Design Cross-sectional anonymous survey among front-line, support service, and administrative healthcare workers. Setting Two large integrated healthcare systems (one private and one public) in New York City during the initial rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers. Participants 1,933 healthcare workers, including nurses, physicians, allied health professionals, environmental services staff, researchers, and administrative staff. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccine receipt during the initial rollout of the vaccine among healthcare workers. Results Among 1,933 healthcare workers who had been offered the vaccine, 81% had received the vaccine at the time of the survey. Receipt was lower among Black (58%) compared with White (91%) healthcare workers; and lower among Hispanic (69%) compared with non-Hispanic (84%) healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, 65% received the vaccine. Among healthcare workers who agreed with the statement that the vaccine is important to protect family members, 86% were vaccinated. Of those who disagreed, 25% received the vaccine. Across all participants, 27% expressed concern about being experimented on with the COVID-19 vaccine. In a multivariable analysis, concern about being experimented on with the COVID-19 vaccine, concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, lack of influenza vaccine receipt, disagreeing that COVID-19 vaccination is important to protect family members, and Black race were independently associated with COVID-19 vaccine non-receipt. Over 70% of all healthcare workers responded that they had been approached for vaccine advice multiple times by family, community members, and patients. Conclusions Our data demonstrated high overall receipt among healthcare workers. Even among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, side effects, or being experimented on, over 50% received the vaccine. Attitudes around the importance of COVID-19 vaccination to protect others played a large role in healthcare workers' decisions to vaccinate. We observed striking inequities in COVID-19 vaccine receipt, particularly affecting Black and Hispanic workers. Further research is urgently needed in developing strategies with healthcare workers to address issues related to vaccine equity and uptake in the context of systemic racism and barriers to care. This is particularly important given the influence healthcare workers have in vaccine decision-making conversations in their communities.","output":"Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine receipt at two integrated healthcare systems in New York City: A Cross sectional study of healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Surgery is challenging during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic This study aimed to investigate the preoperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in elective and emergency surgery and to calculate the patient contacts during hospital stay MATERIALS AND METHODS: All surgeries defined by the German procedural classification (starting with a 5) from 1 June until 29 November 2020 were retrospectively evaluated regarding the preoperative SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test The results were then divided in emergency and elective surgeries To show the personal contacts of the patients in a university hospital, we calculated the patient pathway within the department of urology and urosurgery for April 2020 Therefor we used the electronic patient records RESULTS: Altogether 7745 surgical procedures in 5985 patients were performed, whereby 39 (0 5%) SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive 2833 (37%) surgical procedures were emergency cases and 4912 (63%) were elective procedures 25 (0 9%) of the emergency group and 14 (0 3%) of the elective surgeries had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test The average number of contacts in the patient room was 12 83 (0-50) and 84 22 (0-249) at the ward level, not counting contacts with the clinic staff CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1% of the preoperative SARS-CoV-2 tests of either emergency or elective surgeries tested positive in the 6 months prior to November 2020 Although the risk of undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be low in terms of costs and personnel, preoperative screening is useful in high-risk areas to ensure further necessary surgeries, especially concerning cancer patients and to prevent virus spread in a hospital","output":"[Results of preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing in the coronavirus pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have received particular attention due to their ability to inhibit inflammation caused by cytokine storm induced by COVID-19.

This was a pilot, open-label, prospective, longitudinal study. Five patients that did not improve in their clinical conditions after 48 hours of receiving the standard medical management used by the Medical Center and with persistent PaO2/FiO2 less than 100 mmHg were enrolled. ahUCMSC were infused IV, at dose of 1x10(6) per Kg of body weight over 15 minutes. Patients were monitored after the infusion to detect adverse event. Pa02/FiO2, vital signs, D-dimer, C reactive protein and total lymphocytes were monitored for 21 days after the infusion or until the patient was discharged from the hospital. Descriptive statistics were used with means or medians and standard deviation or interquartile range according to the type of variable. The Wilcoxons rank-sum was used for stationary samples. Adverse events occurred in three patients and were easily and quickly controlled. Immediately after the infusion of ahUCMSC, constant rise of PaO2/FiO2 was observed in all patients during the first 7 days, with statistical significance. Three patients survived and were extubated on the ninth day post-infusion. Two patients died at 13 and 15 days after infusion. The infusion of ahUCMSC in patients with severe ARDS caused by COVID-19, was safe, and demonstrated its anti-inflammatory capacity in the lungs, by improving the respiratory function expressed by PaO2 / FiO2, which allowed the survival of 3 patients, with extubation at 9 days.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Compassionate Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Due to COVID 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple lineages of birds have independently evolved foraging strategies that involve catching aquatic prey by striking at them through the water's surface. Diurnal, visual predators that hunt across the air-water interface encounter several visual challenges, including sun glint, or reflection of sunlight by the water surface. Intense sun glint is common at the air-water interface, and it obscures visual cues from submerged prey. Visually-hunting, cross-media predators must therefore solve the problem of glint to hunt effectively. One obvious solution is to turn away from the sun, which would result in reduction of glint effects. However, turning too far will cast shadows over prey, causing them to flee. Therefore, we hypothesized that foraging herons would orient away from, but not directly opposite to the sun. Our ability to understand how predators achieve a solution to glint is limited by our ability to quantify the amount of glint that free-living predators are actually exposed to under different light conditions. Herons (Ardea spp.) are a good model system for answering questions about cross-media hunting because they are conspicuous, widely distributed, and forage throughout a variety of aquatic habitats, on a variety of submerged prey. To test our hypothesis, we employed radiative transfer modeling of water surface reflectance, drawn from optical oceanography, in a novel context to estimate the visual exposure to glint of free-living, actively foraging herons. We found evidence that Ardea spp. do not use body orientation to compensate for sun glint while foraging and therefore they must have some other, not yet understood, means of compensation, either anatomical or behavioral. Instead of facing away from the sun, herons tended to adjust their position to face into the wind at higher wind speeds. We suggest that radiative transfer modeling is a promising tool for elucidating the ecology and evolution of air-to-water foraging systems.","output":"The light's in my eyes: optical modeling demonstrates wind is more important than sea surface-reflected sunlight for foraging herons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studying career preferences can help in designing and improving health service systems.

However, these diagnostic tools requiring expensive equipment, long testing time, and qualified personnel that is not always available in small local hospitals with limited resources. The lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) platform was developed for rapidly obtaining laboratory results and to make urgent decisions in emergency medicine, as well as the recently introduced concept of testing at the site of care (point-of-care, POC). The simultaneous measurement of different substances from a single sample called multiplex assays have become increasingly significant for in vitro quantification of multiple analytes in a single sample, thereby minimising cost, time, and volume. In multiplex immunoassays, the ligands are immobilized either in planar format (flat surface) or on microspheres in suspension that binds to target analytes in sample. The multiplex technology has established itself in proteomic networks and pathways, validation of genomic discoveries, and in the development of clinical biomarkers. In the present review article, various types of monoplex/simplex and complex/multiplex immunoassays have been analysed that are increasingly being applied in laboratory medicine. Also, some advantages and disadvantages of these multiplex assays have also been included such as experimental animals, in vitro tests using cell lines and tissue samples, 3-dimensional modelling and bioprinting, in silico tests, organ-on-chip, and computer modelling.","output":"Monoplex and multiplex immunoassays: approval, advancements, and alternatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: .

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND Simulation-based training is increasingly used in surgical education. However, it is important to determine which level of competency trainees must reach during simulation-based training before operating on patients. Therefore, pass/fail standards must be established using systematic, transparent, and valid methods. METHODS Systematic literature search was done in four databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library). Original studies investigating simulation-based assessment of surgical procedures with application of a standard setting were included. Quality of evidence was appraised using GRADE. RESULTS Of 24,299 studies identified by searches, 232 studies met the inclusion criteria. Publications using already established standard settings were excluded (N = 70), resulting in 162 original studies included in the final analyses. Most studies described how the standard setting was determined (N = 147, 91%) and most used the mean or median performance score of experienced surgeons (n = 65, 40%) for standard setting. We found considerable differences across most of the studies regarding study design, set-up, and expert level classification. The studies were appraised as having low and moderate evidence. CONCLUSION Surgical education is shifting towards competency-based education, and simulation-based training is increasingly used for acquiring skills and assessment. Most studies consider and describe how standard settings are established using more or less structured methods but for current and future educational programs, a critical approach is needed so that the learners receive a fair, valid and reliable assessment.","output":"Standard Setting in Simulation-Based Training of Surgical Procedures: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented physical distancing measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. AIM: To measure the actual reduction of contacts when physical distancing measures are implemented. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in the Netherlands in 2016C17, in which participants reported the number and age of their contacts the previous day. The survey was repeated among a subsample of the participants in April 2020, after strict physical distancing measures were implemented, and in an extended sample in June 2020, after some measures were relaxed. RESULTS: The average number of community contacts per day was reduced from 14.9 (interquartile range (IQR): 4C20) in the 2016C17 survey to 3.5 (IQR: 0C4) after strict physical distancing measures were implemented, and rebounded to 8.8 (IQR: 1C10) after some measures were relaxed. All age groups restricted their community contacts to at most 5, on average, after strict physical distancing measures were implemented. In children, the number of community contacts reverted to baseline levels after measures were eased, while individuals aged 70 years and older had less than half their baseline levels. CONCLUSION: Strict physical distancing measures greatly reduced overall contact numbers, which likely contributed to curbing the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands. However, age groups reacted differently when measures were relaxed, with children reverting to normal contact numbers and elderly individuals maintaining restricted contact numbers.

The purpose of this study is to study the prevalence, risk factors, anticoagulant therapy and sex difference of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with COVID-19. Methods: The enrolled 121 patients were confirmed positive for COVID-19. All suspected patients with a high Caprini index (4) or PADUA index (4) received color Doppler Ultrasound (US) to screen DVT in both lower extremities. Clinical characteristics of DVT-COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors related to DVT in COVID-19 patients. The distribution of DVT locations, anticoagulation therapy with sex difference, and the outcomes were also analyzed. Results: DVT was found in 48% asymptomatic COVID-19 patients with increased PAUDA index or Caprini index by US scanning. Multivariate logistic regression determined that age, CRP and baseline D-dimer were risk factors among COVDI-19 patients. Although the most common DVT location was infrapopliteal (Class I and Class II), higher mortality in DVT-COVID-19 patients was confirmed. DVT-COVID-19 patients presented significant increases in the CRP, neutrophil count and D-dimer throughout the whole inpatient period compared to non-DVT-COVID-19 patients.

Sex hormones potentially offer one explanation for differences by sex. Objective: To determine whether men exposed to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have lower incidence and severity of COVID-19. Design: We conducted an observational study of male Veterans treated in the Veterans Health Administration from February 15th to July 15th, 2020. We developed a propensity score model to predict the likelihood to undergo Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing. We performed multivariable logistic regression modeling adjusted with inverse probability weighting to examine the relationship between ADT and COVID-19 incidence. We conducted logistic regression analysis among COVID-19 patients to test the association between ADT and COVID-19 severity. Setting: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Participants: The study sample consisted of 6,250,417 male Veterans who were alive as of February 15, 2020. Exposure: Exposure to ADT was defined as having any prescription for a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue or an antiandrogen in the six months prior to the index date. Main Outcomes and Measures: To assess incidence, we used a binary variable indicating any positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 test result through July 15, 2020. To measure severity, we constructed a binary variable indicating whether a patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, placed on mechanical ventilation, or dead in the 60 days following a positive test up to July 15, 2020. Results: We identified 246,087 patients who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 3,057 were exposed to ADT, and 36,096 patients with cancer and no ADT exposure. Of these, 295 ADT patients and 2,427 other cancer patients had COVID-19 illness. In the primary, propensity-weighted comparison of ADT patients to cancer patients not on ADT, ADT was associated with decreased likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.81-0.95]; p=0.001).

We compared sources and levels of stress, distress, and approaches to coping between nurses and physicians, and examined whether coping strategies helped mitigate the negative impact of stress and intentions to quit. METHODS Using a cross-sectional study design, burnout was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. A self-reported survey was used to evaluate stressors, impact on perceived performance, and intentions to quit. The data were analyzed using t-tests and linear regression models. RESULTS Responses of 119 HCPs were analyzed. Findings suggest that (1) compared to physicians, nurses experienced a higher level of distress and burnout, and used more maladaptive coping strategies. (2) Both nurses and physicians experienced more distress and burnout during COVID-19 than before. (3) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative impact of stress on work performance (4) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative effect of stress on burnout, which in turn reduced intentions to quit. Stress negatively impacted work performance and burnout only for those with low, but not high, levels of adaptive coping strategies. DISCUSSION The current findings of HCPs' challenges, risks, and protective factors provide valuable information (1) on COVID-19's impact on HCPs, (2) to guide the distribution of institutional supportive efforts and recommend adaptive coping strategies, and (3) to inform medical education, such as resilience training, focusing on adaptive coping approaches.","output":"Nurses' and Physicians' Distress, Burnout, and Coping Strategies During COVID-19: Stress and Impact on Perceived Performance and Intentions to Quit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There were two rallies of medical students and trainee doctors, where 9,000 participants gathered.

However, few studies have focused on the disease course classification of COVID-19, which is crucial for radiologists to determine treatment plans. This paper proposes a Multi-Modal Fusion Cascade (MMFC) framework for this task, which can make the most of multi-modal information, including CT image and bio-information (laboratory examination, clinical characterization, etc.). The proposed framework consists of two parts: Bio-Visual Feature Learning Module (BFL) and Joint Decision Module (JD). Firstly, BFL learns the discriminative visual features from the mediastinal window with the assistance of bio-information. According to the official Treatment Protocol of China, the bio-information is chosen and helps the BFL better extract the images bio-visual features and then obtained a disease course classification result based on CT images. Secondly, JD uses bio-information again and fuses the confidence of BFLs result to make the joint decision.

We used a web-based survey with a short questionnaire of 13 questions, translated into four languages (Greek, German, French, and Portuguese). The questionnaire included information about demographic and professional data, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of sleep, degree of abidance in lockdown measures, and data about illness or close contact with active confirmed cases of COVID-19. Initially, 2093 individuals participated. After exclusion of those who did not report their duration of sleep, the final sample comprised 1908 participants (Greek, n = 1271; German, n = 257, French, n = 48; Portuguese, n = 332), aged 42.6  12.7 years, who were considered for further analysis. A main effect of the lockdown week on sleep duration was observed (+0.25 h; 95% confidence intervals, CI, 0.17, 0.32; p < 0.001), with the total sleep time of the lockdown week being longer than that under normal conditions.

Therefore, knowledge about the effect of vaccination in this specific group is limited. This information is essential to empower lactating women to make a well-informed decision on their choice for vaccination. After natural infection, SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are present in human milk, which might offer protection for her newborn. The dynamics of these antibodies in human milk following vaccination remain to be elucidated. RESEARCH AIM To determine the effect of vaccination with BNT162b2 on the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in human milk. METHODS In this prospective longitudinal study, we included lactating women who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. Human milk samples were collected prior to vaccination and 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 days after both vaccine doses. Samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS In total, 366 human milk samples from 26 lactating women were analyzed. A biphasic response was observed, with SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) starting to increase between day 5 and 7 after the first dose of the vaccine. After the second dose, an accelerated IgA antibody response was observed. CONCLUSION After vaccination with the mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine, a SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response was observed in human milk. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA after vaccination is important as antibodies are transferred via human milk, and thereby might provide protection to infants against COVID-19.","output":"The Levels of SARS-CoV-2 Specific Antibodies in Human Milk Following Vaccination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals and rarely presents in immunocompetent individuals.

Passive leg raising (PLR) is a validated dynamic method to induce a transient increase in cardiac preload and predict fluid responsiveness. Variations in end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) obtained by capnography correlate closely with variations in cardiac output when alveolar ventilation and carbon dioxide production are kept constant. In this prospective observational study, we tested the hypothesis that variations in ETCO2 induced by a simplified PLR maneuver can track changes in the cardiac index (CI) and thus predict fluid responsiveness. METHOD A five-minute standardized PLR maneuver was performed in 90 paralyzed hemodynamically stable cardiac surgical patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Cardiac index was measured by thermodilution before and one minute after PLR. End-tidal CO2 measurements using capnography were obtained during the entire PLR maneuver. Fluid responsiveness was defined as a 15% increase in the CI. The Chi square test and Student's t test were used to compare responders and non-responders. Logistic regression analyses were then performed to determine factors of responsiveness. RESULTS There were no differences between responders and non-responders in demographic and baseline hemodynamic variables. Fluid responsiveness was associated with an ETCO2 variation (ETCO2) of  2 mmHg during PLR [odds ratio (OR), 7.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.7 to 20.2; P < 0.01; sensitivity 75%]. A low positive predictive value (54%) and a high negative predictive value (NPV) (86%) were observed. No other clinical or hemodynamic predictors were associated with fluid responsiveness. A logistic regression model established that a combination of ETCO2  2 mmHg and a change in systolic blood pressure  10 mmHg induced by passive leg raising was predictive of fluid responsiveness (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 2.5 to 32.2; P = 0.005). CONCLUSION Use of a passive leg raising maneuver to induce variation in ETCO2 is a noninvasive and useful method to assess fluid responsiveness in paralyzed cardiac surgery patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Given its high NPV, fluid responsiveness is unlikely if a passive leg raising maneuver induces ETCO2 of < 2 mmHg.","output":"Assessment of fluid responsiveness with end-tidal carbon dioxide using a simplified passive leg raising maneuver: a prospective observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several blockchain projects to help against COVID-19 are emerging at a fast pace, showing the potential of this disruptive technology to mitigate the multi-systemic threats the pandemic is posing on all phases of the emergency management and generate value for the economy and society as a whole.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted to recognize the pattern of metabolic and radiographic alterations on 18F-FDG PET/CT scans in Covid-19 patients. 492 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were reviewed for pulmonary and systemic abnormalities. RESULTS: 18F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated new lung infiltrates in 29 asymptomatic patients. 13/29 patients had Covid-19 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal nucleic acid PCR test. The most common lung abnormality was pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) (90%) in peripheral distribution (100%), involving 1 lobe in four patients (30.8%), 2-3 lobes in four patients, and 4-5 lobes in five patients (38.4%).

As countries have started lifting Covid-19 related restrictions, businesses have been allowed to again have on-site customers. However, just a limited number of people are being allowed on-site as long as social distancing measures are being followed. This has resulted in heavy burdens on businesses as their number of customers have decreased substantially. In this study, we propose a model to minimize the economic impact of Covid-19 for businesses that have implemented social distancing measures, as well as to minimize the health impact of Covid-19 for their customers and employees. We introduce the quantity Spread in which minimizing Spread gives the optimum number and arrangement of people at a given site while applying social distancing measures. We apply our model to a real-world scenario and optimize the number of passengers and their arrangements under a social distancing measure for two different popular aircraft seat layouts using the Annealing Monte Carlo technique. We obtain the optimal numbers and optimal arrangements of passengers considering both family groups and individual passengers for the social distancing measure. The obtained optimal arrangements of passengers show complex patterns with groups and individual passengers mixed in complex and non-trivial ways. This demonstrates the necessity of using our model or its variants to find these optimal arrangements. In addition, we show that any other arrangements of passengers with the same number of passengers is a suboptimal arrangement with higher health risks as a result of less distance between passengers.

Methods Prospective cohort study, the Andalusian Cohort of Hospitalised patients for COVID-19 (ANCOHVID study), conducted in 4 hospitals and 29 primary care centres in Andalusia, Spain. The sample was composed of 906 adult patients;453 patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 (exposed) and 453 hospitalised due to other causes (non-exposed) from March 1 to April 15, 2020, and discharged alive. The main outcomes were (1) the prevalence of SPS at 12 months after discharge and (2) the incidence of SPS after discharge. Outcome data at 12 months were compared between the exposed and non-exposed cohorts. Risk ratios were calculated, and bivariate analyses were performed. Results A total of 163 (36.1%) and 160 (35.3%) patients of the exposed and non-exposed cohorts, respectively, showed at least one SPS at 12 months after discharge. The SPS with higher prevalence in the subgroup of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 12 months after discharge were persistent pharyngeal symptoms (p<0.001), neurological SPS (p=0.049), confusion or memory loss (p=0.043), thrombotic events (p=0.025) and anxiety (p=0.046). The incidence of SPS was higher for the exposed cohort regarding pharyngeal symptoms (risk ratio, 8.00;95% CI, 1.85 to 36.12), confusion or memory loss (risk ratio, 3.50;95% CI, 1.16 to 10.55) and anxiety symptoms (risk ratio, 2.36;95% CI, 1.28 to 4.34).

As type I interferons (IFNs) are our first line of defense against severe viral respiratory infections, we explored whether glucocorticoids interfere with IFN signaling and whether their use associates to outcome of IFN beta treatment of ARDS. Methods: We performed a propensity-matched post-hoc-analysis using data from the recent randomized INTEREST trial comparing IFN beta 1a to placebo in ARDS patients. Based on the results of these analyses we utilized human lung tissue and human pulmonary endothelial cell cultures to investigate the effect of hydrocortisone on IFN nuclear signaling and the protein transcription of CD73, a molecule responsible for vascular integrity. Results: We found that hydrocortisone reduces the production, and prevents the nuclear translocation of IRF9, that is required for IFN beta-dependent signaling of multiple IFN-induced genes. In addition, hydrocortisone inhibits IFN beta dependent upregulation of CD73 in human lung tissue. Additionally, we found that use of glucocorticoids with IFN beta 1a was independently associated with increased mortality (OR 5.4, 95% CI 2.1-13.9, P< 0.001) in the INTEREST-trial. Conclusions: Glucocorticoids inhibit type I IFN beta signaling and the upregulation of CD73 in human lung.

In vivo, MHV3 induced in C3H mice a genetically controlled infection of meningeal cells, ependymal cells, and neurons. In vitro, purified MHV3 bound to the surface of isolated ependymal cells and cultured cortical neurons but not to oligodendrocytes or cultured astrocytes. MHV3 replicated within cultured cortical neurons and neuroblastoma cells (NIE 115); infected cultured neurons nonetheless survived and matured normally for a 7-day period postinfection. On the other hand, MHV3 had a low affinity for cortical glial cells or glioma cells (C6 line), both of which appear to be morphologically unaltered by viral infection. Finally, MHV3 infected and disrupted cultured meningeal cells. This suggests that differences in the affinity of cells for MHV3 are determinants of the selective vulnerability of cellular subpopulations within the CNS. In vivo, a higher titer of virus was needed for CNS penetration in the genetically resistant (A/Jx) mice than in the susceptible (C57/BL6) mouse strain. However, in spite of viral invasion, no neuropathological lesions developed. In vitro viral binding to adult ependymal cells of susceptible and resistant strains of mice was identical. Genetic resistance to MHV3-CNS infection appeared to be mediated both by a peripheral mechanism limiting viral penetration into the CNS and by intra-CNS mechanisms, presumably at a stage after viral attachment to target cells.","output":"Selective tropism of a neurotropic coronavirus for ependymal cells, neurons, and meningeal cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) plays important roles in host defense against viral infection as revealed by studies in humans and mice.

The encoded polypeptide, 468 aa in length, has three tetratricopeptide repeat motifs. pIFIT2 gene was unevenly distributed in all eleven tissues studied with the most abundance in spleen. Poly(I:C) treatment notably strongly upregulated the mRNA level and promoter activity of pIFIT2 gene.

The global lockdown due to the Covid-19 global pandemic outbreak has resulted in major interruptions in students learning and education at all levels around the world. One of the consequences of university closures is that students suddenly find themselves having a lot more responsibility for their learning. Surprisingly, many students are not fully equipped with the relevant skills to excel in online learning despite being born into technology. Students are not aware of how to look inward to examine how they learn and to judge which methods are effective especially when faced with new forms of learning online because they lack metacognitive skills. Metacognition is crucial to the talent of learning. Although many researchers affirmed that metacognitive skills are crucial in any learning, a study on the impact of the use of metacognitive strategies on learning performance is still rudimentary. The study was carried out with 770 university IT students who have taken at least one online learning course. Data was collected using a self-administered instrument that was adapted from multiple sources. Three hypotheses were formulated and structural equation modeling was employed to conduct path modeling analysis. The findings from this study affirmed that students who use metacognitive strategies in online learning are indeed capable of evaluating their understanding of the course content and are capable of adding more effort in regulating their learning process. In view of the findings, this study will be useful for course instructors and students to establish practices on how to utilise metacognitive strategies to enhance students learning performance as those lacking in metacognition may find themselves at a huge disadvantage.","output":"The use of metacognitive strategies for undisrupted online learning: Preparing university students in the age of pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile learning is a methodology that involves the use of mobile devices to carry out the teaching-learning process.

Increase in the rate of infection can by caused by inadequate hygiene practices and cleanliness. The virus is active up to few hours on various surfaces and time may vary according to the nature of the surface. The virus can continue to spread rapidly by contact surfaces and air. Prevention of further viral spread can be attained by effective disinfection of surface and air.

METHODS: Regulatory network is constructed to be a hopfield-like network with nodes representing biomarkers and directional connections to be regulations in between. The input to the network is the measured expression levels of biomarkers, and the output is the summation of regulatory strengths from other biomarkers. The network is optimized towards minimizing the energy function that is defined as the measure of the disagreement between the input and output of the network. To simulate more complicated regulations, a sigmoid kernel function is imposed on each node to construct a non-linear regulatory network. RESULTS: Two datasets have been used as test beds, one dataset includes patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with different responses to chemotherapy drug, and the other consists of patients of severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, and control normals. The regulatory networks among protein biomarkers were reconstructed for different disease conditions in each dataset. We demonstrated our methods have better classification capability when comparing with conventional methods including Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), K-nearest neighborhood (KNN), linear support vector machines (linSVM) and radial basis function based support vector machines (rbfSVM). CONCLUSION: The derived networks can effectively capture the unique regulatory patterns of protein markers associated with different patient groups and hence can be used for disease classification. The discovered regulation relationships can potentially provide insights to revealing the molecular signaling pathways. In this paper, a novel technique of regulatory network is proposed on purpose of modeling biomarker regulations and classifying different disease groups. The network is composed of a certain number of nodes that are directionally connected in between in which nodes denote predictors and connections to be the regulation relationship. The network is optimized towards minimizing its energy function with biomarker expression data acquired from a specific patient group, thus the optimized network can model the regulatory relationship of biomarkers under the same circumstance. To simulate more complicated regulations, a sigmoid kernel function is imposed on each node to construct a non-linear regulatory network. The regulatory network can extract unique features of each disease condition, thus one immediate application of regulatory network is to classifying different diseases. We demonstrated that regulatory network is capable of performing disease classification through comparing with conventional methods including FLD, KNN, linSVM and rbfSVM on two protein datasets.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the contributions of hypertension alone, T2DM alone, or their combination to the risk of death, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/respiratory failure, and severe COVID\\\\19 infection. Additionally, we assessed risks associated with elevated blood pressure and fasting blood glucose on the same three clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic models were used for these analyses. Among the 3400 patients, 3327(97.9%) survived and 73(2.1%) died. Compared to patients having neither hypertension nor T2DM (n = 1392), the risk of mortality was significantly higher in patients with T2DM alone (n = 226, OR 5.26 [95% CI: 2.39C11.58]) or with T2DM in combination with hypertension (n = 507, OR 3.02, [95% CI: 1.48C6.15]).

RESULTS: 21 cases of travel associated CCHF were identified, of which 12 died (3 outcome unknown) and 4 secondary (nosocomial) infections were reported. Risk occupations or activities for CCHF infection were reported in 8/12 cases when data were available. Travel from Asia to Asia occurred in 9 cases, Africa to Africa occurred in 5 cases, Africa to Europe in 3 cases, Asia to Europe in 2 cases and Europe to Europe in 2 cases. CONCLUSION: CCHF related to travel is rare, is generally associated with at risk activities/occupation and is frequently fatal. Key to early diagnosis and prevention of nosocomial transmission is an understanding of CCHF risk factors and the geographical distribution of CCHF. International travel to CCHF endemic areas is increasing and clinicians and laboratory personnel managing returning travellers should maintain a high index of suspicion.","output":"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in travellers: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread across the globe, but patient experiences are rarely documented. OBJECTIVE: To explore the psychology of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization. METHODS: A phenomenological and robust sampling approach was employed. Sixteen patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology with COVID-19 from 20th January to 1st March 2020 were selected. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, phone calls, or face-to-face interviews using quarantine measures. Data were analyzed using the Colaizzi method. RESULTS: The psychological experience of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization could be summarized into five themes. Firstly, attitudes toward the disease included fear, denial, and stigma during the early stages, which gradually developed into acceptance in the later stages. Secondly, the major source of stress included the viral nature of the disease, quarantine measures, and concerns regarding the health of family members. Thirdly, reactions of body and mind included disease stage-dependent emotional responses, excessive attention to symptoms, rumination, and changes in diet, sleep, and behavior. Fourthly, supportive factors included psychological adjustments, medical care, and family and social support. Finally, the disease resulted in psychological growth and patients viewed problems with gratitude through the cherishing of life, family, bravery, and tenacity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients gradually changed their attitude toward the disease and displayed emotional responses dependent on the stage of the disease. Negative emotions dominated during the early stages but gradually gave way to mixed positive and negative emotions. Active guidance of psychological growth may therefore promote physical and mental recovery in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Qualitative study of the psychological experience of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The shelter-in-place mandate to mitigate the effects from the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was associated with an increase in admissions of school-aged children to our burn center but a decrease in adult admissions It was unclear how many admissions were from suspected abuse Our objective was to determine the social impact of the shelter-in-place mandate on the number of burn admissions secondary to suspected abuse during the COVID pandemic compared to previous years Methods Patients were identified using Institutional Burn Center registry and linked to the clinical and administrative data All patients admitted from January 1, 2016 to July 31, 2020 with suspected abuse were eligible for inclusion Demographics, patient and burn characteristics were evaluated Statistical analysis was performed with Students' t-test, and chi-squared test Results There were 7177 patients included in the study Prior to 2020, each year the percentage of cases with suspected abuse decreased compared to previous years (19% decrease in 2017, 23% decrease in 2018, 30% decrease in 2019) Compared 2019, the number of patients admitted with suspected abuse during the COVID pandemic increased 257%, p=0 00046 There were no significant differences in race, ethnicity, sex, burn mechanism, or burn size in those admitted with abuse-related injuries The average age of patients with abuse-related injuries in 2020 was 13 years old, compared to an average age of 28 years old for the period from 2016C2019 (p&lt; 0 003) Conclusions There is a significant increase in number of patients admitted for suspected abuse Shelter-in-place mandate limited viral transmission of COVID-19 but led to unfathomable increases in abuse cases at our institution","output":"85 Did Shelter-in-place Mandate Lead to an Increase in Suspected Abuse Cases?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of telepsychology soared in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

It is intuitively appealing specifically for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) as its minimal invasiveness favors cosmesis and facilitates any future (re)operation. METHODS Consecutive patients presenting either electively or urgently for resectional surgery for CD over a 36 month period were considered for SPLS using, by preference, a transumbilical 'Surgical Glove Port'. Standard, straight laparoscopic instrumentation was used without additional resources. RESULTS Of 33 consecutive, unselected patients, 28 (92%) had their procedure initiated by SPLS including those needing urgent intervention (n=15) and those with prior abdominal operation (n=8), obstruction (n=7), mass (n=6), fistula (n=6) and/or abscess (n=4). The median (range) age and BMI of the patients were 31 (17-69) years and 21.3 (18.6-28) kg/m2 respectively. 31 had ileocolonic resection (6 with recurrent disease) while two underwent segmental colectomy. No-one suffered intraoperative or anastomotic complication. Both conversion (15%) and postoperative complication (13 Clavian-Dindo complications - I: 8; II: 2; IIIa: 3) rates were predominantly reflective of patient and disease complexity. Median (range) postoperative day of discharge was 6 (3-33) overall and 5 (3-18) in those completed by SPLS. There was one early readmission (for infectiouscolitis) and median follow-up is now 21 months.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship of changes in social media use among children aged 12 to 18 years who were at risk for excessive use of social media during the pandemic period with anxiety and a sense of loneliness. Material and Methods: The study population consisted of children aged 12 to 18 years and living in Turkey. Participants completed the COVID-19 information form, the Social Media Disorder Scale, the Loneliness Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: This study evaluated the data of 1,142 patients. The mean age of the participants was 15.6 years, and 63.2% were females. Among the participants, 63.8% stated that they knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19 in their family or close environment, and 7.1% stated that they were diagnosed with CO-VID-19. Furthermore, 46.4% stated that what they learned from the media increased their anxiety, and 60.4% stated that their academic success decreased during the pandemic period.

We examined the impact of wearing double gloves on surgeons performance in laparoscopic surgery. Methods Eleven surgeons-in-training were recruited to perform laparoscopic cutting tasks in simulation while wearing none, one pair, and two pairs of surgical gloves. Forces applied to laparoscopic instruments were measured. Results Wearing gloves prolonged task times (one pair of gloves: 301.6  61.7 s;two pairs of gloves: 295.8  65.3 s) compared with no gloves (241.7  46.9 s;p = 0.043). Wearing double gloves increased cutting errors (20.4  5.1 mm2) compared with wearing one pair of gloves (16.9  5.5 mm2) and no gloves (14.4  4.6 mm2;p = 0.030). Wearing gloves reduced the peak force (one pair of gloves: 2.4  0.7 N;two pairs of gloves: 2.7  0.6 N;no gloves: 3.4  1.4 N;p = 0.049), and the total force (one pair of gloves: 10.1  2.8 N;two pairs of gloves: 10.3  2.6 N;no glove: 12.6  1.9 N;p = 0.048) delivered onto laparoscopic scissors compared with wearing no glove.

Previously described endovascular methods typically involve carotid revascularization with stent placement prior to or following intracranial thrombectomy. Stent-based approaches, however, require the use of antiplatelet therapy which may increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. We describe a novel modified Dotter technique which may be used for carotid revascularization in lieu of stenting. This technique can eliminate the need for antiplatelet therapy, reduce procedure times, and possibly reduce hemorrhagic conversion rates. METHODS Seven patients presenting between April 2013 and January 2014 were treated with this technique. All patients had carotid stenosis of 65-100% and tandem middle cerebral artery occlusions. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale scores as well as clinical and procedural times were recorded. Pre- and post-Dotter stenosis was measured using the NASCET criteria. Follow-up imaging and clinical data were reviewed. RESULTS The mean age was 64 years and mean initial NIH Stroke Scale score was 11.7. Mean groin to recanalization time was 26 min. Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction grade 2b-3 was achieved in all patients. The mean stenosis was 88% preoperatively and 61% postoperatively. There were no intracranial hemorrhages.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the Quintiles-IMSLegacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database from 2010 to 2016 to describe the population receiving infliximab (IFX) and vedolizumab (VDZ) HIs and determine predictors for an urgent/emergent visit post-HIs. We then administered a cross-sectional survey to IBD Partners Internet-based cohort participants to assess knowledge and experience with infusions. RESULTS: We identified claims for 11 892 conventional IFX patients, 1573 home IFX patients, 438 conventional VDZ patients, and 138 home VDZ patients. There were no differences in demographics or median charges with IFX home and conventional infusions. Home VDZ infusions had a greater median charge than conventional VDZ infusion. Less than 4% of patients had an urgent/emergent visit post-HIs. Charlson comorbidity index > 0 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-3.77) and Medicaid (OR: 3.01; 95% CI, 1.53-5.94) conferred significantly higher odds of urgent/emergent visit post-HIs. In IBD Partners, 644 IBD patients responded; 56 received HIs. The majority chose HIs to save time and preferred HIs to conventional infusions. Only 2 patients reported an urgent/emergent visit for HI-related problems. CONCLUSIONS: HI appears to be safe in IBD patients receiving IFX and VDZ. However, patients with fewer resources and more comorbidities are at increased risk for an urgent/emergent visit post-HIs. The overall patient experience with HI is positive. Expansion of HIs may result in decreased therapy-related logistic burden for carefully selected patients.","output":"Home Infusions for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Are Safe: US Experience and Patient Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy has negative health impacts on the woman and the fetus.

It was used extensively during the 1990s for this purpose as well as in other epidemiological contexts. Surveillance data on COVID-19 diagnoses can be analysed by the method of back-projection using information about the probability distribution of the time between infection and diagnosis, which is primarily determined by the incubation period. This paper demonstrates the value of such analyses using daily diagnoses from Australia. It is shown how back-projection can be used to assess the pattern of COVID-19 infection incidence over time and to assess the impact of control measures by investigating their temporal association with changes in incidence patterns. For Australia, these analyses reveal that peak infection incidence coincided with the introduction of border closures and social distancing restrictions, while the introduction of subsequent social distancing measures coincided with a continuing decline in incidence to very low levels. These associations were not directly discernible from the daily diagnosis counts, which continued to increase after the first stage of control measures. It is estimated that a one week delay in peak incidence would have led to a fivefold increase in total infections. Furthermore, at the height of the outbreak, half to three-quarters of all infections remained undiagnosed. Automated data analytics of routinely collected surveillance data are a valuable monitoring tool for the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful for calibrating transmission dynamics models.","output":"Back-projection of COVID-19 diagnosis counts to assess infection incidence and control measures: analysis of Australian data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) include a broad range of diffuse parenchymal lung disorders and are characterized by diffuse parenchymal lung abnormalities leading to irreversible fibrosis. ILDs are correlated with the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), which generally also results in pulmonary hypertension (PH). Interferons, secreted in larger amounts during viral infections, are an important possible risk factor contributing to this outcome. Aims: In this narrative review, the role of 10 different viral infections on the generation/development of ILDs and their outcomes are described in detail. The aim of this review is to determine the probable risk that COVID-19 and other viral infections pose in the post-infection development of ILDs, PF, and PH. Methods: Searches in PubMed (Medline), Google Scholar, Web of Science (ISI, Researcher ID, Publons), ResearchGate, Scopus, and secondary sources yielded 134 studies. After exclusion criteria, 92 studies containing the terms \\"Coronavirus\\" (COVID-19), \\"Interstitial Lung Diseases,\\" \\"Pulmonary Fibrosis,\\" \\"Pulmonary Hypertension\\" and \\"viral infections\\" were selected for inclusion. Selected articles were read with a focus on the roles of the 10 commonly studied viral infections on generation/intensification of ILDs and classified according to their dominant effect on the respiratory system, with a focus on each infection's effects on parenchyma of the lungs and generation and/or intensification of ILDs. Results: This review found that ILDs, PF, and PH can occur after a COVID-19 viral infection. Similar results are also seen in post-infection cases of other viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, Human herpesvirus-8, adenovirus, Hepatitis C, Torque-Teno (Transfusion-Transmitted) Virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Conclusion: Results of current studies show probable possibility for generation and/or intensification of ILDs in COVID-19 infected patients like other studied viruses. Studies on determination of the actual prevalence of ILD, PF and PH in post-COVID-19 infected patients, follow-up studies on the prevention of ILDs in recovered COVID-19 patients, and meta-analyzed studies on pulmonary outcomes of pandemic corona viruses are strongly recommended as topics for future studies.","output":"Association of COVID-19 and other viral infections with interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus is an enclosed positive-sense RNA virus with club-like spikes protruding from its surface that causes acute respiratory infections in humans. Because it is considered a member of the complex pathogen group, it has been found to infect different host species and cause a variety of diseases. So far, it has been discovered that it may affect the immune, infection, and inflammatory systems, leading to the hypothesis that the immune and inflammatory systems (signaling pathways and components) fail to control infection, opening the door to look for potential targets primarily in these systems. The studys main purpose is to identify highly overexpressed genes and their functional implications as a result of COVID-19 infection, as well as to investigate probable infections, inflammation, and immune systems to better understand the impact of coronavirus infection. We explored the genes and pathways mostly linked with infection, inflammation, and the immune systems using the datasets available for COVID-19 infection gene expression compendium.

Evidence suggests patients can auto-emit aerosols containing viable viruses, these aerosols could be further propagated when patients undergo certain treatments including continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Our aim was to assess i) the degree of viable virus propagated from PAP circuit mask leak, ii) the efficacy of a ventilated plastic canopy to mitigate virus propagation. METHODS: Bacteriophage PhiX174 (108a? copiesmL-1) was nebulised into a custom PAP circuit. Mask leak was systematically varied at the mask interface. Plates containing Escherichia coli host quantified viable virus (via plaque forming unit) settling on surfaces around the room. The efficacy of a low-cost ventilated headboard created from a tarpaulin hood and a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was tested. RESULTS: Mask leak was associated with virus contamination in a dose-dependent manner (&#967;2=58.24, df=4, p<0.001). Moderate mask leak (&#8805;21a? Lmin-1) was associated with virus counts equivalent to using PAP with a vented mask. The highest frequency of viruses was detected on surfaces 1a? m away, however, viable viruses were recorded up to 3.86a? m from the source. A plastic hood with HEPA filtration significantly reduced viable viruses on all plates. HEPA exchange rates &#8805;170a? m3hr-1 eradicated all evidence of virus contamination. CONCLUSION: Mask leak from PAP may be a major source of environmental contamination and nosocomial spread of infectious respiratory diseases.

Data in the childrens files of 31 sub-Saharan African countries were pooled from the Demographic and Health Surveys collected between 2010 and 2019. The outcome variables were three child anthropometrics: stunting (height-for-age z-scores); wasting (weight-for-height z-scores); and underweight (weight-for-age z-scores). The joint effect of maternal marital status and type of household cooking fuel on child nutritional status was examined using multilevel regression models. The results were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) at p < 0.05. The percentages of children who were stunted, wasted and underweight in the 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were 31%, 8% and 17%, respectively. On the joint effect of maternal marital status and type of household cooking fuel on stunting, we found that compared to children born to married mothers who used clean household cooking fuel, children born to single mothers who use unclean household cooking fuel, children born to single women who use clean household cooking fuel, and children born to married women who used unclean household cooking were more likely to be stunted. With wasting, children born to single mothers who used unclean household cooking fuel and children born to married women who used unclean household cooking fuel were more likely to be wasted compared to children born to married mothers who used clean household cooking fuel. With underweight, we found that compared to children born to married mothers who used clean household cooking fuel, children born to single mothers who used unclean household cooking fuel, children born to single women who used clean household cooking fuel and children born to married women who used unclean household cooking were more likely to be underweight. It is imperative for the governments of the 31 sub-Saharan African countries to double their efforts to end the use of unclean household cooking fuel. This goal could be achieved by promoting clean household cooking fuel (e.g., electricity, gas, ethanol, solar, etc.) through effective health education, and promotion programmes.

The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 g, 100 g, or 250 g. There were 15 participants in each dose group. RESULTS: After the first vaccination, antibody responses were higher with higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti-S-2P antibody geometric mean titer [GMT], 40,227 in the 25-g group, 109,209 in the 100-g group, and 213,526 in the 250-g group). After the second vaccination, the titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, and 1,192,154, respectively). After the second vaccination, serum-neutralizing activity was detected by two methods in all participants evaluated, with values generally similar to those in the upper half of the distribution of a panel of control convalescent serum specimens. Solicited adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose, and three participants (21%) in the 250-g dose group reported one or more severe adverse events.

COVID-19 forecasts have received much media attention and numerous platforms have been created to inform the public. However, forecasting effectiveness varies by geographic scope and are affected by changing assumptions in behaviors and preventative measures in response to the pandemic. Due to time requirements for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, evidence is needed to inform short-term forecasting method selection at county, health district, and state levels. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 forecasts keep the public informed and contribute to public policy. As such, proper understanding of forecasting purposes and outcomes is needed to advance knowledge of health statistics for policy makers and the public. Using publicly available real-time data provided online, we evaluate the performance of seven forecasting methods utilized to forecast cumulative COVID-19 case counts. Forecasts are evaluated based on how well they forecast one-. three-, and seven-days forward when utilizing one-, three-, seven-, or all-prior days' cumulative case counts during early onset. This study provides an objective evaluation of the forecasting methods to identify forecasting model assumptions that contribute to lower error in forecasting COVID-19 cumulative case growth. This information benefits professionals, decision makers, and the public relying on the data provided by short-term case count estimates at varied geographic levels. METHODS: One-, three-, and seven-days forecasts are created at the county, health district, and state levels using: (1) a na?ve approach; (2) Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (HW); (3) growth rate (Growth); (4) moving average (MA); (5) autoregressive (AR); (6) autoregressive moving average (ARMA); and (7) autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). Forecasts rely on Virginia's 3,463 historical county-level cumulative case counts from March 7 - April 22, 2020, as reported by The New York Times. Statistically significant results are identified using 95% confidence intervals of Median Absolute Error (MdAE) and Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE) error metrics of the resulting 216,698 forecasts. RESULTS: Next-day MA forecast with three-day lookback obtained the lowest MdAE (0.67, 0.49-0.84, P < .001) and statistically significantly differs from 39 (66.1%) to 53 (89.8%) of alternatives at each geographic level at a significance level of 0.01. For short-range forecasting, methods assuming stationary means of prior days' counts outperform methods with assumptions of weak- or non-stationarity means. MdAPE results reveal statistically significant differences across geographic levels. CONCLUSIONS: For short-range COVID-19 cumulative case count forecasting at the county, health district, and state levels during early onset: (1) MA is effective for forecasting one-, three-, and seven-days' cumulative case counts; (2) exponential growth is not the best representation of case growth during early onset when the public is aware of the virus; and (3) geographic resolution is a factor in forecasting method selection.

Variability in COVID-19 severity may be explained by differences in the host genome. METHODS: We compared poly-amino acids variability from WES data in severely affected COVID-19 patients versus SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive oligo-asymptomatic subjects. FINDINGS: Shorter polyQ alleles (&#8804;22) in the androgen receptor (AR) conferred protection against severe outcome in COVID-19 in the first tested cohort (both males and females) of 638 Italian subjects. The association between long polyQ alleles (&#8805;23) and severe clinical outcome (p = 0.024) was also validated in an independent cohort of Spanish men <60 years of age (p = 0.014). Testosterone was higher in subjects with AR long-polyQ, possibly indicating receptor resistance (p = 0.042 Mann-Whitney U test). Inappropriately low serum testosterone level among carriers of the long-polyQ alleles (p = 0.0004 Mann-Whitney U test) predicted the need for intensive care in COVID-19 infected men. In agreement with the known anti-inflammatory action of testosterone, patients with long-polyQ and age &#8805;60 years had increased levels of CRP (p = 0.018, not accounting for multiple testing). INTERPRETATION: We identify the first genetic polymorphism that appears to predispose some men to develop more severe disease. Failure of the endocrine feedback to overcome AR signaling defects by increasing testosterone levels during the infection leads to the polyQ tract becoming dominant to serum testosterone levels for the clinical outcome. These results may contribute to designing reliable clinical and public health measures and provide a rationale to test testosterone as adjuvant therapy in men with COVID-19 expressing long AR polyQ repeats.

BMI cannot differentiate body fat from lean mass. Normal weight obesity was defined to distinguish people with normal BMI and increased body fat percentage (BF%). In contrast to conventional atherogenic prediction, Apolipoprotein B level is elevated before LDL cholesterol. Adiposity is also known for causing insulin resistance. Hence this study is an attempt to find the correlation of apo B and Insulin sensitivity in predicting future cardiovascular risk among normal weight obese. To study the role of apoB and insulin resistance in predicting cardio vascular risk. Methods: 269 participants of age group 18-24 in a medical teaching institute were selected for the first phase of the study through systematic random sampling. BF% was calculated with Harpenden skinfold callipers using Jackson Pollock's method. Second phase of the study involved biochemical investigation of 30 NWO participants. ApoB level and insulin sensitivity using HOMA model was estimated. Spearman correlations and simple linear regression were used. Analysis done using SPSSv16. Results: Male and Females were 56.4% and 43.6%, respectively. Out of 269, 44 were found to be having NWO. Hence Prevalence was 16.4%.There is a positive correlation found between apoB and insulin resistance with increasing body fat percentage. Conclusions: Elevated levels of apo B and insulin resistance are seen in NWO individuals as the BF% increases. NWO should be diagnosed early and thus apoB and insulin resistance can be screened for cardio vascular risk prediction.","output":"Normal Weight Obesity: Role of apoB and Insulin Sensitivity in Predicting Future Cardiovascular Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strategies implemented worldwide to contain COVID-19 outbreaks varied in severity across different countries, and established a new normal for work and school life (i.e. from home) for many people, reducing opportunities for physical activity.

It is hoped that better understanding of the types of substance abuse that most often occur in the college-age population, the specific contextual factors that support substance abuse in this population, and the various available methods of prevention and treatment of substance abuse that have been developed for college students will contribute to more informed approaches to managing this problem. Methods: This presentation will use data from the medical literature to examine patterns of stimulant misuse and diversion among college students, and gain understanding into factors that contribute to misuse and diversion, with the goal of improving care of transitional-age youth. Integrated into the presentation are case studies and audience polls with a period of discussion with a master clinician to enhance learning. We look at ways that stimulants are misused by college students including in combination with alcohol. We also take a look at what we know and do not know about how the shift to online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic has affected stimulant misuse. Results: In 1 study, over half of college students prescribed stimulants for ADHD said they had been approached to sell, trade, or give away their medication. There are multiple factors impacting stimulant misuse, including social and biological factors, resulting in different patterns of misuse. Conclusions: Stimulants are a highly effective treatment for ADHD but carry the risk of misuse and diversion. There is evidence that in treating ADHD, different treatment trajectories can impact later substance use. By understanding the multiple factors involved in misuse, we can improve clinical care by enhancing screening for misuse and make informed choices in individualized treatment of ADHD.

But does focusing on firms' credit constraints make sense in crises that do not originate from a shock to the financial-sector? In a new large-scale survey of beliefs and plans of German firms during the COVID-19 crisis combined with administrative data, firms identify pessimistic and uncertain beliefs about future demand, rather than current or future credit constraints, as the main impediment for their business. Demand-driven uncertainty is also what limits firms' demand for credit. Firms predominantly rely on retained earnings to finance their operations. Those who access external financing do so largely through regular commercial loans rather than loans guaranteed by government programs.

In their first years of life children are receptive to obstructive airway diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of redecoration of the apartment on airway symptoms in infants during the first two years of life. The Leipzig Allergy Risk Children Study (LARS) is a birth cohort study with the following inclusion criteria: double positive family atopy anamnesis, cord blood IgE>0.9 kU/l, or low birth weight between 1500 C 2500 g. Within the context of LARS, 186 parents of risk children completed a questionnaire on the respiratory symptoms of their children and the redecoration of their apartment at the end of the first and second year of life. A total 22% of the children suffered from obstructive bronchitis once or more during their first year, and 11% experienced this condition during their second year of life. Redecoration of the apartment had a significant influence on the appearance of obstructive bronchitis in the first (OR 4.1 95%CI 1.4 C 11.9) and in the second year of life (OR 4.2 95%CI 1.4 C 12.9). (The OR are adjusted for cord blood-IgE >0.9 kU/l, birth weight 2500 g, male sex and double positive parental atopy anamnesis, dampness, smoking or pet in the apartment). Simultaneous contamination from redecoration activities and additional exposures such as smoking, a pet or dampness in the apartment increased the risk for obstructive bronchitis in the first year (OR 9.1; 95% CI 2.3 C 34.8) as well as in the second year (OR 5.1; 95%CI 1.6 C 15.6). Our data suggest that redecoration of the apartment is associated with the development of acute inflammations, but not with a chronic influence on the airways in atopy risk infants.

We followed a total of 236 elective cesarean sections in Belgian Blue (BB) cows, from which neonatal calves were morphometrically assessed (in cm) within the first 72 h of delivery using a strictly standardized protocol. The effect of the season of birth on each calf measurement was analyzed using mixed linear regression models, including the farm of origin as a random effect. Calves born in spring had a longer diagonal length (69.7  1.24; P = 0.05) than those born in autumn (66.9  1.16). The tibial length of calves born in spring (35.8  0.48) was longer (P < 0.02) than of those born in autumn (33.1  0.57) or summer (34.1  0.49). Calves born in autumn have a shorter head diameter (12.9  0.23; P < 0.02) than those born in summer (12.6  0.29) or winter (13.5  0.22). For all other parameters, no differences were found (P > 0.08). Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the birth season influences the morphometrics of neonatal BB calves, with a tendency for spring to be associated with the largest body size. The latter is important to avoid dystocia when BB cattle are crossed with other breeds.","output":"The effect of season of birth on the morphometrics of newborn Belgian Blue calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an exponential increase in telehealth. In response to the pandemic, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health (D-HH) and its Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) closed non-essential in-person services on March 17, 2020 and began reopening on April 27, 2020. We examined outpatient telehealth utilization at D-HH and NCCC in the peri-pandemic period and compared utilization to the Academic Medical Center (AMC) overall and to other service lines. Methods: Weekly outpatient volumes, percentage telehealth, percentage video versus audio-only, and percentage of new patients were examined for D-HH, for the AMC, and for selected AMC-based service lines from January 1 to October 31, 2020. Results: Compared with the AMC overall and with five other primarily non-surgical specialties, oncology was lower in the (1) proportion of outpatient visits performed via telehealth (example week 7/12/20: oncology = 11%; AMC = 21%; mean of 5 other specialties = 38%) and (2) percentage of telehealth involving video versus audio-only (7/12/20: oncology = 19%; AMC = 58%; mean of 5 others = 60%). Oncology more closely resembled the surgical specialty of orthopedics (7/12/20: 2% telehealth; 10% of telehealth involved video). Oncology also demonstrated (1) a high proportion of outpatient visits involving procedures (oncology = 22%; orthopedics = 12%) and (2) no difference between telehealth and in-person visits in terms of the percentage involving new patients. Conclusions: During the peri-pandemic period, our oncology service demonstrated a lower than average incorporation of telehealth overall into their outpatient practice and a lower proportion of telehealth performed by video.

As part of an integrated public healthcare strategy, data with subsequent analysis of diabetes control achieved in patients living with DM (PLWD) need to be available. Diabetes control data from KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, South Africa, are scarce. Smaller studies conducted in public and private healthcare sectors of KZN have shown suboptimal DM control. OBJECTIVES To identify the percentage of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) tests done in KZN public healthcare facilities, and to provide a glimpse into diabetes control being achieved in each KZN district municipality. METHODS Data regarding the number of HbA1c tests performed, number of patients with an HbA1c 7% and number of diabetes visits were accessed from the KZN Department of Health Information Systems and analysed. RESULTS The majority of HbA1c tests were performed in the metro municipality of eThekwini (p<0.001). Approximately two-thirds (64.5%) of PLWD in whom HbA1c tests had been performed, were suboptimally controlled. In 5 of the 11 KZN district municipalities more than two-thirds of PLWD had an HbA1c >7%. Most of the patients in 9 of the 11 district municipalities showed suboptimal control of their DM. The total number of HbA1c tests performed in KZN represents approximately one-tenth of the total number of diabetes treatment visits. This trend was prevalent in all 11 district municipalities, where the incidence of DM was on an upward trajectory. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that the majority of PLWD visiting public healthcare facilities in KZN have suboptimal glycaemic control. They are at increased risk of developing diabetes-related complications, further burdening the healthcare fiscus of low- to middle-income countries. We also showed that the number of HbA1c tests being performed, in the presence of suboptimal control, was well below par. This finding serves to emphasise the need for strategies to be implemented to increase awareness of HbA1c testing for the monitoring of glycaemic control, and for making point-of-care HbA1c testing readily available in these healthcare facilities.","output":"Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) use and glycaemic control in patients living with diabetes mellitus attending public healthcare facilities in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BRAZILI? - Een verpleegkundige temperatuurt het stamhoofd van de Arapuim-stam in Brazili?, voordat ze een covid-19-test bij hem afneemt.

METHODS: All patients diagnosed with a Kawasaki-like disease at our centre in the past 5 years were divided according to symptomatic presentation before (group 1) or after (group 2) the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Kawasaki- like presentations were managed as Kawasaki disease according to the American Heart Association indications. Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) was defined by presence of circulatory dysfunction, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation criteria. Current or previous infection was sought by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, and by serological qualitative test detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. FINDINGS: Group 1 comprised 19 patients (seven boys, 12 girls; aged 30 years [SD 25]) diagnosed between Jan 1, 2015, and Feb 17, 2020. Group 2 included ten patients (seven boys, three girls; aged 75 years [SD 35]) diagnosed between Feb 18 and April 20, 2020; eight of ten were positive for IgG or IgM, or both.

The LVEF of both groups was higher than that before treatment, and the observation group was higher than the control group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the levels of two groups' patients' creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), and troponin I (cTnI) were all lower than those before treatment, and the observation group patients were all lower than the control group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the levels of serum myeloperoxidase (MPO), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) in the two groups were all lower than those before treatment, and the observation group patients were all lower than the control group (P < 0.05). After treatment, there was no statistical difference between the two groups of patients in cardiogenic death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and other adverse cardiovascular events (P > 0.05). But, the incidence of severe arrhythmia and heart failure in the observation group were both lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). KaplanCMeier survival curve analysis showed that the median survival time without MACE in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin treatment for patients with STEMI combined with T2DM after PCI can improve cardiac function to certain extent, reduce inflammation, and will reduce the incidence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.","output":"Investigating the Effects of Dapagliflozin on Cardiac Function, Inflammatory Response, and Cardiovascular Outcome in Patients with STEMI Complicated with T2DM after PCI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the World Health Organization, about 20 million people are infected with Hepatitis E every year. In 2015, there were 44,000 deaths due to HEV infection worldwide. Food, water and climate are key factors that affect the outbreak of Hepatitis E. This paper presents an ensemble learning model for Hepatitis E prediction by studying the correlation between historical epidemic cases of hepatitis E and environmental factors (water quality and meteorological data). Environmental factors include many features, and ones that are most relevant to HEV are selected and input into the ensemble learning model composed by Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Random Forest for training and prediction. Three indicators, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the ensemble learning model against the classical time series prediction model. It is concluded that the ensemble learning model has a better prediction effect than the classical model, and the prediction effectiveness can be improved by exploiting water quality and meteorological factors (radiation, air pressure, precipitation).","output":"The Prediction of Hepatitis E through Ensemble Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented need to re-organise and re-align priorities for all surgical specialties. Despite the current declining numbers globally, the direct effects of the pandemic on institutional practices and on personal stress and coping mechanisms remains unknown. The aims of this study were to assess the effect of the pandemic on daily scheduling and work balances, its effects on stress, and to determine compliance with guidelines and to assess whether quarantining has led to other areas of increased productivity. METHODS: A trans-Atlantic convenience sample of paediatric urologists was created in which panellists (Zoom) discussed the direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual units, as well as creating a questionnaire using a mini-Delphi method to provide current semi-quantitative data regarding practice, and adherence levels to recently published risk stratification guidelines. They also filled out a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire to assess contemporary pandemic stress levels. RESULTS: There was an 86% response rate from paediatric urologists. The majority of respondents reported near complete disruption to planned operations (70%), and trainee education (70%). They were also worried about the effects of altered home-lives on productivity (&#8804;90%), as well as a lack of personal protective equipment (57%). The baseline stress rate was measured at a very high level (PSS) during the pandemic. Adherence to recent operative guidelines for urgent cases was 100%. CONCLUSION: This study represents a panel discussion of a number of practical implications for paediatric urologists, and is one of the few papers to assess more pragmatic effects and combines opinions from both sides of the Atlantic. The impact of the pandemic has been very significant for paediatric urologists and includes a decrease in the number of patients seen and operated on, decreased salary, increased self-reported stress levels, substantially increased telemedicine usage, increased free time for various activities, and good compliance with guidelines and hospital management decisions.","output":"A survey and panel discussion of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric urological productivity, guideline adherence and provider stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India's health infrastructure is under pressure since the daily COVID-19 cases have crossed the milestone of 4 Lakhs cases per day which surpass the previous years' peak. Patients with mild symptoms have been advised for home treatment since most of the hospitals are running out of bed. In this situation delivering healthcare to people has become revolutionizing due to the rapid advancement of embedded systems, communication, and informatics technologies. Integration of different health sensors, handheld devices, and internet can be a great potential for significant improvement of the quality of remote healthcare. This paper discusses the use of MySignals HW shield which is a hardware development platform for medical devices to build e-health monitoring system. Wearable health monitoring system prototype has been developed in this work. To conduct experiments, health vitals such as body temperature, ECG, oxygen saturation level, and pulse rate from 5 volunteers have been measured, collected, and stored in a cloud database using the system prototype. To evaluate the performance of the prototype, transmission delay has been recorded in both wired (Ethernet) and wireless (Wi-Fi) communication modes. It is observed that it takes 2.71 ms and 5.18 ms of time to collect and store the health vitals to the cloud database in wired and wireless mode respectively. Comparing the collected health vitals with the normal range of health vitals, no abnormality is found in all volunteer's health. Finally, a framework for contactless monitoring of COVID-affected patients is proposed. Contactless monitoring of health vitals can reduce the chance of community spread.","output":"On Development of MySignals based prototype for application in health vitals monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Levels of severe acute respiratory coronavirus type 2 (SARS CoV 2) RNA in wastewater could act as an effective means to monitor coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within communities. However, current methods used to detect SARS CoV 2 RNA in wastewater are limited in their ability to process sufficient volumes of source material, inhibiting our ability to assess viral load. Typically, viruses are concentrated from large liquid volumes using two stage concentration, primary and secondary. Here, we evaluated a dead-end hollow fiber ultrafilter (D-HFUF) for primary concentration, followed by the CP Select&#8482; for secondary concentration from 2 L volumes of primary treated wastewater. Various amendments to each concentration procedure were investigated to optimally recover seeded OC43 (betacoronavirus) from wastewater. During primary concentration, the D-HFUF recovered 69  18% (n = 29) of spiked OC43 from 2 L of wastewater. For secondary concentration, the CP Select&#8482; system using the Wastewater Application settings was capable of processing 100 mL volumes of primary filter eluates in <25 min. A hand-driven syringe elution proved to be significantly superior (p = 0.0299) to the CP Select&#8482; elution for recovering OC43 from filter eluates, 48  2% compared to 31  3%, respectively. For the complete method (primary and secondary concentration combined), the D-HFUF and CP select/syringe elution achieved overall 22  4% recovery of spiked OC43 through (n = 8) replicate filters. Given the lack of available standardized methodology confounded by the inherent limitations of relying on viral RNA for wastewater surveillance of SARS CoV 2, it is important to acknowledge these challenges when interpreting this data to estimate community infection rates. However, the development of methods that can substantially increase sample volumes will likely allow for reporting of quantifiable viral data for wastewater surveillance, equipping public health officials with information necessary to better estimate community infection rates.","output":"Development of a large volume concentration method for recovery of coronavirus from wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although myocarditis and pericarditis were not observed as adverse events in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trials, there have been numerous reports of suspected cases following vaccination in the general population.

Mipomersen is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits the synthesis of apolipoprotein B-100, an essential component of low density lipoprotein (LDL), and thus decreases the production of LDL. We aimed to determine the effect of mipomersen in patients with FH. Methods: We searched Ovid Medline, Ovid EMBASE, WHO ICTRP search portal, ISI database, the reference lists of relevant articles, and also Google Scholar to retrieve articles. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients with FH receiving mipomersen as an add-on and a parallel group receiving a placebo or no intervention were selected. Results: Five studies with more than 500 patients were included. All had low risk of bias. Pooling data showed that mipomersen probably reduces LDL compared with placebo [mean difference: -24.79, 95% CI (-30.15, -19.43)] but with a moderate level of certainty. There was a high level of evidence for injection site reactions [RR = 2.56, CI (1.47-4.44)] and a low level for increased serum alanine transaminase (ALT) > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) [RR = 5.19, CI (1.01-26.69)]. Conclusion: A moderate level of evidence in decreasing serum LDL indicates that we are uncertain if this drug provides benefit in any outcome important to patients. Although a low level of evidence for an increase in serum ALT leaves uncertainty about this adverse effect, injection site reactions in 10% or more of patients can be an important concern.","output":"The Effect of Mipomersen in the Management of Patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Medical photography is used extensively in dermatology to record disease progression, measure treatment response, and help teach patients about skin disease;such photos are also commonly utilized in teledermatology, medical education, research, and medical reference websites.

Objective: The aims of this study were to elucidate patient perceptions of skin photos in dermatology and to explore possible next steps in improving the patient experience with medical photography in the hospital or clinic setting. Methods: A scoping review of the literature was performed using the PubMed database, with clinic- or hospital-based full-text publications in English spanning the last 10 years considered for inclusion. Results: The majority of included studies (10/11, 91%) found positive patient attitudes toward medical photographs. The majority of patients (1197/1511, 79.2%) felt that medical photographs could improve medical care in the clinic setting. Written consent detailing all photo uses, including secondary uses (such as research or teaching), was preferred, apart from in 1 study. Patients preferred or found it acceptable for the photographer of their medical photos to be a physician (1301/1444, 90.1%). Clinic-owned cameras with departmental record storage were the preferred modality. Latinx and African American patients expressed less trust in the utility of medical photographs to improve care, compared with Asian and White patients. The minimal number of available publications on this topic and the inclusion of articles older than 5 years are limitations, since patient perceptions of medical photography may have rapidly changed during this time span, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent increase in teledermatology visits. Conclusions: Patients reported positive perceptions of dermatologic photography for improving their medical care. Ethnic disparities in patient perceptions require further exploration to better elucidate nuances and develop interventions to improve the experience of marginalized patients. Building patient trust in nonphysician photographers may enhance clinic efficiency.

The dearth of targeted therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19, an ongoing global health crisis, underscores the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of the interactions of SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins. Here we describe the use of a convenient bacteria-based two-hybrid (B2H) system to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We identify sixteen distinct intraviral protein-protein interactions (PPIs), involving sixteen proteins. We find that many of the identified proteins interact with more than one partner. We further show how our system facilitates the genetic dissection of these interactions, enabling the identification of selectively disruptive mutations. We also describe a modified B2H system that permits the detection of disulfide bond-dependent PPIs in the normally reducing Escherichia coli cytoplasm and we use this system to detect the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with its cognate cell surface receptor ACE2. We then examine how the RBD-ACE2 interaction is perturbed by several RBD amino acid substitutions found in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our findings illustrate the utility of a genetically tractable bacterial system for probing the interactions of viral proteins and investigating the effects of emerging mutations. In principle, the system could also facilitate the identification of potential therapeutics that disrupt specific interactions of virally encoded proteins. More generally, our findings establish the feasibility of using a B2H system to detect and dissect disulfide bond-dependent interactions of eukaryotic proteins.

Our novel concept of infection unit is defined. The model separately considers various population pools: two of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected patients;three different pools of recovered individuals;of assisted hospitalized patients;of the quarantined;and of those who die from COVID-19. Transmission of this disease is described by an infection rate function, modulated by an encounter frequency function. This definition makes redundant the addition of a separate pool for the exposed, as done in several other models. Simulations are presented. The effects of social restrictions and of quarantine policies on pandemic spread are demonstrated. The model differs conceptually from others of the kind in the description of the transmission dynamics of the disease.

Demographic data and discharge diagnosis were documented for every patient. RESULTS: Of the 1,307 patients who were hospitalized during the study period, 444 (35.5%) were males with a mean (SD) age of 66.1  16.6 years. There was a 47 and 46% reduction in all-cause respiratory morbidity compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, respectively. The mean incidence rate for respiratory diseases during the study period was 21.4 admissions per day, and this rate was significantly lower than the rate during the same period in 2018 (40.8 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.525; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.491-0.562; p < 0.001) or the rate during 2019 (39.9 admissions per day; IRR, 0.537; 95% CI, 0.502-0.574; p < 0.001). The greatest reductions (%) in the number of daily admissions in 2020 were observed for sleep apnoea (87% vs. 2018 and 84% vs. 2019) followed by admissions for asthma (76% vs. 2018 and 79% vs. 2019) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (60% vs. 2018 and 51% vs. 2019), while the lowest reductions were detected in hospitalizations for pulmonary embolism (6% vs. 2018 and 23% vs. 2019) followed by tuberculosis (25% vs. both 2018 and 2019).

METHODS: : Data on 24,034 patients screened for COVID-19 as of July 2020 were extracted from the Froedtert/Medical College of Wisconsin Epic medical record. COVID-19 outcomes were defined as positive screens, proportion hospitalized among positive screens, and proportion that died among positive and hospitalized population. The primary independent variable was a 3-category variable: physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis alone, and combined mental and physical health diagnoses. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the independent relationship between separate and combined diagnoses and COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: : Compared to physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis alone had lower odds of screening positive (OR=0.68, CI=0.51;0.92) and was not associated with hospitalization or mortality among positive screens. Combined had lower odds of screening positive (OR=0.78, CI=0.69;0.88) and higher odds of hospitalization among positive screens after adjusting for demographics (OR=1.58, CI=1.20;2.08) but lost significance in the fully adjusted model.

A 1-year cohort study on 245 hip fracture patients in Finland indicated the lowest 3-year mortality and highest survival among patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 50C74 nmol/L. PURPOSE: To explore pre-fracture serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level as a factor associated with post-fracture survival among a cohort of hip fracture patients in Finland. METHODS: A prospectively collected cohort of hip fracture patients (n = 245, 70% women) from two hospitals was followed for 3.2 post-hip fracture years. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured in admission to the hospital and classified: < 50, 50C74, 75C99, and  100 nmol/L. Survival was analyzed with a Bayesian multivariate model. Relative survival was explored with the life table method according to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Mortality according to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and to the hospital was calculated. RESULTS: Mortality in the patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 50C74 nmol/L was significantly lower than in all other patients together at every post-fracture year. The most important factors for survival were age under 85 years; living in an actual/private home; serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 50C74 nmol/L, followed by 75C99 nmol/L; ASA classes 1C2 and 3; and female sex. The mean age of patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 50C99 nmol/L was significantly higher than in other levels. Relative survival was highest in men, women, and patients in hospital B with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 50C74 nmol. CONCLUSION: The highest 3-year survival and the lowest mortality in this cohort appeared in patients with pre-fracture serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 50C74 nmol/L. This result differs from similar studies and is lower than the recommended level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D among hip fracture patients.

There was a need to develop alternative approaches for stable patients to access medication. With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic there was an urgent need to decongest facilities and protect people from infection. In this crisis the Metro Health Services rapidly implemented home delivery of medication by community health workers. This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of home delivery of medication by community health workers during the coronavirus pandemic in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: A convergent mixed methods study evaluated six implementation outcomes: adoption, feasibility, fidelity, coverage, cost, and sustainability of the initiative. Data sources included routinely collected data, a telephonic survey of 138 patients, an analysis of set-up and recurrent costs as well as 17 descriptive exploratory qualitative semi-structured interviews with 68 key informants. RESULTS: Over a 6-month period 1,054,657 pre-packaged parcels were sent to primary care facilities, 819,649 (77.7%) were delivered and of those 97,297 (11.9%) returned. The additional costs were estimated as 1.3% of a total health budget of R2,2 billion. The initiative was rapidly adopted as it decongested facilities and protected vulnerable patients. Although it was feasible to implement at scale, numerous challenges were encountered, such as incorrect addresses and contact details, transporting parcels, communicating with patients, having a reliable audit trail, and handling out-of-area patients.

CONCLUSION: Home delivery of medication by community health workers is feasible at scale and affordable. It should continue, but as one of a menu of options for alternative delivery of medication. The following need to be improved: efficiency of the system, the audit trail, adequate support and resources for community health workers, transport of medication, communication with patients, empanelment of patients, governance of the system and training of the community health workers.","output":"Evaluating the implementation of home delivery of medication by community health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Cape Town, South Africa: a convergent mixed methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical course of severe COVID-19 in cystic fibrosis (CF) is incompletely understood. We describe the use of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) as a salvage therapy in a critically unwell patient with CF (PWCF) who developed COVID-19 while awaiting lung transplantation. METHODS: IV AAT was administered at 120mg/kg/week for 4 consecutive weeks. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, and soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1) were assessed at regular intervals in plasma, with IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and neutrophil elastase (NE) activity measured in airway secretions. Levels were compared to baseline and historic severe exacerbation measurements. RESULTS: Systemic and airway inflammatory markers were increased compared to both prior exacerbation and baseline levels, in particular IL-6, IL-1 and NE activity. Following each AAT dose, rapid decreases in each inflammatory parameter were observed. These were matched by marked clinical and radiographic improvement.

To prevent cardiopulmonary complications, many clinics perform preoperative OSA screening. Consequently, adequate adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is essential but challenging. We aimed to evaluate CPAP adherence and its influence on postoperative outcomes. METHODS In a prospective multicenter cohort study, we compared different perioperative strategies for handling undiagnosed OSA in bariatric patients. In this subgroup analysis, patients newly diagnosed with OSA were compared to those with pre-existing OSA. We assessed inadequate CPAP adherence, defined as < 4 h/night, between the preoperative period and 6 months postoperative. Cardiopulmonary complications and (un)scheduled ICU admissions were also evaluated. RESULTS In total, 272 patients with newly diagnosed OSA (67.4%) and 132 patients with pre-existing OSA (32.6%) were included. Before surgery, 41 newly diagnosed patients used CPAP inadequately, compared to 5 patients with pre-existing OSA (15% vs. 4%, p = 0.049). Six months after surgery, inadequate CPAP use increased to 73% for newly diagnosed patients and 39% for patients with pre-existing OSA, respectively (p < 0.001). Incidences of cardiopulmonary complications, scheduled, and unscheduled ICU admissions were similar in the two study groups (p = 0.600, p = 0.972, and p = 0.980, respectively). CONCLUSION Inadequate CPAP adherence is higher in bariatric patients newly diagnosed with OSA when compared to patients with pre-existing OSA. Strategies to increase CPAP adherence may be valuable when considering routine OSA screening and CPAP therapy in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Further studies are needed to improve current guidelines on perioperative OSA management of obese patients.

A wide range of respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus, rhinovirus (HRV), have repeatedly been detected in acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children in the past decades. However, in the last ten years thanks to progress in molecular technologies, newly discovered viruses have been identified including human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses NL63 (HcoV-NL63) and HKU1 (HcoV-HKU1), human Bocavirus (HBoV), new enterovirus (HEV), parechovirus (HpeV) and rhinovirus (HRV) strains, polyomaviruses WU (WUPyV) and KI (KIPyV) and the pandemic H1N1v influenza A virus. These discoveries have heavily modified previous knowledge on respiratory infections mainly highlighting that pediatric population is exposed to a variety of viruses with similar seasonal patterns. In this context establishing a causal link between a newly identified virus and the disease as well as an association between mixed infections and an increase in disease severity can be challenging.

Within this context, the present study aimed to explore undergraduate medical students' perceptions regarding the effectiveness of synchronized online learning at Unaizah College of Medicine and Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using virtual focus group discussions synchronously with the help of a discussion guide consisting of seven open-ended questions. Overall, 60 medical students were recruited using a maximum variation sampling technique; these students then participated in eight focus group discussions. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for thematic contents using the standard (Mayring, Kiger. M. E. and Braun.V) content analysis framework. RESULTS: A thematic content analysis yielded four core themes: (1) educational impact, (2) time management, (3) challenges encountered, and (4) preferences for the future. The online modality was well-received, and all participants agreed that online sessions were time saving and that their performance was improved due to enhanced utility of time; however, they indicated that they encountered some challenges, including methodological, content perception, technical, and behavioral challenges during sessions and online exams. Most of the preclinical students preferred online learning for the upcoming academic years. CONCLUSION: Synchronized online classes were well-accepted by the medical students. This represents significant and promising potential for the future of medical education.

We compared surrogate SALR measures between patients using hylan G-F 20 and specific non-hylan G-F 20 HA products. DESIGN Knee OA patients were identified from the Optum Clinformatics dataset (January 2006 to June 2016), stratified into hylan G-F 20 and non-hylan G-F 20 HA users, matched by single or multiple injection products. Occurrences of surrogate SALR measures including inflammation/infection, intraarticular corticosteroid (CS) injections, arthrocentesis/aspiration, arthrotomy/incision and drainage, and arthroscopy were evaluated within 3 days post-HA. RESULTS Based on 694,404 HA injections, inflammation/infection rate was rare within 3 days of HA (up to 0.03%), with no statistical differences between hylan G-F 20 and non-hylan G-F 20 groups (matched by single or multiple injection products). The risk of knee arthrotomy/incision and drainage, arthroscopy, or arthrocentesis for hylan G-F 20 (2 mL) 3 weekly injection patients was lower than Hyalgan/Supartz and Orthovisc patients, but greater than Euflexxa patients. Overall, we found that Hylan G-F 20 (2 mL) 3 weekly injection had lower SALR rates compared to Hyalgan/Supartz and Orthovisc. However, Hylan G-F 20 (2 mL) 3 weekly injection had slightly higher rates of SALR when compared to Euflexxa. Among the single injection products, Hylan G-F 20 (6 mL) single injection had lower rates of SALR than Monovisc and Gel-One.

The complex molecular cascade of events related to the viral pathogenicity is triggered by the Spike protein upon interacting with the ACE2 receptor on human lung cells through its receptor binding domain (RBDSpike). One potential therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19 could thus be limiting the infection by blocking this key interaction. In this current study, we adopt a protein design approach to predict and propose non-virulent structural mimics of the RBDSpike which can potentially serve as its competitive inhibitors in binding to ACE2. The RBDSpike is an independently foldable protein domain, resilient to conformational changes upon mutations and therefore an attractive target for strategic re-design. Interestingly, in spite of displaying an optimal shape fit between their interacting surfaces (attributed to a consequently high mutual affinity), the RBDSpikeCACE2 interaction appears to have a quasi-stable character due to a poor electrostatic match at their interface. Structural analyses of homologous protein complexes reveal that the ACE2 binding site of RBDSpike has an unusually high degree of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues, attributed to key evolutionary changes, making it inherently reaction-prone. The designed mimics aimed to block the viral entry by occupying the available binding sites on ACE2, are tested to have signatures of stable high-affinity binding with ACE2 (cross-validated by appropriate free energy estimates), overriding the native quasi-stable feature. The results show the apt of directly adapting natural examples in rational protein design, wherein, homology-based threading coupled with strategic hydrophobic ?polarmutations serve as a potential breakthrough.","output":"Plausible Blockers of Spike RBD in SARS-CoV2 C Molecular Design and Underlying Interaction Dynamics from High-Level Structural Descriptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Describe the development and preliminary impact of CAMP Air, a web-based intervention for adolescents with uncontrolled asthma.

Greater surveillance of underage use is necessary to inform e-cigarette policy and mitigate adolescent e-cigarette use. Accurate prevalence estimates for adolescent e-cigarette use are provided by large national surveys. However, these surveys are costly and provide only annual estimates. To obtain more affordable estimates faster and more frequently, novel methods are required. Methods: Online search term popularity data were taken from Google Trends. Interest in the search terms \\"vapes\\", \\"vape\\", and \\"vape pen\\" were followed monthly from January 2011 to November 2020. Time-lagged zero-normalized cross-correlations were performed between the Google data and current (past 30 day) high-school e-cigarette use prevalence estimates from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). The search interest data were then calibrated to the NYTS data to estimate adolescent e-cigarette use prevalence using online searches. Results: Maximum correlation coefficients of 0.979 for \\"vapes\\" and 0.938 for \\"vape\\" were obtained when search interest lagged use prevalence by one month, and 0.970 for \\"vape pen\\" when the lag was two months (p<0.0001 for all). Calibrating the search term data to NYTS provided a high-school current e-cigarette use prevalence estimate of 11.3-16.5% for November 2020, suggesting adolescent use of e-cigarettes has continued to decline since the NYTS estimate of 19.6% for January-March 2020. Conclusions: Online search trend data may provide reasonably reliable and more frequent estimates of adolescent e-cigarette use prevalence at substantially lower costs than traditional surveys.

Although acute pancreatitis (AP) has been reported in patients treated with PIs, there have been few real-world studies comparing the occurrence and characteristics of AP after different PI regimens. Methods: Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were utilized for data mining of the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for suspected adverse events involving AP after PI from January 2004 to December 2019. The times to onset and fatality rates of AP following different PI regimens were also compared. Results: Based on 33,832 reports related to PIs, 285 cases (0.84% of total adverse drug reactions, ADRs) were associated with AP;in these reports, the number of AP cases reported for the top five PIs was as follows: ritonavir/dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir, 64 (22.46%);ritonavir, 54 (18.95%);atazanavir, 52 (18.25%);lopinavir/ritonavir, 48 (16.84%);and darunavir, 26 (9.12%). Twelve out of the 15 studied PIs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir and nelfinavir, which are potential therapeutics for COVID-19, were associated with AP. Of all the reported adverse events involving AP related to PIs, 64.56% occurred in men, which was a much higher proportion than what was observed in women (28.42%). The median time to onset of AP was 103 (IQR: 26-408) days after the initiation of PI treatment. Patients treated with ritonavir/dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir appeared to have an earlier onset of AP than those receiving atazanavir (31 [IQR: 17C68.25] days vs 187.5 [IQR: 80.5C556.5] days, p=0.0379) or ritonavir (31 [IQR: 17C68.25] days vs 177 [IQR: 56C539] days, p=0.0371).

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the timing and efficacy of TCZ in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 with an elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) level (>10 pg/ml) were offered TCZ intravenously for compassionate use. Clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, and chest imaging before and after the administration of TCZ were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 58 consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria and with no compliance to the exclusion criteria were included. Of these 58 patients, 39 patients received TCZ treatment, and 19 patients who declined TCZ treatment were used as the control cohort. In the TCZ-treatment group, 6 patients (15.4%) were in mild condition, 16 (41.0%) were in severe condition, and 17 (43.6%) were in critical condition. After TCZ treatment, the condition of 27 patients (69.2%) improved and 12 (30.8%) died. Compared with the improvement group, patients in the death group had higher baseline levels of IL-6 (P = 0.0191) and procalcitonin (PCT) (P = 0.0003) and lower lymphocyte percentage (LYM) (P = 0.0059). Patients receiving TCZ treatment had better prognoses than those without TCZ treatment (P = 0.0273). Furthermore, patients with a baseline IL-6 level of 100 pg/ml in the TCZ-treatment group had poorer clinical outcomes than those with an IL-6 level of <100 pg/ml (P = 0.0051). CONCLUSION: The administration of TCZ in an early stage of cytokine storm (IL-6 level < 100 pg/ml) may effectively improve the clinical prognosis of patients with COVID-19 by blocking the IL-6 signal pathway.","output":"Administration Timing and Efficacy of Tocilizumab in Patients With COVID-19 and Elevated IL-6"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A fast, reliable, and cost-effective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was established to determine the effects of the traditional Chinese medicine employed to treat coronavirus disease 2019, namely, Lianhua Qingwen granules, Huoxiang Zhengqi capsules, Jinhua Qinggan granules, Shufeng Jiedu capsules, and Angong Niuhuang pills, on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir in rats. Blood samples were prepared using the protein precipitation method and atazanavir was selected as the internal standard (IS). Separation was performed on an Agilent ZORBAX eclipse plus C(18) (2.1 mm  50 mm, 1.8 m) column using acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase for gradient elution. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min and the injection volume was 2 L. Agilent Jet Stream electrospray ionization was used for mass spectrometry detection under positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode at a transition of m/z 629.3447.3 for lopinavir, m/z 721.3296.1 for ritonavir, and m/z 705.4168.1 for the IS. The method showed good linearity in the concentration range of 25C2500 ng/mL (r=0.9981) for lopinavir and 5C500 ng/mL (r=0.9984) for ritonavir.

Tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against human IL-6 receptor, poses a therapeutic option for the treatment of CRS leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome in coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods We performed a single-center retrospective study to reveal the outcome of COVID-19 patients on tocilizumab and proposed the Cerrahpa?a-PREDICT score, a new clinical scoring system using clinical and laboratory parameters that would help predicting the 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab. Results Eighty-seven patients (median age: 59 years) were included of whom 75.8% were male. Tocilizumab use significantly improved clinical and laboratory parameters. The 28-day mortality rate on tocilizumab was 16.1%. The Cerrahpa?a-PREDICT score, consisting of platelet counts, procalcitonin, D-dimer levels, SO2R and the time from symptom onset to tocilizumab administration had a positive predictive value of 94.5% and negative predictive value of 92.9% for anticipating 28-day mortality. Conclusions Severe COVID-19 should closely be monitored for the signs of hyperinflammation. We showed that administration of tocilizumab early in the course of the disease (prior to ICU admission) resulted in a favorable outcome. Close monitoring usually aids identifying patients who would benefit from tocilizumab. In this regard, the Cerrahpa?a-PREDICT score might serve as a practical tool for estimating the 28-day mortality in COVID-19 patients who received tocilizumab and would facilitate timely recognition of fatal cases to be evaluated for other therapeutic options.","output":"Tocilizumab in COVID-19: the Cerrahpa?a-PREDICT score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 21-year-old previously healthy Caucasian female presented to the emergency department (ED) in the pre-COVID-19 era for evaluation of thrombocytopenia after a flu-like illness.

Critical values are computed via a standard permutation algorithm. Under a high-level condition that the observed data can be coupled by a collection of conditionally independent variables, we establish the asymptotic validity of the permutation test, allowing the sizes of the local subsamples to be either be fixed or grow to infinity. In the latter case, we also establish that the permutation test is consistent. We demonstrate that our high-level condition can be verified in a broad range of problems in the infill asymptotic time-series setting, which justifies using the permutation test to detect jumps in economic variables such as volatility, trading activity, and liquidity.

By using HPLC-Q-TOF/MS, we conducted metabonomics analysis to screen the significantly changed endogenous metabolites and construct the network in both serum and urine. The results revealed that SA regulated the pathways of glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, lysine biosynthesis, pyrimidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis under the pathological conditions of AMI. Furthermore, we selected the regulatory enzymes related to heart disease, including ecto-5-nucleotidase (NT5E), guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT), platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) and methionine synthase (MTR), for validation.

Death date and cause of death were directly extracted from publicly available ICE Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Library, ICE death reports, and ICE press releases. Annual suicide rates were calculated as suicides per 100,000 person-years and suicides per 100,000 admissions. RESULTS: From 2010C2019, the mean number of suicides per 100,000 person-years was 3.3 (standard deviation (SD): 2.6). In 2020, the suicide rate increased 5.3 times the prior 10-year average to 17.4 suicides per 100,000 person-years. When calculating suicide rate based on admissions per FY, the mean number of suicides from 2010C2019 per 100,000 admissions was 0.3 (SD: 0.3). In 2020, the suicide rate increased 11.0 times the prior 10-year average to 3.4 suicides per 100,000 admissions.

However, users are reluctant to share their location and contact details due to concerns related to the privacy and security of their personal information, which affects its implementation and extensive adoption.

In contrast to a large number of short and intermediate-term results, no series of SG with a follow-up of 5 years or more has been published so far. METHODS We report on the weight loss results of our first consecutive 26 patients with a complete follow-up of 5 years. Furthermore in a subgroup of 12 patients, plasma ghrelin levels were measured preoperatively, and up to 5 years following SG. RESULTS Weight loss defined as mean percent excess weight loss (%EWL) was found as 57.5 +/- 4.5, 60.3 +/- 5.0, 60.0 +/- 5.7, 58.4 +/- 5.4, and 55.0 +/- 6.8 (not converted, n = 21) for the first 5 years. Weight regain of more than 10 kg from nadir was observed in five (19.2%) of the 26 patients. Four of the patients (15.4%) were converted to gastric bypass due to severe reflux (n = 1, 3.8%) and weight loss failure (n = 3, 11.5%). A total of eight patients (30.8%) were at chronic need for proton pump inhibitor medication due to severe reflux.

To add, providers often struggle in helping patients negotiate the decision to start AC therapy. To assist in the communication between patients and providers regarding preferences and knowledge about AC therapy, different strategies are being used to try and solve this problem. In this research study, we will have patients and providers utilize the AFib 2gether app with hopes that it will create a platform for shared decision making regarding the prevention of stroke in patients with AF receiving AC therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to measure several outcomes related to encounters between patients and their cardiology providers where AFib 2gether is used. These outcomes include usability and perceived usefulness of the app from the perspective of patients and providers. In addition, we will assess the extent and nature of shared decision making. METHODS: Eligible patients and providers will evaluate the AFib 2gether mobile app for usability and perceived usefulness in facilitating shared decision making regarding understanding the patients risk of stroke and whether or not to start AC therapy. Both patients and providers will review the app and complete multiple questionnaires about the usability and perceived usefulness of the mobile app in a clinical setting.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common degenerative disorders in joints and is characterized by gradual and irreversible cartilaginous tissue damage. Notably, immune factors were newly identified to be closely related to OA development. In this study, we explored the modulatory effects of clinical-grade hDPSCs on osteoarthritic macrophages and their protective effects on cartilaginous tissues in OA joints. METHODS: The cell morphology, immunophenotype, and inflammatory factor expression of osteoarthritic macrophages were explored by phase contrast microscope, transmission electron microscopy, immunostaining, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Additionally, the factors and signaling pathways that suppressed macrophage activation by hDPSCs were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western-blotting. Furthermore, hDPSCs were administered to a rabbit knee OA model via intra-articular injection. Macrophage activation in vivo and cartilaginous tissue damage were also evaluated by pathological analysis. RESULTS: We found that hDPSCs markedly inhibited osteoarthritic macrophage activation in vitro. The cell morphology, immunophenotype, and inflammatory factor expression of osteoarthritic macrophages changed into less inflammatory status in the presence of hDPSCs. Mechanistically, we observed that hDPSC-derived hepatocyte growth factor and transforming growth factor 1 mediated the suppressive effects on osteoarthritic macrophages. Moreover, phosphorylation of MAPK pathway proteins contributed to osteoarthritic macrophage activation, and hDPSCs suppressed their activation by partially inactivating those pathways. Most importantly, injected hDPSCs inhibited macrophage activation in osteochondral tissues in a rabbit knee OA model in vivo. Further histological analysis showed that hDPSCs alleviated cartilaginous damage to knee joints. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our findings reveal a novel function for hDPSCs in suppressing osteoarthritic macrophages and suggest that macrophages are efficient cellular targets of hDPSCs for alleviation of cartilaginous damage in OA.

Numerous overlapping mechanisms, such as the IL-6 dependent cytokine storm and unopposed angiotensin II stimulation, could be responsible for these consequences. Cardiac damage is hypothesized to be a consequence of the direct viral infection of cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased metabolic demand, immunological activation, and microvascular dysfunction. Patients with pre-existing chronic heart failure are therefore at increased risk of decompensation, further heart damage, and significant health deterioration. Based on the aforementioned assumptions, we developed a study aiming to provide a detailed description of changes in biological parameters and cardiac injury markers of patients with heart failure and SARS-CoV-2 infection by correlating them with the clinical presentation and COVID-19 vaccination status, to predict the probability of ICU admission based on their initial hospital presentation. A two-year retrospective study was performed on heart failure patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and detailed records of biological biomarkers;a total of 124 eligible patients with COVID-19 and 236 without COVID-19 were recruited. Patients with heart failure and SARS-CoV-2 infection had significantly elevated baseline biological parameters and cardiac markers compared to those without COVID-19. Several cardiac injury markers were identified as significant independent risk factors for ICU admission: CK-MB (HR = 4.1, CI[2.2C6.9]), myoglobin (HR = 5.0, CI[2.3C7.8]), troponin-I (HR = 7.1[4.4C9.6]) troponin-T (HR = 4.9, CI[1.7C7.4]). The elevation of a basic panel of acute inflammation markers (CRP, IL-6, fibrinogen), D-dimers, and BNP was also a significant risk factor. The follow-up of survivors at four weeks after viral clearance determined a worsened clinical picture by NYHA classification, worsened cardiac ultrasound findings, and a mild improvement in cardiac and inflammatory markers.

We identified a correlation with the disease severity and the reduced expression of several members of the PPAR?3 complex such as EP300, RXRA, RARA, SUMO1, NR3C1, CCDC88A. CHIP-seq analyses confirmed repression of the PPAR?3-RXRA-NR3C1 cistrome in COVID-19 lung samples. Further analysis of protein-protein networks highlighted an interaction between the PPAR?3-associated protein SUMO1 and a nucleoprotein of the SARS virus. Overall, these results demonstrate for the first time, the involvement of the PPAR?3 complex in severe COVID-19 lung disease and suggest strongly its role in the major monocyte / macrophage-mediated inflammatory storm.","output":"PPAR?3 cistrome repression during activation of lung monocyte-macrophages in severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus pandemic significantly changed our lives, leading to long-lasting medical, social, economic, psychological consequences Currently, when the COVID-19 morbidity growth is less galloping, the more important are the issues of long-lasting prognosis, rehabilitation, immunity stability, risk of recurrent infection etc An increased incidence of stress-induced somatic and mental diseases is envisaged Among them, sleep disorders appear to be significant and can result from various reasons: change in habitual life style, work regimen, decrease in physical activity during self-isolation, lesser daylight exposure and greater exposure to artificial light (including screens of electronic devices) The evidence confirms an important role of sleep in human health and wellbeing The paper summarizes data on the role of sleep in immune system regulation We pay special attention to sleep-disordered breathing which is associated with the higher risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and more severe COVID-19 Other sleep disorders, including changes in sleep quality and duration during the pandemic, are also discussed The paper reviews the existing approaches to manage stress-induced sleep disorders which are applicable in the pandemic and can be implemented in rehabilitation procedures ? 2020 All-Russian Public Organization Antihypertensive League All rights reserved","output":"COVID-19: what are the risks for patients with sleep disorders?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Micronics Engineered Filtration Group is moving its corporate headquarters from Portsmouth, New Hampshire to Chattanooga, Tennessee from 1 September 2020","output":"Micronics to relocate HQ to Chattanooga, Tennessee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a widespread and persistent pollutant in the environment.

The coexisting mechanism and the removal of SMX of the consortium were investigated. The total oxidizable carbon (TOC) removal rate of the combined bacterial system was 38.94% compared to 29.45% for the single bacterial system at the same biomass.

The optimum conditions found for SMX degradation were 30 C, pH 7.0, a shaking speed of 160 rmin(?1), and an initial SMX concentration of 200 mgL(?1). The degradation of SMX was accelerated by the addition of YL2 for its ability to metabolize the key intermediate, 4-aminophenol. The removal rate of 4-aminophenol by strain YL2 reached 19.54% after 5 days.

This mechanism, however, requires rare coincidence in space and time between a hybridization event and opening of ecological opportunity, because hybridization generates large genetic variation only locally and it will persist only for a short period. Hence, hybridization seems unlikely to explain recurrent AR in the same lineage. Contrary to these expectations, our evolutionary computer simulations demonstrate that admixture variation can geographically spread and persist for long periods if the hybrid population becomes separated into isolated sub-lineages. Subsequent secondary hybridization of some of these can reestablish genetic polymorphisms from the ancestral hybridization in places far from the birthplace of the hybrid clade and long after the ancestral hybridization event.

CONCLUSIONS.-: COVID-19-associated coagulopathy ranges from mild laboratory alterations to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with a predominant phenotype of thrombotic/multiple organ failure. Characteristically, high D-dimer levels on admission and/or continuously increasing concentrations of D-dimer are associated with disease progression and poor overall survival. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the immune-hemostatic response. Drastic inflammatory responses including, but not limited to, cytokine storm, vasculopathy, and NETosis may contribute to an overwhelming activation of coagulation. Hypercoagulability and systemic thrombotic complications necessitate anticoagulant and thrombolytic interventions, which provide opportunities to prevent or reduce \\"excessive\\" thrombin generation while preserving \\"adaptive\\" hemostasis and bring additional benefit via their anti-inflammatory effect in the setting of COVID-19.","output":"Coagulation Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity of lung involvement is the main prognostic factor in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3), a marker of lung damage and fibrosis, could help predict the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. This was a retrospective and observational study. CA 15-3 was analyzed in the blood samples of patients consecutively admitted for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and whose blood samples were available in the biobank. Other prognostic markers were also measured (interleukin 6 [IL6], C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, troponin T, and NT-ProBNP). The occurrence of in-hospital complications was registered, including death, the need for medical intensive care, and oxygen therapy at discharge. In this study, 539 patients were recruited (54.9% men, mean age: 59.6  16.4 years). At admission, the mean concentrations of CA 15-3 was 20.5  15.8 U/mL, and the concentration was correlated with male sex, older age, and other severity markers of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) (IL6, CRP, D-dimer, troponine T, and NT-ProBNP). CA 15-3 levels were higher in patients who died (n = 56, 10.4%) (35.33  30.45 vs. 18.8  12.11, p < 0.001), who required intensive medical support (n = 78, 14.4%; 31.17  27.83 vs. 18.68  11.83; p < 0.001), and who were discharged with supplemental oxygen (n = 64, 13.3%; 22.65  14.41 vs. 18.2  11.7; p = 0.011). Elevated CA 15-3 levels (above 34.5 U/mL) were a strong predictor of a complicated in-hospital course, in terms of a higher risk of death (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22C11.9, p = 0.022) and need for intensive care (adjusted OR 4.56, 95% CI: 1.37C15.8) after adjusting for all other risk factors. The degree of lung damage and fibrosis evaluated in terms of CA 15-3 concentrations may allow early identification of the increased risk of complications in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","output":"CA 15-3 prognostic biomarker in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the development of the bike-sharing system (BSS) and the introduction of green and low carbon development, the environmental impacts of BSS had received increasing attention in recent years. However, the emissions from the rebalancing of BSS, where fossil-fueled vehicles are commonly used, are usually neglected, which goes against the idea of green travel in a sharing economy. Previous studies on the bike-sharing rebalancing problem (BRP), which is considered NP-hard, have mainly focused on algorithm innovation instead of improving the solution model, thereby hindering the application of many existing models in large-scale BRP. This study then proposes a method for optimizing the CO(2) emissions from BRP and takes the BSS of Beijing as a demonstration. We initially analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of BSS, especially the flow between districts, and find that each district can be independently rebalanced. Afterward, we develop a rebalancing optimization model based on a partitioning strategy to avoid deciding the number of bikes being loaded or unloaded at each parking node. We then employ the tabu search algorithm to solve the model. Results show that (i) due to over launch and lack of planning in rebalancing, the BSS in Beijing shows great potential for optimization, such as by reducing the number of vehicle routes, CO(2) emissions, and unmet demands; (ii) the CO(2) emissions of BSS in Beijing can be reduced by 57.5% by forming balanced parking nodes at the end of the day and decreasing the repetition of vehicle routes and the loads of vehicles; and (iii) the launch amounts of bikes in specific districts, such as Shijingshan and Mentougou, should be increased.","output":"Reducing CO(2) emissions from the rebalancing operation of the bike-sharing system in Beijing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, the governmental response to the COVID-19 pandemic In Ukraine Is described, starting from the first detected cases, up until the summer of 2020 Pandemic caught Ukraine's health care system in the midst of a reform At the time of COVID-19 outbreak, the first steps of primary health care reform were already being implemented while the reform at the secondary health care level were about to started However, changes of the political environment (due to the elections 2019), two changes of the Minister of Health (since the beginning of the pandemic), the absence of the general plan of action followed by the inconsistent political decisions, and the uncertainty in financing mechanisms of the secondary health care facilities, made the COVID-19 pandemic challenging for Ukraine The Ukrainian government had difficulties in devoting additional recourses to medical facilities to protect medical professionals and provide treatment for patients Instead, as a main intervention to combat COVID-19, the government implemented lockdown from 12 of March to 12th of May that only postponed the raise of infections, preserved lives While the pandemic still had a highly negative impact on the economy, initial analysis indicate that lockdown could be considered effective from the economics point of view","output":"Ukrainian response to the COVID-19 pandemic: governmental interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Although the most common neuro-otolaryngological findings associated with COVID-19 infection are chemosensory changes, it should be known that these patients may present with different clinical findings.Case summary: We present a 57-year-old woman who developed progressive hoarseness while suffering from COVID-19 infection without a history of chronic disease or any other etiological cause.

The objective of this study was to determine whether CS is effective at alleviating pain and improving function in patients with knee OA and to identify the factors that explain inconsistencies in clinical trial results. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of randomized, placebo-controlled trials, searching the databases Medline, Cochrane central register for controlled trials and Scopus. Random effects meta-analysis was then performed, using tau2 and I2 statistics to assess heterogeneity. The pain and Lequesne index (LI) scores were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs), with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was explored by stratifying the analyses according to pre-specified study-level characteristics and assessing the sources of funnel plot asymmetry. RESULTS The inclusion criteria yielded 18 trials. Overall, CS significantly but inconsistently reduced pain (SMD: - 0.63; 95% CI: - 0.91, - 0.35; I2 = 94%) and improved function (SMD: - 0.82; 95% CI: - 1.31, - 0.33; I2 = 95%). When limiting the analysis to studies with a low risk of bias, the pharmaceutical grade CS of IBSA origin showed a greater reduction in pain (SMD: - 0.25; 95% CI: - 0.34, - 0.16; I2 = 75%) and function (SMD: - 0.33; 95% CI: - 0.47, - 0.20; I2 = 53%, p = 0.07) compared with the other preparations (SMDPain: - 0.08; 95% CI: - 0.19, + 0.02; I2 = 20%; SMDFunction: - 0.18; 95% CI: - 0.36, +0.01; I2 = 0%). Assessing funnel plot asymmetry in the studies with a low risk of bias, we found strong correlations between the treatment effects and study size (pain: rS = 0.93; LI: rS = 0.86; p < 0.05). Ultimately, there was no residual heterogeneity in the CS effects when the smallest studies were removed from the analyses. CONCLUSION This new meta-analysis suggests that CS provides a moderate benefit for pain and has a large effect on function in knee OA, however with large inconsistency. The risks of bias, brand and study size were the factors explaining heterogeneity among the clinical trial results.","output":"Efficacy of Chondroitin Sulfate in Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Exploring Inconsistencies in Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of delivery of novel levofloxacin/ doxycycline (LEVO/DOX) combination to the brain by intranasal route to achieve a significant local concentration in the brain and a direct nose-to-brain pathway.

This decision will lead to a total reversal of doctors legal duty from the obligation to refuse abortion services to their requirement to provide them, given the Medical Service Act that states that a doctor may not refuse a request for treatment or assistance in childbirth. I argue, confined to abortion services in Korea that will take place in the near future, that doctors should be granted the legal right to exercise conscientious objection to abortion. MAIN TEXT: Considering that doctors in Korea have been ethically and legally obligated to refrain from abortions for many years, imposing a universal legal duty to provide abortions that does not allow exception may endanger the moral integrity of individual doctors who chose a career when abortion was illegal. The universal imposition of such a duty may result in repudiation of doctors as moral agents and damage trust in doctors that forms the basis of medical professionalism. Even if conscientious objection to abortion is granted as a legal right, most patients would experience no impediment to receiving abortion services because the healthcare environment of Korea provides options in which patients can choose their doctors based on prior information, there are many doctors who would be willing to provide an abortion, and Korea is a relatively small country. Finally, the responsibility to effectively balance and guarantee the respective rights of the two agents involved in abortion, the doctor and the patient, should be imposed on the government rather than individual doctors. This assertion is based on the governments past behaviours, the nature of its relationship with doctors, and the capacity it has to satisfy both doctors right to conscientious objection and patients right to legal medical services. CONCLUSION: With regard to abortion services that will be sought in the near future, doctors should be granted the legal right to exercise conscientious objection based on the importance of doctors moral integrity, lack of impediment to patients, and government responsibility.","output":"Conscientious objection to abortion: why it should be a specified legal right for doctors in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Given that this novel virus most notably affects the human respiratory system, early detection may help prevent severe lung damage, save lives, and help prevent further disease spread. Given the constraints on the healthcare facilities and staff, the role of artificial intelligence for automatic diagnosis is critical. The automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 based on medical images is, however, not straightforward. Due to the novelty of the disease, available X-ray datasets are very limited. Furthermore, there is a significant similarity between COVID-19 X-rays and other lung infections. In this paper, these challenges are addressed by proposing an approach consisting of a bag of visual words and a neural network classifier. The proposed method can classify X-ray chest images into non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 with high performance. Three public datasets are used to evaluate the proposed approach. Our best accuracy on the first, second, and third datasets is 96.1, 99.84, and 98 percent. Since detection of COVID-19 is important, sensitivity is used as a criterion. The proposed method's best sensitivities are 90.32, 99.65, and 91 percent on these datasets, respectively.

A contribution of other cellular components, such as natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells, for costimulation blockade-induced xenograft survival has not been clearly defined. We therefore tested the hypothesis that NK or NKT cells would promote rat islet and skin xenograft acceptance in mice. METHODS Lewis rat islets or skin was transplanted into wild type B6 mice or into B6 mice that were Jalpha18(null), CD1(null), or beta2 microglobulin (beta2M)(null) NK 1.1 depleted, or perforin(null). Graft recipients were pretreated with an infusion of donor derived spleen cells and a brief course of anti-CD154 mAb treatments. Additional groups received mAb or cells only. RESULTS We first observed that the depletion of NK1.1 cells does not significantly interfere with graft survival in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. We used NKT cell deficient B6 mice to test the hypothesis that NKT cells are involved in islet and skin xenograft survival in our model. These mice bear a null mutation in the gene for the Jalpha18 component of the T-cell receptor. The component is uniquely associated with NKT cells. We found no difference in islet xenograft survival between Jalpha18(null) and wild type B6 mice. In contrast, median skin graft survival appeared shorter in Jalpha18(null) recipients. These data imply a role for Jalpha18(+) NKT cells in skin xenograft survival in treated mice. In order to confirm this inference, we tested skin xenograft survival in B6 CD1(null) mice because NKT cells are CD1 restricted. Results of these trials demonstrate that the absence of CD1(+) cells adversely affects rat skin graft survival. An additional assay in beta2M(null) mice demonstrated a requirement for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression in the graft host, and we demonstrate that CD1 is the requisite MHC component. We further demonstrated that, unlike reports for allograft survival, skin xenograft survival does not require perforin-secreting NK cells. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that MHC class I(+) CD1(+) Jalpha18(+) NKT cells promote the survival of rat skin but not rat islet xenografts. These studies implicate different mechanisms for inducing and maintaining islet vs. skin xenograft survival in mice treated with donor antigen and anti-CD154 mAb, and further indicate a role for NKT cells but not NK cells in skin xenograft survival.","output":"Natural killer T cell facilitated engraftment of rat skin but not islet xenografts in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: People who inject drugs (PWID) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, have a high prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

We assess the impact of existing and scaled up harm reduction (HR) interventions on HIV and HCV transmission among PWID in Dar es Salaam. METHODS: An HIV and HCV transmission model among PWID in Tanzania was calibrated to data over 2006C2018 on HIV (30% and 67% prevalence in males and females in 2011) and HCV prevalence (16% in 2017), numbers on HR interventions (5254 ever on OAT in 2018, 766C1479 accessing NSP in 2017) and ART coverage (63.1% in 2015). We evaluated the impact of existing interventions in 2019 and impact by 2030 of scaling\\\\up the coverage of OAT (to 50% of PWID), NSP (75%, both combined termed full HR) and ART (81% with 90% virally suppressed) from 2019, reducing sexual HIV transmission by 50%, and/or HCV\\\\treating 10% of PWID infected with HCV annually. RESULTS: The model projects HIV and HCV prevalence of 19.0% (95% credibility interval: 16.4C21.2%) and 41.0% (24.4C49.0%) in 2019, respectively. For HIV, 24.6% (13.6C32.6%) and 70.3% (59.3C77.1%) of incident infections among male and female PWID are sexually transmitted, respectively. Due to their low coverage (22.8% for OAT, 16.3% for NSP in 2019), OAT and NSP averted 20.4% (12.9C24.7%) of HIV infections and 21.7% (17.0C25.2%) of HCV infections in 2019. Existing ART (68.5% coverage by 2019) averted 48.1% (29.7C64.3%) of HIV infections in 2019. Scaling up to full HR will reduce HIV and HCV incidence by 62.6% (52.5C74.0%) and 81.4% (56.7C81.4%), respectively, over 2019C2030; scaled up ART alongside full HR will decrease HIV incidence by 66.8% (55.6C77.5%), increasing to 81.5% (73.7C87.5%) when sexual risk is also reduced.

This may explain the emergence of nonalcoholic fatty liver as the leading cause of liver disease. Several previous studies have addressed the association between thyroid function and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Objectives: To study the impact of weight reduction through lifestyle modifications in adolescents with obesity. Methods: A prospective cohort study was done on 61 adolescents with obesity. Patients were evaluated at the first visit by the full history, clinical examination, and investigations (thyroid profile, lipid profile, liver function tests, HbA1c, and liver ultrasonography) as basal information. The intervention program included a dietary program, increasing physical activity, and decreasing sedentary activity. A postintervention evaluation was done at the end of six months which included anthropometric measures, laboratory results, and ultrasonographic estimation. Results: It was shown that the mean BMI of the participants had significantly decreased after lifestyle modification from (32.05  3.36 kg/m2) to (28.1  2.77 kg/m2) (P < 0.001). It also showed that the percentage of studied adolescents with elevated TSH decreased from 47.5% to 19.7% after the weight reduction program.

The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the use of the diet worldwide. METHODS With the use of the Internet, e-mail requests for information about international ketogenic diet centers (outside the United States) were made over a 9-month period. Assistance also was obtained from the Child Neurology Society and International League Against Epilepsy. Questions included patient enrollment (total and annually), year the diet was first offered, unique cultural and religious issues in the country, community opinion, and research interests. RESULTS Successful communication was made with 73 academic centers in 41 countries outside the United States. Sixteen (39%) countries provided information from multiple centers. The median duration offering the diet was 8 years (range, 1-45 years). The average number of patients enrolled to date was 71.6 per country, with 5.4 new patients annually. Common difficulties included avoiding rice intake, tolerating higher fat-to-protein and carbohydrate ratios (e.g., 4:1), finding specific nutritional labels on foods, and handling the growing interest from large populations with limited resources. Nevertheless, cultural and religious issues were generally not limiting; physician and patient acceptance of the diet as an option is high; and most meals were similar among countries. Centers often had great pride in their programs, and international collaborative groups are forming rapidly.

This fusion process is mediated by at least three classes of fusion proteins (Class I, II, and III) based on the protein sequence and structure. For Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), the glycoprotein Gc (Class II fusion protein) mediates this fusion event following entry into the endocytic pathway, allowing the viral genome access to the cell cytoplasm. Here, we show that peptides analogous to the RVFV Gc stem region inhibited RVFV infectivity in cell culture by inhibiting the fusion process. Further, we show that infectivity can be inhibited for diverse, unrelated RNA viruses that have Class I (Ebola virus), Class II (Andes virus), or Class III (vesicular stomatitis virus) fusion proteins using this single peptide. Our findings are consistent with an inhibition mechanism similar to that proposed for stem peptide fusion inhibitors of dengue virus in which the RVFV inhibitory peptide first binds to both the virion and cell membranes, allowing it to traffic with the virus into the endocytic pathway. Upon acidification and rearrangement of Gc, the peptide is then able to specifically bind to Gc and prevent fusion of the viral and endocytic membranes, thus inhibiting viral infection. These results could provide novel insights into conserved features among the three classes of viral fusion proteins and offer direction for the future development of broadly active fusion inhibitors.","output":"A Fusion-Inhibiting Peptide against Rift Valley Fever Virus Inhibits Multiple, Diverse Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Well-labeled datasets of chest radiographs (CXRs) are difficult to acquire due to the high cost of annotation. Thus, it is desirable to learn a robust and transferable representation in an unsupervised manner to benefit tasks that lack labeled data. Unlike natural images, medical images have their own domain prior;e.g., we observe that many pulmonary diseases, such as the COVID-19, manifest as changes in the lung tissue texture rather than the anatomical structure. Therefore, we hypothesize that studying only the texture without the influence of structure variations would be advantageous for downstream prognostic and predictive modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose a generative framework, the Lung Swapping Autoencoder (LSAE), that learns factorized representations of a CXR to disentangle the texture factor from the structure factor. Specifically, by adversarial training, the LSAE is optimized to generate a hybrid image that preserves the lung shape in one image but inherits the lung texture of another.

People with HF experience substantial burden that includes low exercise tolerance, poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), increased risk of mortality and hospital admission, and high healthcare costs. The previous (2014) Cochrane systematic review reported that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) compared to no exercise control shows improvement in HRQoL and hospital admission among people with HF, as well as possible reduction in mortality over the longer term, and that these reductions appear to be consistent across patient and programme characteristics. Limitations noted by the authors of this previous Cochrane Review include the following: (1) most trials were undertaken in patients with HF with reduced (< 45%) ejection fraction (HFrEF), and women, older people, and those with preserved ( 45%) ejection fraction HF (HFpEF) were under-represented; and (2) most trials were undertaken in the hospital/centre-based setting. OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation on mortality, hospital admission, and health-related quality of life of people with heart failure. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases on 29 January 2018. We also checked the bibliographies of systematic reviews and two trial registers. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials that compared exercise-based CR interventions with six months' or longer follow-up versus a no exercise control that could include usual medical care. The study population comprised adults (> 18 years) with evidence of HF - either HFrEF or HFpEF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened all identified references and rejected those that were clearly ineligible for inclusion in the review. We obtained full papers of potentially relevant trials. Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials, assessed their risk of bias, and performed GRADE analyses. MAIN RESULTS We included 44 trials (5783 participants with HF) with a median of six months' follow-up. For this latest update, we identified 11 new trials (N = 1040), in addition to the previously identified 33 trials. Although the evidence base includes predominantly patients with HFrEF with New York Heart Association classes II and III receiving centre-based exercise-based CR programmes, a growing body of studies include patients with HFpEF and are undertaken in a home-based setting. All included studies included a no formal exercise training intervention comparator. However, a wide range of comparators were seen across studies that included active intervention (i.e. education, psychological intervention) or usual medical care alone. The overall risk of bias of included trials was low or unclear, and we downgraded results using the GRADE tool for all but one outcome.Cardiac rehabilitation may make little or no difference in all-cause mortality over the short term ( one year of follow-up) (27 trials, 28 comparisons (2596 participants): intervention 67/1302 (5.1%) vs control 75/1294 (5.8%); risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.21; low-quality GRADE evidence) but may improve all-cause mortality in the long term (> 12 months follow up) (6 trials/comparisons (2845 participants): intervention 244/1418 (17.2%) vs control 280/1427 (19.6%) events): RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02; high-quality evidence). Researchers provided no data on deaths due to HF. CR probably reduces overall hospital admissions in the short term (up to one year of follow-up) (21 trials, 21 comparisons (2182 participants): (intervention 180/1093 (16.5%) vs control 258/1089 (23.7%); RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.83; moderate-quality evidence, number needed to treat: 14) and may reduce HF-specific hospitalisation (14 trials, 15 comparisons (1114 participants): (intervention 40/562 (7.1%) vs control 61/552 (11.1%) RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84; low-quality evidence, number needed to treat: 25). After CR, a clinically important improvement in short-term disease-specific health-related quality of life may be evident (Minnesota Living With Heart Failure questionnaire - 17 trials, 18 comparisons (1995 participants): mean difference (MD) -7.11 points, 95% CI -10.49 to -3.73; low-quality evidence). Pooling across all studies, regardless of the HRQoL measure used, shows there may be clinically important improvement with exercise (26 trials, 29 comparisons (3833 participants); standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.60, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.39; I2 = 87%; Chi2 = 215.03; low-quality evidence). ExCR effects appeared to be consistent different models of ExCR delivery: centre vs. home-based, exercise dose, exercise only vs. comprehensive programmes, and aerobic training alone vs aerobic plus resistance programmes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This updated Cochrane Review provides additional randomised evidence (11 trials) to support the conclusions of the previous version (2014) of this Cochane Review. Compared to no exercise control, CR appears to have no impact on mortality in the short term (< 12 months' follow-up). Low- to moderate-quality evidence shows that CR probably reduces the risk of all-cause hospital admissions and may reduce HF-specific hospital admissions in the short term (up to 12 months). CR may confer a clinically important improvement in health-related quality of life, although we remain uncertain about this because the evidence is of low quality. Future ExCR trials need to continue to consider the recruitment of traditionally less represented HF patient groups including older, female, and HFpEF patients, and alternative CR delivery settings including home- and using technology-based programmes.","output":"Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic forces educational institutions to divert from traditional face-to-face classes to online classes.

METHODS Three-dimensional medical modeling was pursued early in the planning process and was used to estimate the soft-tissue requirements for reconstruction and to design custom tissue expanders. RESULTS The reconstructive effort required postponement until respiratory status was optimized. Even with elaborate preoperative planning, primary closure of the abdomen was limited because of tissue edema and other less predictable patient factors. Delayed closure of the abdominal wall was made possible with negative-pressure wound therapy and secondary flap advancements.

Medical students need to be sufficiently proficient in AI, its advantages to improve healthcare's expenses, quality, and access. Similarly, students must be educated about the shortfalls of AI such as bias, transparency, and liability. Overlooking a technology that will be transformative for the foreseeable future would place medical students at a disadvantage. However, there has been little interest in researching a proper method to implement AI in the medical education curriculum. This study aims to review the current literature that covers the attitudes of medical students towards AI, implementation of AI in the medical curriculum, and describe the need for more research in this area. METHODS: An integrative review was performed to combine data from various research designs and literature. Pubmed, Medline (Ovid), GoogleScholar, and Web of Science articles between 2010 and 2020 were all searched with particular inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text of the selected articles was analyzed using the Extension of Technology Acceptance Model and the Diffusions of Innovations theory. Data were successively pooled together, recorded, and analyzed quantitatively using a modified Hawkings evaluation form. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was utilized to help improve reporting. RESULTS: A total of 39 articles meeting inclusion criteria were identified.

CASE REPORTS: A 30-year-old presented with 2 weeks of left upper extremity symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Duplex ultrasound demonstrated axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis and venogram confirmed total occlusion of the axillary and subclavian veins with profuse collaterals around the occlusion. Suction thrombectomy was performed successfully and veins remained patent at 6 month follow up. The patient declined first rib resection and stopped lifting weights. A 16-year-old presented with 4 days of right arm symptoms 1 month after testing positive for COVID-19. Duplex ultrasound revealed acute axillary and subclavian vein thrombosis and she underwent successful thrombectomy followed by balloon angioplasty with improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has strained health care resources such that the treatment of non-life-threatening conditions must be triaged to conserve resources. While axillary-subclavian venous occlusion is usually not life-threatening, timely treatment leads to decreased morbidity and better outcomes. Percutaneous aspiration and thrombectomy without adjunctive thrombolysis may be of benefit in reducing healthcare resource utilization while still achieving good outcomes during the COVID pandemic and beyond.","output":"Surgical Considerations in the Treatment of Axillary-Subclavian Venous Thrombosis in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I am just starting my career as a cancer biologist, but I have always been a Black man in America.

Persistent and/or recurrent COVID-19 has not yet been demonstrated in this population. We identified patients with B-cell lymphomas as having a particularly high risk for persistent SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Subsequent analysis of patients with lymphoid malignancies and COVID-19 identified discrete risk factors for severity of primary infection as compared to disease chronicity. Active therapy and diminished T-cell counts were key drivers of acute mortality in lymphoma patients with COVID-19 infection. Conversely, B-cell depleting therapy was the primary driver of re-hospitalization for COVID-19. In patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we observed high levels of viral entropy consistent with intrahost viral evolution, particularly in patients with impaired CD8+ T-cell immunity. These results suggest that persistent COVID-19 infection is likely to remain a risk in patients with impaired adaptive immunity and that additional therapeutic strategies are needed to enable viral clearance in this high-risk population. Statement of Significance We establish persistent symptomatic COVID-19 infection as a novel clinical syndrome in patients with lymphoid malignancies and identify B-cell depletion as the key immunologic driver of persistent infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate ongoing intrahost viral evolution in patients with persistent COVID-19 infection, particularly in patients with impaired CD8+ T-cell immunity.","output":"Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with lymphoid malignancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than half a century has already passed since the production of nonwovens began in Japan.

Based on the past contribution of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) and immune-based therapies as a treatment option in crucial pathogen outbreaks, we aimed to summarize potential therapeutic strategies that could be helpful to stop further spread of SARS-CoV-2 by effecting its structural components or modulation of immune responses. Several TCM with or without modification could be effective against the structural protein, enzymes, and nucleic acid should be tested from available libraries or to identify their immune-stimulatory activities to enhance several antiviral biological agents for effective elimination of SARS-CoV-2 from the host. TCM is not only effective in the direct inhibition of virus attachment and internalization in a cell but can also prevent their replication and can also help to boost up host immune response. Immune-modulatory effects of TCMs may lead to new medications and can guide us for the scientific validity of drug development.

A recent report investigated the relationship between substance use disorders (SUD) and the risk of severe COVID-19 in the United States and concluded that the risk of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 is directly correlated with substance abuse, including opioid use disorder (OUD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD). While we found this analysis fascinating, we believe this observation may be biased due to comorbidities (such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) confounding the direct impact of SUD on severe COVID-19 illness. To objectively answer this question, we sought to investigate the causal relationship between substance abuse and medication-taking history (as a proxy trait for comorbidities) with the risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Our Mendelian randomization analysis confirms the causal relationship between SUD and severe COVID-19 illness but hints at a negative causal effect for cannabinoids. Given that a great deal of COVID-19 mortality is attributed to disturbed immune regulation, the possible modulatory impact of cannabinoids in alleviating cytokine storms merits further investigation.","output":"Substance abuse and the risk of severe COVID-19: Mendelian randomization confirms the causal role of opioids but hints a negative causal effect for cannabinoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marine crustacean waste has not been fully utilized and is a rich source of chitin.

METHODS: Patients with acute TBF requiring early decompression were prospectively collected. The enrolled patients were randomly assigned to TXA and control group, in which wound surface was soaked with TXA or the same volume of normal saline for 5 min after wound incision, respectively. The total blood loss (TBL), intraoperative blood loss (IBL), postoperative blood loss (PBL), hemoglobin (HGB) levels on preoperatively (pre-op) and postoperatively, and amount of allogenic blood transfusion were recorded. Furthermore, the general information was also compared between groups. RESULTS: There were 39 and 37 patients enrolled in TXA and control group for final analysis. The demographics data showed no significant difference between groups (P > 0.05), but operation time and IBL were significantly decreased in TXA group (P < 0.05). Further analysis showed that HGB level was significantly higher in the TXA group at POD1, while the TBL and PBL were significantly less than those in the control group (P < 0.05), but similar to HBL (P > 0.05). The postoperative ambulation time, removal time of drainage tube, length of hospital stay, and blood transfusion rate were also significantly less in TXA group (P < 0.05). At the final follow-up, no neurological deteriorations and no TXA-related complications were observed in both groups.

Rsultats Au total, 18 patients avec une infection  SARS-CoV-2 prouve prsentaient un pneumothorax. Le sex-ratio tait dune femme pour 17 hommes. Lage moyen au moment du diagnostic tait de 68 ans. Six (33,3 %) taient ags de moins de 60 ans. Dans notre cohorte, sept patients (38,8 %) taient hospitaliss en service de mdecine conventionnelle et 11 patients (61,1 %) taient hospitaliss en ranimation. Le mode de ventilation tait recueilli. Dix patients (55,5 %) taient intubs et bnficiaient dune ventilation mcanique lors de la survenue du pneumothorax. Un patient tait sous Optiflow? (5,5 %). Cinq (27,7 %) dentre eux taient traits par oxygnothrapie simple au masque ou aux lunettes. Deux patients (11,1 %) ont prsent un pneumothorax en air ambiant, sans assistance ventilatoire. La prise en charge thrapeutique consistait, pour la majorit des cas (14 patients, 77 %), en une pose de drain thoracique. Quatre patients (22,3 %) ntaient pas drains soit en raison de ltendue minime du pneumothorax soit le risque opratoire ne permettait pas un tel geste.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of college students in Ireland was undertaken in 2018. Data on 5201 students from 13 higher education institutions (HEIs) were analyzed. Stress, anxiety, and depression symptom scores based on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were calculated and reported, with statistical testing used to compare across groups. RESULTS: Overall, 29.6% and 19.1% of respondents were classified in the mild to moderate and severe to extremely severe range for depression respectively. The corresponding proportions were 25.9% and 20.7% for anxiety, and 24.5% and 14.8% for stress. Differences across groups included higher levels of psychological distress for transgender and female students compared to males (p < 0.01), for gay/lesbian/bisexual students compared to heterosexuals (p < 0.01), for undergraduates compared to postgraduates (p < 0.01), for students from intermediate/technical/service/unskilled social classes compared to professional/self-employed social classes (p < 0.01), and for those with financial difficulties compared to those without financial difficulties (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of psychological distress were high amongst college students in Ireland prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with substantial differences across groups.

The absence of mass testing and the relevant presence of asymptomatic individuals causes the available data of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil to be largely under-reported regarding the number of infected individuals and deaths. We propose an adapted Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model which explicitly incorporates the under-reporting and the response of the population to public policies (such as confinement measures, widespread use of masks, etc) to cast short-term and long-term predictions. Large amounts of uncertainty could provide misleading models and predictions. In this paper, we discuss the role of uncertainty in these prediction, which is illustrated regarding three key aspects. First, assuming that the number of infected individuals is under-reported, we demonstrate an anticipation regarding the peak of infection. Furthermore, while a model with a single class of infected individuals yields forecasts with increased peaks, a model that considers both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals suggests a decrease of the peak of symptomatic. Second, considering that the actual amount of deaths is larger than what is being register, then demonstrate the increase of the mortality rates. Third, when consider generally under-reported data, we demonstrate how the transmission and recovery rate model parameters change qualitatively and quantitatively. We also investigate the effect of the \\"COVID-19 under-reporting tripod\\", i.e. the under-reporting in terms of infected individuals, of deaths and the true mortality rate.

Despite C19+ participants reporting subjective olfactory dysfunction, few showed signs of objectively altered function one year later. Critically, all but one individual in the C19+ group had reduced olfactory bulb volume with an average volume reduction of 14.3%, but this did not amount to a significant between group difference compared to the control group (2.3% reduction) using inference statistics. No morphological differences in cerebral olfactory areas were found but we found stronger functional connectivity between olfactory brain areas in the C19+ croup at the post measure.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Program-specific documents, pre-existing, and related to COVID-19; documents from national and international kidney agencies; national and international webinars, including webinars that we hosted for input and feedback; with additional information from formal and informal review of published academic literature. METHODS: Challenges in the care of patients with advanced CKD during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted within the Canadian Senior Renal Leaders Forum discussion group. The Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) developed the COVID-19 rapid response team (RRT) to address these challenges. They identified a lead with expertise in advanced CKD who identified further nephrologists and administrators to form the workgroup. A nation-wide survey of advanced CKD clinics was conducted. The initial guidance document was drafted and members of the workgroup reviewed and discussed all suggestions in detail via email and a virtual meeting. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The document was reviewed by the CSN COVID-19 RRT, an ethicist and an infection control expert. The suggestions were presented at a CSN-sponsored interactive webinar, attended by 150 kidney health care professionals, for further peer input. The document was also sent for further feedback to experts who had participated in the initial survey. Final revisions were made based on feedback received until April 28, 2020. Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease (CJKHD) editors reviewed the parallel process peer review and edited the manuscript for clarity. KEY FINDINGS: We identified 11 broad areas of advanced CKD care management that may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) clinic visit scheduling, (2) clinic visit type, (3) provision of multidisciplinary care, (4) bloodwork, (5) patient education/support, (6) home-based monitoring essentials, (7) new referrals to multidisciplinary care clinic, (8) kidney replacement therapy, (9) medications, (10) personal protective equipment, and (11) COVID-19 risk in CKD.

Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, and several vaccines are currently available. Efforts need to be undertaken to counter the threat of the global COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We generated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, EBY100/pYD1-RBD, in which the full-length receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was expressed on the surface of yeast. Mice vaccinated orally with unadjuvanted EBY100/pYD1-RBD could produce significant humoral and mucosal responses as well as robust cellular immune responses. Notably, EBY100/pYD1-RBD elicited a mixed Th1/Th2-type cellular immune response with a Th1-biased immune response in a mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of the RBD as a key target to design and develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and provide evidence of oral administration of a S. cerevisiae-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine eliciting significant immune responses. Most importantly, the S. cerevisiae surface display system can serve as a universal technology platform and be applied to develop other oral viral or bacterial vaccines.","output":"Immune response induced by oral administration with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surgery is a demanding field, requiring determination and emotional stability.

The SARS-CoV-2 S RBD is a major target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that block RBD - ACE2 interactions. In this report, NAb-RBD binding epitopes in the protein databank were classified as C1, C1D, C2, C3, or C4, using a RBD binding profile (BP), based on NAb-specific RBD buried surface area and used to predict the binding epitopes of a series of uncharacterized NAbs. Naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence variation was also quantified to predict NAb binding sensitivities to the RBD-variants. NAb and ACE2 binding studies confirmed the NAb classifications and determined whether the RBD variants enhanced ACE2 binding to promote viral infectivity, and/or disrupted NAb binding to evade the host immune response. Of 9 single RBD mutants evaluated, K417T, E484K, and N501Y disrupted binding of 65% of the NAbs evaluated, consistent with the assignment of the SARS-CoV-2 P.1 Japan/Brazil strain as a variant of concern (VoC). RBD variants E484K and N501Y exhibited ACE2 binding equivalent to a Wuhan-1 reference SARS-CoV-2 RBD. While slightly less disruptive to NAb binding, L452R enhanced ACE2 binding affinity. Thus, the L452R mutant, associated with the SARS-CoV-2 California VoC (B.1.427/B.1.429-California), has evolved to enhance ACE2 binding, while simultaneously disrupting C1 and C2 NAb classes.

In this paper, we describe the framework for development of the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) CPPD Core Domain Sets. METHODS The OMERACT CPPD working group performed a scoping literature review and qualitative interview study. Generated outcomes were presented at the 2020 OMERACT CPPD virtual Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting with discussion focused on whether different core domain sets should be developed for different calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) clinical presentations and how the future CPPD Core Domain Set may overlap with already established osteoarthritis (OA) domains. These discussions informed development of a future work plan for development of the OMERACT CPPD Core Domain Sets. FINDINGS Domains identified from a scoping review of 112 studies and a qualitative interview study of 36 people (28 patients with CPPD, 7 health care professionals, one stakeholder) were mapped to core areas of OMERACT Filter 2.1. The majority of SIG participants agreed there was need to develop separate core domain sets for \\"short term\\" and \\"long term\\" studies of CPPD. Although CPPD + OA is common and core domain sets for OA have been established, participants agreed that existing OA core domain sets should not influence the development of OMERACT core domain sets for CPPD.

Acupuncture is a traditional rehabilitation technique in China, which has been used in rehabilitation for COPD. But whether acupuncture can improve the diaphragm function of COPD patients remains to be verified. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the rehabilitation effects of acupuncture on diaphragm dysfunction in patients with COPD. METHODS: The authors retrieved in CNKI, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, Ebsco, Web of Science, from inception to November 2020, for relevant randomized control trials. Two researchers independently screened the articles and extracted the data. The quality of the included studies was evaluated by Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. The primary outcome measures were maximal inspiratory pressure and the scale for accessory respiratory muscle mobilization, the secondary outcome measures were pulmonary function-related indicators and arterial blood gas indicators. RESULTS: Nine articles were finally obtained. Seven studies added acupuncture to standard treatment for patients with diaphragm dysfunction in COPD and found statistically significant changes in the maximum inspiratory pressure and the scale for accessory respiratory muscle mobilization. Two studies have proved that use acupuncture combined with other Traditional Chinese Medicine methods in the rehabilitation for COPD can effectively improve the diaphragm strength and diaphragmatic motor performance. Seven studies showed that acupuncture has obvious improvement in pulmonary ventilation function. Seven studies reported significant differences in arterial blood gas pre- to post-intervention. CONCLUSION: This systematic review found that acupuncture can effectively enhance the diaphragm strength, relieve respiratory muscle fatigue, it can also play a promoting role in improving lung function, hypoxia, and carbon dioxide retention, as well as preventing and alleviating respiratory failure.

Guidance on how to handle and safely continue such trials is lacking. Chronically ill elderly individuals require-in addition to protection from infection-regular physical exercise and social contact to remain healthy. Solutions on how to handle these conflicting necessities are needed. The ENTAIER-randomised controlled trial was investigating the influence of mindful movements on fall risk, fear of falling, mobility, balance, life quality, and other outcomes. The study population was planned to comprise of 550 chronically ill elderly individuals with a high risk of falling. The movements were regularly performed in coached groups over 6 months. After the trial began, COVID-19 lockdowns stopped all in-person meetings, and it was expected that the limitations of this pandemic would continue for a long term. Therefore, the exercise programme, which involved complex movements and was typically conducted face-to-face in groups, had to be substituted by a telemedicine programme within a short timeframe. The objectives, therefore, were to identify challenges and tasks that could to be resolved and steps that could to be taken to achieve high-quality, efficacy, safety, and enable human encounter and motivation. METHODS: We proceeded with four steps: 1) A literature review on the quality and feasibility issues of telemedicine in general, and specifically, in exercise training in elderly individuals. 2) Participation in two international telemedicine task forces on integrative medicine, particularly, mind-body medicine. 3) Interviews with study therapists, (for practical purposes, eurythmy therapists and Tai Chi teachers are summarized here as therapists) personnel, and international experts on providing mindful movement exercises and other physiotherapies via live telecommunication technology, and with scientists and patient representatives. 4) Final evaluation by the core trial team and subsequent planning and implementation of changes in the trial organisation. RESULTS: Various tasks and challenges were identified: for the technical equipment for therapists and patients; for the ability of therapists and trial participants to adequately manage the technology and telemedicine intervention; the reservations and concerns about the technology among therapists and participants; safety and data protection in using the technology; and study design. The two major options found on how to continue the trial in the COVID-19 situation were a complete switch to telemedicine and a partial switch in the form of risk management implemented into the former design. CONCLUSIONS: The management of an ongoing clinical trial in a national or international crisis with a minimum of available time and extra financial resources, alongside with two checklists on steps and procedures for trial continuation and telemedicine implementation, may be informative for other researchers or healthcare providers faced with similar challenges and making similar decisions in the current situation or similar future scenarios.

While knowledge\\\\based assessment can be evaluated via remote exams, soft skills (e.g., reflections on the topic of death) can often be overlooked. This study aims to quantitatively investigate how different anatomy course formats play a role in initiating students reflections on life's passing, during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHOD: In the fall semester of 2020, 216 medical, dental, premedical undergraduate, and health sciences students from 14 international universities discussed (in small groups) differences in their anatomy courses as part of an online exchange program. Formats of anatomy education delivery in the 14 universities ranged from dissection, hybrid dissection\\\\prosection, and prosection only, to no laboratory exposure during the pandemic. Students responses to the question, Did/does your Anatomy course initiate your thinking on life's passing? were collected utilizing a multiple\\\\choice question and a short essay. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi\\\\square analysis. RESULTS: 105 students dissected (group 1), 21 had a hybrid dissection\\\\prosection class (group 2), and 79 had no dissection (group 3). 11 students did not have an anatomy course. Within the 3 groups, 149 students had exposure to human anatomical specimens and 52 students did not. A majority of students in groups 1 and 2 reported that the anatomy course helped them to initiate reflections on the topic of death, compared to those in group 3 (75% and 71% respectively, versus 36%, p<0.05). The majority of students who had exposure to human anatomical specimens thought that the course did initiate thoughts about life's passing, compared to students who did not have this exposure (p<0.05). Students who did not dissect during the time of the pandemic felt that talking with their peers who did dissect during this period (i.e., at schools that did offer dissection) resulted in initiating thoughts about the topic of death. DISCUSSION: Anatomy dissection courses and exposure to human anatomical specimens help initiate reflection on the topic of life's passing. During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic interactions between students who do not dissect and their peers who do dissect help initiate thoughts about the topic of death in the non\\\\dissecting students, as reflected by their essays. Without exposure to human bodies there is less chance that students will think about this subject. CONCLUSION: Anatomy dissection courses are important for the initiation of students feelings about the topic of death.

Nationwide control measures, including vaccination of poultry, were implemented in 2005, leading to a sharp reduction in H5N1 virus outbreaks. In 2008, novel non-N1 subtype (H5Nx) viruses emerged, gradually replacing the dominant H5N1 subtype and causing global outbreaks. The cause of this major shift in the ecology of HPAI H5 viruses remains unknown. Here, we show that major H5N1 virus lineages underwent population bottlenecks in 2006, followed by a recovery in virus populations between 2007 and 2009. Our analyses indicate that control measures, not competition from H5Nx viruses, were responsible for the H5N1 decline, with an H5N1 lineage capable of infecting poultry and wild birds experiencing a less severe population bottleneck due to circulation in unaffected wild birds. We show that H5Nx viruses emerged during the successful suppression of H5N1 virus populations in poultry, providing an opportunity for antigenically distinct H5Nx viruses to propagate. Avian influenza vaccination programs would benefit from universal vaccines targeting a wider diversity of influenza viruses to prevent the emergence of novel subtypes. IMPORTANCE A major shift in the ecology of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 viruses occurred from 2008 to 2014, when viruses with non-N1 neuraminidase genes (termed H5Nx viruses) emerged and caused global H5 virus outbreaks. Here, we demonstrate that nationwide control measures, including vaccination in China, successfully suppressed H5N1 populations in poultry, providing an opportunity for antigenically distinct H5Nx viruses to emerge. In particular, we show that the widespread use of H5N1 vaccines likely conferred a fitness advantage to H5Nx viruses due to the antigenic mismatch of the neuraminidase genes. These results indicate that avian influenza vaccination programs would benefit from universal vaccines that target a wider diversity of influenza viruses to prevent potential emergence of novel subtypes.","output":"H5Nx Viruses Emerged during the Suppression of H5N1 Virus Populations in Poultry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heat treatment can modify the allergenic potential, reducing allergenicity in specific proteins.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine key themes and topics of English-language COVID-19-related tweets posted by individuals and to explore the trends and variations in how the COVID-19-related tweets, key topics, and associated sentiments changed over a period of time from before to after the disease was declared a pandemic. METHODS: Building on the emergent stream of studies examining COVID-19-related tweets in English, we performed a temporal assessment covering the time period from January 1 to May 9, 2020, and examined variations in tweet topics and sentiment scores to uncover key trends. Combining data from two publicly available COVID-19 tweet data sets with those obtained in our own search, we compiled a data set of 13.9 million English-language COVID-19-related tweets posted by individuals. We use guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to infer themes and topics underlying the tweets, and we used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis to compute sentiment scores and examine weekly trends for 17 weeks.

The aim of this study was to explore trends in infant mortality rates (IMR) and stillbirth rates by socio-economic position (SEP) in Scotland, between 2000 and 2018, inclusive. METHODS: Data for live births, infant deaths, and stillbirths between 2000 and 2018 were obtained from National Records of Scotland. Annual IMR and stillbirth rates were calculated and visualised for all of Scotland and when stratified by SEP. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the association between SEP and infant mortality and stillbirth events, and to assess for break points in trends over time. The slope (SII) and relative (RII) index of inequality compared absolute and relative socio-economic inequalities in IMR and stillbirth rates before and after 2010. RESULTS: IMR fell from 5.7 to 3.2 deaths per 1000 live births between 2000 and 2018, with no change in trend identified. Stillbirth rates were relatively static between 2000 and 2008 but experienced accelerated reduction from 2009 onwards. When stratified by SEP, inequalities in IMR and stillbirth rates persisted throughout the study and were greatest amongst the sub-group of post-neonates. Although comparison of the SII and RII in IMR and stillbirths before and after 2010 suggested that inequalities remained stable, descriptive trends in mortality rates displayed a 3-year rise in the most deprived quintiles from 2016 onwards. CONCLUSION: Whilst Scotland has experienced downward trends in IMR and stillbirth rates between 2000 and 2018, the persistence of socio-economic inequalities and suggestion that mortality rates amongst the most deprived groups may be worsening warrants further action to improve maternal health and strengthen support for families with young children.","output":"Trends in infant mortality and stillbirth rates in Scotland by socio-economic position, 2000C2018: a longitudinal ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phospholipid monolayers at oil-water interfaces are used for various biological applications and often formed by vesicle adsorption. However, the adsorbed structures are not well characterized; therefore, fundamental investigation on vesicle adsorption behavior is necessary for correct understanding of the monolayer systems. Herein, we investigated the adsorption of phosphatidylcholine vesicles onto silicone oil-water interfaces using fluorescence microscopy and pendant drop tensiometry. The interfacial monolayer coverage, S, was determined by assuming S = 1 for tightly packed monolayers. Adsorption for 10 min with a lipid concentration of 0.2 mM resulted in S  0.4. An increase in lipid concentration (0.5-2 mM) and adsorption time (1 h) moderately increased monolayer coverage (S  0.6). However, extended adsorption for 24 h only slightly increased coverage (S  0.7). Monolayers with an S < 0.6 were homogeneous while those with an S > 0.6 were associated with several vesicular structures. The surface density of these bound vesicles increased with increasing S. We conclude that vesicles readily fused with the interface to form monolayers at S < 0.6 and that their fusogenicity considerably decreased at S > 0.6. These results demonstrate that the ability of vesicles to form monolayers is determined by the interfacial coverage.","output":"Determination of the Coverage of Phosphatidylcholine Monolayers Formed at Silicone Oil-Water Interfaces by Vesicle Fusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article addresses the problem of replication among smart cities in the European Commission's Horizon 2020: Smart Cities and Communities (EC-H2020-SCC) framework programme. This article initially sets the general policy context by conducting a benchmarking about the explicit replication strategies followed by each of the 17 ongoing EC-H2020-SCC lighthouse projects. This article aims to shed light on the following research question: Why might replication not be happening among smart cities as a unidirectional, hierarchical, mechanistic, solutionist, and technocratic process? Particularly, in asking so, it focuses on the EC-H2020-SCC Replicate project by examining in depth the fieldwork action research process implemented during 2019 through a knowledge exchange webinar series with participant stakeholders from six European cities-three lighthouse cities (St. Sebastian, Florence, and Bristol) and three follower-fellow cities (Essen, Lausanne, and Nilufer). This process resulted in a City-to-City Learning Programme that reformulated the issue of replication by experimenting an alternative and an enhanced policy approach. Thus, stemming from the evidence-based policy outcomes of the City-to-City Learning Programme, this article reveals that a replication policy approach from the social innovation lenses might be enabled as a multidirectional, radial, dynamic, iterative, and democratic learning process, overcoming the given unidirectional, hierarchical, mechanistic, solutionist, and technocratic approach.","output":"Replicating Smart Cities: The City-to-City Learning Programme in the Replicate EC-H2020-SCC Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus pandemic has been recognized as a global threat across the world and many methods were adopted for the prevention of this disease. This pandemic has caused global and economic disruption which resulted in numerous Covid-19 cases across the world. To know the number of cases and keep a track of this pandemic situation we need to collect the live data sets from the worldwide corona virus records. This can be achieved by the technique of Web Scraping which enables the extraction of live data sets from a specific platform. It facilitates the user to access the World Wide Web wherein specific data is gathered, copied from the web and then it is stored in a central local database then provides ways to retrieve and analyse the data. This estimate is to design a platform where you can obtain the live data sets and have a compact knowledge about the present scenario. This is an elementary approach to scrap the live data sets through a user interface from the Worldometer Covid-19 data set with the aid of a Google voice assistant. To implement this scheme, we use the Python programming language. To effectuate this task, we acquire the process of making API calls to the Worldometer Covid-19 website and simultaneously we will make use of the regular expressions to extract the data from the web page. However, this action includes a series of tactics that has to be recognized analysed and accomplished sequentially. Initially the input is given by the user in the form of speech. Then the required contents are searched and matched with the users input.

The purpose of this study was to develop a score that incorporates both preoperative and intraoperative factors so that it could be used for patients admitted to a cardiac surgical intensive care unit (ICU) immediately after surgery. METHOD Preoperative and intraoperative data from 30,350 patients in four hospitals were used to build a multiple logistic regression model estimating 30-day mortality after cardiac surgery. Sixty percent of the patients were used as a derivation group and forty percent as a validation group. RESULTS Mortality occurred in 2.6% of patients (n = 790). Preoperative factors identified in the model were age, female sex, emergency status, pulmonary hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, renal dysfunction, diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, history of alcohol abuse, and refusal of blood products. Intraoperative risk factors included the need for an intra-aortic balloon pump, ventricular assist device or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation leaving the operating room, presence of any intraoperative complication reported by the surgeon, the use of inotropes, high-dose vasopressors, red blood cell transfusion, and cardiopulmonary bypass time. When used after surgery at ICU admission, the model had C-statistics of 0.86 in both derivation and validation sets to estimate the 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative and intraoperative variables can be used on admission to a cardiac surgical ICU to estimate 30-day mortality.

Prior academic research is limited in the extent to which it can account for this heterogeneity because (1) it has evaluated effects of remote work on workers and organizations that have self-selected into remote work arrangements, and (2) has paid little attention to the role that job characteristics play in determining the impact of remote work. This research note overcomes these limitations and explicates factors that account for the diverse impacts of remote work arrangements. We utilize the context of exogenously imposed remote work arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate whether effects of remote work on employee outcomes differ systematically based on the extent to which employees work-related tasks are characterized by the need for human proximity (NHP) and whether the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have differential impacts on employee outcomes in low and high NHP jobs. Analysis of a multi-source dataset consisting of NHP scores for 107 job types estimated before the COVID-19 induced country-wide lockdown in India (N=3,099) and a survey of employees experience working remotely conducted during the lockdown (N=403) reveals that employees working in jobs that entail high NHP are both less productive and experience greater isolation than those working in jobs with low NHP. Although the use of videoconferencing technologies compensates for the relatively lower productivity of employees in jobs with high NHP, it doesnt similarly reduce the extent to which they experience isolation. These findings generate several important implications for organizational and governmental policy and make important theoretical and methodological contributions to prior research on remote work.","output":"The Impact of Job Need for Human Proximity and Communication Technologies on Remote Work Efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to widespread changes in all health care settings including academic radiology departments. The purpose of this survey-based study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on radiology resident training and education workflow in Canada in terms of the nature, scale, and heterogeneity of the changes, preparedness and adaptation, and perceptions of the present and future of radiology training. METHODS A 30-question web-based survey was sent to 17 radiology residency program directors across Canada. A separate 32-question survey was sent to 460 residents currently enrolled in a radiology residency in Canada. These surveys were open for 3 weeks. RESULTS We received responses from 16 program directors and 80 residents (response rates 94.1% and 17.4%, respectively). Most respondents agreed that objectives were being met for knowledge and interpretation but less so for case volumes and technical skills. Less time was allotted for on-site activities (eg, readouts) with more time for off-site activities (eg, videoconferencing). Daytime rotations were at least partly cancelled. Most respondents felt these changes were met with enthusiasm by both faculty and residents. However, there were perceived challenges including lack of training on virtual platforms for delivery of teaching and decreased staff-resident interaction, with short- and long-term anxiety reported. CONCLUSIONS The coronavirus disease 2019 has dramatically changed radiology resident training in Canada, with increased virtual learning at the expense of cancelled rotations and the resultant reduction in case volumes and staff-resident interaction. Although adopted with enthusiasm, these changes present substantial challenges and anxiety regarding the future of radiology resident education.","output":"Lessons Learned From the Effects of COVID-19 on the Training and Education Workflow of Radiology Residents-A Time for Reflection: Perspectives of Residency Program Directors and Residents in Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Seroprevalence studies have been carried out in many developed and developing countries to evaluate ongoing and past infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data on this infection in marginalized populations in urban slums are limited, which may offer crucial information to update prevention and mitigation policies and strategies. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and factors associated with seropositivity in slum and non-slum communities in two large cities in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among the target population in Dhaka and Chattogram cities between October 2020 and February 2021. Questionnaire-based data, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements and blood were obtained. SARS-CoV-2 serology was assessed by Roche Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. RESULTS: Among the 3220 participants (2444 adults, 18 years; 776 children, 10C17 years), the overall weighted seroprevalence was 67.3% (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 65.2, 69.3) with 71.0% in slum (95% CI = 68.7, 72.2) and 62.2% in non-slum (95% CI = 58.5, 65.8). The weighted seroprevalence was 72.9% in Dhaka and 54.2% in Chattogram. Seroprevalence was positively associated with limited years of formal education (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.43, 1.82), lower income (aOR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.46), overweight (aOR = 1.2835; 95% CI = 1.26, 1.97), diabetes (aOR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.21, 2.32) and heart disease (aOR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.86). Contrarily, negative associations were found between seropositivity and regular wearing of masks and washing hands, and prior BCG vaccination. About 63% of the population had asymptomatic infection; only 33% slum and 49% non-slum population showed symptomatic infection. CONCLUSION: The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was more prominent in impoverished informal settlements than in the adjacent middle-income non-slum areas. Additional factors associated with seropositivity included limited education, low income, overweight and pre-existing chronic conditions. Behavioral factors such as regular wearing of masks and washing hands were associated with lower probability of seropositivity.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated factors among Bangladeshi slum and non-slum dwellers in pre-COVID-19 vaccination era: October 2020 to February 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective: Viruses are important aetiological agents of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD).

The WMP of respiratory viral infection in AECOPD was 34.1% (95% CI: 23.9C44.4). picornavirus was the most commonly detected virus with WMP 17.3% (95% CI: 7.2C27.3), followed by influenza; 7.4% (95% CI: 2.9C12.0), respiratory syncytial virus; 5.3% (95% CI: 1.6C9.0), corona viruses; 3.1% (95% CI: 0.4C5.8), parainfluenza; 2.6% (95% CI: 0.4C4.8), adenovirus; 1.1% (95% CI: ?1.1 to 3.3), and human metapneumovirus; 0.7% (95% CI: ?0.3 to 1.8). Maximum WMP was observed in studies from Europe followed by the USA, Australia and Asia. Picorna was the most common virus detected in Western countries whereas influenza was most common in Asia. Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrated that viruses are strongly associated with AECOPD, with the highest detection rates of viruses being in Europe.

We evaluated a new topographical method for endotracheal tube positioning relative to the carina, using a well-known prior topographical method for comparison. METHODS One hundred adult (male 50, female 50) patients were studied. The comparison topographic length (in cm) was measured by adding the distance between the right mouth corner and the right mandibular angle to the distance between the right mandibular angle and the center of the sternal manubrium. The new endotracheal tube insertion depth (in cm) was determined by adding the distance between the right mouth corner and the vocal cords, measured with the endotracheal tube itself, to the distance between the thyroid prominence and the manubriosternal joint, and then subtracting 4 cm. After intubation, the endotracheal tube was positioned properly at the right mouth corner and the endotracheal tube tip was evaluated using a fiberoptic bronchoscope at the carina. RESULTS The distances from the tip of the endotracheal tube to the carina were not significantly different between the methods in the same gender. However, our method allowed endotracheal tube tip placement between 3 cm and 5 cm, above the carina more frequently than the prior method in males.

Intratumoral vessel diameter was significantly larger in the DLM group than the non-DLM group (p < 0.01). Larger VSs showed a higher intratumoral MVD in the DLM group (p < 0.05). Multilayered SMA-positive vessels were identified in the DLM, tumor, and border; there tended to be more of these vessels within the tumor in the DLM group compared to the non-DLM group (p = 0.08).

The objective of this study was to standardize lower cost molecular methods for SARS-CoV-2 identification. E gene primers previously determined for TaqMan assays by Colman et al. (2020) were adapted in SYBR Green assay and RT-PCR conventional. The cross-reactivity test was performed with 17 positive samples for other respiratory viruses, and the sensibility test was performed with 8 dilutions (10 based) of SARS-CoV-2 isolated and 63 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. The SYBR Green assays and conventional RT-PCR have not shown amplification of the 17 respiratory samples positives for other viruses. The SYBR Green-based assay was able to detect all 8 dilutions of the isolate. The conventional PCR detected until 10(7) dilution, both assays detected the majority of the 63 samples, 98.42% of positivity in SYBR Green, and 93% in conventional PCR. The average Ct variation between SYBR Green and TaqMan was 1.92 and the highest Ct detected by conventional PCR was 35.98.

A healthy pregnancy can have significant impacts on the life chances of children. The objective of this review was to understand the association between individual-level and household-level measures of socioeconomic status and adverse pregnancy outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Nine databases were searched (Medline, Embase, Scopus, ASSIA, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BNI, MIDRIS and Google Scholar) for articles published between 1999 and August 2019. Grey literature searches were also assessed. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies reporting associations between individual-level or household socioeconomic factors on pregnancy outcomes in the UK or Ireland. RESULTS: Among the 82 353 search results, 53 821 titles were identified and 35 unique studies met the eligibility criteria. Outcomes reported were neonatal, perinatal and maternal mortality, preterm birth, birth weight and mode of delivery. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. There were significantly increased odds of women from lower levels of occupation/social classes compared with the highest level having stillbirth (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.59, I2 98.62%), neonatal mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.57, I2 97.09%), perinatal mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.57, I2 98.69%), preterm birth (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.50, I2 70.97%) and low birth weight (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.61, I2 99.85%). Limitations relate to available data, unmeasured confounders and the small number of studies for some outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified consistent evidence that lower occupational status, especially manual occupations and unemployment, were significantly associated with increased risk of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes. Strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes should incorporate approaches that address wider determinants of health to provide women and families with the best chances of having a healthy pregnancy and baby and to decrease pregnancy-related health inequalities in the general population.

Critically ill patients have some special characteristics that increase the risk for VTE and complicate risk stratification and diagnosis. Given the positive effect of thromboprophylaxis on main outcomes, its use is mandatory in these patients, which is documented by various studies and recommended by all published guidelines. However, anticoagulation management is not an easy issue in clinical practice, as the critical patient may be at high risk for thrombosis or, conversely, at increased risk of bleeding or may balance between thrombotic and bleeding risk. Thrombotic and bleeding risk scoring should be evaluated daily in order to select the appropriate form of thromboprophylaxis. The selection depends on the degree of bleeding risk and the subgroup of ICU patients involved, such as patients with sepsis, acute brain injury, major trauma or coronavirus disease-2019. If there is no bleeding risk or other contraindication, the patient should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins, weighing the advantages of each agent. If the patient is at high risk of bleeding or there is a contraindication to pharmacologic prophylaxis, he should receive mechanical thromboprophylaxis mainly with intermittent pneumatic compression or graduated compression stockings. Thromboprophylaxis compliance with the guidelines is a prerequisite for moving from theory to practice.

However, the disinformation spreading through social media is, according to the literature, one of the causes of increased COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. In this context, the analysis of social media posts is particularly important, but the large amount of data exchanged on social media platforms requires specific methods. This is why machine learning and natural language processing models are increasingly applied to social media data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the capability of the CamemBERT French-language model to faithfully predict the elaborated categories, with the knowledge that tweets about vaccination are often ambiguous, sarcastic, or irrelevant to the studied topic. METHODS: A total of 901,908 unique French-language tweets related to vaccination published between July 12, 2021, and August 11, 2021, were extracted using Twitters application programming interface (version 2; Twitter Inc). Approximately 2000 randomly selected tweets were labeled with 2 types of categorizations: (1) arguments for (pros) or against (cons) vaccination (health measures included) and (2) type of content (scientific, political, social, or vaccination status). The CamemBERT model was fine-tuned and tested for the classification of French-language tweets. The models performance was assessed by computing the F1-score, and confusion matrices were obtained. RESULTS: The accuracy of the applied machine learning reached up to 70.6% for the first classification (pro and con tweets) and up to 90% for the second classification (scientific and political tweets). Furthermore, a tweet was 1.86 times more likely to be incorrectly classified by the model if it contained fewer than 170 characters (odds ratio 1.86; 95% CI 1.20-2.86). CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the model is affected by the classification chosen and the topic of the message examined. When the vaccine debate is jostled by contested political decisions, tweet content becomes so heterogeneous that the accuracy of the model drops for less differentiated classes. However, our tests showed that it is possible to improve the accuracy by selecting tweets using a new method based on tweet length.","output":"An Analysis of French-Language Tweets About COVID-19 Vaccines: Supervised Learning Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals and institutions around the world have been affected by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This pandemic represents a serious public health risk. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is essential to control disease progression. Radiological examination plays a crucial role in the early identification and management of infected patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify the diagnostic value of different imaging modalities used for diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords diagnostic imaging, radiology, respiratory infection, pneumonia, coronavirus infection and COVID-19 were used to identify radiology articles focusing on the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to determine the diagnostic value of various imaging modalities, including x-ray, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and nuclear medicine for identification and management of infected patients. RESULTS: We identified 50 articles in the literature search. Studies that investigated the diagnostic roles and imaging features of patients with COVID-19, using either chest CT, lung ultrasound, chest x-ray, or positron emission topography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, were discussed. Of these imaging modalities, chest x-ray and CT scan are the most commonly used for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients, with chest CT scan being more accurate and sensitive in identifying COVID-19 at early stages. Only a few studies have investigated the roles of ultrasound and PET/CT scan in diagnosing COVID-19.

When present in the lumbar spine, they typically present with radiculopathy and weakness. CT imaging is helpful in assessing for bony involvement and temporal involvement while MRI imaging can be helpful in distinguishing hemangiomas from other mass lesions, however current reports on imaging features are limited. Diagnosis remains primarily dependent on tissue pathology with surgery as the mainstay of treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a unique case report in which we obtain additional DSA imaging to not only visualize the vascular anatomy associated with a L4-5 neuroforaminal capillary hemangioma involving the L4 nerve root and ganglion, but to also embolize the feeding artery prior to surgical resection. Patient initially underwent a CT-guided biopsy that was suspicious for a hemangioma and confirmed on final pathology to be the capillary subtype. DISCUSSION: When diagnosed appropriately, patients avoid unnecessary additional testing and avoid erroneous treatment of this rare lesion. Based on our experience, we propose initial MRI imaging to characterize the hemangioma and evaluate for intradural involvement, DSA to assess vascularity followed by embolization of the lesion when able in order to minimize intra-operative hemorrhage risk, and ultimately surgery to achieve a gross total resection.","output":"Extradural lumbar nerve root and ganglion capillary hemangioma: case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A comprehensive understanding of the transmission routes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great importance for the effective control of the spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: We developed a simple framework to integrate the a priori dose-response relation for SARS-CoV based on mice experiments, the recent data on infection risk from a meta-analysis and the respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath, to shed light on the dose-response relation for human. The aerosol transmission infection risk was evaluated based on the dose-response model for typical indoor environment. RESULTS: The developed dose-response relation is an exponential function with a constant k in the range of about 6.410 (4) to 9.810 (5) virus copies, which means that the infection risk caused by one virus copy in viral shedding is on the order of 10 (-6) to 10 (-5). The median infection risk via aerosol transmission with one-hour exposure (10 (-6) to 10 (-4)) was significantly lower than the risk caused by close contact (10 (-1)) in a room of the area from 10 to 400 m (2) with one infected individual in it and with typical ventilation rate 1 ACH (Air Changes per Hour).

However, the focus on optimally managing children in hospitals is changing with new variants and concerns with the development of hyperinflammatory syndromes. There are also concerns with the overuse of antimicrobials to treat patients with COVID-19 in hospitals enhancing resistance rates. The Bangladesh Paediatric Association have developed guidelines to improve patient care building on national guidance. Consequently, there is a need to document the current management of children with COVID-19 in Bangladesh and use the findings for future guidance. Methods: Rapid analysis of the management of children with COVID-19 among eight private and public hospitals in Bangladesh with varying numbers of in-patient beds using purposely developed case report forms (CRFs). The CRFs were piloted before full roll-out. Results: Overall low numbers of children in hospital with COVID-19 (4.3% of in-patient beds). The majority were male (59.6%) and aged 5 years or under (63.5%). Reasons for admission included respiratory distress/ breathing difficulties with 94.2% of COVID-19 cases confirmed. All children were prescribed antibiotics empirically, typically those on the Watch list of antibiotics and administered parenterally, with only a small minority switched to oral therapy before discharge. There was appreciable prescribing of Vitamins (C and D) and zinc and encouragingly limited prescribing of other antimicrobials (antivirals, antimalarials and antiparasitic medicines). Length of stay was typically 5 to 10 days. Conclusion: Encouraging to see low hospitalisation rates and limited use of antimicrobials apart from antibiotics. Concerns with high empiric use of antibiotics and limited switching to oral formulations can be addressed by instigating antimicrobial stewardship programmes. We will be monitoring this.

The adjusted odds of single and combination guideline compliance were estimated by disability type, in reference to adults without disabilities, using separate multivariable logistic regressions. After adjusting for age, sex, and income, adults with disabilities in mobility, cognitive, or self-care domains had approximately half the odds of meeting all 3 guidelines, compared with adults without disabilities (adjusted odds range: 0.49-0.77). Significantly lower adherence was observed among adults with functional disabilities, compared with no disabilities, for sleep, and moderate to vigorous physical activity, but not sedentary guidelines.

One of the most critical problems in this regard is to identify innovative drugs that may reduce or manage this global health concern. Nanoparticles have shown a pivotal role in drug delivery systems in recent decades. The surface of nanoparticles could be covered by a layer composed of different biomolecules (e.g., proteins and macromolecules) following the incubation with a biological fluid. This protein-rich layer is called Protein Corona. In this study, an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation was used for investigating the monomeric B domain of the spike glycoprotein due to its role in the accessibility of the spike glycoprotein to single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The interaction energy values between the carbon nanotube and B domain of the viral spike glycoprotein were evaluated. The obtained results, based on Lennard-Jones potentials, demonstrated that SWCNTs had an affinity to the B domain of the S1 subunit in the spike glycoprotein. The adsorption of SWCNTs on the B domain surface led to a significant change in solvent-accessible surface, internal hydrogen bonds, and finally in the tertiary structure, which could provide a reasonable method to impede the interaction between the angiotensin-converting enzyme II and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. A decrease in the mean square displacement of the B domain was shown after the adsorption of SWCNTs as a result of increasing the hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties of the B domain. The arrangement of SWCNTs on the B domain surface and their interaction using the 2-acetamido-2-deoxy--d-glucopyranose group (988, 991, and 992) demonstrated that a change in the affinity of the S1 subunit could be used as a barrier to viral replication. The analysis of the SWCNT-B domain complex indicated that the presence of SWCNTs is able to cause alterations in the S1 subunit of the spike protein, and these nanotubes could be employed for further in-vitro and in-vivo antiviral studies. Also, SWCNTs are able to be utilized in drug delivery systems.","output":"Tracking the interaction between single-wall carbon nanotube and SARS-Cov-2 spike glycoprotein: A molecular dynamics simulations study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article considers the contribution of the ICT sector to the medium- and long-term development of the Russian economy.

However, its effectiveness is severely limited by the lack of quantity and diversity of known materials deposited in the current materials repositories such as ICSD and OQMD. Recent progress in machine learning and especially deep learning have enabled a generative strategy that learns implicit chemical rules for creating chemically valid hypothetical materials with new compositions and structures. However, current materials generative models have difficulty in generating structurally diverse, chemically valid, and stable materials. Here we propose CubicGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep neural network model for large scale generation of novel cubic crystal structures. When trained on 375,749 ternary crystal materials from the OQMD database, we show that our model is able to not only rediscover most of the currently known cubic materials but also generate hypothetical materials of new structure prototypes. A total of 506 such new materials (all of them are either ternary or quarternary) have been verified by DFT based phonon dispersion stability check, several of which have been found to potentially have exceptional functional properties. Considering the importance of cubic materials in wide applications such as solar cells and lithium batteries, our GAN model provides a promising approach to significantly expand the current repository of materials, enabling the discovery of new functional materials via screening.

Combining a phylogenetic approach with the study of contact zones can help to overcome such difficulties. The Podarcis hispanicus species complex has proven to be prosperous in independent evolutionary units, sometimes associated with cryptic diversity. Previous studies have revealed that one of the species of this complex, P. guadarramae, comprises two deeply divergent yet morphologically indistinguishable evolutionary units, currently regarded as subspecies (P. g. guadarramae and P. g. lusitanicus). In this study we used molecular data to address the systematics of the two lineages of Podarcis guadarramae and the closely related P. bocagei. Firstly, we reconstructed the species tree of these three and two additional taxa based on 30 nuclear loci using the multispecies coalescent with and without gene flow. Secondly, we used SNPs obtained from RADseq data to analyze the population structure across the distribution limits P. g. lusitanicus and P. g. guadarramae, and for comparison, a contact zone between P. bocagei and P. g. lusitanicus. Nuclear phylogenetic relationships between these three taxa are clearly difficult to determine due to the influence of gene flow, but our results give little support to the monophyly of P. guadarramae, potentially due to a nearly simultaneous divergence between them. Genetic structure and geographic cline analysis revealed that the two lineages of P. guadarramae replace each other abruptly across the sampled region and that gene flow is geographically restricted, implying the existence of strong reproductive isolation. Podarcis bocagei and P. g. lusitanicus show a similar degree of genetic differentiation and reproductive isolation, with very low levels of admixture in syntopy. These results support that all three forms are equally differentiated and reproductively isolated. In consequence, we conclude that the two former subspecies of Podarcis guadarramae constitute valid, yet cryptic species, that should be referred to as P. lusitanicus and P. guadarramae.","output":"Nuclear phylogenies and genomics of a contact zone establish the species rank of Podarcis lusitanicus (Squamata, Lacertidae)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The prevalence and persistence of antibodies following a peak SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights into its spread in the community, the likelihood of reinfection and potential for some level of population immunity. Methods Prevalence of antibody positivity in England, UK (REACT2) with three cross-sectional surveys between late June and September 2020. 365104 adults used a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG. A laboratory comparison of LFIA results to neutralization activity in panel of sera was performed. Results There were 17,576 positive tests over the three rounds. Antibody prevalence, adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England, declined from 6.0% [5.8, 6.1], to 4.8% [4.7, 5.0] and 4.4% [4.3, 4.5], a fall of 26.5% [-29.0, -23.8] over the three months of the study. There was a decline between rounds 1 and 3 in all age groups, with the highest prevalence of a positive result and smallest overall decline in positivity in the youngest age group (18-24 years: -14.9% [-21.6, -8.1]), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (75+ years: -39.0% [-50.8, -27.2]); there was no change in antibody positivity between rounds 1 and 3 in healthcare workers (+3.45% [-5.7, +12.7]).

Discussion These findings provide evidence of variable waning in antibody positivity over time such that, at the start of the second wave of infection in England, only 4.4% of adults had detectable IgG antibodies using an LFIA. Antibody positivity was greater in those who reported a positive PCR and lower in older people and those with asymptomatic infection.

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for the 2019 global pandemic of COVID-19 community acquired pneumonia. We have undertaken a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CONCOR-1 is an open-label, multicentre, randomized trial. Inclusion criteria include the following: patients > 16 years, admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection, receiving supplemental oxygen for respiratory complications of COVID-19, and availability of blood group compatible CCP. Exclusion criteria are : onset of respiratory symptoms more than 12 days prior to randomization, intubated or imminent plan for intubation, and previous severe reactions to plasma. Consenting patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either approximately 500 mL of CCP or standard of care. CCP is collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and who have detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantified serologically. The primary outcome is intubation or death at day 30. Secondary outcomes include ventilator-free days, length of stay in intensive care or hospital, transfusion reactions, serious adverse events, and reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Exploratory analyses include patients who received CCP containing high titre antibodies. A sample size of 1200 patients gives 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction assuming a 30% baseline risk of intubation or death at 30 days (two-sided test; &#945; = 0.05). An interim analysis and sample size re-estimation will be done by an unblinded independent biostatistician after primary outcome data are available for 50% of the target recruitment (n = 600). DISCUSSION: This trial will determine whether CCP will reduce intubation or death non-intubated adults with COVID-19. The trial will also provide information on the role of and thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and neutralization assays for donor qualification.

These methods are based on either deep learning or radiomics. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence comparing these methods on the same external validation sets. The aim of our study was to compare the performance of a deep-learning model with the performance of a radiomics model for significant-PCa diagnosis on various cohorts. We collected multiparametric magnetic resonance images and pathology data from four patient cohorts (644 patients in total). One of the cohorts was used to develop a deep-learning model and a radiomics model. Both models were tested on the three remaining cohorts. The comparison shows that whereas the performance of the deep-learning model was higher on the training cohort, the radiomics model outperformed the deep-learning model in all the testing cohorts, making it a more accurate tool with which to detect clinically significant prostate cancer. ABSTRACT: The computer-aided analysis of prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) could improve significant-prostate-cancer (PCa) detection. Various deep-learning- and radiomics-based methods for significant-PCa segmentation or classification have been reported in the literature. To be able to assess the generalizability of the performance of these methods, using various external data sets is crucial. While both deep-learning and radiomics approaches have been compared based on the same data set of one center, the comparison of the performances of both approaches on various data sets from different centers and different scanners is lacking. The goal of this study was to compare the performance of a deep-learning model with the performance of a radiomics model for the significant-PCa diagnosis of the cohorts of various patients. We included the data from two consecutive patient cohorts from our own center (n = 371 patients), and two external sets of which one was a publicly available patient cohort (n = 195 patients) and the other contained data from patients from two hospitals (n = 79 patients). Using multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), the radiologist tumor delineations and pathology reports were collected for all patients. During training, one of our patient cohorts (n = 271 patients) was used for both the deep-learning- and radiomics-model development, and the three remaining cohorts (n = 374 patients) were kept as unseen test sets. The performances of the models were assessed in terms of their area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). Whereas the internal cross-validation showed a higher AUC for the deep-learning approach, the radiomics model obtained AUCs of 0.88, 0.91 and 0.65 on the independent test sets compared to AUCs of 0.70, 0.73 and 0.44 for the deep-learning model. Our radiomics model that was based on delineated regions resulted in a more accurate tool for significant-PCa classification in the three unseen test sets when compared to a fully automated deep-learning model.","output":"Classification of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer on Multi-Parametric MRI: A Validation Study Comparing Deep Learning and Radiomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In the aftermath of a disaster, the services provided by pharmacists are essential to ensure the continued health and well-being of the local population. To continue pharmacy services, it is critical that pharmacists are prepared for disasters. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore pharmacists' and pharmacy students' preparedness for disasters and the factors that affect preparedness. METHODS: This review was conducted in April 2020 through electronic databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO, and two disaster journals. Search terms such as 'pharmacist*', 'disaster*' and 'prepared*' were used. The search yielded an initial 1781 titles. Articles were included if they measured pharmacists or pharmacy students' disaster preparedness. After screening and quality appraisal by two researchers, four articles were included in final analysis and review. Data were extracted using a data collection tool formulated by the researchers. Meta-analysis was not possible; instead, results were compared across key areas including preparedness ratings and factors that influenced preparedness. KEY FINDINGS: Three articles focused on pharmacy students' preparedness for disasters, and one on registered pharmacists' preparedness. Preparedness across both groups was poor to moderate with <18% of registered pharmacists found to be prepared to respond to a disaster. Factors that potentially influenced preparedness included disaster competency, disaster interventions and demographic factors. CONCLUSION: For pharmacists, the lack of research around their preparedness speaks volumes about their current involvement and expectations within disaster management.

These glycine lipids have also been detected in human arteries, but their effects on atherosclerosis are unknown. Here we sought to investigate the bioactivity of bacterial glycine lipids in mouse models of atherosclerosis. Lipid 654 (L654), a serine-glycine lipodipeptide species, was first tested in a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed Ldlr-/- model of atherosclerosis. Intraperitoneal (I.P.) administration of L654 over 7 weeks to HFD-fed Ldlr-/- mice resulted in hypocholesterolemic effects and significantly attenuated the progression of atherosclerosis. We found that L654 also reduced liver inflammatory and extracellular matrix gene expression, which may be related to inhibition of macrophage activation as demonstrated in vivo by lower MHC-class II gene expression and confirmed in cell experiments. In addition, L654 and other bacterial glycine lipids in feces, liver, and serum were markedly reduced alongside changes in Bacteroidetes relative abundance in HFD-fed mice. Finally, we tested the bioactivities of L654 and related lipid 567 (L567) in chow-fed Apoe-/- mice, which displayed much higher fecal glycine lipids relative to HFD-fed Ldlr-/- mice. Administration of L654 or L567 for 7 weeks to these mice reduced the liver injury marker alanine aminotransferase, but other effects seen in Ldlr-/- were not observed. Therefore, we conclude that conditions in which gut microbiome-derived glycine lipids are lost, such as HFD, may exacerbate the development of atherosclerosis and liver injury, while correction of such depletion may protect from these disorders.","output":"Gut Microbiome-Derived Glycine Lipids Are Diet-Dependent Modulators of Hepatic Injury and Atherosclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevention of suicide and suicide-related behaviour are key policy priorities in Australia and internationally.

The aim of the study was to present our preliminary experience in laparoscopic cholecystectomy through single intraumbilical incision. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three patients with gallbladder symptoms (2 female, 1 male) underwent surgery through single intraumbilical incision. In two cases the procedure was performed with three 5 mm Dexide port approach and in one, with a flexible rubber/gel SILSTM-Port (Covidien, USA) access. A simple 5 mm optics was employed. In two procedures the following disposable instruments were used: roticulator Endo dissect, roticulator Endo grasp, mini Sears scissors as well as standard hook and clips while for the third procedure, a conventional multi-use grasp and roticular Endo dissect. The gallbladder was elevated to the integuments by two sutures to expose Calot's triangle and bladder site. Following exposure, the bile duct and the vesical artery were clipsed and cut routinely to remove the gallbladder in a plastic bag through the bell-button. After procedures no drains were left in the peritoneal cavities. RESULTS In all three cases the laparoscopic procedure was performed. The median operative time was 88 min. In one female patient, bleeding into the peritoneal cavity was reported and called for laparotomy within a few hours of laparoscopic procedure. Intraoperatively, the branch of vesical artery was sutured to arrest bleeding. The median hospital stay following procedure was 3, 8 and 5 days respectively.

The results of finite element analysis reveal the correlation between orientation of TDN and the conductance blockade. The experimentally measured fluctuations in the conductance blockade, expressed as voltage-dependent histogram profiles, are consistent with the simulation, revealing the nature of a random distribution in orientation and weak influence of electrostatic and viscous torques. The step changes in orientation of a TDN during translocation are further explained by the collision with the nanopore, while the gradual changes in orientation illustrate the impact of a weak torque field in the nano-fluidic channel.

Here, we developed a protocol based on reverse transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. This protocol is applied directly to SARS-CoV-2 nose and throat swabs, with no RNA purification step required. We tested this protocol on over 180 suspected patients, and compared the results to those obtained using the standard method.

Findings: We included 88 cohort studies with age/gender adjusted data from 6,653,207 SARS-CoV-2 patients from Europe. Hospital-based mortality was associated with high and moderate certainty evidence for solid organ tumours, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, liver disease, and obesity, while a higher risk, albeit with low certainty, was noted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure. Community-based mortality was associated with a history of heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease. Evidence of high/moderate certainty revealed a strong association between hospitalisation for COVID-19 and solid organ transplant recipients, sleep apnoea, diabetes, stroke, and liver disease. Interpretation: The results confirmed the strong association between specific prognostic factors and mortality and hospital admission. Prioritisation of booster vaccinations and the implementation of non-pharmaceutical protective measures for these populations may contribute to a reduction in COVID-19 mortality, ICU and hospital admissions.

Extensive testing on datasets and performance assessment of the suggested approaches are demonstrated. Furthermore, we used a symbolic method to successfully maintain inter and intra class differences in face mask detection.

Therefore, many case studies are being conducted that address the impacts on both residents and tourists. The goal of this manuscript is to analyze the attitudes of local residents to the development of tourism in the urban monument zone P?edhrad. Primary data were collected in a questionnaire survey for residents who have a permanent residence in a municipality of P?edhrad in 2020. In our research, we tried to identify the significant negative impacts of tourism development. In the same way, we evaluate how the locals see positive effects on their quality of life conducted with tourism development. The research finds out that local respondents perceived some negative impacts to increase the economic perspective, as they referred to in the higher traffic load or increased noise.

Parcel lockers constitute a valid solution for addressing the challenges home deliveries imply. In fact, eliminating courier-consumer contact (also relevant for health-related issues, as made evident by the COVID-19 pandemic) and delivering in fewer predefined places might help coping mechanisms for missed deliveries substantially. Furthermore, this option enables consolidated shipping and reduced delivery trip costs. This paper analyses and compares consumer preferences for alternative collection strategies. It investigates home delivery vs. parcel locker use and forecasts their future market shares. This is performed based on both customer socio-economic variables and the attributes characterising these alternative logistic fulfilment strategies. The case study considered tests upon a stated preference survey deployed in the city of Rome. The investigation specifically targeted young people (i.e., population under 30 years) since they represent early adopters. Discrete choice models allow both quantifying the monetary value of parcel lockers attributes (i.e., willingness to pay measures) and estimating the potential demand for this innovative delivery scheme. Results show that distance and accessibility are the main choice determinants. Furthermore, there is an overall high propensity to adopt parcel lockers.

However, the specific regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Here, we investigated the role and molecular mechanism of histone methyltransferases G9a in lipids-induced M1 macrophage polarization in type 2 diabetes. METHODS We used saturated fatty acid palmitate to induce macrophage polarization, and performed real-time PCR, western blot, flow cytometry and CHIP assay to study the function and molecular mechanism of G9a. Additionally, we isolated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 187 patients with type 2 diabetes and 68 healthy individuals, and analyzed the expression level of G9a. RESULTS The palmitate treatment induced the macrophage M1 polarization, and decreased the expression of G9a. The deficiency of G9a could promote the palmitate-induced M1 macrophage polarization, whereas, over-expressing G9a notably suppressed this process. Meanwhile, we observed the regulatory role of G9a on the ER stress which could contribute to M1 macrophage. Furthermore, we identified the fatty acid transport protein CD36 as the potential target of G9a. Dependent on the methyltransferase activity, G9a could negatively regulate the expression of CD36 induced by palmitate. The CD36 inhibitor SSO could significantly attenuate the regulatory effect of G9a on M1 macrophage polarization and ER stress. Importantly, G9a was decreased, and suppressed CD36 and M1 macrophage genes in the PBMCs from individuals with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Our studies demonstrate that G9a plays critical roles in lipid-induced M1 macrophage polarization via negatively regulating CD36.","output":"Histone methyltransferases G9a mediated lipid-induced M1 macrophage polarization through negatively regulating CD36."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we addressed the pharmacology and toxicology of synthetic organoselenium compounds and some naturally occurring organoselenium amino acids. The use of selenium as a tool in organic synthesis and as a pharmacological agent goes back to the middle of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. The rediscovery of ebselen and its investigation in clinical trials have motivated the search for new organoselenium molecules with pharmacological properties. Although ebselen and diselenides have some overlapping pharmacological properties, their molecular targets are not identical. However, they have similar anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, possibly, via activation of transcription factors, regulating the expression of antioxidant genes. In short, our knowledge about the pharmacological properties of simple organoselenium compounds is still elusive. However, contrary to our early expectations that they could imitate selenoproteins, organoselenium compounds seem to have non-specific modulatory activation of antioxidant pathways and specific inhibitory effects in some thiol-containing proteins. The thiol-oxidizing properties of organoselenium compounds are considered the molecular basis of their chronic toxicity; however, the acute use of organoselenium compounds as inhibitors of specific thiol-containing enzymes can be of therapeutic significance. In summary, the outcomes of the clinical trials of ebselen as a mimetic of lithium or as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 proteases will be important to the field of organoselenium synthesis. The development of computational techniques that could predict rational modifications in the structure of organoselenium compounds to increase their specificity is required to construct a library of thiol-modifying agents with selectivity toward specific target proteins.","output":"Toxicology and pharmacology of synthetic organoselenium compounds: an update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 32-nucleotide (nt) RNA motif located at the 3 end of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome was found to specifically interact with the host proteins glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) and arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RRS). This RNA motif has high homology in sequence and secondary structure with the gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) element, which is located at the 3 end of several mRNAs encoding proinflammatory proteins. The GAIT element is involved in the translation silencing of these mRNAs through its interaction with the GAIT complex (EPRS, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q, ribosomal protein L13a, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) to favor the resolution of inflammation. Interestingly, we showed that the viral RNA motif bound the GAIT complex and inhibited the in vitro translation of a chimeric mRNA containing this RNA motif. To our knowledge, this is the first GAIT-like motif described in a positive RNA virus. To test the functional role of the GAIT-like RNA motif during TGEV infection, a recombinant coronavirus harboring mutations in this motif was engineered and characterized. Mutations of the GAIT-like RNA motif did not affect virus growth in cell cultures. However, an exacerbated innate immune response, mediated by the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) pathway, was observed in cells infected with the mutant virus compared with the response observed in cells infected with the parental virus. Furthermore, the mutant virus was more sensitive to beta interferon than the parental virus. All together, these data strongly suggested that the viral GAIT-like RNA motif modulates the host innate immune response.","output":"Identification of a Gamma Interferon-Activated Inhibitor of Translation-Like RNA Motif at the 3 End of the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus Genome Modulating Innate Immune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A high prevalence of various infectious diseases is reported in diabetic patients, which may suggest impaired innate immunity against different pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

The PREDICT project, a component of United States Agency for International Developments Emerging Pandemic Threats program, has introduced capacity building efforts to increase zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife in global hot spot regions where zoonotic disease emergence is likely to occur. Understanding priorities, challenges, and opportunities from the perspectives of the stakeholders is a key component of any successful capacity building program. METHODS: A survey was administered to wildlife officials and to PREDICT-implementing in-country project scientists in 16 participating countries in order to identify similarities and differences in perspectives between the groups regarding capacity needs for zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife. RESULTS: Both stakeholder groups identified some human-animal interfaces (i.e. areas of high contact between wildlife and humans with the potential risk for disease transmission), such as hunting and markets, as important for ongoing targeting of wildlife surveillance. Similarly, findings regarding challenges across stakeholder groups showed some agreement in that a lack of sustainable funding across regions was the greatest challenge for conducting wildlife surveillance for zoonotic pathogens (wildlife officials: 96% and project scientists: 81%). However, the opportunity for improving zoonotic pathogen surveillance capacity identified most frequently by wildlife officials as important was increasing communication or coordination among agencies, sectors, or regions (100% of wildlife officials), whereas the most frequent opportunities identified as important by project scientists were increasing human capacity, increasing laboratory capacity, and the growing interest or awareness regarding wildlife disease or surveillance programs (all identified by 69% of project scientists). CONCLUSIONS: A One Health approach to capacity building applied at local and global scales will have the greatest impact on improving zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife. This approach will involve increasing communication and cooperation across ministries and sectors so that experts and stakeholders work together to identify and mitigate surveillance gaps. Over time, this transdisciplinary approach to capacity building will help overcome existing challenges and promote efficient targeting of high risk interfaces for zoonotic pathogen transmission.","output":"Capacity building efforts and perceptions for wildlife surveillance to detect zoonotic pathogens: comparing stakeholder perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coinfection by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and Pasteurella multocida (PM) frequently has been observed in cattle that develop severe pneumonia.

Data scarcity, on the other hand, hinders what would be a desirable migration towards autonomous robotic-assisted surgical systems. Automated anomaly detection systems in this area typically rely on classical supervised learning. Anomalous events in a surgical setting, however, are rare, making it difficult to capture data to train a detection model in a supervised fashion. In this work we thus propose an unsupervised approach to anomaly detection for robotic-assisted surgery based on deep residual autoencoders. The idea is to make the autoencoder learn the 'normal' distribution of the data and detect abnormal events deviating from this distribution by measuring the reconstruction error. The model is trained and validated upon both the publicly available Cholec80 dataset, provided with extra annotation, and on a set of videos captured on procedures using artificial anatomies ('phantoms') produced as part of the Smart Autonomous Robotic Assistant Surgeon (SARAS) project.

We analyzed published case reports, case series and articles on COVID-19s clinical presentation, management, outcomes and vaccination among kidney transplant recipients. A total of 33 studies were included in the study, which included 1676 KTx recipients and 108 waiting list patients infected with COVID-19. These studies reported the clinical presentation, management and immunosuppressive adjustment among the KTx recipients. The remaining studies focused on other aspects, such as vaccination and transplantation, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mortality due to COVID-19 was observed to be the highest for KTx recipients, followed by patients on hemodialysis, and lowest in the general population. There is no definitive treatment of COVID-19 yet, and managing transplant patients is enigmatic of this: the treatment is based on symptom management. There is an urgent need for guidelines on managing kidney transplant recipients and immunosuppressive adjustments for the course of COVID-19 treatment.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite significant interests in contraception by men, effective methods of male contraception are limited to vasectomy and condoms. Recently, there have been several promising advances in male contraceptive research. This review will update readers on recent research in both hormonal and nonhormonal approaches to male contraception. Hormonal approaches to male contraception have been stymied by adverse effects, formulations requiring injections or implants, a 5% to10% nonresponse rate, as well as poor understanding of user acceptability. In the last several years, research has focused on novel, orally bioavailable androgens such as dimethandrolone undecanoate and 11-methyl-19-nor-testosterone. Additionally, combinations of a topical testosterone gel combined with a gel containing segesterone acetate, a potent progestin, have shown promise in clinical trials recently. Simultaneously, significant preclinical progress has been made in several approaches to nonhormonal male contraceptives, including compounds that inhibit sperm motility such as eppin, compounds that inhibit retinoic acid binding or biosynthesis, and reversible approaches to obstruction of the vas deferens. It is imperative for these areas of research to continue making strides so that there is a gamut of contraceptive options for couples to choose from. Some of these approaches will hopefully reach clinical utility soon, greatly improving contraceptive choice for couples.","output":"Emerging approaches to male contraception."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is facing a pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Adaptive immune responses are essential for SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance. Although a large body of studies have been conducted to investigate the immune mechanism in COVID-19 patients, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the BCR repertoire in patients. In this study, we used the single-cell V(D)J sequencing to characterize the BCR repertoire across convalescent COVID-19 patients. We observed that the BCR diversity was significantly reduced in disease compared with healthy controls. And BCRs tend to skew toward different V gene segments in COVID-19 and healthy controls. The CDR3 sequences of heavy chain in clonal BCRs in patients were more convergent than that in healthy controls. In addition, we discovered increased IgG and IgA isotypes in the disease, including IgG1, IgG3 and IgA1. In all clonal BCRs, IgG isotypes had the most frequent class switch recombination events and the highest somatic hypermutation rate, especially IgG3. Moreover, we found that an IgG3 cluster from different clonal groups had the same IGHV, IGHJ and CDR3 sequences (IGHV4-4-CARLANTNQFYDSSSYLNAMDVW-IGHJ6).

This study aims to reveal the spatio-temporal patterns of TB in the Qinghai province, which could be helpful in the planning and implementing key preventative measures. METHODS: We extracted data of reported TB cases in the Qinghai province from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) during January 2009 to December 2016. The Kulldorffs retrospective space-time scan statistics, calculated by using the discrete Poisson probability model, was used to identify the temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal clusters of TB at the county level in Qinghai. RESULTS: A total of 48,274 TB cases were reported from 2009 to 2016 in Qinghai. Results of the Kulldorffs scan revealed that the TB cases in Qinghai were significantly clustered in spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal distribution. The most likely spatio-temporal cluster (LLR = 2547.64, RR = 4.21, P < 0.001) was mainly concentrated in the southwest of Qinghai, covering seven counties and clustered in the time frame from September 2014 to December 2016.

The researchers also aim at exploring the construct validity further through examining the relationship between FCV-19S, wellbeing and life satisfaction in Egyptian universities context. The current study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale among Egyptian population. METHODS: The FCV-19S is translated and validated in Egyptian context. The forward backward translation method is used to translate the English version of the survey into Arabic. The sample is comprised of 1832 Egyptian participants, who have conducted an online survey based on the Arabic versions of FCV-19S. RESULTS: The Cronbach &#945; value for the Egyptian FCV-19S is 0.87, indicating a good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis show that the unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S has fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S is significantly correlated with the seven-item survey. Moreover, the results show a significant negative relationship between Fear of COVID-19 and both wellbeing and life satisfaction (r = -0.42, p < 0.001; r = -0.24, p < 0.01.), respectively. CONCLUSION: The study supports the one factor model of FCV-19S scale in Egyptian context. The Arabic scale version in the Egyptian context shows excellent reliability and validity.

OBJECTIVE: to describe all outbreaks of COVID-19 infection in Scottish care-homes for older people between 01/03/2020 to 31/03/2020, with follow-up to 30/06/2020. DESIGN AND SETTING: national linked data cohort analysis of Scottish care-homes for older people. METHODS: data linkage was used to identify outbreaks of COVID-19 in care-homes. Care-home characteristics associated with the presence of an outbreak were examined using logistic regression. Size of outbreaks was modelled using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: 334 (41%) Scottish care-homes for older people experienced an outbreak, with heterogeneity in outbreak size (1-63 cases; median = 6) and duration (1-94 days; median = 31.5 days). Four distinct patterns of outbreak were identified: 'Typical' (38% of outbreaks, mean 11.2 cases and 48 days duration), Severe (11%, mean 29.7 cases and 60 days), Contained (37%, mean 3.5 cases and 13 days), and Late-onset (14%, mean 5.4 cases and 17 days). Risk of a COVID-19 outbreak increased with increasing care-home size (for &#8805;90 beds vs <20, adjusted OR = 55.4, 95%CI 15.0-251.7) and rising community prevalence (OR = 1.2 [1.0-1.4] per 100 cases/100,000 population increase). No routinely available care-home characteristic was associated with outbreak size. CONCLUSIONS: reducing community prevalence of COVID-19 infection is essential to protect those living in care-homes.

In this study, we examined whether natto impairs infection by viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as well as bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). Interestingly, our results show that both SARS-CoV-2 and BHV-1 treated with a natto extract were fully inhibited infection to the cells. We also found that the glycoprotein D of BHV-1 was shown to be degraded by Western blot analysis and that a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) was proteolytically degraded when incubated with the natto extract. In addition, RBD protein carrying a point mutation (UK variant N501Y) was also degraded by the natto extract. When the natto extract was heated at 100 C for 10 min, the ability of both SARS-CoV-2 and BHV-1 to infect to the cells was restored. Consistent with the results of the heat inactivation, a serine protease inhibitor inhibited anti-BHV-1 activity caused by the natto extract. Thus, our findings provide the first evidence that the natto extract contains a protease(s) that inhibits viral infection through the proteolysis of the viral proteins.","output":"Natto extract, a Japanese fermented soybean food, directly inhibits viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Migrants are often scapegoated during public health crises.

Results: During the first wave, we collected data from 900 patients with RMDs (Table 1): 320 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 295 patients with spondyloarthropathies (SpA), 283 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 2 patients with vasculitis. 546 (60%) were treated with bDMARD/tsDMARDs. Overall, a total of 11/900 (1%) cases were tested for COVID-19 due to compatible symptoms. 2 (0.2%) adult patients treated with bDMARDs were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. 2 patients without confirmed COVID-19 developed pneumonia that required admission to hospital. No deaths occurred among the patients with confirmed COVID-19. During the second wave, data were collected from 470 patients who accepted to take part of the study (Table 1). 49 presented with symptoms that were compatible with COVID-19. 139 patients were tested whereas 30 patients (6%) had a swab confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, 16 (53%) were treated with bDMARDs and a patient was treated with tofacitinib. we found no increase in COVID-19 prevalence in patients treated with bDMARD/tsDMARDs (p0.05). A patient with SLE developed pneumonia that required admission to hospital and died. Lacking distinct prevalence data between first and second waves, we found no differences in total COVID-19 prevalence between general population living in Campania (215.752/5.802.000;3.7%) and patients with RMDs (32/900;3.5%). However, we had a significant increase in COVID-19 prevalence in our cohort during the second wave compared to the first. Nevertheless, no increase in mortality or hospitalization was recorded, confirming the safety of immunomodulatory therapies in patients with RMDs. Conclusion: In this cohort of patients with RMDs in a geographical region with a high prevalence of COVID-19, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection does not appear different from that observed in the general population.","output":"Prevalence of COVID-19 among patients with rheumatic diseases: An observational survey during the two waves in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Increasing attention has been paid to the potential relationship between gut and lung.

The study argues that countries with better governance are more capable of adopting and implementing appropriate policies and that such governments are considered more trustworthy by their people. Combined, these factors enable such countries to better control a pandemic like COVID-19. Using several measures of good governance and two measures of pandemic spread, namely the COVID-19 positive rate and the COVID-19 growth rate, this paper tests its argument econometrically in a sample of 185 countries. The results show the existence of a significant inverse relationship between all measures of good governance, and the COVID-19 positive and growth rates. The significant inverse relationship largely persists even after controlling for continent-fixed effects and a host of geographic, demographic, and socio-economic factors. This indicates the presence of a strong systemic linkage between quality of governance and pandemic control. The findings empirically strengthen the argument of eminent medical historians concerning the importance of effective governmental intervention for epidemic control.

The current situation of prevention and control is severe and urges guidance for clinicians, especially for medical systems. In the hope of providing a reference and recommendation for the prevention and control of the COVID-19, we carried out research to improve the quality of patient care and prevention during this epidemic. METHODS: All of the staff were trained rapidly to master personal protection in our department. We reviewed the patients discharged records who underwent surgery in our department during January 1 to March 1, 2019, and January 1 to March 1, 2020. The management of the surgery patients and flow charts were described and analyzed. Post-operation outcomes of the patients include duration, complications, surgical site infection (SSI), system infection, re-operation, and mortality. Both chi-squared test and Students t test were performed to determine the relationship between the two periods in terms of post-operation outcomes. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics analysis revealed that demographic of the patients between the two periods is similar. We had benefited from the strict flowcharts, smart robot, and protection equipment during the perioperative managements for orthopedic patients. With the help of the strict flow charts and smart equipment, post-operation outcomes of the patients revealed that the rates of the complications and re-operation had been reduced significantly (p < 0.05), while duration of operation, SSI, and system infection had no significant difference between two periods (p > 0.05). No patient and staff caught COVID-19 infection or mortality during the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that medical quality and efficiency were affected little with the help of strategies described above during the epidemic, which could be a reference tool for medical staff in routine clinical practice for admission of patients around the world.

It utilizes the concept of inline viewing and a single incision that accommodates all of the working instruments. Here, we describe a single surgeon's initial experiences of using this technique in a tertiary hospital. METHODS Between January and September 2010, 21 patients underwent SILC for symptomatic cholelithiasis. The umbilicus was the point of access into abdomen for all patients using a 2.0-2.5-cm incision. The surgeries were performed using the Covidien SILS port with a 30 angled scope and two 5-mm conventional laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS Nineteen patients successfully underwent surgery (8 males and 11 females; mean age: 43 years). The mean body mass index was 25.9 kg/m(2) (range: 19.0-38.2 kg/m(2)). The mean operative time was 89 minutes (range: 55-135 minutes). Minimal blood loss was noted in each patient. The mean length of the postoperative stay was 1.1 days (range: 1-3 days). No complications or mortalities were associated with the technique. The visual analogue score for pain at the 1-day and 6-week follow-up examinations was 2 (range: 1-7) and 0.6 (range: 0-3), respectively. At 6 weeks, the mean satisfaction score for the resultant scar was 8.8 (range: 4-10) and the mean overall satisfaction score was 9.2 (range: 7-10).

At Week 1 pre- and postpartum, serum samples were obtained from each cow to measure neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-related variables, and blood neutrophils were collected for transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing. The serum concentration of NETs was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in cows with high SCCs than in cows with low SCCs (36.5  2.92 vs. 18.4  1.73 ng/mL). The transcriptomic analysis revealed that the transcriptome differences in neutrophils between high- and low-SCC cows were mainly in cell cycle-related pathways (42.6%), including the cell cycle, DNA damage, and chromosomal conformation, at Week 1 prepartum. The hub genes of these pathways were mainly involved in both the cell cycle and NETosis. These results indicated that the formation of NETs in the blood of transition dairy cows was different between cows with low and high SCCs, which may be used as a potential indicator for the prognosis of postpartum mastitis risk and management strategies of perinatal dairy cows.","output":"Formation of Blood Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Increases the Mastitis Risk of Dairy Cows During the Transition Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 situation is a worldwide health emergency with strong implications in clinical oncology In this viewpoint, we address two crucial dilemmas from the ethical dimension: (1) Is it ethical to postpone or suspend cancer treatments which offer a statistically significant benefit in quality of life and survival in cancer patients during this time of pandemic?;(2) Should we vaccinate cancer patients against COVID-19 if scientific studies have not included this subgroup of patients?

The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy from a healthcare payer perspective in the UK. METHODS Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects of initiation of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg were based on an indirect comparison conducted using patient-level data, as there is currently no head-to-head clinical trial comparing these therapies. Modelled patients received treatments until glycated haemoglobin exceeded 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), at which point patients initiated basal insulin. The analysis captured pharmacy costs and costs of diabetes-related complications, expressed in 2019 pounds sterling (GBP). Projected outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. Scenario analyses were prepared to assess uncertainty around projected outcomes. RESULTS Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with increases in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.12 years and 0.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, compared with empagliflozin 25 mg. Projected improvements in quality and duration of life resulted from a reduced cumulative incidence and a delayed time to onset of diabetes-related complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with increased pharmacy costs, but this was partially offset by avoided costs of treating complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with an increase in costs of GBP 1017 per patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 4439 per QALY gained.

Were there ways to have avoided the trauma faced by nurses (International Council of Nurses, ICN, 2021) after the overexposure to the health care crisis?Such a grim realization has specific implications for nursing. Naturally, one cannot change the world. Similarly, nurses cannot affect all aspects of health care systems that need serious reform. But nurses can affect nursing-sensitive outcomes. Most importantly, nursing-sensitive outcomes can be used to establish criteria for safe nursing practice. Health care institutions must enable health care professionals to function within the scope of their professional ethical codes. After all, systems operate thanks to the professionals comprising them. Similarly, professionals need to be facilitated by systems to function with integrity.","output":"Setting minimum standards of practice in times of crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Highly active, small\\\\molecule furin inhibitors are attractive drug candidates to fend off bacterial exotoxins and viral infection. Based on the 22\\\\residue, active Lys fragment of the mung bean trypsin inhibitor, a series of furin inhibitors were designed and synthesized, and their inhibitory activity towards furin and kexin was evaluated using enzyme kinetic analysis. The most potent inhibitor, containing 16 amino acid residues with a K (i) value of 2.45  10(?9) m for furin and of 5.60  10(?7) m for kexin, was designed with three incremental approaches. First, two nonessential Cys residues in the Lys fragment were deleted via a Cys\\\\to\\\\Ser mutation to minimize peptide misfolding. Second, residues in the reactive site of the inhibitor were replaced by the consensus substrate recognition sequence of furin, namely, Arg at P(1), Lys at P(2), Arg at P(4) and Arg at P(6). In addition, the P(7) residue Asp was substituted with Ala to avoid possible electrostatic interference with furin inhibition. Finally, the extra N\\\\terminal and C\\\\terminal residues beyond the doubly conjugated disulfide loops were further truncated. However, all resultant synthetic peptides were found to be temporary inhibitors of furin and kexin during a prolonged incubation, with the scissile peptide bond between P(1) and P(1) being cleaved to different extents by the enzymes. To enhance proteolytic resistance, the P(1) residue Ser was mutated to d\\\\Ser or N\\\\methyl\\\\Ser. The N\\\\methyl\\\\Ser mutant gave rise to a K (i) value of 4.70  10(?8) m for furin, and retained over 80% inhibitory activity even after a 3 h incubation with the enzyme. By contrast, the d\\\\Ser mutant was resistant to cleavage, although its inhibitory activity against furin drastically decreased.

Currently, clinicians use haphazard manual solutions. The ubiquitous use of electronic health records provides an opportunity to standardise safety-netting practices.A new electronic safety-netting toolkit has been introduced to provide systematic ways to track and follow up patients. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this toolkit, which is embedded in a major primary care clinical system in England:Egerton Medical Information System(EMIS)-Web. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a stepped-wedge cluster RCT in 60 general practices within the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) network. Groups of 10 practices will be randomised into the active phase at 2-monthly intervals over 12 months. All practices will be activated for at least 2 months. The primary outcome is the primary care interval measured as days between the first recorded symptom of cancer (within the year prior to diagnosis) and the subsequent referral to secondary care. Other outcomes include referrals rates and rates of direct access cancer investigation.Analysis of the clustered stepped-wedge design will model associations using a fixed effect for intervention condition of the cluster at each time step, a fixed effect for time and other covariates, and then include a random effect for practice and for patient to account for correlation between observations from the same centre and from the same participant. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the North West-Greater Manchester West National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (REC Reference 19/NW/0692). Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and sent to participating practices. They will be published on the University of Oxford Nuffield Department of Primary Care and RCGP RSC websites.

Here, we propose a concerted mechanism of associative and dissociative routes for ammonia synthesis over a cobalt-loaded nitride catalyst. Isotope exchange experiments reveal that the adsorbed N2 can be activated on both Co metal and the nitride support, which leads to superior low-temperature catalytic performance. The cooperation of the surface low work function (2.6 eV) feature and the formation of surface nitrogen vacancies on the CeN support gives rise to a dual pathway for N2 activation with much reduced activation energy (45 kJmol-1) over that of Co-based catalysts reported so far, which results in efficient ammonia synthesis under mild conditions.","output":"Dissociative and Associative Concerted Mechanism for Ammonia Synthesis over Co-Based Catalyst."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Positional change affects the cuff pressure of an endotracheal tube (ETT) in treacheally intubated patients. We compared the cuff pressure of a TaperGuard ETT and a cylindrical ETT after lateral rotation of head during middle ear surgery. METHODS Fifty-two patients aged 18-70 years underwent a tympanomastoidectomy under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive endotracheal intubation with cylindrical (group C, n = 26) or TaperGuard ETTs (group T, n = 26). After endotracheal intubation, the ETT cuff pressure was set at 22 cmH2O in the neutral position of head. After lateral rotation of head, the cuff pressure was measured again and readjusted to 22 cmH2O. In addition, the change of distance from the carina to the tip of the ETT was measured before and after the positional change. The incidence of cough, sore throat, and hoarseness was assessed at 30 minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS There was no difference in demographic data between groups. After lateral rotation of head, the cuff pressure significantly increased in group T (11.9  2.3 cmH2O) compared with group C (6.0  1.9 cmH2O) (P < 0.001). The incidence of a cuff pressure >30 cmH2O was higher in group T (96.2%) than in group C (30.8%) (P < 0.001). In addition, the degree of displacement of an ETT was greater in group T (11.0  1.7 mm) than in group C (7.2  2.6 mm) (P < 0.001). The overall incidences of postoperative sore throat, hoarseness, and cough at 30 minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after surgery were comparable between two groups. CONCLUSION The cuff pressure was higher in the TaperGuard ETT than in the cylindrical ETT after positional change of head from neutral to lateral rotation.

The CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein contains two structurally independent RNA binding domains, designated the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the dimeric C-terminal domain (CTD), joined by a charged linker region rich in serine and arginine residues (SR-rich linker). An important goal in unraveling N function is to molecularly characterize N-protein interactions. Recent genetic evidence suggests that N interacts with nsp3a, a component of the viral replicase. Here we present the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp3a and show, using isothermal titration calorimetry, that MHV N219, an N construct that extends into the SR-rich linker (residues 60 to 219), binds cognate nsp3a with high affinity (equilibrium association constant [K(a)], [1.4  0.3]  10(6) M(-1)). In contrast, neither N197, an N construct containing only the folded NTD (residues 60 to 197), nor the CTD dimer (residues 260 to 380) binds nsp3a with detectable affinity. This indicates that the key nsp3a binding determinants localize to the SR-rich linker, a finding consistent with those of reverse genetics studies. NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis reveals that the N-terminal region of an MHV N SR-rich linker peptide (residues 198 to 230) binds to the acidic face of MHV nsp3a containing the acidic 2 helix with an affinity (expressed as K(a)) of 8.1  10(3) M(-1).

We calculated the average annual percentage change (AAPC) to depict the secular trends of ASMR and ASDR from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the global ambient PM2.5-related deaths and DALYs were 4,140,970 and 118.2 million, respectively, with 1,702,150 deaths and 47.5 million DALYs for females and 2,438,820 deaths and 70.7 million DALYs for male. In the 13 level-three causes, ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive and pulmonary disease (COPD) were the leading three causes of deaths and DALYs attributable to ambient PM2.5. The number of global deaths and DALYs attributable to ambient PM2.5 has increased by 102.3% and 67.7% from 1990 to 2019, respectively. However, ASMR and ASDR showed little change. In the 13 level-three diseases, ischemic heart disease, stroke, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and lung cancer were the top five contributors to the increase of global deaths or DALYs, among which diabetes mellitus had the fastest increase of ASMR and ASDR, with AAPC of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.43, 1.58) and 2.21 (95% CI: 2.15, 2.27), respectively. The population attributable fractions (PAF) of causes in ASMR or ASDR varied significantly across regions, of which PAF of COPD, stroke and lung cancer were the top three. Regarding the GBD region, high PAF mainly occurred in North Africa and Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia.

METHODS: Prospective observational study including consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to the University Hospital of Pisa (4th March-30(th) April 2020). Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. The secondary endpoint was a composite of death or severe ARDS. LMWH, hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline, macrolides, antiretrovirals, remdesivir, baricitinib, tocilizumab, and steroids were evaluated as treatment exposures of interest. First, a Cox-regression analysis, in which treatments were introduced as time-dependent variables, was performed to evaluate the association of exposures and outcomes. Then, a time-dependent Propensity-score (PS) was calculated and a PS-matching performed for each treatment variable. RESULTS: Among 315 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 70 (22.2%) died during hospital stay. The composite endpoint was achieved by 114 (36.2%) patients. Overall, 244 (77.5%) patients received LMWH, 238 (75.5%) hydroxychloroquine, 201 (63.8%) proteases inhibitors, 150 (47.6%) doxycycline, 141 (44.8%) steroids, 42 (13.3%) macrolides, 40 (12.7%) baricitinib, 13 (4.1%) tocilizumab, and 13 (4.1%) remdesivir.

In Singapore, extensive contact tracing by the Ministry of Health for every diagnosed COVID-19 case, and legally enforced quarantine and intensive health surveillance of close contacts provided a rare opportunity to determine asymptomatic attack rates and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors among community close contacts of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore, identified between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with the index COVID-19 case. Non-household close contacts were defined as those who had contact for at least 30 min within 2 m of the index case. All patients with COVID-19 in Singapore received inpatient treatment, with access restricted to health-care staff. All close contacts were quarantined for 14 days with thrice-daily symptom monitoring via telephone. Symptomatic contacts underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Secondary clinical attack rates were derived from the prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts. Consenting contacts underwent serology testing and detailed exposure risk assessment. Bayesian modelling was used to estimate the prevalence of missed diagnoses and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors. FINDINGS: Between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020, 7770 close contacts (1863 household contacts, 2319 work contacts, and 3588 social contacts) linked to 1114 PCR-confirmed index cases were identified. Symptom-based PCR testing detected 188 COVID-19 cases, and 7582 close contacts completed quarantine without a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Among 7518 (968%) of the 7770 close contacts with complete data, the secondary clinical attack rate was 59% (95% CI 49-71) for 1779 household contacts, 13% (09-19) for 2231 work contacts, and 13% (10-17) for 3508 social contacts. Bayesian analysis of serology and symptom data obtained from 1150 close contacts (524 household contacts, 207 work contacts, and 419 social contacts) estimated that a symptom-based PCR-testing strategy missed 62% (95% credible interval 55-69) of COVID-19 diagnoses, and 36% (27-45) of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic. Sharing a bedroom (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 538 [95% CI 182-1584]; p=00023) and being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (786 [386-1602]; p<00001) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household contacts. Among non-household contacts, exposure to more than one case (multivariable OR 392 [95% CI 207-740], p<00001), being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (267 [121-588]; p=0015), and sharing a vehicle with an index case (307 [155-608]; p=00013) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Among both household and non-household contacts, indirect contact, meal sharing, and lavatory co-usage were not independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and reduced capacity for mindfulness-a protective factor for child-bearers-may be particularly relevant factors driving mental health problems given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. The current study aims to shed light on modifiable paths to perinatal psychological distress by testing whether there is an indirect effect of IU on psychological symptoms through a perceived reduction in mindfulness during the pandemic. Methods: Pregnant individuals (67%, n = 133) and new mothers within 6 months postpartum (33%, n = 66) participated in a cross-sectional online survey assessing IU, current and retrospective pre-pandemic mindfulness (FFMQ), and psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, somatization; BSI). Perceived change in mindfulness was captured by including retrospective mindfulness as a covariate in the PROCESS macro used for analyses. Results: Tests of the direct association between mindfulness, IU, and psychological symptoms showed significant effects of IU (b = 0.46, SE = 0.064; p < .001) and perceived decrease in mindfulness during the pandemic (b = - 0.72, SE = 0.08, p < .001) on psychological symptoms (R 2 = .21-.34; F[2, 197] = 51.13-52.81, p < .001).

We defined high capability centers using two criteria: (1) provision of adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), based on either 2008C2013 Extracorporeal Life Support Organization reporting or provision of ECMO to 2010 Medicare beneficiaries; or (2) high annual hospital mechanical ventilation volume, based 2010 Medicare claims. SETTING: Nonfederal acute care hospitals in the United States. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We defined geographic access as the percentage of the state, region and national population with either direct or hospital-transferred access within one or two hours by air or ground transport. Of 4,822 acute care hospitals, 148 hospitals met our ECMO criteria and 447 hospitals met our mechanical ventilation criteria. Geographic access varied substantially across states and regions in the United States, depending on center criteria. Without interhospital transfer, an estimated 58.5% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 79.0% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. With interhospital transfer and under ideal circumstances, an estimated 96.4% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 98.6% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. However, this degree of geographic access required substantial interhospital transfer of patients, including up to two hours by air.

Results Eleven articles were included in the review comprising seven national registries and one international registry (of 12 European countries) for a total sample of 265,608 patients. Data were most commonly provided to the registry by a web-based application, and included individual-level data (i.e. sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, and clinical measurements). When reported, service-level data most commonly included wait times, programme enrolment and completion. The overarching governance, funding modes (e.g. industry ( n = 2), government ( n = 1)), and incentives for registry participation (e.g. benchmarking, financial reimbursement, or mandatory requirement) varied widely.

Methods: A total of 357 international students from 62 countries (236 in the host country and 121 in the home country) completed an online questionnaire survey 2 months after transition to online learning. We studied students' levels of loneliness, life and academic satisfaction, acculturative stress, academic adjustment, performance, loyalty, and perceptions of the online learning experience. Results: The country-of-residence variable had no statistically significant effects on most psychological and academic variables. Significant effects were observed only for two academic variables. Specifically, students who returned to the home country found online communication with other students more contributing to their online learning experience and exhibited higher academic adjustment than students who remained in the host country. This suggests the positive influence of (peer and familial) support on online learning experience from the home country. Furthermore, a significant difference in experiencing acculturative stress occurred for students in quarantine/self-isolation in the host country, which expands prior literature on the disruptive effects of social distancing on students' mental health. Finally, this study confirmed the expected increased levels of loneliness among self-isolating students in both countries, hence extending prior results to the home- and host-country contexts. No relationship between self-isolation and students' life or academic satisfaction was found, which is explained by the specific nature of the learning-from-home experience.","output":"The Psychological and Academic Effects of Studying From the Home and Host Country During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections with SARS-CoV-2 can cause a multi-facetted disease, which is not only characterized by pneumonia and overwhelming systemic inflammatory immune responses, but which can also directly affect the digestive system and infect intestinal epithelial cells.

When the teeth fall off and enter the crusher with other ore materials, serious damages to crusher gears and other equipment happen, which causes millions of economic loss, because it is made of high-manganese steel. Thus, it is urgent to develop an efficient and automatic algorithm for detecting broken teeth. However, existing methods for detecting broken teeth have little effect and most research studies depended on sensor skills, which will be disturbed by closed cavity in shovel and not stable in practice. In this paper, we present an intelligent computer vision system for monitoring teeth condition and detecting missing teeth. Since the pixel-level algorithm is carried out, the amount of calculation should be reduced to improve the superiority of the algorithm. To release computational pressure of subsequent work, salient detection based on deep learning is proposed for extracting the key frame images from video flow taken by the camera installed on the shovel including the teeth we intend to analyze. Additionally, in order to more efficiently monitor teeth condition and detect missing teeth, semantic segmentation based on deep learning is processed to get the relative position of the teeth in the image. Once semantic segmentation is done, floating images containing the shape of teeth are obtained. Then, to detect missing teeth effectively, image registration is proposed. Finally, the result of image registration shows whether teeth are missing or not, and the system will immediately alert staff to check the shovel when teeth fall off. Through sufficient experiments, statistical result had demonstrated superiority of our presented model that serves more promising prospect in mining industry.","output":"Electric Shovel Teeth Missing Detection Method Based on Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In free flap reconstruction for head and neck cancer, achieving a haemodynamic target using excessive fluid infusion is associated with decreased flap survival rates and extended hospital stays. We hypothesized that goal-directed haemodynamic therapy would improve flap survival rates and shorten hospitalization periods. METHODS Patients scheduled for free flap reconstruction were randomly assigned to a goal-directed haemodynamic therapy group (n = 31) or a conventional haemodynamic therapy control group (n = 31). The control group received extra bolus fluid and ephedrine or norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure  65 mmHg. The goal-directed haemodynamic therapy group received a colloid solution as the extra bolus fluid to maintain a stroke volume variation < 12%; dobutamine, ephedrine, or norepinephrine was administered to maintain a cardiac index  2.5 l/min/m2 and mean arterial pressure  65 mmHg. Enhanced recovery after surgery protocols were not used except for fluid therapy. An otolaryngologist blinded to group assignments assessed flap outcomes and classified them as 'survival,' 'at risk' or 'failure.' RESULTS The hospitalization period was not significantly different between the groups. The goal-directed haemodynamic therapy group had significantly shorter intensive care unit stays and a higher flap survival rate. The crystalloid volume was significantly lower in goal-directed haemodynamic therapy group. Reoperation rates, post-operative complications, and laboratory data including inflammatory markers were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION Compared to conventional haemodynamic therapy, goal-directed haemodynamic therapy does not reduce hospitalization periods; it may, however, reduce the length of intensive care unit stays and increase flap survival rates.

These medications have been postulated to influence susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this study was to assess a possible association between prescription of RAS inhibitors and the incidence of COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. Methods We conducted a propensity-score matched cohort study to assess the incidence of COVID-19 among patients with hypertension who were prescribed ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared to patients treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in a large UK-based primary care database (The Health Improvement Network). We estimated crude incidence rates for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 among those prescribed ACE inhibitors, ARBs and CCBs. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to produce adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19 comparing patients prescribed ACE inhibitors or ARBs to those prescribed CCBs. We further assessed all-cause mortality as a secondary outcome and a composite of accidents, trauma or fractures as a negative control outcome to assess for residual confounding. Results In the propensity score matched analysis, 83 of 18,895 users (0.44%) of ACE inhibitors developed COVID-19 over 8,923 person-years, an incidence rate of 9.3 per 1000 person-years. 85 of 18,895 (0.45%) users of CCBs developed COVID-19 over 8,932 person-years, an incidence rate of 9.5 per 1000 person-years. The adjusted hazard ratio for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 for users of ACE inhibitors compared to CCBs was 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). 79 out of 10,623 users (0.74%) of ARBs developed COVID-19 over 5010 person-years, an incidence rate of 15.8 per 1000 person-years, compared to 11.6 per 1000 person-years among users of CCBs. The adjusted hazard ratio for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 for users of ARBs compared to CCBs was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.95). There were no significant associations between use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality, compared to use of CCBs. We found no evidence of significant residual confounding with the negative control analysis. Conclusion Current use of ACE inhibitors was not associated with the risk of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 whereas use of ARBs was associated with a statistically non-significant 38% relative increase in risk compared to use of CCBs. However, no significant associations were observed between prescription of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality during the peak of the pandemic.","output":"Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension: a propensity score-matched cohort study in primary care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last decade (2010-2021) has witnessed the evolution of robotic applications in orthodontics.

By using intravenous or topical fluorescent agents, CLE highlights certain mucosal elements that facilitate an optical biopsy in real time. CLE technology has been used in different organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract. There has been numerous studies evaluating this technology in gastrointestinal endoscopy, our aim was to evaluate the safety, value, and efficacy of this technology in the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Technology and Value Assessment Committee (TAVAC) performed a PubMed/Medline database search of clinical studies involving CLE in May of 2018. The literature search used combinations of the keywords: confocal laser endomicroscopy, pCLE, Cellvizio, in vivo microscopy, optical histology, advanced endoscopic imaging, and optical diagnosis. Bibliographies of key references were searched for relevant studies not covered by the PubMed search. Case reports and small case series were excluded. The manufacturer's website was also used to identify key references. The United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) Manufacturer And User facility and Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for reports regarding the device malfunction or injuries. RESULTS The technology offers an excellent safety profile with rare adverse events related to the use of fluorescent agents. It has been shown to increase the detection of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, gastric intraepithelial neoplasia/early gastric cancer, and dysplasia associated with inflammatory bowel disease when compared to standard screening protocols. It also aids in the differentiation and classification of colorectal polyps, indeterminate biliary strictures, and pancreatic cystic lesions. CONCLUSIONS CLE has an excellent safety profile.

Like for other coronaviruses, its particles are composed of four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins. The involvement of each of these proteins and their interactions are critical for assembly and production of ?-coronavirus particles. Here, we sought to characterize the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins during the viral assembly process. By combining biochemical and imaging assays in infected vs. transfected cells, we show that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S as well as its intracellular processing. Indeed, the imaging data reveal that S is re-localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or Golgi compartments upon co-expression of E or M, as observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which prevents syncytia formation. We show that a C-terminal retrieval motif in the cytoplasmic tail of S is required for its M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlight that E and M induce a specific maturation of N-glycosylation of S, independently of the regulation of its localization, with a profile that is observed both in infected cells and in purified viral particles. Finally, we show that E, M and N are required for optimal production of virus- like-particles. Altogether, these results highlight how E and M proteins may influence the properties of S proteins and promote the assembly of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 Envelope and Membrane proteins modulate maturation and retention of the Spike protein, allowing assembly of virus-like particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the role of demographics, civic beliefs, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in association with distinct forms of civic participation.

Progress in medicine should combine improvements of knowledge, efficacy, and safety of diagnostic/therapeutic procedures, with adequate cost-effectiveness profiles. This narrative review is aimed at assessing in medicine, more specifically in phlebology and lymphology: (a) scientific literature possible biases, (b) the level of evidence, comprehensiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the main therapeutic options, and (c) the possible contribution of integrative and translational medicine. Current medical research may have cognitive biases, or industry-tied influences, which impacts clinical practice. Some reductionism, with an increasing use of drugs and technology, often neglecting the understanding and care of the root causative pathways of the diseases, is affecting biomedical science as well. Aging brings a relevant burden of chronic degenerative diseases and disabilities, with relevant socio-economic repercussions; thus, a major attention to cost-effectiveness and appropriateness of healthcare is warranted. In this scenario, costly and innovative but relatively validated therapies may tend to be adopted in venous and lymphatic diseases, such as varicose veins, leg venous ulcer, post-thrombotic syndrome, pelvic congestion syndrome, and lymphedema. Conversely, a more comprehensive approach to the basic pathophysiology of chronic venous and lymphatic insufficiency and the inclusion of pharmacoeconomics analyses would benefit overall patients management. Erroneous lifestyle and nutrition, together with chronic stress-induced syndromes, significantly influence chronic degenerative phlebo-lymphatic diseases. The main active epigenetic socio-biologic factors are obesity, dysfunctions of musculo-respiratory-vascular pumps, pro-inflammatory nutrition, hyperactivation of stress axis, and sedentarism.

Our approach combines insights from recent scholarship highlighting the socially situated character of inequality beliefs with those of survey experimental work testing how information about inequality changes peoples understandings of it. Specifically, we propose to use deliberative focus groups to approximate the interactional contexts in which individuals process information and form beliefs in social life.

We assessed the short-term impact of a COVID-19 immunization program with varying constraints on population health and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) needs. METHODS: A SARS-CoV-2 transmission model was calibrated to French epidemiological data. We defined several vaccine implementation scenarios starting in January 2021 based on timing of discontinuation of NPIs, supply and uptake constraints, and their relaxation. We assessed the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations averted, the need for and number of days with NPIs in place over the 2021-2022 period. RESULTS: An immunisation program under constraints could reduce the burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 9-40% if the vaccine prevents against infections. Relaxation of constraints not only reduces further COVID-19 hospitalizations (30-39% incremental reduction), it also allows for NPIs to be discontinued post-2021 (0 days with NPIs in 2022 versus 11 to 125 days for vaccination programs under constraints and 327 in the absence of vaccination). CONCLUSION: For 2021, COVID-19 control is expected to rely on a combination of NPIs and the outcome of early immunisation programs. The ability to overcome supply and uptake constraints will help prevent the need for further NPIs post-2021.

METHODS State-transition Markov model provided absolute and incremental clinical and monetary results. In the model, obese patients could undergo surgery, develop post-surgery complications, experience diabetes type II, cardiovascular diseases or die. German Quality Assurance in Bariatric Surgery Registry and literature sources provided data on clinical effectiveness and safety. The model considered three types of surgeries: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding. The model was extensively validated, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainty. Cost data were obtained from German sources and presented in 2012 euros (). RESULTS Over 10 years, bariatric surgery led to the incremental cost of 2909, generated additional 0.03 years of life and 1.2 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2457 per QALY. Over a lifetime, surgery led to savings of 8522 and generated an increment of 0.7 years of life or 3.2 QALYs. The analysis also depicted an association between surgery and a reduction of obesity-related adverse events (diabetes, cardiovascular disorders). Delaying surgery for up to 3 years, resulted in a reduction of life years and QALYs gained, in addition to a moderate reduction in associated healthcare costs. CONCLUSIONS Bariatric surgery is cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and may result in a substantial reduction in the financial burden on the healthcare system over the lifetime of the treated individuals.

Whilst vaccines are being rolled out, non-pharmaceutical interventions remain the most important tools for mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Quantifying the impact of these measures as well as determining what settings are prone to instigating (super)spreading events is important for informed and safe reopening of spaces and the targeting of interventions. Mathematical models can help decipher the complex interactions that underlie virus transmission. Currently, most mathematical models developed during the COVID-19 epidemic evaluate interventions at national or subnational levels. Smaller scales of transmission, such as at the level of indoor spaces, have received less attention, despite the central role they play in both transmission and control. Models that do act on this scale use simplified descriptions of human behavior, impeding a valid quantitative analysis of the impact of interventions on transmission in indoor spaces, particularly those that aim for physical distancing. To more accurately predict the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through a pedestrian environment, we introduce a model that links pedestrian movement and choice dynamics with SARS-CoV-2 spreading models. The objective of this paper is to investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor spaces as it arises from human interactions and assess the relative impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions thereon. We developed a world-wide unique combined Pedestrian Dynamics - Virus Spread model (PeDViS model), which combines insights from pedestrian modelling, epidemiology, and IT-design. In particular, an expert-driven activity assignment model is coupled with the microscopic simulation model (Nomad) and a virus spread model (QVEmod). We first describe the non-linear relationships between the risks of exposure to the virus and the duration, distance, and context of human interactions. We compared virus exposure relative to a benchmark contact (1.5meters for 15 minutes): a threshold often used by public health agencies to determine at risk contacts. We discuss circumstances under which individuals that adhere to common distancing measures may nevertheless be at risk. Specifically, we illustrate the stark increase in exposure at shorter distances, as well as longer contact durations. These risks increase when the infected individual was present in the space before the interaction occurred, as a result of buildup of virus in the environment. The latter is particularly true in poorly ventilated spaces and highlights the importance of good ventilation to prevent potential virus exposure through indirect transmission routes. Combining intervention tools that target different routes of transmission can aid in accumulating impact. We use face masks as an example, which are particularly effective at reducing virus spread that is not affected by ventilation. We then demonstrate the use of PeDViS using a simple restaurant case study, focussing on transmission between guests. In this setting the exposure risk to individuals that are not seated at the same table is limited, but guests seated at nearby tables are estimated to experience exposure risks that surpass that of the benchmark contact. These risks are larger in low ventilation scenarios. Lastly, we illustrate that the impact of intervention measures on the number of new infections heavily depends on the relative efficiency of the direct and indirect transmission routes considered. This uncertainty should be considered when assessing the risks of transmission upon different types of human interactions in indoor spaces. The PeDViS case study shows the multi-dimensionality of SARS-CoV-2 that emerges from the interplay of human behaviour and the spread of respiratory viruses in indoor spaces. A modelling strategy that incorporates this in risk assessments can be an important tool to inform policy makers and citizens. It can empower them to make better design and policy decisions pertaining to the most effective use of measures to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and safely open up indoor spaces.","output":"The multi-dimensional challenges of controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor spaces: Insights from the linkage of a microscopic pedestrian simulation and virus transmission models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Minimally invasive surgery is associated with smaller surgical incisions than those of traditional midline laparotomy. However, most colorectal resections and all hand-assisted procedures require an incision either for specimen retrieval or insertion of the hand-assist device. The ideal site of this incision has not been evaluated with respect to the incidence of incisional hernia. This study compares the rates of incisional hernia associated with a standard midline laparotomy, a midline incision of reduced length, and a Pfannenstiel incision. METHODS From March 2004 to July 2007, 512 consecutive patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were divided into three groups depending on the type of incision (open, midline, and Pfannenstiel). Demographic variables, rate of incisional hernia, and risk factors for hernia were compared among the groups. RESULTS There were 142, 231, and 139 patients in the open, midline, and Pfannenstiel groups, respectively. All three groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, steroid use, diabetes, number of patients with malignancy, and duration of follow-up. The Pfannenstiel group had a higher mean BMI (p = 0.015) and the open group had a higher rate of wound infection (28.2%) compared to the other groups. Incidence of incisional hernia was similar for the open and midline groups (19.7 and 16%, p = 0.36). At a mean follow-up of 17.5 months, not a single patient with a Pfannenstiel incision developed an incisional hernia (p < 0.001). BMI (p = 0.019), follow-up (p < 0.001), and Pfannenstiel incision (p < 0.001) were found to be predictors (protectors) of incisional hernia on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION A Pfannenstiel incision is associated with the lowest rate of incisional hernia and should be the incision of choice for hand assistance and specimen extraction in minimally invasive colorectal resections wherever applicable.","output":"Incisional hernia, midline versus low transverse incision: what is the ideal incision for specimen extraction and hand-assisted laparoscopy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines, released in 2017, are a combination of expert opinion and evidence-based medicine, adopted by many institutions as a standard of practice.

The deadline for implementing European legislation in this area means that strategic plans are being developed at local and regional level. In Spain there are municipal and regional strategies already developed and implemented but the national strategy has not yet been approved. To this end, the development of monitoring and evaluation tools such as the one presented in this article, can help not only in local decision-making, but also in the establishment of common criteria to help assess its future evolution. This research analyses the large peri-urban parks located in the southwest of the Community of Madrid (Spain). The evaluation is carried out from a local to a regional scale applying multifunctionality criteria to the planning, design, execution, maintenance and resilience phases. From the point of view of landscape structures, the findings of this study reflect a high environmental and social services delivery value, which makes it possible to understand the need to create networks to integrate the peri-urban spaces into the city and to attend to and understand the needs of all actors involved: citizens, political leaders, municipal technicians and private companies, providing them a common vision that improves the future of these spaces. This makes them core areas from which to design strategic plans for natural infrastructure and improvement of biodiversity in the urban area, being, likewise, an example that can be extrapolated and applied to large cities whose urban areas are adjoined and where peri-urban parks can be the starting point for designing supramunicipal strategies for open spaces. Based on these results we can conclude that south-west Madrid provides the ideal conditions for implementing a supra-municipal strategy for green infrastructures which, starting with its large forest parks, showcases the periurban areas which connect them with the urban green network. The Mstoles Green Network and Bosquesur are two strategic projects which, together with the forest parks, constitute a working framework based on which the Supra-municipal Strategy for Open Spaces in South-west Madrid can be devised.","output":"Green space networks as natural infrastructures in PERI-URBAN areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a clonal, acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorder, which is caused by activation of the complement system leading to life-threatening manifestations such as hemolysis, thrombosis, and marrow failure Eculizumab is a complement inhibitor of C5, which acts by blocking complement-mediated hemolysis It needs to be administered lifelong to the patient;hence, there are major financial implications This drug is easily available in the Western countries;however, in low resource countries, where its availability is limited, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) still remains the main modality for achieving cure in PNH PNH being a rare disease, large prospective studies and guidelines are scarce To choose the ideal candidate for transplant is the real challenge This article aims to review the trends in HSCT for PNH, such as the use of reduced-intensity conditioning to attain the graft versus PNH effect or the use of haploidentical donors In the era of complement inhibitor therapy, the role of transplantation still needs to be explored","output":"Current status of stem cell transplantation in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the whole world is still struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning and home office become more common.

A well-known side effect of propofol is a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance resulting in hypotension, but little is known about the effects on microcirculation in humans. We aimed to evaluate the effects of propofol on the sublingual microcirculatory perfusion by continuous video imaging in pediatric patients undergoing procedural sedation. METHODS Patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for procedural sedation were recruited. Oral microcirculation was measured employing a continuous monitoring strategy with incident dark-field illumination imaging. Measurements were obtained before and 3 minutes after propofol induction. Total and perfused vessel densities, proportion of perfused vessels, microvascular flow index, blood vessel diameter (?bv ), and systemic hemodynamics were analyzed. RESULTS Continuous measurements were achieved in seven patients. Three minutes after propofol induction mean arterial pressure decreased (P = 0.028) and total and perfused vessel densities increased by 12% (P = 0.018) and 16% (P = 0.018), respectively. MFI was unaltered and mean ?bv increased but not significantly. CONCLUSIONS Propofol induction induces a reduction in mean arterial pressure and a rise in sublingual microvascular perfusion.

On the government's side, social media can provide a conduit for communicating health risk information in an effective and timely fashion, while also engaging citizens in informed decision-making. On the citizen's side, information communication technology (ICT)-based practices cannot function unless citizens recognize and act on their responsibility to actively engage with government social media platforms. Despite an increasing interest in understanding the adoption of ICT practices and e-government services for health risk communication, there remains a crucial need for a comprehensive framework to explain which factors determine citizen use of digital government resources. The purpose of this study is to investigate how to increase government accountability for motivating citizens to engage in ICT-based health risk communication, thereby attaining sustainable public health practices through collaborative governance. By integrating trust and health risk information into the e-government adoption model (GAM), this research examines factors that influence citizens' likelihood of using government social media resources. Survey data from 700 Korean citizens were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicated that individuals with higher social media competency are more likely to (a) seek risk information through social media and (b) perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use. Consistent with the GAM, intentions to use the government's social media sites for information and interactions appear to increase as citizens perceive more value in using them regarding information quality, ease of use, functional benefit, and security. Furthermore, perceived trust in the government's social media resources appears to function as a mediator of this process. Initial trust in the government is an important determinant of perceptions of its digital resources. Citizens who trust the government tend to evaluate new initiatives positively and are more likely to accept and make use of them. The results of this study can inform policy design and implementation by elucidating the mechanisms that determine citizens' adoption and usage of digital government services. Theoretically, this work expands the GAM to include health risk communication and adds empirical evidence to the small yet growing body of knowledge of e-government initiatives. These findings also highlight the importance of public trust in the government, as this encourages citizens to seek health risk information and assistance from the government. Overall, the data and model generated in this investigation represent an important step toward the successful and sustainable modernization of public services.","output":"Collaborative accountability for sustainable public health: A Korean perspective on the effective use of ICT-based health risk communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews and explains the recent policy reactions of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan to the financial and macroeconomic turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic The financial and monetary policy actions of major central banks in the most recent crisis have, by some metrics, surpassed their responses to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-09 in both swiftness and scope","output":"Responses of International Central Banks to the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate nurses self-efficacy, confidence, and nurse-patient interaction during caring of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This study evaluates the impact of a brief, lay provider delivered group-based psychological intervention [Group Problem Management Plus (gPM+)] on the mental health of refugees in a camp, as well as on parenting behavior and childrens mental health. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial, 410 adult Syrian refugees (300 females, 110 males) in Azraq Refugee Camp (Jordan) were identified through screening of psychological distress (16 on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) and impaired functioning (17 on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule). Participants were randomly allocated to gPM+ or enhanced usual care (EUC) involving referral information for psychosocial services on a 1:1 ratio. Participants were aware of treatment allocation, but assessors were blinded to treatment condition. Primary outcomes were scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL; depression and anxiety scales) assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months follow-up as the primary outcome time point. It was hypothesized that gPM+ would result in greater reductions of scores on the HSCL than EUC. Secondary outcomes were disability, posttraumatic stress, personally identified problems, prolonged grief, prodromal psychotic symptoms, parenting behavior, and childrens mental health. Between October 15, 2019 and March 2, 2020, 624 refugees were screened for eligibility, 462 (74.0%) screened positive, of whom 204 were assigned to gPM+ and 206 to EUC. There were 168 (82.4%) participants in gPM+ and 189 (91.7%) in EUC assessed at follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that at follow-up, participants in gPM+ showed greater reduction on HSCL depression scale than those receiving EUC (mean difference, 3.69 [95% CI 1.90 to 5.48], p = .001; effect size, 0.40). There was no difference between conditions in anxiety (mean difference ?0.56, 95% CI ?2.09 to 0.96; p = .47; effect size, ?0.03). Relative to EUC, participants in gPM+ had greater reductions in severity of personally identified problems (mean difference 0.88, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.69; p = .03), and inconsistent disciplinary parenting (mean difference 1.54, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.05; p < .001). There were no significant differences between conditions for changes in PTSD, disability, grief, prodromal symptoms, or childhood mental health outcomes. Mediation analysis indicated the change in inconsistent disciplinary parenting was associated with reduced attentional ( = 0.11, SE .07; 95% CI .003 to .274) and internalizing ( = 0.08, SE .05; 95% CI .003 to 0.19) problems in children. No adverse events were attributable to the interventions or the trial. Major limitations included only one-quarter of participants being male, and measures of personally identified problems, grief, prodromal psychotic symptoms, inconsistent parenting behavior, and childrens mental health have not been validated with Syrians. CONCLUSIONS: In camp-based Syrian refugees, a brief group behavioral intervention led to reduced depressive symptoms, personally identified problems, and disciplinary parenting compared to usual care, and this may have indirect benefits for refugees children. The limited capacity of the intervention to reduce PTSD, disability, or childrens psychological problems points to the need for development of more effective treatments for refugees in camp settings.

To minimize the risk of health problems, visitors should be able to access information on the health care systems of the places they visit. Most short-term overseas visitors are young adults. Although they are not very likely to get sick from noncommunicable diseases, they are at high risk for injury and often experience stomach ailments, fever, or nausea when travelling. The objective of this study is to evaluate culturally and linguistically appropriate health information on preventive health behaviours and the health care system in Japan. We will examine the level of satisfaction of overseas visitors to Japan with health care-related educational materials using a five-minute digital game named Sa-Chan Japan. METHODS: Our study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We will assess both satisfaction and motivation before, during, and after the interventions and examine the changes over time. The intervention group will comprise overseas visitors who will view and answer questions in an animation named Sa-Chan Japan. The control group will comprise overseas visitors who will watch an English digital animation named Mari Info Japan. We will recruit 1002 participants through the Macromill Internet portal. We will contact overseas visitors who have either visited or wish to visit Japan from the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia. The participants will fill out a self-administered questionnaire online in the first quarter of 2021.

This study examined the prevalence of sleep disturbances and their association with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable older psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This multicenter, cross-sectional study involved older patients attending maintenance treatment at outpatient departments of four major psychiatric hospitals in China. Patients socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. Sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and QOL were assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and 2 items of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief version, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the independent associations of socio-demographic and clinical variables with sleep disturbances, while the association between sleep disturbances and QOL was explored with analysis of covariance. RESULTS: A total of 941 patients were recruited. The prevalence of sleep disturbances was 57.1% (95% CI: 53.9C60.2%). Analysis of covariance revealed that QOL was significantly lower in patients with sleep disturbances compared to those without. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbances were positively and independently associated with more severe depressive symptoms (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.26C1.37). Compared to patients with major depressive disorder, those with other psychiatric diagnoses had a significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.00C2.08).

Limited data directly compare selection of mechanically \\"optimal\\" or \\"best\\" PEEP in both supine and prone positions, either with or without changes in chest wall compliance. To compare best PEEP in these varied conditions, we used an experimental ARDS model to compare the mechanical, gas exchange, and hemodynamic response to PEEP titration in supine and prone position with varied abdominal pressure. METHODS Twelve adult swine underwent pulmonary saline lavage and injurious ventilation to simulate ARDS. We used a reversible model of intra-abdominal hypertension to alter chest wall compliance. Response to PEEP levels of 20,17,14,11, 8, and 5 cmH2O was evaluated under four conditions: supine, high abdominal pressure; prone, high abdominal pressure; supine, low abdominal pressure; and prone, low abdominal pressure. Using lung compliance determined with esophageal pressure, we recorded the \\"best PEEP\\" and its corresponding target value. Data were evaluated for relationships among abdominal pressure, PEEP, and position using three-way analysis of variance and a linear mixed model with Tukey adjustment. RESULTS Prone position and PEEP independently improved lung compliance (P < .0001). There was no interaction. As expected, intra-abdominal hypertension increased the PEEP needed for the best lung compliance (P < .0001 supine, P = .007 prone). However, best PEEP was not significantly different between prone (12.8  2.4 cmH2O) and supine (11.0  4.2 cmH2O) positions when targeting lung compliance CONCLUSIONS: Despite complementary mechanisms, prone position and appropriate PEEP exert their positive effects on lung mechanics independently of each other.","output":"PEEP titration: the effect of prone position and abdominal pressure in an ARDS model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic marks an extraordinary global public health crisis unseen in the last century, with its rapid spread worldwide and associated mortality burden.

Due to public health restrictions, many pediatric pain clinics halted in-person appointments, delaying and disrupting access to care. There is no existing research on the impacts of COVID-19 on pediatric chronic pain care in Canada or the challenges experienced by health care professionals and pain clinics. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on Canadian pediatric chronic pain care by documenting how health care professionals provided care during the first six months of the pandemic. Methods: Two Canadian online cross-sectional surveys were conducted: one among Canadian pediatric pain clinic directors (Study 1) and another among multidisciplinary pediatric pain health care professionals (Study 2). Results: Responses from 13/13 Canadian pediatric pain clinics/rehabilitation programs indicated that all clinics provided virtual care during the pandemic. No significant changes were reported on the frequency of appointment requests. Most clinics reported no perceived change in patient pain levels (n = 9/13, 69%) or occurrence of pain flares (n = 10/13, 77%). Results from 151 individual health care professionals indicated that the majority (90%) of nonCemergency department respondents were providing virtual care. The main challenges of virtual care included technological barriers, financial concerns, infrastructure and logistics, privacy, and clinical challenges. Conclusions: This study documented the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric chronic pain care in Canada and highlighted the rapid shift to using virtual solutions. Simultaneously, respondents outlined current challenges and potential solutions to consider in the development of virtual care guidelines and policy in Canada.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Impact and Response in Canadian Pediatric Chronic Pain Care: A National Survey of Medical Directors and Pain Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although terrestrial gastropods are remarkably diverse, our knowledge of them is still lacking, especially for species from the Global South. As such, new tools to help researchers collect data on these organisms are very welcome. With this in mind, we investigated Brazilian observations on iNaturalist to assess the feasibility of the data available on the platform as a basis for studies on the tropical terrestrial gastropod fauna. The observations on iNaturalist were filtered by country, Brazil, and higher taxa, namely Eupulmonata, Cyclophoroidea and Helicinoidea, yielding a sample of 4,983 observations. These observations were then reviewed in search of records of rare or little-known species, species found outside their previously known range, and interesting ecological interactions. Exotic species made up 35% to 39% of the sampled iNaturalist records. The most commonly observed species were Lissachatina fulica (Bowdich, 1822), Bradybaena similaris (Frussac, 1822), Drymaeus papyraceus (Mawe, 1823), Drymaeus interpunctus (E. von Martens, 1887), Limacus flavus (Linnaeus, 1758), Meghimatium pictum (Stoliczka, 1873), Cornu aspersum (O. F. Mller, 1774), Vaginulus taunaisii (Frussac, 1821), Ovachlamys fulgens (Gude, 1900), and Bulimulus tenuissimus (Frussac, 1832). In total, 166 observations were deemed of interest to our purposes (e.g., rare species, range extensions, ecological interactions), totalling 46 identified species and 16 observations identified at genus level. Among the selected observations, we found pictures of live specimens of species that were previously known only from their shells, such as Megalobulimus pergranulatus (Pilsbry, 1901), bringing to light their appearances in life. Two potentially new species belonging to the genera Plekocheilus Guilding, 1827 and Megalobulimus K. Miller, 1878 were revealed. Additionally, we found records of living individuals of two species that were previously presumed to be possibly extinct, Leiostracus carnavalescus Simone & Salvador, 2016, and Gonyostomus egregius (Pfeiffer, 1845). We take the opportunity to discuss individual records of interest, evaluate the quality of the data and possible improvements, as well the potential and implications of the use of the iNaturalist platform for research in Brazil and other tropical countries.

ObjectiveTo estimate how many Californians have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from prior infection or vaccination. DesignWave 1 of CalScope: a repeated cross-sectional serosurvey of adults and children enrolled between April 20, 2021 and June 16, 2021. SettingA population-based random sample of households in seven counties in California (Alameda, El Dorado, Kern, Los Angeles, Monterey, San Diego, and Shasta) were invited to complete an at-home SARS-CoV-2 antibody test and survey instrument. ParticipantsInvitations were sent to 200,000 randomly selected households in the seven counties. From each household, 1 adult (18 years and older) and 1 child (aged 6 months to 17 years) could enroll in the study. There were no exclusion criteria. Main Outcome(s) and MeasuresAll specimens were tested for antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome was serostatus category, which was determined based on antibody test results and self-reported vaccination status: seronegative, antibodies from infection only, antibodies from infection and vaccination, and antibodies from vaccination alone. We used inverse probability of selection weights and iterative proportional fitting to account for non-response. Results11,161 households enrolled in wave 1 of CalScope, with 7,483 adults and 1,375 children completing antibody testing. As of June 2021, 27% (95%CI [23%, 31%]) of adults and 30% (95%CI [24%, 36%]) of children had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection; 33% (95%CI [28%, 37%]) of adults and 57% (95%CI [48%, 66%]) of children were seronegative. Serostatus varied regionally. Californians 65 years or older were most likely to have antibodies from vaccine alone (59%; 95%CI [48%, 69%]) and children between 5-11 years old were most likely to have antibodies from prior infection alone (36%; 95%CI [21%, 52%]). Conclusions and RelevanceAs of June 2021, a third of adults in California and most children under 18 remained seronegative.

We conducted this analysis to better understand tocilizumab treatment for COVID-19 patients. MAIN TEXT: We searched major databases for manuscripts reporting the effects of tocilizumab on COVID-19 patients. A total of 25 publications were analyzed with Revman 5.3 and R for the meta-analysis. Significant better clinical outcomes were found in the tocilizumab treatment group when compared to the standard care group [odds ratio (OR) = 0.70, 95% confidential interval (C): 0.54-0.90, P = 0.007]. Tocilizumab treatment showed a stronger correlation with good prognosis among COVID-19 patients that needed mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.37-0.93, P = 0.02). Among stratified analyses, reduction of overall mortality correlates with tocilizumab treatment in patients less than 65 years old (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.60-0.77, P < 0.00001), and with intensive care unit patients (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.55-0.70, P < 0.00001). Pooled estimates of hazard ratio showed that tocilizumab treatment predicts better overall survival in COVID-19 patients (HR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24-0.84, P = 0.01), especially in severe cases (HR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.49-0.68, P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that tocilizumab treatment is associated with a lower risk of mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement among COVID-19 patients.

Here we present the case of an encephalopathic COVID-19 patient with bilateral globus pallidus lesions. While imaging abnormalities involving basal ganglia have been reported in encephalitis caused by neuroinvasive flaviviruses, the bipallidal lesions noted here likely resulted from hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Case Presentation A 51-year-old African American woman was found unresponsive at home by her fianc. She had been complaining of shortness of breath and cough for three days. She is a former smoker with past medical history of hypertension, nephropathy, and bipolar disorder. Upon examination, she was alert but nonverbal, following commands inconsistently, and unable to move extremities against gravity. After several minutes, she was able to state her name but kept repeating it in response to all questions. Chest radiograph revealed bilateral lung infiltrates. CT of the head showed hypodensities in bilateral globus pallidi. A non-contrast MRI of the brain showed symmetric restricted diffusion and FLAIR hyperintense signal changes in bilateral globus pallidi. Abnormal SWI signal seen in bilateral globus pallidi likely represents mineralization or hemosiderin. There were no striatal or thalamic lesions. Major intracranial arteries were widely patent.The patient later tested positive for 2019-nCoV using real-time PCR assay, and was transferred to our COVID-19 designated hospital campus. Thereafter, she had waxing and waning mentation. Repeat CT imaging 11 days after the first scan demonstrated resolution of the bipallidal hypodensities. The patient was recently discharged to a subacute rehab facility but is still experiencing confusion. Conclusions: As we come across neurological manifestations of COVID-19, we believe neuroimaging is likely to play an important role in establishing if central nervous system involvement is invariably due to indirect mechanisms such as metabolic or hypoxic-ischemic brain injury or if direct neuroinvasive disease is a possibility, as with certain viruses.","output":"Bipallidal Lesions in a COVID-19 Patient: A Case Report and Brief Review of Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this study was to assess the drivers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infection development in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its impact on patient outcome.

Outcomes considered were MDR infection and ICU mortality. Results: Fifty percent of patients developed an MDR infection during ICU stay after a median time of 8 [4-11] days. Most common MDR pathogens were carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, causing bloodstream infections and pneumonia. MDR infections were linked to a higher length of ICU stay (p = 0.002), steroid therapy (p = 0.011), and associated with a lower ICU mortality (odds ratio: 0.439, 95% confidence interval: 0.251-0.763; p < 0.001).

The extended use of protective measures (PM) can lead to ill effects on the skin. Our aim was to investigate PM-induced dermatoses amongst healthcare workers and the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 2 months. The study subjects were patients who presented to dermatology outpatient clinics or sought teleconsultation for skin problems related to the use of PMs against COVID-19. A detailed history was obtained and cutaneous examination was documented for all the patients in a pre-set proforma. Diagnoses of the adverse skin effects were formulated based upon history and clinical examination. RESULTS: A total of 101 cases with cutaneous adverse effects due to the use of PMs against COVID-19 were included in the study. The general population and healthcare workers were affected similarly, comprising of 54.5% and 45.5%, respectively. The mean age of the study participants was 36.71  15.72 years.

Thromboelastography (TEG) with platelet mapping (PM) is an alternative assay that directly measures clot formation and mechanical strength. This study compares the results of PRU to TEG-PM.METHODSPatients with simultaneous or near-simultaneous PRU and TEG-PM results who underwent cervical carotid artery stenting, intracranial stent-assisted aneurysm coiling, or flow diversion at the authors' institution between August 2015 and November 2016 were identified. PRU results were compared with the TEG maximal amplitude (MA) attributable to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) activity (MA-ADP) as measured by TEG-PM. Platelet inhibition was considered therapeutic for MA-ADP values < 50 mm or PRU < 194. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated, and the sensitivity and specificity of PRU were calculated assuming that the results of TEG-PM reflected the true degree of platelet inhibition.RESULTSTwenty-three patients were identified with a total of 37 matched sets of TEG-PM and PRU. Three of these pairs were excluded due to anemia outside of the PRU manufacturer's recommended range. The Pearson correlation coefficient for these values was 0.50 (p = 0.0026). The prevalence of clopidogrel nonresponders determined by TEG-PM (9%) matched reported rates (5%-12%); PRU demonstrated much higher prevalence (39%).

not feeling burnout (p&lt;0 01) Differences were seen in wellbeing and CJP between countries (p&lt;0 001) and related to CV-19 country mortality rate (p&lt;0 05) The main predictors of wellbeing, burnout and CJP were resilience and changes to work hours Others frequently identified were coping strategies, ethnicity, concern about training/career, worried about current wellbeing, and working conditions In Survey II, results from 942 participants are undergoing analysis Overall, comparisons between surveys show overall wellbeing and burnout rates have worsened overtime but CJP has improved Among 272 participants who completed both surveys, WBI scores 4 (indicating higher risk of distress) and burnout rates were higher in survey II compared to survey I (22% vs 31% p=0 01;35% vs 49% p=0 001 respectively) suggesting wellbeing and burnout may be worsening overtime CJP improved (38% vs 54% p&lt;0 001) Conclusions: In the largest global survey series, COVID-19 is impacting on the wellbeing and job performance of oncology professionals Risk of distress and burnout has increased over time Urgent measures to address wellbeing and improve resilience are essential Legal entity

responses: pathogen specific signals in the context of co-stimulatory danger signals drive immune strength and accuracy. Viral infections trigger anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) responses by stimulating endosomal and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). However, viruses have also evolved many strategies to counteract IFN responses. Are there intracellular danger signals that enhance immune responses to viruses? During infection, viruses place a heavy demand on the protein folding machinery of the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To survive ER stress, host cells mount an unfolded protein response (UPR) to decrease ER protein load and enhance protein-folding capacity. Viruses also directly elicit the UPR to enhance their replication. Increasing evidence supports an intersection between the host UPR and inflammation, in particular the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN. The UPR directly activates pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription factors and dramatically enhances cytokine production in response to viral PRR engagement. Additionally, viral PRR engagement may stimulate specific pathways within the UPR to enhance cytokine production. Through these mechanisms, viral detection via the UPR and inflammatory cytokine production are intertwined. Consequently, the UPR response is perfectly poised to act as an infection-triggered danger signal. The UPR may serve as an internal co-stimulatory signal that (1) provides specificity and (2) critically augments responses to overcome viral subterfuge. Further work is needed to test this hypothesis during viral infections.","output":"A new paradigm: innate immune sensing of viruses via the unfolded protein response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the impact of exogenous local conditions which favor high market concentration on supply, price and quality in local markets for care homes for older people in England.

We find that areas susceptible to a high degree of market concentration tend to have greatly restricted supply of care home places and (to a lesser extent) a higher average public cost, than areas susceptible to low degree of market concentration.

Recent discussions of science denial suggest that correcting peoples false beliefs rarely has an impact on eliminating the adherence to false beliefs and assumptions, which is called the backfire effect. This paper brings the backfire effect within the context of science denial to the attention of science education researchers and practitioners and discusses the potential role(s) of epistemic understanding of knowledge production in science in dealing with the rejection of scientific evidence and claims in science classrooms. The use of epistemic understanding of knowledge production in science with a focus on avoiding the backfire effect may increase the potential for science education research to produce fruitful strategies which advance students attitudes toward science and deepen students understanding of how science works through divergent perspectives. There are some areas that need to be focused on and investigated for their potential to combat science denial and the backfire effect while foregrounding the role(s) epistemic understanding of knowledge production for science instruction. These areas include expanding ways of knowing and marking the boundary between the scientific way of knowing and other ways of knowing at the same time, comparing claims and arguments that derive from different frameworks, teaching about the power and limitations of science, and bringing different and similar ways science is done to students attention.","output":"When Science Denial Meets Epistemic Understanding: Fostering a Research Agenda for Science Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral Finance is an evolving field that studies how psychological factors affect decision making under uncertainty. This study seeks to find the influence of certain identified behavioral financial biases on the decision-making process of investors in developing countries. This research examines the moderating effect of Information asymmetry on the two most important and commonly used cognitive biases, namely Anchoring bias and Optimism bias and decision making and investigates whether Risk perception mediates the relationship between them or not. Quantitative research has been conducted using a structured questionnaire for data collection. After completing the pilot study, a questionnaire was designed and sent to investors via online channels. Data has been collected from 317 real estate investors. Mediation analysis has been performed using model 4 and moderation analysis by applying model 15 of Process Macros (Hayes, 2017) for the interaction effect. The study investigated that both cognitive biases have a significant positive effect on investors decisions and Risk perception also significantly mediates the relationship between them. Consistency with other studies suggests that Information asymmetry has a significant moderating effect. The proposed conceptual model provides insight into how investors decisions are influenced by behavioral biases in the real estate sector and enhances the understanding of cognitive biases in the real estate sector. This study is recommended for real estate investors and policymakers of emerging and developed countries.

The characteristics of these patients, nevertheless, are unknown. We sought to identify disease severity and MV settings of patients in non-ICU. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of Kinan Hospital and Owase General Hospital, where there are no ICUs. Data for adult patients who required MV from January through December 2018 were collected. To find the characteristics of patients who have been decided to treat in non-ICU hospitals without early transferring, we analyzed patients who have been treated for more than three days in those hospitals. Results A total of 171 patients received MV; 29 patients were treated for more than three days. Of those, the mortality rate was 44.8% (13 patients). The median age was 80 years (range: 72-84 years). The mean Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score was 20.9  8.1, and predicted mortality was 0.42  0.25.

Management of personal protective equipment (PPE) and its potential limited availability have created concerns about the increased risks for healthcare professionals at hospitals and nursing homes. Ozone is a powerful oxidant agent. The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of ozone treatment on PPE contaminated with SARS-CoV-2, and to explore whether relative humidity could modify those effects. Methods: PPE contaminated by heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 were treated with different ozone concentrations, exposure times, and relative humidity conditions. SARS-CoV-2 gene amplification was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: There was no amplification of SARS-CoV-2 in PPE after the following ozone exposures: 30 s at 10,000 ppm (20 g/m(3)), 5 min at 4000 ppm, and 10 min at 2000 ppm. At lower ozone concentrations, 4C12 ppm (0.008C0.024 g/m(3)), the effects were highly dependent on the relative humidity conditions. Conclusions: Oxidative stress induced by ozone exposure eliminated heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in different PPE components under appropriate exposure times, ozone concentrations, and relative humidity conditions. These findings could have implications in decreasing the risk of contamination associated with personal protective equipment management and in increasing its availability.

In particular, we aimed to determine the empowerment practices that would have the greatest positive effect on employee performance. Understanding the relationship between performance and empowerment can help health care providers better manage worker stress during any global crisis. This understanding is crucial in guiding policies and interventions aimed at maintaining health care workers' psychological well-being and their overall performance. METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated the relationship between employee empowerment and performance, determining the best empowerment practices for health care leaders to utilize. Frontline health care workers (n = 100) selected using convenience and snowball sampling completed the survey between March 15 and 31, 2020. This is the period when the pandemic just started to accelerate in Saudi Arabia. We conducted Pearson's correlation analysis to assess whether there was a relationship between performance and health care workers' empowerment practice, and stepwise linear regression analysis to investigate the impact each of these empowerment practices on health care workers' performance. RESULTS: Our results indicate that health care workers' performance can be expected to increase the most through 2 empowerment practices: giving employees the discretion to change work processes and offering performance-based rewards (R2 = 0.301, P < .05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that health care leaders must invest in these 2 practices to better equip frontline health care workers. During a global crisis, additional discretion granted to employees helps reduce their anxiety and burnout and hence empowers them with the flexibility to adapt to unforeseen circumstances and improve the quality of their interactions with health service recipients.","output":"The Effects of Empowerment on Health Care Worker Performance During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaration de liens d'interets: Les auteurs declarent ne pas avoir de liens d'interets Copyright ? 2020","output":"Interet d'une web application de triage medical dans la surveillance a l'echelle nationale de l'epidemie d'infections a SARS-Cov2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, US hospitals relied on static projections of future trends for long-term planning and were only beginning to consider forecasting methods for short-term planning of staffing and other resources. With the overwhelming burden imposed by COVID-19 on the health care system, an emergent need exists to accurately forecast hospitalization needs within an actionable timeframe. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to leverage an existing COVID-19 case and death forecasting tool to generate the expected number of concurrent hospitalizations, occupied intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and in-use ventilators 1 day to 4 weeks in the future for New Mexico and each of its five health regions. METHODS: We developed a probabilistic model that took as input the number of new COVID-19 cases for New Mexico from Los Alamos National Laboratory's COVID-19 Forecasts Using Fast Evaluations and Estimation tool, and we used the model to estimate the number of new daily hospital admissions 4 weeks into the future based on current statewide hospitalization rates. The model estimated the number of new admissions that would require an ICU bed or use of a ventilator and then projected the individual lengths of hospital stays based on the resource need. By tracking the lengths of stay through time, we captured the projected simultaneous need for inpatient beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. We used a postprocessing method to adjust the forecasts based on the differences between prior forecasts and the subsequent observed data. Thus, we ensured that our forecasts could reflect a dynamically changing situation on the ground. RESULTS: Forecasts made between September 1 and December 9, 2020, showed variable accuracy across time, health care resource needs, and forecast horizon. Forecasts made in October, when new COVID-19 cases were steadily increasing, had an average accuracy error of 20.0%, while the error in forecasts made in September, a month with low COVID-19 activity, was 39.7%. Across health care use categories, state-level forecasts were more accurate than those at the regional level. Although the accuracy declined as the forecast was projected further into the future, the stated uncertainty of the prediction improved. Forecasts were within 5% of their stated uncertainty at the 50% and 90% prediction intervals at the 3- to 4-week forecast horizon for state-level inpatient and ICU needs. However, uncertainty intervals were too narrow for forecasts of state-level ventilator need and all regional health care resource needs. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time forecasting of the burden imposed by a spreading infectious disease is a crucial component of decision support during a public health emergency. Our proposed methodology demonstrated utility in providing near-term forecasts, particularly at the state level. This tool can aid other stakeholders as they face COVID-19 population impacts now and in the future.","output":"How New Mexico Leveraged a COVID-19 Case Forecasting Model to Preemptively Address the Health Care Needs of the State: Quantitative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to understand the status of COVID-19 spread in Japan and other countries around the world To visually grasp, visualization was performed using a map, and the population was also considered We implemented visualization on the map using statistics software R shiny package and leaflet package ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Visualization of the distribution of newly infected persons with COVID-19 in the prefecture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within an unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic, the burden of helping without harming has grown under the weight of destructive political bias which is harming without helping.

During her PhD, she looked at differences in gene expression between differentiated and undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma stem cells, inspiring an early interest in gene expression and cell fate determination. Between 1986 and 1992, Christine undertook three postdoctoral research positions that took her from London back to Scotland, where she was first introduced to mammary gland biology through her work with John Clark at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh. During her time in the Clark lab, Christine identified a factor - later shown to be STAT5 - that binds to the promoter of the milk protein gene -lactoglobulin. This prompted further work identifying the key role played by the STAT family of transcription factors in mammary gland development. Shortly afterwards, Christine became a group leader at the Roslin Institute and later relocated to the University of Edinburgh to collaborate with Andrew Wyllie. This led to her recruitment to the University of Cambridge in 1998, where she has remained to date.

Within participatory research, recent social distancing practice has forced a transition to digital communication platforms, a setting that warrants deeper understanding. The aim of this study was to describe the experiences of, and evaluate a digital co-creation process for developing an eHealth tool for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: The co-creation was guided by Participatory appreciative action and reflection, where a convenience sample (n = 17), including persons with COPD, health care professionals, relatives and a patient organization representative participated in six digital workshops. User instructions, technical equipment, and skilled support were provided if necessary. Workshops centred around different topics, with pre-recorded films, digital lectures and home assignments to up-skill participants. Process validity, experiences and ownership in the co-creation process were evaluated by repeated respondent validation, member checking, questionnaires and by assessing attendance. Data was analysed quantitatively or qualitatively as appropriate. RESULTS: The co-creators were in general satisfied with the digital format of the workshops. Mean attendance and perceived engagement in workshops was high and the experience described as enjoyable. Engagement was facilitated by up-skilling activities and discussions in small groups. Few had used digital communication previously, and feelings ranging from excitement to concern were expressed initially. Technical issues, mainly audio related, were resolved with support. At completion, skills using equipment and digital platform surpassed expectations. Few disadvantages with the digital format were identified, and advantages included reduced travel, time efficiency and reduced infection risk. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences of digital co-creation were overwhelmingly positive, despite initial barriers related to computer naivety and use of digital equipment and platforms. The high level of satisfaction, engagement, attendance rates, and agreement between individual and group views suggests that a digital co-creation process is a feasible method. Several important success factors were identified, such as the provision of information and education on discussion topics in advance of workshops, as well as the smaller group discussions during workshops.

Here, we longitudinally profiled this response in mild and severe COVID-19 patients over a period of five months. Serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses waned rapidly but spike (S)-specific IgG+ memory B cells (MBCs) remained stable or increased over time. Analysis of 1,213 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from S-specific MBCs revealed a primarily de novo response that displayed increased somatic hypermutation, binding affinity, and neutralization potency over time, providing evidence for prolonged antibody affinity maturation. B cell immunodominance hierarchies were similar across donor repertoires and remained relatively stable as the immune response progressed. Cross-reactive B cell populations, likely re-called from prior endemic beta-coronavirus exposures, comprised a small but stable fraction of the repertoires and did not contribute to the neutralizing response. The neutralizing antibody response was dominated by public clonotypes that displayed significantly reduced activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging in Brazil and South Africa that harbor mutations at positions 501, 484 and 417 in the S protein. Overall, the results provide insight into the dynamics, durability, and functional properties of the human B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and have implications for the design of immunogens that preferentially stimulate protective B cell responses.","output":"Prolonged evolution of the human B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study examines racial and ethnic disparities in health insurance coverage among Black and Hispanic adults vs White adults aged 60 to 64 years.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Insurance Coverage Among US Adults Aged 60 to 64 Years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The performance of Islamic banks during the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the financial soundness of Islamic Banks.

Objective: To investigate COVID-19-related outcomes in French nursing homes that implemented voluntary staff confinement with residents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in French nursing homes from March 1 to May 11, 2020. Participants included residents and staff members of the nursing homes where staff participated in voluntary self-confinement as well as those of the facilities for elderly people where staff did not practice self-confinement. Rates of COVID-19 cases and mortality in the cohort of nursing homes with self confinement were compared with those derived from a population-based survey of nursing homes conducted by French health authorities. Exposures: Nursing homes with staff who self-confined were identified from the media and included if the confinement period of staff with residents was longer than 7 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality related to COVID-19 among residents and COVID-19 cases among residents and staff members. COVID-19 was diagnosed by primary care or hospital physicians on the basis of fever and respiratory signs (eg, cough, dyspnea) or a clinical illness compatible with COVID-19; COVID-19 diagnoses were considered confirmed if real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on nasopharyngeal swab was positive and considered possible if the test had not been performed or results were negative. Cases of COVID-19 were recorded by a telephone interview with the directors of nursing homes with staff who self-confined and by a nationwide declaration survey to health authorities for all facilities. Results: This study included 17 nursing homes in which 794 staff members confined themselves to the facility with their 1250 residents. The national survey included 9513 facilities with 385a?290 staff members and 695a?060 residents. Only 1 nursing home with staff who self-confined (5.8%) had cases of COVID-19 among residents, compared with 4599 facilities in the national survey (48.3%) (P < .001). Five residents (0.4%) in the nursing homes with staff who self-confined had confirmed COVID-19, compared with 30a?569 residents (4.4%) with confirmed COVID-19 in the national survey (P < .001); no residents of facilities with self-confinement had possible COVID-19, compared with 31a?799 residents (4.6%) with possible COVID-19 in the national survey (P < .001). Five residents (0.4%) in the nursing homes with staff who self-confined died of COVID-19, compared with 12a?516 (1.8%) in the national survey (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.09-0.53; P < .001). Twelve staff members (1.6%) from the facilties with self-confinement had confirmed or possible COVID-19, compared with 29a?463 staff members (7.6%) in the national survey (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of French nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality rates related to COVID-19 were lower among nursing homes that implemented staff confinement with residents compared with those in a national survey. These findings suggest that self-confinement of staff members with residents may help protect nursing home residents from mortality related to COVID-19 and residents and staff from COVID-19 infection.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outcomes in French Nursing Homes That Implemented Staff Confinement With Residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both increasing emission of chlorophenol chemicals and plastic waste pollution are severe global environmental challenges, which is worth being explored to respond with a \\"waste eliminated by waste\\" coupling treatment strategy. Herein, we propose a one-step recyclable nano-MgO template strategy to prepare in-situ N, O-doped novel porous carbon coral reefs (PCNCR) directly derived from the mixture of real waste PET and melamine formaldehyde resin. The template precursor can be conveniently recycled by facile acetic acid pickling, vacuum evaporation and drying, and the whole preparing process does not involve any toxic solvents, massive consumption of pore-forming agents, or discharge of salty wastewater. The obtained PCNCRs have hierarchical porous structures and abundant N, O-doped species, and the textural parameters can be modulation linearly by varying the mass ratio of magnesium acetate to mixed waste plastics. The optimized PCNCR-1.25 exhibited remarkable adsorption capacity for chlorophenol contaminants (777.5mg/g for 4-Chloro-3,5-dimethylphenol, PCMX and 538.74mg/g for 4-Chloro-3-methylphenol, PCMC) in aqueous solution. Adsorption isotherm fitting studies revealed chlorophenol contaminants tended to be rapidly adsorbed on the PCNCR surface in the form of monolayer. And the system reached adsorption equilibrium at about 15min, which was described by linear driving force model. Reusability test verified that PCNCR-1.25 had excellent adsorption stability for chlorophenol in continuous adsorption-regeneration cycles. DFT calculation illustrated the enhancement of chlorophenol adsorption by heteroatom species, especially nitrogen dopants. This work highlighted a low-cost and sustainable approach to defuse the dual environmental threat of chlorophenol emissions and plastic waste pollution simultaneously.","output":"Waste eliminated by waste under COVID-19 pandemic: Mixed plastic waste derived N,O-rich porous carbon nano-coral reefs for chlorophenol pollutants efficient capture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyses the response of Lithuanian local authorities to the first wave of COVID-19 with a special focus on the economic support measures they took.

Reported superspreading events analyzed within this framework point towards aerosol mediated transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Virion exposure calculated for these events is found to trace out a single value, suggesting a universal minimum infective dose (MID) via aerosol that is comparable to the MIDs measured for other respiratory viruses; thus, the consistent infectious exposure levels and their commensurability to known aerosol-MIDs establishes the plausibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

The elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to the highest level between COVID-19 diagnosis and hospital discharge was categorized according to a standardized toxicity grade scale. In total, 799 patients were included in this study, 39% of which were female, with a mean age of 69.9 (16.0) years. Of these patients, 225 (28.1%) developed LEE of grade 2 after a median of three days (interquartile range (IQR): 0C8 days) from the diagnosis of COVID-19, and they were estimated to have a higher hazard of death or ICU admission (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14C1.88). The clinical and laboratory variables associated with the development of LEE were male sex, higher respiratory rate, higher gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and lower albumin levels at baseline.

A clinical risk score to predict 14-day occurrence of hypoxia, ICU admission, and death is unavailable. OBJECTIVE: Derive and validate a risk score to predict suitability for discharge from a monitored setting among an early cohort of patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Model derivation and validation in a retrospective cohort. We built a manual forward stepwise logistic regression model to identify variables associated with suitability for discharge and assigned points to each variable. Event-free patients were included after at least 14 days of follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis between March 1, 2020, and April 12, 2020, in 10 hospitals in Massachusetts, USA. MAIN MEASURES: Fourteen-day composite predicting hypoxia, ICU admission, and death. We calculated a risk score for each patient as a predictor of suitability for discharge evaluated by area under the curve. KEY RESULTS: Of 2059 patients with COVID-19, 1326 met inclusion. The 1014-patient training cohort had a mean age of 58 years, was 56% female, and 65% had at least one comorbidity. A total of 255 (25%) patients were suitable for discharge. Variables associated with suitability for discharge were age, oxygen saturation, and albumin level, yielding a risk score between 0 and 55. At a cut point of 30, the score had a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 82%.

Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have reached discordant conclusions regarding the effectiveness of sodium chloride solution and steroids in managing spinal pain. True placebo-controlled trials with the injection of an inactive substance to unrelated structures have been nonexistent. Consequently, the discussions continue to escalate, seemingly without proper discourse. In this review, we sought to assess the true placebo nature of saline and the effectiveness of steroids. OBJECTIVES This assessment of sodium chloride solution is undertaken to assess if it is a true placebo when injected into the epidural space, is effective alone, and whether steroids are effective when injected with sodium chloride solution rather than local anesthetic in managing spinal pain. STUDY DESIGN A systematic review of randomized controlled trials utilizing sodium chloride solution alone, steroids alone, or sodium chloride solution with steroids in managing spinal pain secondary to disc herniation or spinal stenosis. METHODS The systematic review was performed utilizing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Cochrane review criteria and Interventional Pain Management techniques--Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB) was used to assess the methodological quality assessment. Qualitative analysis was performed by utilizing best evidence synthesis principles, and quantitative analysis was performed utilizing meta-analysis with conventional methodology and single-arm meta-analysis. PubMed, Cochrane Library, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, Google Scholar, and prior systematic reviews and reference lists were utilized in the literature search from 1966 through December 2018. The evidence was summarized utilizing principles of best evidence synthesis on a scale of 1 to 5. Outcome measures for the present analysis, 20% improvement from the baseline pain scores or disability scores was considered clinically significant. Effectiveness was determined short-term if it was less than 6 months, whereas longer than 6 months was considered to be long-term. RESULTS Of the 8 trials meeting inclusion criteria, 2 trials utilized fluoroscopic imaging and one study utilized ultrasound. All other studies performed the procedure without fluoroscopy. With dual-arm meta-analysis, there was no significant difference between epidural sodium chloride solution and epidural steroids with sodium chloride solution. Utilizing single-arm analysis, both epidural saline and epidural steroids with saline were effective in reducing 20% of pain, however, only reducing disability scores by 10% to 12%. Based on the qualitative analysis, epidural saline and epidural steroids with saline showed effect beyond placebo and showed level I, or strong evidence, that neither epidural saline, nor epidural steroids with saline are placebo and that both are effective. LIMITATIONS Despite 8 randomized controlled trials, only 2 of them utilized fluoroscopy. Overall evidence is considered less than optimal and further studies elucidating these actions are strongly recommended. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis show that epidurally administered sodium chloride solution and sodium chloride solution with steroids may be effective in managing low back and lower extremity pain.

We aimed to determine if vaccination reduces hospital visits in breakthrough COVID-19. METHODS: This observational cohort analysis compared unvaccinated (UV), partially vaccinated (PV), and fully vaccinated (FV) adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring emergency care(EC)/hospitalization within an eight-hospital system in Michigan. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from the electronic record. Vaccination data was obtained from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry and Centers for Disease Control vaccine tracker. Primary endpoint was rate of emergency care/hospitalization encounters among patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Secondary outcome was severe disease-composite outcome (ICU, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death). FINDINGS: Between December 15,2020 and April 30,2021, 11,834 EC encounters were included:10,880 (91.9%) UV, 825 (7%) PV, 129 (1.1%) FV. Average age was 53.0  18.2 and 52.8% were female. Accounting for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination population groups in Michigan, the ED encounters/hospitalizations rate relevant to COVID-19 was 96% lower in FV versus UV (multiplicative effect:0.04, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.06, p < 0.001) in negative binomial regression. COVID-19 EC visits rate peaked at 22.61, 12.88, and 1.29 visits per 100000 for the UV, PV, and FV groups, respectively. In the propensity-score matching weights analysis, FV had a lower risk of composite disease compared to UV but statistically insignificant (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38). INTERPRETATION: The need for emergency care/hospitalization due to breakthrough COVID-19 is an exceedingly rare event in fully vaccinated patients. As vaccination has increased regionally, EC visits amongst fully vaccinated individuals have remained low and occur much less frequently than unvaccinated individuals. If hospital-based treatment is required, elderly patients with significant comorbidities are at high-risk for severe outcomes regardless of vaccination status.","output":"Vaccination reduces need for emergency care in breakthrough COVID-19 infections: A multicenter cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Incidence of mucormycosis suddenly surged in India after the second wave of COVID-19.

Relatively high heterogeneity was observed among included trials (I 2 = 80.8%, P heterogeneity < 0.001). Subgroup analysis displayed that probiotics supplementation significantly reduced HR by 2.94 bpm (95% CI: -5.06, -0.82) among participants with baseline HR  75 bpm, by 1.17 bpm (95% CI: -2.34, -0.00) with probiotics dose 1  1010 CFU/day, and by 1.43 bpm (95% CI: -2.69, -0.17) with multiple-strain intervention. Meta-regression analysis showed that baseline HR was a major potential effect modifier of probiotics supplementation on lowering HR. Conclusion: Hitherto, the overall evidence in the literature was insufficient to support the notion that probiotics supplementation has a class effect on HR reduction. However, in subgroup analysis, probiotics reduced HR significantly in those who had higher baseline HR, received a higher dose or multiple strains of probiotics.","output":"Effect of Probiotics Supplementation on Heart Rate: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aging population is increasingly faced with daily life limitations, threatening their Functional Independence (FI). These limitations extend different life domains and require a broad range of community-care professionals to be addressed. The Decision Support Tool for Functional Independence (DST-FI) facilitates community-care professionals in providing uncontradictory recommendations regarding the maintenance of FI in community-dwelling older people. The current study aims to determine the validity and reliability of the DST-FI. METHODS: Sixty community-care professionals completed a twofold assessment. To assess construct validity, participants were asked to assign predefined recommendations to fifty cases of older people to maintain their level of FI. Hypotheses were tested regarding the expected recommendations per case. Content validity was assessed by questions on relevance, comprehensiveness, and comprehensibility of the current set of recommendations. Twelve participants repeated the assessment after two weeks to enable both within- and between rater reliability properties, expressed by an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient. RESULTS: Seven out of eight predefined hypotheses confirmed expectations, indicating high construct validity. As the recommendations were indicated relevant and complete, content validity was high as well. Agreement between raters was poor to moderate while agreement within raters was moderate to excellent, resulting in moderate overall reliability. CONCLUSION: The DST-FI suggests high validity and moderate reliability properties when used in a population of community-dwelling older people. The tool could facilitate community-care professionals in their task to preserve FI in older people. Future research should focus on psychometric properties like feasibility, acceptability, and developing and piloting strategies for implementation in community-care.","output":"Psychometric evaluation of the Decision Support Tool for Functional Independence in community-dwelling older people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Present mechanical devices are unable to achieve recanalisation in up to 20-40% of large vessel occlusion strokes. We compared efficacy and safety of the Trevo Retriever, a new stent-like device, with its US Food and Drug Administration-cleared predecessor, the Merci Retriever. METHODS In this open-label randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients at 26 sites in the USA and one in Spain. We included adults aged 18-85 years with angiographically confirmed large vessel occlusion strokes and US National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of 8-29 within 8 h of symptom onset. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) with sequentially numbered sealed envelopes to thrombectomy with Trevo or Merci devices. Randomisation was stratified by age (68 years vs 69-85 years) and NIHSS scores (18 vs 19-29) with alternating blocks of various sizes. The primary efficacy endpoint, assessed by an unmasked core laboratory, was thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) scores of 2 or greater reperfusion with the assigned device alone. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of procedure-related adverse events. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01270867. FINDINGS Between Feb 3, 2011, and Dec 1, 2011, we randomly assigned 88 patients to the Trevo Retriever group and 90 patients to Merci Retriever group. 76 (86%) patients in the Trevo group and 54 (60%) in the Merci group met the primary endpoint after the assigned device was used (odds ratio 422, 95% CI 192-969; p(superiority)<00001). Incidence of the primary safety endpoint did not differ between groups (13 [15%] patients in the Trevo group vs 21 [23%] in the Merci group; p=01826).

The generational groups were selected to analyze whether the different life stages and developmental tasks that need to be completed have an impact on PSU. The groups were divided into digital immigrants, digital natives, and Generation Y and Z as subgroups of digital natives. A total of 399 subjects participated (312 women, 86 men, 1 diverse; mean age = 25.9; range 14C67; 44 digital immigrants, 355 digital natives, 35 Generation Y, and 320 Generation Z). They completed the ICD-10 Symptom Rating (ISR), the Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10), and the Mobile Phone Problematic Use Scale (MPPUS). The results show differences between digital immigrants and digital natives in the expression of PSU, neuroticism, conscientiousness, depression, anxiety, and compulsivity. Concerning Generations Y and Z, differences were only found in the expression of the PSU. Regression revealed that symptoms for obsessive-compulsive disorders, depression, conscientiousness, and gender were significant predictors of PSU. Moderations have shown that being a digital immigrant/native moderates the impact of eating disorders on PSU. Belonging to Generation Y/Z moderates the influence of conscientiousness and depression on PSU. Thus, it shows that in different generations, different factors seem to play a role in the development and maintenance of PSU.","output":"Psychopathological Symptoms and Personality Traits as Predictors of Problematic Smartphone Use in Different Age Groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To report the experience of a Virtual Culture Circle with Brazilian families about coping with COVID-19, as a space that promotes health during the pandemic.

However, enzyme immobilization on nanomaterials is not straightforward due to the toxic and unpredictable properties of nanoparticles in medical practice. AIM OF REVIEW: In fact, because of the ability to load enzymes on nano-based supports and increase their renewability, scientific groups have been tempted to create potential therapeutic enzymes in this field. Therefore, this study not only pays attention to the therapeutic and diagnostic applications of diseases by enzymeCnanoparticle (NP) bio-conjugate (abbreviated as: ENB), but also considers the importance of nanoplatforms used based on their toxicity, ease of application and lack of significant adverse effects on loaded enzymes. In the following, based on the published reports, we explained that the immobilization of enzymes on polymers, inorganic metal oxide and hybrid compounds provide hopes for potential use of ENBs in medical activities. Then, the use of ENBs in bioassay activities such as paper-based or wearing biosensors and lab-on-chip/microfluidic biosensors were evaluated. Finally, this review addresses the current challenges and future perspective of ENBs in biomedical applications.

The approach is illustrated for two classes of models, respectively from ecology and epidemiology. Several numerical tests demonstrate experimentally important features of the method, like fast convergence and influence of the smoothness of the models' coefficients.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 256 participants age 60 through 95 completed the following self-administered questionnaires: Perceived Susceptibility, Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Symptoms of Depression (CES-D) and health-related quality of life (SF-12v2 Health Survey). Data were collected from June to July 2020, 3 months after the COVID-19 state of emergency was declared in Israel. Participants were interviewed by family medicine residents via telephone. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlations, t-tests between groups, regression analyses, and Hayes PROCESS to analyze a moderated mediation model. RESULTS: Of the elderly participants, 37.5% were classified as having depression. Optimism, social support and health-related quality of life were positively associated. Higher optimism and social support were related to lower perceived susceptibility and lower depression. Results of a multivariate regression explained 29% of the variance in depression and 19% of the variance in health-related quality of life. The relationships assessed by 4 Process models were significant, such that higher optimism and social support were related to lower perceived susceptibility, which in turn was related to higher depression and lower health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Optimism and social support may be effective in coping with challenges and buffering depression. Perceived susceptibility may mediate the association of optimism and social support with higher depression and lower health-related quality of life. The conclusions of this study underscore the need to treat depression among older adults during this period. Hence, healthcare providers should also support elderly patients living at home.

This lack of replication fidelity, together with the fact that RNA viruses can undergo spontaneous mutations, results in genetic variants displaying different viral morphogenesis, as well as variation on their surface glycoproteins that affect viral antigenicity. This diverse viral population, routinely containing a variety of mutants, is known as a viral quasispecies. The mutability of their virions allows for fast evolution of RNA viruses that develop antiviral resistance and overcome vaccines much more rapidly than DNA viruses. This also translates into the fact that pathogenic RNA viruses, that cause many diseases and deaths in humans, represent the major viral group involved in zoonotic disease transmission, and are responsible for worldwide pandemics.","output":"Animal and human RNA viruses: genetic variability and ability to overcome vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to cancellation and deferral of many cancer investigations, including CT colonography (CTC). In May 2020, BSGAR and SCoR issued guidelines outlining steps for conduct of CTC in the early recovery phase. We evaluated the implementation of these in four English hospital trusts. METHODS: Ethical permission was not required for this multicentre service evaluation. We identified patients undergoing CTC over a 2-month period from May to July 2020 at four Trusts. We recorded demographics, scan indications, colonic findings, and incidental lung base changes compatible with COVID-19. A subset of patients were contacted via telephone to document new symptoms 2 weeks following their scan. Staff were contacted to determine if any acquired COVID-19 during the period. RESULTS: 224 patients (118 male, 52.7%) were scanned during the period. In 55 patients (24.6%), CTC showed a &#8805;6 mm polyp. 33 of 224 (14.7%) scans showed incidental lung base changes felt unrelated to COVID-19, and only one patient had changes indeterminate for COVID-19; no classic COVID-19 pulmonary changes were found. Of 169 patients with telephone follow-up, none reported any new symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, fever, anosmia, ageusia) within 14 days of CTC. None of the 86 staff contacted developed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We found no cases of patients or staff acquiring COVID-19 infection following CTC; and no evidence of significant asymptomatic COVID-19 patients attending for CTC appointments based on lung base changes.

COVID-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; however, currently recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates and are unable to identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting in patient misdiagnosis and impeding epidemic containment. Combining the advantages of targeted amplification and long-read, real-time nanopore sequencing, herein, nanopore targeted sequencing (NTS) is developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously within 6-10 h, with a limit of detection of ten standard plasmid copies per reaction.

Parallel testing with approved real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction kits for SARS-CoV-2 and NTS using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected COVID-19 cases show that NTS identifies more infected patients (22/61) as positive, while also effectively monitoring for mutated nucleic acid sequences, categorizing types of SARS-CoV-2, and detecting other respiratory viruses in the test sample.

However, social distancing has negative consequences, including increases in depression and anxiety. Digital interventions, such as text messaging, can provide accessible support on a population-wide scale. We developed text messages in English and Spanish to help individuals manage their depressive mood and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine the effect of our 60-day text messaging intervention. Additionally, we aim to assess whether the use of machine learning to adapt the messaging frequency and content improves the effectiveness of the intervention. Finally, we will examine the differences in daily mood ratings between the message categories and time windows. METHODS: The messages were designed within two different categories: behavioral activation and coping skills. Participants will be randomized into (1) a random messaging arm, where message category and timing will be chosen with equal probabilities, and (2) a reinforcement learning arm, with a learned decision mechanism for choosing the messages. Participants in both arms will receive one message per day within three different time windows and will be asked to provide their mood rating 3 hours later. We will compare self-reported daily mood ratings; self-reported depression, using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire; and self-reported anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale at baseline and at intervention completion.

For patients for whom age, sex and date of infection detection were available, we determined the impact of these variables on mortality 30 days after the date of diagnosis or hospitalization. Multivariable weighted Cox analysis showed that each of the analyzed variables independently affected COVID-19 mortality. Specifically, in the overall series, age was the main risk factor for mortality, with HR > 100 in the age groups older than 65 years compared with a reference group of 15C44 years. Male sex presented a two-fold higher risk of death than female sex. Patients infected after the first pandemic wave (i.e. after 30 June 2020) had an approximately threefold lower risk of death than those infected during the first wave. Thus, in a series of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected cases in an entire European nation, elderly age was by far the most significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, confirming that protecting the elderly should be a priority in pandemic management.

Assessing infection attack rates in the population is critical for estimating disease severity and herd immunity which is needed to calibrate public health interventions. We have previously shown that it is possible to achieve this in real time to impact public health decision making. AIM: Our objective was to develop and evaluate serological assays applicable in large-scale sero-epidemiological studies. METHODS: We developed an ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated its sensitivity and specificity in combination with confirmatory microneutralisation (MN) and 90% plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT(90)) in 51 sera from 24 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 and in age-stratified sera from 200 healthy controls. RESULTS: IgG and IgM RBD ELISA, MN and PRNT(90) were reliably positive after 29 days from illness onset with no detectable cross-reactivity in age-stratified controls. We found that PRNT(90) tests were more sensitive in detecting antibody than MN tests carried out with the conventional 100 tissue culture infectious dose challenge. Heparinised plasma appeared to reduce the infectivity of the virus challenge dose and may confound interpretation of neutralisation test. CONCLUSION: Using IgG ELISA based on the RBD of the spike protein to screen sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, followed by confirmation using PRNT(90), is a valid approach for large-scale sero-epidemiology studies.","output":"Serological assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), March 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: During COVID-19 pandemic the global population is facing an important psychosocial distress. The aim of this study was to evaluate how people with epilepsy (PWE) in Brazil is dealing with the pandemic, in relation to seizure frequency, access to antiseizure medicines (ASM), medical follow-up, and well-being. METHODS: An online questionnaire survey among PWE (group 1) and caregivers (group 2) was applied in the social networks of the Brazilian Association of Epilepsy, the official Brazilian chapter of the International Bureau for Epilepsy. The questionnaire was composed of 46 generic questions in four areas, namely, demographics and baseline clinical data as well as epilepsy and quality-of-life impact by COVID-19 pandemic based on the domains of the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 464 participants including 380 (81.9%) PWE (78.7% female; age 34.3 yrs.; 9.76) and 84 (18.1%) caregivers (patients age 14.1 yrs.; 10.30). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 36.8% of PWE and 36.4% of caregivers reported difficulties in accessing the epilepsy healthcare provider, and visits occurred normally only in 29.7% of PWE and in 34.5% of the caregive?s group. Telehealth was not provided for 66.6% of group 1 and for 58.5% of group 2. Lack of availability of ASM was reported by 21.9% of PWE and 28.0% of caregivers in public dispensing units and by 19.2% and 17.8%, respectively, in private pharmacies. Increase in seizures during pandemic was mentioned by 26.3% and 27.9% of groups 1 and 2, respectively. Patients who had increase in seizure frequency had more frequently reported problems with treatment and in quality-of-life concepts. Fear of having a more severe COVID-19 presentation because of epilepsy was reported by 74.5% of PWE and by 89.8% of caregivers. Dissatisfaction with current health status was reported by 36.7% and 38.1% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and that the support from others has decreased (56.1% and 66.1%, in groups 1 and 2) during the pandemic. The factors with higher Odds Ratio of increase in seizure frequency during pandemic were age >41 yrs., treatment in public healthcare system, drug-resistant epilepsy, adversities in getting ASM in public dispensing units, difficulties with prescription renewals, current financial problems and belief that epilepsy or ASM are risk factors for contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, PWE and caregivers reported increase in seizures in one-fourth of the patients and several difficulties, namely problems in accessing the healthcare system including ASM dispensation, telehealth, and fear of having a more severe COVID-19 because of epilepsy. There were also physical, psychological, and social concerns which affected quality-of-life-related aspects in this population.

AIM: To investigate the timing of end-of-life recognition, palliative registration, and the recording of end-of-life preferences in primary care for people aged &#8805;75 years. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study using national primary care record data, covering 34% of GP practices in England. METHOD: ResearchOne data from electronic healthcare records (EHRs) of people aged &#8805;75 years who died in England between 1 January 2015 and 1 January 2016 were examined. Clinical codes relating to end-of-life recognition, palliative registration, and end-of-life preferences were extracted, and the number of months that elapsed between the code being entered and death taking place were calculated. The timing for each outcome and proportion of relevant EHRs were reported. RESULTS: Death was recorded for a total of 13 149 people in ResearchOne data during the 1-year study window. Of those, 6303 (47.9%) records contained codes suggesting end of life had been recognised at a point in time prior to the month of death. Recognition occurred &#8805;12 months before death in 2248 (17.1%) records. In total, 1659 (12.6%) people were on the palliative care register and 457 (3.5%) were on the register for &#8805;12 months before death; 2987 (22.7%) records had a code for the patient's preferred place of care, and 1713 (13.0%) had a code for the preferred place of death.

(CCDS?) decontaminates N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) using vapor phase hydrogen peroxide (VPHP) for reuse when there is a critical supply shortage. The Battelle CCDS received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2020. This research focused on evaluating the mechanical properties of the straps as an indicator of respirator fit. The objective was to characterize the load generated by the straps following up to 20 don/doff and decontamination cycles in Battelles CCDS. In general, the measured loads at 50 and 100% strains after 20 cycles were similar (15%) to the as-received controls. Qualitatively, reductions in the load may be associated with loss of elasticity in the straps, potentially reducing the ability to obtain a proper fit. However, small changes in strap elasticity may not affect the ability to obtain a proper fit given the potential for variation in strap length and positioning on the head. Regardless, prior to reusing a N95 respirator, it is important to complete a visual inspection to ensure it is not damaged, malformed, or soiled. If so, it is recommended to discard the respirator and use a different one. Similarly, the respirator should be discarded if the wearer cannot obtain a proper fit during the user seal check.","output":"Strap Performance of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators After Multiple Decontamination Cycles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Co\\\\infection of apple trees with several viruses/viroids is common and decreases fruit yield and quality.

Inhibition of viral entry and thereby spread constitute plausible therapeutic avenues. Similar to other respiratory pathogens, SARS-CoV2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets, with potential for aerosol and contact spread. It uses receptor-mediated entry into the human host via angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) that is expressed in lung tissue, as well as oral and nasal mucosa, kidney, testes, and the gastrointestinal tract. Modulation of ACE2 levels in these gateway tissues may prove a plausible strategy for decreasing disease susceptibility. Cannabis sativa, especially one high in the anti-inflammatory cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), has been proposed to modulate gene expression and inflammation and harbour anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. Working under the Health Canada research license, we have developed over 800 new Cannabis sativa lines and extracts and hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to modulate ACE2 expression in COVID-19 target tissues. Screening C. sativa extracts using artificial human 3D models of oral, airway, and intestinal tissues, we identified 13 high CBD C. sativa extracts that modulate ACE2 gene expression and ACE2 protein levels. Our initial data suggest that some C. sativa extract down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV2 entry into host cells. While our most effective extracts require further large-scale validation, our study is crucial for the future analysis of the effects of medical cannabis on COVID-19. The extracts of our most successful and novel high CBD C. sativa lines, pending further investigation, may become a useful and safe addition to the treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy. They can be used to develop easy-to-use preventative treatments in the form of mouthwash and throat gargle products for both clinical and at-home use. Such products ought to be tested for their potential to decrease viral entry via the oral mucosa.

Personal exposure (PE) of adults to BC has been widely studied, but little is known about the exposure of young children (toddlers) to BC in cities. We carried out a pilot study to investigate the integrated daily PE of toddlers to BC in a city-state with a high population density (Singapore). We studied the impact of urban traffic on the PE of toddlers to BC by comparing and contrasting on-road traffic flow (i.e., volume and composition) in Singapore in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and in 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Our observations indicate that the daily BC exposure levels and inhaled doses increased by about 25% in 2020 (2.9  0.3 g m-3 and 35.5 g day-1) compared to that in 2019 (2.3  0.4 g m-3 and 28.5 g day-1 for exposure concentration and inhaled dose, respectively). The increased BC levels were associated with the increased traffic volume on both weekdays and weekends in 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. Specifically, we observed an increase in the number of trucks as well as cars/taxis and motorcycles (private transport) and a decline in the number of buses (public transport) in 2020. The implementation of lockdown measures in 2020 resulted in significant changes in the time, place and duration of PE of toddlers to BC. The recorded daily time-activity patterns indicated that toddlers spent almost all the time in indoor environments during the measurement period in 2020. When we compared different ventilation options (natural ventilation (NV), air conditioning (AC), and portable air cleaner (PAC)) for mitigation of PE to BC in the home environment, we found a significant decrease (>30%) in daily BC exposure levels while using the PAC compared to the NV scenario. Our case study shows that the PE of toddlers to BC is of health concern in indoor environments in 2020 because of the migration of the increased TRAP into naturally ventilated residential homes and more time spent indoors than outdoors. Since toddlers' immune system is weak, technological intervention is necessary to protect their health against inhalation exposure to air pollutants.","output":"Assessment and mitigation of toddlers' personal exposure to black carbon before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case study in Singapore."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study compared 2019 values for the National Health Security Preparedness Index (NHSPI) with 2020 rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related mortality as reported by the 50 US states and Puerto Rico during the first six months of the US pandemic (March 1 - August 31, 2020). METHODS: Data regarding provisional death counts and estimates of excess deaths for COVID-19 according to state and territory were downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics website. Reporting included the six-month-long period of March 1 - August 31, 2020. Excess mortality rates were calculated as the number of excess deaths per 100,000 persons in each state population using 2019 US Census Bureau data. Mean values for state and territorial NHSPI domain indices were compared to state and territorial rates of COVID-19-related excess mortality using multiple linear regression, including analysis of variance. Correlations between the 51 state and territorial NHSPI values and corresponding COVID-19 excess mortality rates were calculated using Pearsons correlation coefficient. RESULTS: These calculations revealed a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.02 and 0.25) and poor correlation (P = .16 and .08) among values for the overall NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico.

OBJECTIVE To assess the incidence, severity, nature, and clinical consequences of in-stent stenosis on angiographic follow-up after treatment with the PED. METHODS A retrospective study of patients who underwent aneurysm treatment with the PED was conducted. In-stent stenosis was assessed on subsequent follow-up angiography. Intimal hyperplasia was defined as a uniform growth process beyond the limits of the metallic mesh at <25%. In-stent stenosis represented an area of parent vessel narrowing, most often focal, graded as mild (25%-50%), moderate (50%-75%), or severe (>75%). RESULTS Between June 2011 and April 2015, 80 patients were treated with the PED. Angiographic follow-up was available for 51 patients (representing 76% of available or 64% of all patients). Mean follow-up was 12.5 months. In-stent stenosis was detected in 5 patients (9.8%) at a median of 6 months. Stenosis was mild in 4 of 5 (80%) and moderate in 1 of 5 (20%) patients. There were no cases of severe stenosis. No stenosis caused flow limitation, clinical symptoms, or required re-treatment. Additional follow-up angiography was available in 2 of 5 stenosis patients showing marked improvement. Sixteen patients (31%) had intimal hyperplasia, and 28 patients (55%) had no stenosis. Asymptomatic stent occlusion occurred in 2 patients (4%) related to medication noncompliance. CONCLUSION Treatment with the PED was associated with a 9.8% rate of in-stent stenosis, detected on first angiographic follow-up, at a median of 6 months.

The aim is to identify homogeneous subgroups or phenotypes of children with PARDS that may benefit from the specific pharmaceutical approach examined.

Some of the enablers contribute to the role of the pharmacist towards the local community, social accountability, and towards the country's Vision, such as interaction with the general public and educating them. Other enablers are related to the pharmacists' career aspirations, such as owning a business. Some of the barriers that were found relevant include high workload, inflexible working hours, and limited opportunities for professional development. Localisation of community pharmacies would help to create more jobs for national pharmacists, increase the participation of female pharmacists in the workforce and support the achievement of Vision 2030. The barriers should be tackled on several levels: undergraduate curriculum, regulatory, and actual practice. Undergraduate education needs to include primary pharmaceutical care services in its curriculum. Regulatory changes include enforcing the renationalisation of the community pharmacy sector and permitting females to work in community pharmacies without location restrictions.","output":"A Cross-Sectional Study on Pharmacy Students' Career Choices in the Light of Saudi Vision 2030: Will Community Pharmacy Continue to Be the Most Promising, but Least Preferred, Sector?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monitoring and managing potential infected patients of COVID-19 is still a great challenge for the latest technologies. In this work, IoT based wearable monitoring device is designed to measure various vital signs related to COVID-19. Moreover, the system automatically alerts the concerned medical authorities about any violations of quarantine for potentially infected patients by monitoring their real time GPS data. The wearable sensor placed on the body is connected to edge node in IoT cloud where the data is processed and analyzed to define the state of health condition. The proposed system is implemented with three layered functionalities as wearable IoT sensor layer, cloud layer with Application Peripheral Interface (API) and Android web layer for mobile phones. Each layer has individual functionality, first the data is measured from IoT sensor layer to define the health symptoms. The next layer is used to store the information in the cloud database for preventive measures, alerts, and immediate actions. The Android mobile application layer is responsible for providing notifications and alerts for the potentially infected patient family respondents. The integrated system has both API and mobile application synchronized with each other for predicting and alarming the situation. The design serves as an essential platform that defines the measured readings of COVID-19 symptoms for monitoring, management, and analysis. Furthermore, the work disseminates how digital remote platform as wearable device can be used as a monitoring device to track the health and recovery of a COVID-19 patient.","output":"IoT Based Wearable Device to Monitor the Signs of Quarantined remote patients of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study focuses on tracing the early economic impacts of COVID-19. The pandemic has unleashed a global shock impacting all economies in several ways. The lockdowns have brought economic activity to a standstill, with the closure of businesses and halting of travel, trade and commerce. Even as the impact on sensitive sectors as trade, tourism and remittances are already becoming visible, it is imperative to understand how these are impacting economies in Asia. This article studies these impacts on Thailand and Sri Lanka, both of which being wired to the globalized world, are witnessing adverse impacts on earnings through exports and tourism as well as a huge decline in inward remittances. Even as countries beef up their health infrastructure, they also seek to restart international travel and trade. Hence, the role of the state is critical to pull the economies out of the deglobalization trends that are expected to gain pace in and beyond 2020. This section discusses how the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic affects the various components of exports and imports of Sri Lanka. The impact on the industrial/ manufacturing sector exports and its major components such as export of textile and garment products, petroleum products and rubber products based on the availability of monthly data are examined.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 24(th) 2020 and July 10(th) 2020, a total of 161 patients (55 males, 106 females; median age: 69.0 years [IQR 63.0-75.0], range, 41 to 81 years) who underwent primary TKA were randomly allocated into three parallel groups according to their concomitant procedure in a double-blind fashion: (i) those to whom nerve blockade was performed after competition of surgery under the duration of spinal anesthesia (n=50); (ii) those to whom LIA was performed during surgery (n=52), and (iii) control group (n=59). The content of LIA was 10-10 mL of 20 mg lidocaine with 0.01 mg adrenalin and 100 mg ropivacaine, 1 mL (30 mg) ketorolac, and 5 mL (500 mg) tranexamic acid was diluted by 50 mL 0.9% NaCl under aseptic conditions. Outcome parameters were the evaluation of pain until the evening of first postoperative day (24 to 36 h), mobilization, and blood loss within the first three postoperative days. RESULTS: The pain was maximal between 4 and 8 h postoperatively, when the effect of the spinal anesthetic drugs disappeared. During this critical period, tolerable pain (Numerical Rating Scale, NRS 3) was observed in 52%, 42%, and 19% of nerve blockade in LIA and control groups, respectively. None of the patients complained of high-intensity pain (NRS >8) in the LIA group, which was a significant difference from the block and control groups (10% and 14%, p<0.008, respectively). There was no significant muscle weakness associated with the use of this extended block. The decrease in hemoglobin level was significantly lower in the LIA group than in the control and block groups (odds ratio [OR]: 0.379, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.165-0.874 for nerve blockade vs. LIA, OR: 1.189, 95% CI: 0.491-2.880 for nerve blockade vs. control, OR: 0.319, 95% CI: 0.140-0.727, respectively). The common language effect size for pain in each referred interval in each group and for decrease of hemoglobin between the first and third postoperative days fell between 0.507 and 0.680. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that LIA technique offers a fast and safe treatment option for pain relief after TKA. No clinically relevant muscle weakness was observed among groups according to field block applications. Significant advantages were also achieved in blood loss.","output":"A randomized comparative evaluation of local infiltration analgesia, extended nerve blocks, and conventional analgesia in pain management after total knee arthroplasty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asynchronous tasks, when created with over-decomposition, enable automatic computation-communication overlap which can substantially improve performance and scalability. This is not only applicable to traditional CPU-based systems, but also to modern GPU-accelerated platforms. While the ability to hide communication behind computation can be highly effective in weak scaling scenarios, performance begins to suffer with smaller problem sizes or in strong scaling due to fine-grained overheads and reduced room for overlap. In this work, we integrate GPU-aware communication into asynchronous tasks in addition to computation-communication overlap, with the goal of reducing time spent in communication and further increasing GPU utilization. We demonstrate the performance impact of our approach using a proxy application that performs the Jacobi iterative method, Jacobi3D. In addition to optimizations to minimize synchronizations between the host and GPU devices and increase the concurrency of GPU operations, we explore techniques such as kernel fusion and CUDA Graphs to mitigate fine-grained overheads at scale.","output":"Improving Scalability with GPU-Aware Asynchronous Tasks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emerging popularity of online food delivery (OFD) services, this research examined predictors affecting customer intention to use OFD services amid the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

We conducted an observational study in five Peruvian ICUs to characterize differences between ARDS at MV onset and after MV onset and identify risk factors for the development of ARDS after MV onset. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure requiring at least 24 h of mechanical ventilation and followed them prospectively during the first 28 days and compared baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes by ARDS status. RESULTS: We enrolled 1657 participants on MV (mean age 60.0 years, 55% males) of whom 334 (20.2%) had ARDS at MV onset and 180 (10.9%) developed ARDS after MV onset. Average tidal volume at the initiation of MV was 8.7 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) for participants with ARDS at MV onset, 8.6 mL/kg PBW for those who developed ARDS after MV onset, and 8.5 mL/kg PBW for those who never developed ARDS (p = 0.23). Overall, 90-day mortality was 56% and 55% for ARDS after MV onset and ARDS at MV onset, respectively, as compared to 46% among those who never developed ARDS (p < 0.01). Adults with ARDS had a higher body mass index (BMI) than those without ARDS (27.3 vs 26.5 kg/m(2), p < 0.01). Higher peak pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.21C1.88), higher mean airway pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.13C1.76), and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.10C1.50) at MV onset were associated with a higher odds of developing ARDS after MV onset. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of mechanically ventilated patients, 31% of study participants had ARDS at some point during their ICU stay. Optimal lung-protective ventilation was not used in a majority of patients. Patients with ARDS after MV onset had a similar 90-day mortality as those with ARDS at MV onset.

Of importance, a variety of medicinal plants have shown promise to treat a number of viral infections, and some of them possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In the past, exploration into the antiviral activity of various promising medicinal plants was limited due to: (a) highly infectious nature of viruses and (b) lack of appropriate separation techniques for the identification of antiviral components from plants. Development of vector-based strategies, in which non-infectious molecular clone of a virus could be used for antiviral screening purposes, and advancement in separation technologies offers promise for medicinal plants usage in modern drug discovery.

Methods: A total of 450 college students were surveyed with the Big Five Inventory-2, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Adolescent Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Questionnaire. Results: Regression analysis showed that neuroticism significantly negatively predicted emotion regulation, while it positively predicted depression and NSSI. Multiple mediation modeling demonstrated that neuroticism and emotion regulation had no significant direct effects on NSSI. However, neuroticism could indirectly affect NSSI through four pathways of multiple mediating effects, including depression, cognitive reappraisal-depression, expressive suppression-depression, and cognitive reappraisal-expressive suppression-depression. Conclusions: Neuroticism positively predicts depression and NSSI behavior, and affects NSSI through the mediating effect of ER and depression. Therefore, amelioration of neuroticism from the perspectives of emotion regulation and depression is recommended, so as to reduce NSSI behavior among college students with highly neurotic personalities.","output":"The Relation between Neuroticism and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Behavior among College Students: Multiple Mediating Effects of Emotion Regulation and Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A nasal aerosol formulation of ciclesonide with a hydrofluoroalkane propellant (CIC-HFA) is currently in development for treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR).

However, their uptake has been low and slow due to privacy concerns, the lack of trust and motivational affordances, and their minimalist design. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to present a protocol for a systematic review of the main factors, including facilitators and barriers, that influence the adoption of contact tracing apps. METHODS: We searched seven databases, namely, Scopus, CINAHL, PubMed (MEDLINE), IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, for relevant publications between October 30, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Three authors were involved in removing duplicates, screening, and selection of relevant articles according to the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols) guidelines. RESULTS: Altogether, we retrieved 777 articles from the seven databases.

DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) Genealogy/Phenotype resource, a U.S. genealogy database with veterans individually linked to VHA electronic health records. PATIENTS: Sepsis was identified using International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition and 10th Edition codes. There were two comparison groups: one composed of the all veterans with linked data and deep genealogy and the other included 1,000 sets of controls, each set randomly sampled from the entire cohort after matching on sex and 10-year birth year range on a 1:1 ratio with cases. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 4,666 cases of sepsis from 2001 to 2018, of which 96% were male and 80% greater than or equal to 65 years old. Utilizing the Genealogical Index of Familiality, there was a significant excess of pairwise relatedness among sepsis cases over that in the control sets sampled from VHA population (p = 0.03). The relative risk (RR) of sepsis among identified relatives compared with the larger linked VHA cohort demonstrated an excess of sepsis cases in the first-degree (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.03C1.92; p = 0.05) and second-degree (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07C2.17; p = 0.04) relatives that were not demonstrated in higher degree relatives. The sepsis cases clustered into 1,876 pedigrees of which 628 had a significant excess of sepsis cases among the descendants (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data from this cohort of nearly all male U.S. veterans demonstrate evidence for contribution of an inherited predisposition to sepsis and the existence of pedigrees with a significant excess of diagnoses that provide a valuable resource for identification of the predisposition genes and variants responsible. This complements studies on individual genetic variants toward estimating the heritability patterns and clinical relevance of genetic sepsis predisposition.","output":"Evidence for an Inherited Contribution to Sepsis Susceptibility Among a Cohort of U.S. Veterans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite thromboprophylaxis, patients with coronavirus\\\\19 disease (COVID\\\\19) exhibit hypercoagulability and higher venous thromboembolic risk, although its real incidence is still unknown.

In the Philippines, Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the second most common glomerular disease but with no available data on the subtypes.To our knowledge, this is the first case of collapsing glomerulopathy in the country to be published. Methods: This is a case report of primary Collapsing Glomerulopathy seen in our institution. Results: The case is a 36 year-old Filipino female admitted due to edema which started 2 weeks post-partum. She is gravida 3 para 3 (1203), with no complications in all the pregnancies. She had no known comorbidities. Social history was negative for intravenous or illicit drug use. She initially sought consult with her obstetrician where work up showed hypoalbuminemia and diffuse hepatic disease on ultrasound. She was referred to a gastroenterologist where albumin infusion and paracentesis was done but with no improvement. She developed anasarca and was admitted in our institution. Paracentesis was attempted but only minimal ascitic fluid was obtained. Serum ascites albumin gradient was low and baseline laboratories showed high creatinine at 146 mmol/L, hypoalbuminemia at 16 g/L and +3 albumin on urinalysis. Further testing showed a 24-hour urine protein of 11 grams. ANA and anti-DsDNA were negative and c3 and c4 levels were normal. Hepatitis profile was negative for infection. Abdominal CT scan revealed a hypoenhancing pancreatic tail lesion, breast cyst and nodule. Tumor markers showed high CA-125, CA 19-9 and CA 15-3. Breast ultrasound showed simple breast cyst. Gyneocology consult was called where pap smear done was negative for malignancy. Surgery service recommended observation and monitoring for the pancreatic and breast lesions. Kidney biopsy was delayed due to new onset bacterial pneumonia. COVID-19 RT-PCR test was negative. Kidney biopsy was done after lysis of fever. Pending pathologic diagnosis, patient was discharged clinically improved with no edema. She was sent home on prednisone, ARB, statin, fenofibrate and anti-platelet. On follow up at the outpatient clinic, the kidney biopsy result came out to be collapsing glomerulopathy, acute tubular injury, mild interstitial fibrosis and atrophy. HIV test was done and came out negative. Bipedal edema has recurred and albumin/creatinine ration was 731mg/g. She was then started on tacrolimus. She has been on regular follow up and currently has no edema and has ACR of 79mg/g and normal creatinine level. Conclusions: This is an interesting case as the primary glomerular disease has been masked by the initial laboratory findings. The ultrasound showed parenchymal liver disease. Further work-up revealed multiple lesions in the pancreas, breasts and lymph nodes with high tumor-markers which led us to think of paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome. The renal biopsy revealed a rare diagnosis with no previous local data. This serves as an index case for primary collapsing glomerulopathy in a Filipino patient on remission after being treated with tacrolimus.

Around the country, Pediatric Camps and Adult Support groups have been canceled or moved to an alternate format. While these alternative methods provide much-needed support and interaction for burn survivor groups, it is unknown how they compare to traditional, in-person support programs. In November 2020, our facility will replace our traditional Adult Burn Survivor Retreat with an entirely virtual, synchronous retreat. The retreat will feature many of the sessions and experiences from the in-person retreat but will be lacking the face-to-face contact that is so valued by our Adult Survivor Group. Educational sessions will be provided by adult psychologists and social workers, burn therapists and nurses. An adult burn survivor will provide the keynote address. Adult burn survivors, who have participated in prior years retreats, will be invited to participate in a comparison feedback survey. METHODS: Participants in the Virtual Adult Survivor Retreat will complete a post-retreat survey, comparing the virtual retreat experience to the traditional in-person retreat format. Likert scale questions will address participation level, benefit of retreat, specific feedback for sessions and ease of ability for survivors to interact with peers. In addition, the survey will seek to identify barriers of the virtual format as a means of providing needed survivor support. RESULTS: Survey results will be analyzed, and trends will be reported. Statistically significant results can be further explored to guide future virtual events. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual events utilizing video platforms have become commonplace in the era of COVID-19, however, this format is still new, and the benefits have not been fully explored. Evidence has shown a direct benefit to survivors participating in support services. In an attempt to fill the gap left by the cancelation of in-person events, our facility is hosting a synchronous virtual retreat for adult burn survivors. Retreat evaluation and data comparing the virtual event to prior in-person events will be analyzed and reported.","output":"507 Burn Survivor Perspectives On a Virtual Survivor Retreat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mapping cell types across a tissue is a central concern of spatial biology, but cell type abundance is difficult to extract from spatial gene expression data.

The respiratory droplets produced from coughing and talking of an infected patient were possible transmission routes of coronavirus between people. To avoid the infection, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised to wear face masks while maintaining a social distancing of 2 m. Can the social distancing be reduced if people wear masks? To answer this question, we measured the mass of inhaled droplets by a susceptible manikin wearing a mask with different social distances, which was produced by coughing and talking of an index patient (human subject) also wearing a mask. We also used the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology with a porous media model and particle dispersion model to simulate the transmission of droplets from the patient to the susceptible person with surgical and N95 masks. We compared the CFD results with the measured velocity in the environmental chamber and found that the social distancing could be reduced to 0.5 m when people wearing face masks. In this case, the mass concentration of inhaled particles was less than two people without wearing masks and with a social distancing of 2 m. Hence, when the social distancing was difficult, wearing masks could protect people. We also found that the leakage between the face mask and the human face played an important role in the exhaled airflow pattern and particle dispersion. The verified numerical model can be used for more scenarios with different indoor environments and HVAC systems.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A descriptive observational study was performed. Children and adolescents (0 to 18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection, diagnosed in the emergency room or admitted to the Department of Pediatrics between March 11th and June 18th, were included. Hospital records and Trace COVID-19 platform were reviewed and patient caregivers were interviewed to assess follow up. RESULTS Among 103 diagnosed children, 83% had a known previous contact with an infected patient, 43% presented fever and 42% presented respiratory symptoms. Ten percent had risk factors and 21% were aged under one year old. Ten percent were hospitalised, one needing intensive care, with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome. Blood tests were performed in 9% and chest radiograph in 7%. No children required ventilation, antiviral therapy or underwent thoracic computed tomography scan. Eight percent of children returned to the emergency room and one child was hospitalised. The clinical outcome is known in 101 patients and is favourable in all. DISCUSSION Most children had an epidemiological link and little clinical repercussion, even during the first year of life. The expected mild severity in children justified the use of established clinical criteria and recommendations for similar conditions, regarding tests and hospitalizations.

EWS pertaining to dengue outbreaks is imperative; given the fact that dengue is linked to environmental factors owing to its dominance in the tropics. Prediction is an integral part of EWS, which is dependent on several factors, in particular, climate, geography, and environmental factors. In this study, we explore the role of increased susceptibility to a DENV serotype and climate variability in developing novel predictive models by analyzing RT-PCR and DENV-IgM confirmed cases in Singapore and Honduras, which reported high dengue incidence in 2019 and 2020, respectively. A random-sampling-based susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model was used to obtain estimates of the susceptible fraction for modeling the dengue epidemic, in addition to the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique that was used to fit the model to Singapore and Honduras case report data from 2012 to 2020. Regression techniques were used to implement climate variability in two methods: a climate-based model, based on individual climate variables, and a seasonal model, based on trigonometrically varying transmission rates. The seasonal model accounted for 98.5% and 92.8% of the variance in case count in the 2020 Singapore and 2019 Honduras outbreaks, respectively. The climate model accounted for 75.3% and 68.3% of the variance in Singapore and Honduras outbreaks respectively, besides accounting for 75.4% of the variance in the major 2013 Singapore outbreak, 71.5% of the variance in the 2019 Singapore outbreak, and over 70% of the variance in 2015 and 2016 Honduras outbreaks. The seasonal model accounted for 14.2% and 83.1% of the variance in the 2013 and 2019 Singapore outbreaks, respectively, in addition to 91% and 59.5% of the variance in the 2015 and 2016 Honduras outbreaks, respectively. Autocorrelation lag tests showed that the climate model exhibited better prediction dynamics for Singapore outbreaks during the dry season from May to August and in the rainy season from June to October in Honduras. After incorporation of susceptible fractions, the seasonal model exhibited higher accuracy in predicting outbreaks of higher case magnitude, including those of the 2019C2020 dengue epidemic, in comparison to the climate model, which was more accurate in outbreaks of smaller magnitude. Such modeling studies could be further performed in various outbreaks, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to understand the outbreak dynamics and predict the occurrence of future outbreaks.","output":"Prediction of dengue fever outbreaks using climate variability and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques in a stochastic susceptible-infected-removed model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Differentiating lower airway bacterial infection from possible upper airway contamination in children with endobronchial disorders undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is important for guiding management. A diagnostic bacterial load threshold based on inflammatory markers has been determined to differentiate infection from upper airway contamination in infants with cystic fibrosis, but not for children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD), or bronchiectasis. METHODS: BAL samples from children undergoing bronchoscopy underwent quantitative bacterial culture, cytologic examination, and respiratory virus testing; a subset also had interleukin\\\\8 examined. Geometric means (GMs) of total cell counts (TCCs) and neutrophil counts were plotted by respiratory pathogen bacterial load. Logistic regression determined associations between age, sex, Indigenous status, antibiotic exposure, virus detection and bacterial load, and elevated TCCs (>400  10(3) cells/mL) and airway neutrophilia (neutrophils >15% BAL leukocytes). RESULTS: From 2007 to 2016, 655 children with PBB, CSLD, or bronchiectasis were enrolled. In univariate analyses, Indigenous status and bacterial load 10(5) colony\\\\forming units (CFU)/mL were positively associated with high TCCs. Viruses and bacterial load 10(4) CFU/mL were positively associated with neutrophilia; negative associations were seen for Indigenous status and macrolides. In children who had not received macrolide antibiotics, bacterial load was positively associated in multivariable analyses with high TCCs at 10(4) CFU/mL and with neutrophilia at 10(5) CFU/mL; GMs of TCCs and neutrophil counts were significantly elevated at 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/mL compared to negative cultures.

Collected data included the current MS DMT and patient-reported disability level, history of recent sick contact, recent fever, respiratory symptoms, diagnosis with COVID-19, and the disposition after the diagnosis. We defined a COVID-19-suspect group as patients having fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath, or a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive chest computed tomography. We calculated the proportion of COVID-19-suspect patients and compared their demographics, clinical characteristics, and DMT categories with the rest of survey-responders, using univariable and multivariable models. RESULTS Out of 712 patients, 34 (4.8%) fulfilled our criteria for being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Only two patients required hospitalization. No patient required intensive care.

These vascular malformations can occur sporadically or susceptibility to develop these can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait due to mutation in one of three genes. Over a decade ago, we described a 77.6 Kb germline deletion spanning exons 2-10 in the CCM2 gene found in multiple affected individuals from seemingly unrelated families. Segregation analysis using linked, microsatellite markers indicated that this deletion may have arisen at least twice independently. In the ensuing decades, many more CCM patients have been identified with this deletion. In this present study we examined 27 reportedly unrelated affected individuals with this deletion. To investigate the origin of the deletion at base pair level resolution, we sequenced approximately 10 Kb upstream and downstream from the recombination junction on the deleted allele. All patients showed the identical SNP haplotype across this combined 20 Kb interval. In parallel, genealogical records have traced 11 of these individuals to five separate pedigrees dating as far back as the 1600-1700s. These haplotype and genealogical data suggest that these families and the remaining \\"unrelated\\" samples converge on a common ancestor due to a founder mutation occurring centuries ago on the North American continent.

Variables assessed in the model included follow-up intervals (0.5, 1, or 2 years), reliability rates (70%, 85%, or 100%) and number of visual field tests performed at each visit (one to four). RESULTS: Two visual field tests per session compared with one provided higher case detection rates at 2 years (99%C99.8% vs. 34.7%C76.3%, respectively), reduced time to detection (three or four visits vs. six to 10, respectively), and more positive mean deviation score (?4 dB vs. ?10 dB, respectively) at the point of mean deviation change identification, especially in the context of unreliable results. Performing two tests per visit offered similar advantages compared with more tests. False positive change detection rates (<2.5%), were similar across all conditions.

HUVECs in all A/R groups underwent 3 hrs of anoxia and followed by 2 hrs of reoxygenation. In order to investigate the potential mechanisms of how increased TF may contribute to A/R injury in HUVECs, another set of HUVECs were incubated with human recombinant active site blocked factor VII (FVIIai) during A/R. RESULTS After A/R, TF expression at both mRNA and protein level was increased, furthermore, cell viability and the concentrations of SOD, GSH-PX and NO were declined, while LDH, MDA and ET-1 were overproduced (P<0.05 to 0.001 versus control group). In HUVECs of aODN/TF+A/R group, however, TF expression was inhibited, while the declined cell viability and the concentrations of SOD, GSH-PX, NO as well as the enhanced LDH, MDA and ET-1 levels occurred during A/R were ameliorated and reversed effectively (P<0.05 to 0.01 versus those in other A/R groups). The results also showed that ROS was increased and PAR-1, PAR-2, p38 MAP kinase and p42/44 MAP kinase were all activated after A/R (P<0.001 versus HUVECs under normoxia), while FVIIai inhibited the increment of ROS, PAR-1, PAR-2, p38 MAP kinase and p42/44 MAP kinase, and improved the changes of TF:C, MDA, SOD, GSH-PX, cell viability and LDH occurred during A/R (P<0.05 to 0.001 versus HUVECs without FVIIai treatment).

Therefore, the present study was designed to find out the possible impact of socioeconomic, income, and educational status on the adverse effects of drugs and their therapeutic episodes in patients targeted with a combination of tuberculosis intervention. This study found that an increased incidence of tuberculosis was found in patients who have finished high school, contributing to a high percentage of adverse effects. Notably, adverse events were shown maximally in poor patients compared with rich- or high-income patients. On the contrary, a high prevalence of adverse events was shown to be increased in partially skilled workers compared with full-skilled workers. Consequently, adversely considerable events were implicated to be raised in patients associated with minimal socioeconomic class.

Telehealth benefits include improving access, decreasing costs, and elevating patient's experience. A review of cost minimization (CM) analyses was performed in order to explore scientific studies associated with integrating tele-otolaryngology in clinical practice. Our primary objective was to evaluate published literature for cost related to the implementation of telemedicine across otolaryngology, and to determine CM when compared to in-person visits. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Literature Review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane in May 2020, to identify studies with a cost analysis of tele-otolaryngology care. Inclusion criteria focused on articles citing CM data from telehealth services. Literature quality was assessed using the MINORS scoring system. RESULTS: From 380 original articles screened only nine evaluated cost in otolaryngology. CM in the US ranged from $68 to $900 per visit. Cost was evaluated in general otolaryngology, sleep medicine, otology, and head and neck cancer surgery, the latter had the most benefit. The most common types of telehealth visits were routine follow-up and screening. Data were insufficient for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has been trialed across various otolaryngology subspecialties; its incorporation is projected to have a meaningful impact on access to specialty care. This research suggests that the delivery of virtual care reduces cost with the potential of increasing net revenue across multiple otolaryngology subspecialties. Further studies are needed to better discern the entirety of cost savings and the best settings for integration.

So, rehabilitation services were mandated mainly through telepractice for children with hearing loss. Evaluating the effectiveness of tele-practise compared to face-to-face therapy is of utmost importance for evidence-based approaches. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the parents satisfaction with tele-listening training for children with hearing impairment during COVID-19. Methods: Fifty-four parents of children with hearing loss participated in the study. The parents satisfaction on tele-listening training was evaluated through the Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire in terms of 1) the audio and video quality during teletherapy;2) equipment use 3) general parent-therapist interaction and communication during teletherapy;4) service delivery and convenience;and 5) overall satisfaction with the teletherapy. Results: The results showed a higher parent satisfaction rating to avail rehabilitation services through tele-modality during the pandemic. Tele-listening training sessions had helped parents continue training their children at home with the therapist's guidance online. However, parents were not satisfied with their child's interaction with the therapist as they found it difficult to maintain attention throughout the online session. Conclusion: Although most participants agreed that tele session could not replace face-to-face auditory-verbal therapy (AVT) programs, most of them were satisfied with the outreach AVT program. These favorable responses from parents highlight that the digital revolution and other technological advancements support the service providers in Audiology, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, it often tends to be a top-down process initiated by policy makers, and the values of the intended beneficiaries are forgotten. Involving multiple stakeholders including patients and the public in the scaling-up process is thus essential but highly complex. We propose to identify relevant strategies for meaningfully and equitably involving patients and the public in the science and practice of scaling up in HSS. METHODS: We will adapt our overall method from the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Following this, we will perform a two-prong study design (knowledge synthesis and Delphi study) grounded in an integrated knowledge translation approach. This approach involves extensive participation of a network of stakeholders interested in patient and public involvement (PPI) in scaling up and a multidisciplinary steering committee. We will conduct a systematic scoping review following the methodology recommended in the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers Manual. We will use the following eligibility criteria: (1) participantsany stakeholder involved in creating or testing a strategy for PPI; (2) interventionany PPI strategy proposed for scaling-up initiatives; (3) comparatorno restriction; (4) outcomes: any process or outcome metrics related to PPI; and (5) settingHSS. We will search electronic databases (e.g., Medline, Web of Science, Sociological Abstract) from inception onwards, hand search relevant websites, screen the reference lists of included records, and consult experts in the field. Two reviewers will independently select and extract eligible studies. We will summarize data quantitatively and qualitatively and report results using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. We will conduct an online Delphi survey to achieve consensus on the relevant strategies for PPI in scaling-up initiatives in HSS. Participants will include stakeholders from low-, middle-, and high-income countries. We anticipate that three rounds will allow an acceptable degree of agreement on research priorities. DISCUSSION: Our findings will advance understanding of how to meaningfully and equitably involve patients and the public in scaling-up initiatives for sustainable HSS.

To conserve PPE, reduce the spread of the virus, and keep student learners safe, leaders of medical schools across the country made the difficult decision to suspend in-person clinical experiences. As medical students were sent home and hospital systems ramped up their response to the virus, many essential health care workers (HCWs) faced an immediate challenge. As \\"non-essential\\" services such as schools and daycare centers abruptly closed, HCWs serving on the frontlines in inpatient settings needed a way to both fight the pandemic and care for their children. APPROACH: Medical students at Oregon Health & Science University were able to rapidly organize to provide childcare for essential HCWs. For roughly eight weeks following the state of emergency (March 13 through May 15, 2020) students used Twitter and emerging technology to match families in need of childcare with a trainee volunteer. OUTCOMES: By May 15th, the service had successfully fulfilled 181 of the 202 requests for childcare (90%) over the course of 8 weeks. Of the 181 completed childcare requests, 172 (95%) were fulfilled by an individual (1:1 volunteer-to-household pairing), and 9 (5%) were fulfilled by two or more volunteers. NEXT STEPS: The trainees who provided childcare will apply the skills learned (e.g., clear communication, grassroots organizing, triaging, leveraging new technology) to patient care. Broader applications for this system include organizing volunteers to conduct contract tracing or to provide public health information in languages other than English. Future research includes examining the effect of the service on the productivity, morale, and mental health of both those who provided and received childcare.","output":"Rapid Mobilization of Medical Students to Provide Health Care Workers with Emergency Childcare During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid, widespread COVID-19 vaccination is critical to pandemic mitigation and recovery. To help policymakers interested in further enhancing primary care delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, it is important to estimate the absolute number of vaccination opportunities, and identify how these opportunities may fall disproportionately among different communities given the unequal way that COVID-19 falls upon communities of color, low-income, and rural communities. To quantify the potential benefits of greater primary care engagement in vaccination efforts, we estimated the number of potential vaccination opportunities (PVOs) in primary care in the remaining calendar months of year 2021, and the possible uptake if we supplied enough vaccine to primary care practices to fulfill their opportunities. To estimate how many potential vaccination opportunities (PVOs) may occur in primary care, we used three sets of data, analyzing the latest available waves of the following: (i) the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS, 2016, N = 677 providers); (ii) the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, 2018, N = 29,839 individuals in 29,839 households); and (iii) the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS, 2018, N = 40,025 individuals in 14,500 households). Per the NAMCS data, which provide a nationally-representative sample of ambulatory care visits, primary care physicians normally provide 40.2 million primary care visits per month. The majority of the primary care utilization is absorbed by those aged 16 to 64 years old who are not otherwise priority groups (i.e., not having chronic diseases as defined by ACIP) but the second large group of visits are those with a chronic disease (27.2% of all visits). As compared to the NAMCS data providing an estimate of care from the perspective of providers, the overall sample in NHIS provides a view of primary care access and utilization from a population perspective. Per NHIS, 34% of the civilian US population saw a generalist physician in the prior calendar year, or 109.8 million people. Overall, we would estimate that over the latter half of calendar year 2021, approximately 15 million potential vaccine opportunities would be available through US primary care practices.","output":"Potential COVID-19 vaccination opportunities in primary care practices in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The House last week passed the $1.9 trillion COVID\\\\19 relief bill, garnering support, not to mention relief, from mental health advocates who are praising the billions of dollars that will fund crucial mental health and substance use services.","output":"Advocates praise support from new COVID\\\\19 relief package"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, serological assays are urgently needed for rapid diagnosis, contact tracing and for epidemiological studies. So far, there is little data on how commercially available tests perform with real patient samples and if detected IgG antibodies provide protective immunity.

We tested follow up serum/plasma samples of individuals PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 samples were from individuals with moderate to severe clinical course, who required an in-patient hospital stay. For all examined assays, the sensitivity ranged from 58.8 to 76.5% for the early phase of infection (days 5-9) and from 93.8 to 100% for the later period (days 10-18) after PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. With exception of one sample, all positive tested samples in the analysed cohort, using the commercially available assays examined (including the in-house developed IFA), demonstrated neutralizing (protective) properties in the PRNT, indicating a potential protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Regarding specificity, there was evidence that samples of endemic coronavirus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infected individuals cross-reacted in the ELISA assays and IFA, in one case generating a false positive result (may giving a false sense of security).

Here, we employed the avidinCbiotin technology in a novel gold nanoparticle-decorated graphene field-effect transistor (AuNP-GFET) and demonstrated the specific detection of the biotinylated macromolecules such as biotinylated proteins and nucleotides in the sub-picomolar (pM) range. The AuNP-GFET was constructed by fabricating six pairs of interdigital electrodes on graphene transferred on a SiO(2)/Si substrate. The sensing performance of AuNP-GFET was characterized by the real-time two-terminal electrical current measurement upon injection of the analyte solution into a silicone pool preattached onto the electrodes. Avidin, a tetrameric biotin-binding protein with strong affinity and specificity, immobilized on AuNP-decorated single-layer graphene, was used as the sensing platform and transduced the electrical signal upon binding to the analyte macromolecules. The sensing capability of the AuNP-GFET was tested with the biotinylated protein A. Sensitivity of the present biosensor was estimated to be 0.4 pM. The specificity and applicability of the biosensor were confirmed using both synthetic and real samples. Because the biotin label can retain its binding capability to avidin with strong affinity and specificity even after conjugating with varieties of proteins and nucleotides, the present AuNP-GFET biosensor is expected to promote the research in developing different biosensors.","output":"AvidinCBiotin Technology in Gold Nanoparticle-Decorated Graphene Field Effect Transistors for Detection of Biotinylated Macromolecules with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Specificity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms are the predominant clinical manifestations of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The usual replacement interval of biliary plastic stents is three months. This study aimed to investigate if a shorter interval of 6-8 weeks impacts the median premature exchange rate (mPER) in benign and malignant biliary strictures. METHODS All cases with ERCP and plastic stent placement were retrospectively analyzed since establishing an elective replacement interval of every 6-8 weeks at our institution and mPER was determined. RESULTS A total of 3979 ERCPs (1199 patients) were analyzed, including 1262 (31.7%) malignant and 2717 (68.3%) benign cases, respectively. The median stent patency (mSP) was 41 days (range 14-120) for scheduled stent exchanges, whereas it was 17 days (1-75) for prematurely exchanged stents. The mPER was significantly higher for malignant (28.1%, 35-50%) compared to benign strictures (15.2%, 10-28%), p<0.0001), respectively. mSP was significantly shorter in cases with only one stent (34d (1-87) vs. 41d (1-120)) and in cases with only a 7 Fr stent (28d (2-79)) compared to a larger stent (34 d (1-87) p= 0.001).

Based on the spatiotemporal graph neural network and mobility data, this paper attempts to offer a novel prediction by building a high-resolution graph with the characteristics such as willingness to wear masks, daily infection, and daily death. This model is different from the time series prediction model. The method learns from the multivariate spatiotemporal graph, the nodes represent the region with daily confirmed cases and death, and edges represent the inter-regional contacts based on mobility. Simultaneously, the transmission model is built by a time margin as the characteristic of the time change. This paper builds the COVID-19 model by using STGNNs and tries to predict and verify the virus's infection. Finally, the model has an absolute Pearson Correlation of 0.9735, far from the expected value of 0.998. The predicted value on the first and second day is close to the real situation, while the value gradually deviates from the actual situation after the second day. It still shows that the graph neural network uses much temporal and spatial information to enable the model to learn complex dynamics. In the future, the model can be improved by tuning hyper-parameter such as modulation numbers of convolution, or construction of graphs that suitable for smaller individuals such as institutions, buildings, and houses, as well as assigning more features to each node.

Guidelines concerning electrosurgery and active implants such as pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators have been published, but most describe interference between electrosurgery and the active implant rather than the risk of unintended tissue heating. Tissue heating in proximity to implants during electrosurgery may cause an increased risk of patient injury. Objective: To determine the temperature of tissue close to metal implants during electrosurgery in an in-vitro model. Design, Setting, and Participants: Thirty tissue samples (15 with a metal implant placed in center, 15 controls without implant) were placed in an in vitro measurement chamber. Electrosurgery was applied at 5-60 W with the active electrode at three defined distances from the implant while temperatures at four defined distances from the implant were measured using fiber-optic sensors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Tissue temperature increase at the four tissue sites was determined for all power levels and each of the electrode-to-implant distances. Based on a linear mixed effects model analysis, the primary outcomes were the difference in temperature increase between implant and control tissue, and the estimated temperature increase per watt per minute. Results: Tissues with an implant had higher temperature increases than controls at all power levels after 1 min of applied electrosurgery (mean difference of 0.16C at 5 W, 0.50C at 15 W, 1.11C at 30 W, and 2.22C at 60 W, all with p < 0.001).

Materials and MethodsThis prospective, multicenter cohort study analysed people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, well (HbA1c<7.5% or <58 mmol/mol) or insufficiently (HbA1c[]7.5% or []58 mmol/mol) controlled and healthy controls. Roches Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S was used to quantify anti-spike protein antibodies 7-14 days after the first and 14-21 days after the second vaccination. Results86 healthy controls and 161 participants with diabetes were enrolled, 150 (75 with type 1 diabetes and 75 with type 2 diabetes) were eligible for the analysis. After the first vaccination, only 52.7% in the type 1 diabetes group and 48.0% in the type 2 diabetes group showed antibody levels above the cut-off for positivity. Antibody levels after the second vaccination were similar in people with type1, type 2 diabetes and healthy controls if adjusted for age, sex and multiple testing (p>0.05).

The available data on VTE in Asia is limited due to the lack of well-designed multicenter randomized controlled trials as well as non-standardized research designs, making data comparison difficult. Emerging data indicates that the VTE incidence is not low in Asia, and is comparable to that reported in the Western literature in some instances. There is also a trend towards increasing incidence of VTE, as demonstrated by a number of hospital-based studies in Asia. This could be attributed to lifestyle changes, ageing population, increasing awareness of VTE and wider availability of Duplex ultrasound. The risk of VTE in hospitalized patients remain the same in Asians and Caucasians, even though there may be factors that are inherent to patients in Asia that influence the slight variation in incidence. The utilization rate of VTE prophylaxis remains suboptimal in Asia. The Asian Venous Thrombosis Forum (AVTF) comprises participants from various countries such as China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and experts from Australia and Europe. The forum evaluated the available data on VTE from the Asian region and formulated guidelines tailored to meet the needs of the region. We recommend that serious considerations are given to VTE prophylaxis especially in the at-risk group and a formal hospital policy be established to facilitate the implementation. On admission to the hospital, we recommend assessing the patients for both VTE and bleeding risk. We recommend mechanical prophylaxis for patients at increased risk of bleeding and utilizing it as an adjunctive measure in combination with pharmacological prophylaxis in patients with high risk of VTE. For patients undergoing general or gynecological surgery and with moderate risk for VTE, we recommend prophylaxis with one of the following: low dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). For the same group of patients at high risk of VTE, we recommend pharmacological or combination of pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis. For patients undergoing major orthopedic surgeries like total hip replacement, total knee replacement and proximal hip fracture surgery, we recommend using one of the following: LMWH, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, warfarin or aspirin with IPC.

This suggests that SARS-CoV bearing a cleaved form of the S protein can enter cells directly from the cell surface without trypsin treatment. To explore this possibility, we introduced a furin-like cleavage sequence in the S protein at amino acids 798 to 801 and found that the mutated S protein was cleaved and induced cell fusion without trypsin treatment when expressed on the cell surface. Furthermore, a pseudotype virus bearing a cleaved S protein was revealed to infect cells in the presence of a lysosomotropic agent as well as a protease inhibitor, both of which are known to block SARS-CoV infection via an endosome, whereas the infection of pseudotypes with an uncleaved, wild-type S protein was blocked by these agents. A heptad repeat peptide, derived from a SARS-CoV S protein that is known to efficiently block infections from the cell surface, blocked the infection by a pseudotype with a cleaved S protein but not that with an uncleaved S protein. Those results indicate that SARS-CoV with a cleaved S protein is able to enter cells directly from the cell surface and agree with the previous observation of the protease-mediated cell surface entry of SARS-CoV.","output":"Entry from the cell surface of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus with cleaved S protein as revealed by pseudotype virus bearing cleaved S protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has disrupted millions of lives and commerce.

METHODS: A self-reported psychological and sleep online survey was conducted in China between February 5th to 19th, 2020. A total of 244 adults with MDs and 1116 controls matched for age, gender and sites were included. Worsened symptoms of anxiety, depressive and insomnia were defined when severity levels shifted to a more severe category compared to pre-COVID-19. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we found significantly increased prevalence of anxiety (MDs: 54.9% vs. 49.6%, controls: 25.5% vs. 14.3%), depression (MDs: 63.9% vs. 61.5%, controls: 29.9% vs. 21.2%) and insomnia (MDs: 66.0% vs. 57.8%, controls: 31.5% vs. 24.8%) compared to pre-COVID-19 period (all P-value < 0.001). Furthermore, adults with MDs had higher odds for developing COVID-19-related stress (OR = 3.41, 95% CI 2.49 ~ 4.67), worsened anxiety (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.38 ~ 2.76), depression (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.43 ~ 2.93) and insomnia (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.53 ~ 3.21) during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to controls. Moreover, higher COVID-19-related stress and lower levels of pre-COVID-19 anxiety, depressive and insomnia symptoms were predictors for worsened anxiety, depression and insomnia in adults with MDs, respectively.

Therapeutic hypothermia is one such co-therapy, but numerous issues have hampered its clinical use (e.g., pneumonia risk with whole-body cooling). Some problems may be avoided with brain-specific methods, such as intra-arterial selective cooling infusion (IA-SCI) into the arteries supplying the ischemic tissue. Objective: Our research question was about the efficacy of IA-SCI in animal middle cerebral artery occlusion models. We hypothesized that IA-SCI would be beneficial, but translationally-relevant study elements may be missing (e.g., aged animals). Methods: We completed a systematic review of the PubMed database following the PRISMA guidelines on May 21, 2020 for animal studies that administered IA-SCI in the peri-reperfusion period and assessed infarct volume, behavior (primary meta-analytic endpoints), edema, or blood-brain barrier injury (secondary endpoints). Our search terms included: \\"focal ischemia\\" and related terms, \\"IA-SCI\\" and related terms, and \\"animal\\" and related terms. Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria. We adapted a methodological quality scale from 0 to 12 for experimental design assessment (e.g., use of blinding/randomization, a priori sample size calculations). Results: Studies were relatively homogenous (e.g., all studies used young, healthy animals). Some experimental design elements, such as blinding, were common whereas others, such as sample size calculations, were infrequent (median methodological quality score: 5; range: 2-7). Our analyses revealed that IA-SCI provides benefit on all endpoints (mean normalized infarct volume reduction = 23.67%; 95% CI: 19.21-28.12; mean normalized behavioral improvement = 35.56%; 95% CI: 25.91-45.20; mean standardized edema reduction = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.56-1.34). Unfortunately, blood-brain barrier assessments were uncommon and could not be analyzed. However, there was substantial statistical heterogeneity and relatively few studies. Therefore, exploration of heterogeneity via meta-regression using saline infusion parameters, study quality, and ischemic duration was inconclusive. Conclusion: Despite convincing evidence of benefit in ischemic stroke models, additional studies are required to determine the scope of benefit, especially when considering additional elements (e.g., dosing characteristics). As there is interest in using this treatment alongside current ischemic stroke therapies, more relevant animal studies will be critical to inform patient studies.","output":"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies Testing Intra-Arterial Chilled Infusates After Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Care of the pregnant patient during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents many challenges, including creating parallel workflows for infected and non-infected patients, minimizing waste of materials, and ensuring that clinicians can seamlessly transition between types of anesthesia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS An analysis of the surgical literature was performed using the search engine EMBASE and PubMed with particular reference to the principal risk factors related to the post-thyroid surgery hypoparathyroidism.

There is a wide range of reported incidences of transient and permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism in literature. Extensive surgery, malignant disease and concomitant central and/or lateral neck dissection, autoimmune or Grave's' disease and re-operation represent the most recognized risk factors. A wide consensus exists about transplanting a parathyroid gland when it seems to be nonviable. DISCUSSION Although many improvements have been done in surgical technique, hypoparathyroidism seems to be one of the most common complication after total thyroidectomy. In this study we discuss the diagnosis methods and the importance of its early prediction regardless it is transient or permanent. Recovery time is under discussion: some author consider a gland permanent injury if restoring functionality does not occur within 6 months other 12 months.

CONCLUSIONS Many efforts are required to address the problem of a consensus on best define these complications. An early low PTH level after total thyroidectomy is associated with a high risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism and normal levels usually exclude long-term parathyroid glands dysfunction. However, the cost of the PTH assay may limit its widespread application.

AIM: To summarize the recent findings and reports of CoVID-19 reinfection in patients previously reCoVered from the disease. METHODS: This study was a systematic review of current evidence conducted in August 2020. The authors studied the probable reinfection risk of novel coronavirus (CoVID-19). We performed a systematic search using the keywords in online databases. The investigation adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist to ensure the reliability and validity of this study and results. RESULTS: We reviewed 31 studies. Eight studies described reCoVered patients with reinfection. Only one study reported reinfected patients who died. In 26 studies, there was no information about the status of the patients. Several studies indicated that reinfection is not probable and that post-infection immunity is at least temporary and short. CONCLUSION: Based on our review, we concluded that a positive polymerase chain reaction retest could be due to several reasons and should not always be considered as reinfection or reactivation of the disease. Most relevant studies in positive retest patients have shown relative and probably temporary immunity after the reCoVery of the disease.","output":"Reinfection risk of novel coronavirus (COVID-19): A systematic ?review of current evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW In early 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic shifted most healthcare to remote delivery methods to protect patients, clinicians, and hospital staff. Such remote care delivery methods include the use of telehealth technologies including clinical video telehealth or telephone visits. Prior to this, research on the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of telehealth applied to rheumatology, or telerheumatology, has been limited. RECENT FINDINGS Telerheumatology visits were found to be noninferior to in-person visits and are often more time and cost effective for patients. Clinicians and patients both noted the lack of a physical exam in telehealth visits and patients missed the opportunity to have lab work done or other diagnostic tests they are afforded with in-person visits. Overall, patients and clinicians had positive attitudes toward the use of telerheumatology and agreed on its usefulness, even beyond the pandemic. SUMMARY Although telerheumatology has the potential to expand the reach of rheumatology practice, some of the most vulnerable patients still lack the most basic resources required for a telehealth visit. As the literature on telerheumatology continues to expand, attention should be paid to health equity, the digital divide, as well as patient preferences in order to foster true shared decision-making over telehealth.","output":"Telerheumatology: before, during, and after a global pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we formulate and analyze a new mathematical model for COVID-19 epidemic with isolated class in fractional order.

Dynamics and numerical approximations for the proposed fractional-order model are studied. Firstly, positivity and boundedness of the model are established. Secondly, the basic reproduction number of the model is calculated by using the next generation matrix approach. Then, asymptotic stability of the model is investigated. Lastly, we apply the adaptive predictor-corrector algorithm and fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method to simulate the proposed model. Consequently, a set of numerical simulations are performed to support the validity of the theoretical results.

METHODS: Forty patients who attended for intravitreal injections were divided in those with less (<4h) and more (>4h) than 4 hours of mask use. Each group was divided depending on the application or not of povidone-iodine in the periocular area (PA) of the mask. Bacterial load was studied on PA and mouth area (MA) samples. RESULTS: The bacterial load in the PA was higher in the >4h group compared with the <4h group (13.2 vs 48.75 Colony Forming Units/L; p=0.03). The contamination in the PA significantly decreased after applying povidone-iodine in the >4h group (p=0.01). The use or not of povidone-iodine was strongly correlated to a positive culture (OR=9.0, p=0.00. CI 1.63-49.44). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical face masks worn for more than 4 hours presents higher contamination in the PA than those with less use. Bacterial load in the PA is reduced with povidone-iodine on masks used for more than 4 hours.

The role of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the event of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular collapse has not yet been established. We reviewed existing literature surrounding the role of VA-ECMO in the treatment of coronavirus-related cardiovascular collapse. COVID-19 is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). We found only one case report from China where COVID-19-associated fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock (CS) was successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR). We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection. Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus. A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS. Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure.

METHODS Study records and an investigator survey were examined for physician and site related factors, including: number of Wingspan and aneurysm stents submitted for credentialing, number of study procedures performed in SAMMPRIS, years in practice after training, primary specialty, and site enrollment. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine if these factors were associated with the 30 day rate of cerebrovascular events after angioplasty and stenting. RESULTS 213 patients underwent angioplasty alone (n=5) or angioplasty and stenting (n=208) with study devices by 63 interventionists at 48 sites. For credentialing, the median number of Wingspan and similar aneurysm stent cases submitted by study interventionists were 10 and 6, respectively. Interventionists with higher numbers (>10) of Wingspan cases submitted for credentialing tended to have higher rates of 30 day events (19.0% vs 9.9%) than those with <10 cases. High enrolling sites in the trial tended to have lower rates of hemorrhagic stroke (9.8% at sites enrolling <12 patients vs 2.7% at sites enrolling >12 patients). CONCLUSIONS Interventionists credentialed with less Wingspan experience were not responsible for the high rate of periprocedural stroke in SAMMPRIS.

Objective: To determine whether exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with outcomes in the eyes of newborns. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series enrolled newborns from April to November 2020 from 3 different maternity hospitals in S?o Paulo, Brazil. The diagnosis of COVID-19 in mothers and newborns was based on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays with material obtained from oronasopharyngeal swab sample; positive IGM serology was also considered as a diagnostic test for mothers. Newborns were excluded if they had any evidence of another congenital infection. All infants underwent external ocular examination and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. Exposures: Serology test for COVID-19 and detection of SARS-CoV-2 from oronasopharyngeal specimen using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay on both mothers and newborns. Main Outcomes and Measures: Screening for ophthalmologic manifestation in newborns after maternal COVID-19 infection. Results: A total of 165 newborns (age range at examination, 1 to 18 days) were evaluated. Of these, 123 (74.5%) were born at full term, and 42 (25.4%) were born preterm.

The identification of colistin potentiator from natural plants or their compound preparation as antibiotic adjuncts is a new promising strategy to meet this challenge. METHODS: Herein, the synergistic activity, as well as the potential mechanism, of Pingwei pill plus antibiotics against MCR-positive Gram-negative pathogens was examined using checkerboard assay, time-killing curves, combined disk test, western blot assay, and microscope analysis. Additionally, the Salmonella sp. HYM2 infection models of mouse and chick were employed to examine the in vivo efficacy of Pingwei pill in combination with colistin against bacteria infection. Finally, network pharmacology and molecular docking assay were used to predicate other actions of Pingwei pill for Salmonella infection. RESULTS: Our results revealed that Pingwei Pill synergistically potentiated the antibacterial activity of colistin against MCR-1-positive bacteria by accelerating the damage and permeability of the bacterial outer membrane with an FIC (Fractional Inhibitory Concentration) index less than 0.5. The treatment of Pingwei Pill neither inhibited bacterial growth nor affected MCR production. Notably, Pingwei Pill in combination with colistin significantly prolonged the median survival in mouse and chick models of infection using the Salmonella sp. strain HYM2, decreased bacteria burden and organ index of infected animal, alleviated pathological damage of cecum, which suggest that Pingwei Pill recovered the therapeutic performance of colistin for MCR-1- positive Salmonella infection in mice and the naturally infected host chick.

Interventions that increase the speed with which infected individuals remove themselves from the susceptible population are paramount, particularly isolation and hospitalization. Ebola virus disease (EVD), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are zoonotic viruses that have caused significant recent outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission. METHODS: This investigation quantified changing mean removal rates (MRR) and days from symptom onset to hospitalization (DSOH) of infected individuals from the population in seven different outbreaks of EVD, SARS, and MERS, to test for statistically significant differences in these metrics between outbreaks. RESULTS: We found that epidemic week and viral serial interval were correlated with the speed with which populations developed and maintained health behaviors in each outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight intrinsic population-level changes in isolation rates in multiple epidemics of three zoonotic infections with established human-to-human transmission and significant morbidity and mortality. These data are particularly useful for disease modelers seeking to forecast the spread of emerging pathogens.

To this end, we developed a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model for the contagion, and we used official data of the pandemic for identifying the parameters of this model. Our approach features two main non-standard aspects. The first one is that model parameters can be time-varying, allowing us to capture possible changes of the epidemic behavior, due for example to containment measures enforced by authorities or modifications of the epidemic characteristics and to the effect of advanced antiviral treatments. The time-varying parameters are written as linear combinations of basis functions and are then inferred from data using sparse identification techniques. The second non-standard aspect resides in the fact that we consider as model parameters also the initial number of susceptible individuals, as well as the proportionality factor relating the detected number of positives with the actual (and unknown) number of infected individuals. Identifying the model parameters amounts to a non-convex identification problem that we solve by means of a nested approach, consisting in a one-dimensional grid search in the outer loop, with a Lasso optimization problem in the inner step.","output":"A Time-Varying SIRD Model for the COVID-19 Contagion in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are needed that elicit immunity directly in the airways, as well as systemically.

Treatment of submassive pulmonary embolism in a hemodynamically stable patient is still controversial in terms of who would benefit from advanced treatment options such as catheter guided thrombolysis. Specifically, it is not clear how the CT reported right ventricular (RV) strain compares to the gold standard, echo derived RV free wall longitudinal strain. Limited or no data exists in the literature comparing these two modalities for assessment of RV strain. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of 142 patients admitted to Mayo Clinic Arizona with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism who had both echo derived RV strain and CT reported RV strain. Results Patients mean age was 62 yrs. Comorbidities consisted of COPD (5%), asthma (16%), OSA (30%), diabetes (24%), hypertension (57%) and Covid 19 infection (13%). Echographic evaluation revealed mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, right ventricular systolic pressure of 43 mm Hg, and mean RV free wall longitudinal strain of -19%. Specifically, 65% of the patients had abnormal echo derived RV strain (-24% or more negative strain is considered normal), while 45% had abnormal CT reported RV strain. Using echo RV strain as the gold standard, CT reported RV strain has a sensitivity of 58%, specificity of 80%, PPV of 84% and NPV of 50%. Conclusion Our study results suggest that CT reported RV strain has relatively low negative predictive value indicating that these patients would benefit from echo derived RV strain measurements so that potential candidacy for advanced treatment options can be considered. Further studies are needed to understand why there are discrepancies between echo vs. CT reported RV strain.

We generated micro particle PLPs loaded with TLR4 (glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant, GLA) or TLR9 (CpG) agonists, and formulated them with and without a mucosal delivery enhancing carbomer-based nanoemulsion adjuvant (ADJ).

These are commonly originated as a result of the pollutant transport to the alveolar cavity after their inhalation. Once pollutants enter the alveolar cavity, they are deposited on the lung surfactant (LS) film, altering their mechanical performance which increases the respiratory work and can induce a premature alveolar collapse. Furthermore, the interactions of pollutants with LS can induce the formation of an LS corona decorating the pollutant surface, favoring their penetration into the bloodstream and distribution along different organs. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the most fundamental aspects of the interaction of particulate pollutants with LS to mitigate their effects, and design therapeutic strategies. However, the use of animal models is often invasive, and requires a careful examination of different bioethics aspects. This makes it necessary to design in vitro models mimicking some physico-chemical aspects with relevance for LS performance, which can be done by exploiting the tools provided by the science and technology of interfaces to shed light on the most fundamental physico-chemical bases governing the interaction between LS and particulate matter. This review provides an updated perspective of the use of fluid films of LS models for shedding light on the potential impact of particulate matter in the performance of LS film.

We explore the direction and magnitude of potential biases in these estimates and their implications for vaccine protection against infection and against disease in breakthrough infections. MethodsWe developed a mathematical model that accounts for natural and vaccine-induced immunity, changes in serostatus and imperfect sensitivity and specificity of tests for infection and antibodies. We estimated expected biases in VE against symptomatic, asymptomatic and any SARS-CoV-2 infections and against disease following infection for a range of vaccine characteristics and measurement approaches, and the likely overall biases for published trial results that included asymptomatic infections. ResultsVE against asymptomatic infection measured by PCR or serology is expected to be low or negative for vaccines that prevent disease but not infection. VE against any infection is overestimated when asymptomatic infections are less likely to be detected than symptomatic infections and the vaccine protects against symptom development. A competing bias towards underestimation arises for estimates based on tests with imperfect specificity, especially when testing is performed frequently. Our model indicates considerable uncertainty in Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S VE against any infection, with slightly higher than published, bias-adjusted values of 59.0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 38.4 to 77.1) and 70.9% (95% UI 49.8 to 80.7) respectively.

The disease is sweeping through Lombardy, which remains in lockdown since the 8th of March. As of the same day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy have been extended to the entire country.

Methods. To deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual exposed/ infected cases in the total population, we address a compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the total cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death, the case fatality ratio, and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the \`\`effective\\" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the SEIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March, the lockdown day of Lombardy and of all Italy.

Based on the computed values, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number $R_0$. Furthermore, based on an estimation for the reduction in the \\"effective\\" transmission rate of the disease as of March 8 that reflects the suspension of almost all activities in Italy, we ran the simulator to forecast the fade out of the epidemic. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, the effect of social distancing, and the draconian measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020.

Few studies, however, have described the potential impact of these measures on other important infectious diseases. METHODS: The incidence of 19 major infectious diseases in Zhejiang Province was collected from the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System from January 2017 to October 2020. The entire epidemic control phase was divided into three stages. The government deployed the first level response from 24 January to 2 March (the most rigorous measures). When the outbreak of COVID-19 was under control, the response level changed to the second level from 3 to 23 March, and then the third level response was implemented after 24 March. We compared the epidemiological characteristics of 19 major infectious diseases during different periods of the COVID-19 epidemic and previous years. RESULTS: A total of 1,814,881 cases of 19 infectious diseases were reported in Zhejiang from January 2017 to October 2020, resulting in an incidence rate of 8088.30 cases per 1,000,000 person-years. After the non-pharmaceutical intervention, the incidence of 19 infectious diseases dropped by 70.84%, from 9436.32 cases per 1,000,000 person-years to 2751.51 cases per 1,000,000 person-years, with the large decrease in the first response period of influenza. However, we observed that the daily incidence of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and leptospirosis increased slightly (from 1.11 cases per 1,000,000 person-years to 1.82 cases per 1,000,000 person-years for SFTS and 0.30 cases per 1,000,000 person-years to 1.24 cases per 1,000,000 person-years for leptospirosis).

Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several articles have suggested the potential involvement of vitamin D in reducing the risk and severity of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological and observational studies support the hypothesis of a protective role of vitamin D but most studies are retrospective or based on small samples. However, the pandemic progression and the increased knowledge on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 have challenged the first evidence, suggesting also potential negative consequences derived by adequate vitamin D status. A cautious interpretation of the significance of low vitamin D25OH levels is advisable. The balance between over-activation of innate immunity and the exhaustibility of the adaptive immune response still needs to be clarified. In addition, the modulation of endothelial function, the down-regulation of renin, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin genes and the up-regulation of ACE2 expression is still an area of research. SUMMARY: Speculative hypotheses and observational data have suggested a protective role of vitamin D in COVID-19. However, many unanswered questions remain, aberrant detrimental effects of adequate vitamin D25OH levels cannot be excluded and whether its adequacy may prevent the infection or improve clinical outcomes needs to be assessed by adequately sized and designed population-based studies and intervention trials.","output":"A brief discussion of the benefit and mechanism of vitamin D supplementation on coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical robotic systems might play an important role by assisting the healthcare personal by allowing patients to continue their therapy at home and protecting the healthcare personal and patients from COVID-19 with social distancing [1] This article describes the design and development of an elbow exoskeleton the design follows a methodology based on the ISO 9241, that deals with problems of anatomical design of the device, types of control, and user-centered design (UCD), to develop a medical robotic rehabilitation device that supports the healthcare professional and suits the needs of the rehabilitation user ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Design and Development of an Elbow Exoskeleton for Home Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective/bThere is an increased interest in drug repurposing against Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) as its spread has significantly outpaced development of effective therapeutics Our aim is to identify approved drugs that can inhibit the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that is critical for coronavirus infection Methods/bThe published crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 receptor interaction was first analyzed for druggable binding pockets The binding interface was then probed by an integrated virtual screening protocol executed by a high-performance computer cluster, involving docking and consensus scoring using various machine-learning, empirical and knowledge-based scoring functions The consensus-ranked lists of screened drugs were generated via a?rank-by-ranka? and a?rank-by-numbera? schemes Findings/bpAlthough spike protein and ACE2 lacked druggable pockets in their unbound forms, they presented a well-defined pocket when bound together Accordingly, we identified many drugs with high binding potential against this protein-protein interaction pocket Importantly, several antivirals against two major (+)ssRNA viruses (HCV and HIV) constituted major grouof our tohits, of which Atazanavir, Grazoprevir, Saquinavir, Simeprevir, Telaprevir and Tipranavir could be of most importance for immediate experimental/clinical investigations Additional notable hits included many anti-inflammatory/antioxidant, antibiotic/antifungal, and other relevant compounds with proven activity against respiratory diseases, further emphasizing robustness of our current study Notably, we also discovered Maraviroc, the only FDA-approved drug capable of targeting virus-host interaction and blocking HIV entry Conclusion/bOur newly identified compounds warrant further experimental investigation against SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction, which if proven effective may present much-needed immediate clinical potential against Covid-19","output":"Drug Repurposing for Covid-19: Discovery of Potential Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Spike Protein-ACE2 Receptor Interaction Through Virtual Screening and Consensus Scoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During a pandemic, women may be especially vulnerable to secondary health problems driven by its social and economic effects. We examined the relationship between changes in health-related socioeconomic risks (HRSRs) and mental health. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 3,200 women aged 18-90 years was conducted in April 2020 using a quota-based sample from a national panel (88% cooperation rate). Patterns of change in HRSRs (food insecurity, housing instability, interpersonal violence, and difficulties with utilities and transportation) were described. Weighted, multivariate logistic regression was used to model the odds of depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress symptoms among those with and without incident or worsening HRSRs. Results: More than 40% of women had one or more prepandemic HRSRs. In the early pandemic phase, 49% of all women, including 29% with no prepandemic HRSRs, had experienced incident or worsening HRSRs. By April 2020, the rates of depression and anxiety were twice that of prepandemic benchmarks (29%); 17% of women had symptoms of traumatic stress. The odds of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were two to three times higher among women who reported at least one incident or worsening HRSR; this finding was similar for women with and without prepandemic HRSRs. Conclusions: Increased health-related socioeconomic vulnerability among U.S. women early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was prevalent and associated with alarmingly high rates of mental health problems. Pandemic-related mental health needs are likely to be much greater than currently available resources, especially for vulnerable women.","output":"Change in Health-Related Socioeconomic Risk Factors and Mental Health During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Survey of U.S. Women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asian bats have been identified as potential reservoir hosts of coronaviruses associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV).

In the PRADA trial (Prevention of Cardiac Dysfunction During Adjuvant Breast Cancer Therapy), concomitant treatment with the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan attenuated the reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in women receiving treatment for breast cancer, whereas the -blocker metoprolol attenuated the increase in cardiac troponins. This study aimed to assess the long-term effects of candesartan and metoprolol or their combination to prevent a reduction in cardiac function and myocardial injury. METHODS: In this 22 factorial, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center trial, patients with early breast cancer were assigned to concomitant treatment with candesartan cilexetil, metoprolol succinate, or matching placebos. Target doses were 32 and 100 mg, respectively. Study drugs were discontinued after adjuvant therapy. All 120 validly randomized patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome measure was change in LVEF assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging from baseline to extended follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included changes in left ventricular volumes, echocardiographic peak global longitudinal strain, and circulating cardiac troponin concentrations. RESULTS: A small decline in LVEF but no significant between-group differences were observed from baseline to extended follow-up, at a median of 23 months (interquartile range, 21 to 28 months) after randomization (candesartan, 1.7% [95% CI, 0.5 to 2.8]; no candesartan, 1.8% [95% CI, 0.6 to 3.0]; metoprolol, 1.6% [95% CI, 0.4 to 2.7]; no metoprolol, 1.9% [95% CI, 0.7 to 3.0]). Candesartan treatment during adjuvant therapy was associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume compared with the noncandesartan group (P=0.021) and attenuated decline in global longitudinal strain (P=0.046) at 2 years. No between-group differences in change in cardiac troponin I and T concentrations were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Anthracycline-containing adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer was associated with a decline in LVEF during extended follow-up. Candesartan during adjuvant therapy did not prevent reduction in LVEF at 2 years, but was associated with modest reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and preserved global longitudinal strain. These results suggest that a broadly administered cardioprotective approach may not be required in most patients with early breast cancer without preexisting cardiovascular disease.

This study aims to describe the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the health and living circumstances of precarious migrants in Switzerland and to assess whether those undergoing legal status regularization fared better than undocumented migrants. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown in April-May 2020. Undocumented and recently regularized migrants taking part in an ongoing cohort study were asked to respond to an online questionnaire. A subsample was selected to undergo semi-directed phone interviews. Results: Overall, 117 of the 379 (30.9%) cohort study participants responded to the questionnaire. Seventeen interviews were conducted. Migrants faced cumulative and rapidly progressive difficulties in essential life domains. As a consequence, they showed high prevalence of exposure to COVID-19, poor mental health along with frequent avoidance of health care. Moreover, the loss of working hours and the related income overlapped with frequent food and housing insecurity. Around one participant in four had experienced hunger. Despite these unmet needs, half of the participants had not sought external assistance for reasons that differ by legal status. Both groups felt that seeking assistance might represent a threat for the renewal or a future application for a residency permit. While documented migrants were less severely affected in some domains by having accumulated more reserves previously, they also frequently renounced to sources of support. Conclusions: The cumulated difficulties faced by migrants in this period of crisis and their limited search for assistance highlight the need to implement trust-building strategies to bridge the access gap to sources of support along with policies protecting them against the rapid loss of income, the risk of losing their residency permit and the exposure to multi-fold insecurities.","output":"The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic and the Lockdown on the Health and Living Conditions of Undocumented Migrants and Migrants Undergoing Legal Status Regularization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article.","output":"Correction to: N6-Adenosine methylation on mRNA is recognized by YTH2 domain protein of human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Several countries have imposed a mandatory 14-day period of quarantine on individuals arriving from countries considered high-risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

METHODS: A total of 162 patients with end-stage renal disease admitted to our hospital from February 2018 to July 2020 were divided into two groups: cuff tunnel conduit (CTC) group and native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) group. Peripheral blood was collected before and 6 months after dialysis. The incidence of vascular recirculation was measured, and the risk factors of infection were analyzed. RESULTS: The levels of HB, Alb, CRP, BUN, Scr, and TP after dialysis in the two groups were lower than those before dialysis (P < 0.05). The Kt/V of patients in both groups did not exceed 1.2, and the URR value exceeded 60%. The results of independent-samples T test analysis documented that the Kt/V level of patients in the AVF group was higher than that of those in the CTC group after dialysis (P < 0.05). The results of the urea method revealed that 22 of 68 patients (32.35%) in the CVC group and 21 of 94 (22.34%) in the AVF group had vascular pathway recirculation. The (2) test showed that there was no remarkable difference in the incidence of vascular pathway recirculation between both groups (P > 0.05). However, the results of the nonurea method revealed that the incidence of vascular pathway recirculation in the AVF group was lower than that in the CVC group (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression was used to further analyze the factors with statistical significance in the single factor results. It showed that age >60 years, dialysis duration >1 year, dialysis times, diabetes, hypertension, and CTC were all independent risk factors causing vascular access infection. CONCLUSION: If all conditions permit, AVF hemodialysis is a better choice for patients with end-stage renal disease. For the elderly, long-term hemodialysis, and those with diabetes and hypertension, it is necessary to make detailed plans, strengthen the operation proficiency of CTC, and reduce the incidence of infection.","output":"Analysis of Different Vascular Accesses on Dialysis Quality and Infection Risk Factors of Hemodialysis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the trade-offs between health and the economy during the period of social distancing in S?o Paulo, the state hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.

RESULTS: The correlation between average preventive measure interest and length of time before the SAH order was placed was -0.47. Average preventive measure interest was also inversely related to voting for a Republican presidential nominee in the 2016 election (R = -0.75), the latter of which was positively associated with longer delays in SAH orders (R = 0.48).

Further research is required to halt progression of multi-organ injury induced by hyper-inflammation. AREAS COVERED PubMed/MEDLINETM databases were accessed between May 9th-June 9th, 2020, to review the latest perspectives on the treatment and pathogenesis of CRS. EXPERT OPINION Over-activity of chemotaxis triggers a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 and TNF-  are at the forefront of hyper-inflammation. The inflammatory cascade induces endothelial activation and capillary leak, leading to circulatory collapse and shock. As endothelial dysfunction persists, there is activation of the clotting cascade and microvascular obstruction. Continued endothelial activation results in multi-organ failure, regardless of pulmonary tissue damage. We propose that targeting the endothelium may interrupt this cycle. Immuno-modulating therapies have been suggested, however, further data is necessary to confirm that they do not jeopardize adaptive immunity. Inhibition of IL-6 and the Janus Kinase, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins pathway (JAK/STAT), are favorable targets. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) reduces the inflammation of sepsis in animal models and should be considered as a low risk intervention, in combination with cardiovascular protection.","output":"The cytokine storm of COVID-19: a spotlight on prevention and protection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Point of care diagnostics for COVID-19 detection are vital to assess infection quickly and at the source so appropriate measures can be taken. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has proven to be a reliable and simple protocol that can detect small amounts of viral RNA in patient samples (<10 genomes per L) (Nagamine, Hase, and Notomi 2002) Recently, Rabe and Cepko at Harvard published a sensitive and simple protocol for COVID-19 RNA detection in saliva using an optimized LAMP assay (Rabe and Cepko, 2020). This LAMP protocol has the benefits of being simple, requiring no specialized equipment; rapid, requiring less than an hour from sample collection to readout; and cheap, costing around $1 per reaction using commercial reagents. The pH based colorimetric readout also leaves little ambiguity and is intuitive. However, a shortfall in many nucleic acid-based methods for detection in saliva samples has been the variability in output due to the presence of inhibitory substances in saliva. Centrifugation to separate the reaction inhibitors from inactivated sample was shown to be an effective way to ensure reliable LAMP amplification. However, a centrifuge capable of safely achieving the necessary speeds of 2000 RPM for several minutes often costs hundreds of dollars and requires a power supply. We present here an open hardware solution- Handyfuge - that can be assembled with readily available components for the cost of <5 dollars a unit and could be used together with the LAMP assay for point of care detection of COVID-19 RNA from saliva.

Some hand sanitizers claim to interrupt hNoV transmission, but their antiviral efficacy on human hands is poorly characterized. The purpose of this work was to characterize the efficacy of representative commercial hand sanitizers against hNoV using an in vivo fingerpad method (ASTM E1838-17). Eight products [seven ethanol-based and one benzalkonium chloride (BAK)-based], and a benchmark 60% ethanol solution, were each evaluated on 10 human volunteers using the epidemic GII.4 hNoV strain. Virus titers before and after treatment were evaluated by RT-qPCR preceded by RNase treatment; product efficacy was characterized by log(10) reduction (LR) in hNoV genome equivalent copies after treatment. The benchmark treatment produced a 1.7  0.5 LR, compared with Product A (containing 85% ethanol) which produced a 3.3  0.3 LR and was the most efficacious (p < 0.05). Product B (containing 70% ethanol), while less efficacious than Product A (p < 0.05), performed better than the benchmark with a LR of 2.4  0.4. Five of the other ethanol-based products (labeled ethanol concentration ranges of 62C80%) showed similar efficacy to the 60% ethanol benchmark with LR ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 (p > 0.05). Product H (0.1% BAK) was less effective than the benchmark with a LR of 0.3  0.2 (p < 0.05). None of the products screened were able to completely eliminate hNoV (maximum assay resolution 5.0 LR). Product performance was variable and appears driven by overall formulation. There remains a need for more hand sanitizer formulations having greater activity against hNoV, a virus that is comparatively recalcitrant relative to other pathogens of concern in community, healthcare, and food preparation environments.","output":"Comparative Assessment of the Efficacy of Commercial Hand Sanitizers Against Human Norovirus Evaluated by an in vivo Fingerpad Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gene-environment interaction (GxE) determines the vulnerability of an individual to a spectrum of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased impulsivity, excessive aggression, and other behavioural characteristics are associated with variants within the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph2) gene, a key enzyme in brain serotonin synthesis. This phenotype is recapitulated in na?ve mice with complete, but not with partial Tph2 inactivation. Tph2 haploinsufficiency in animals reflects allelic variation of Tph2 facilitating the elucidation of respective GxE mechanisms. Recently, we showed excessive aggression and altered serotonin brain metabolism in heterozygous Tph2-deficient male mice (Tph2+/-) after predator stress exposure. Here, we sought to extend these studies by investigating aggressive and anxiety-like behaviours, sociability, and the brain metabolism of dopamine and noradrenaline. Separately, Tph2+/- mice were examined for exploration activity in a novel environment and for the potentiation of helplessness in the modified swim test (ModFST). Predation stress procedure increased measures of aggression, dominancy, and suppressed sociability in Tph2+/- mice, which was the opposite of that observed in control mice. Anxiety-like behaviour was unaltered in the mutants and elevated in controls. Tph2+/- mice exposed to environmental novelty or to the ModFST exhibited increased novelty exploration and no increase in floating behaviour compared to controls, which is suggestive of resilience to stress and despair. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed significant genotype-dependent differences in the metabolism of dopamine, and norepinephrine within the brain tissue.

The first case of COVID-19 was identified in Lebanon on the 21(st) of February 2020, amid a national economic crisis. As the numbers of cases increased, ICU admissions and mortality rose, which led hospitals across Lebanon to take certain safety measures to contain the virus. The Naef K. Basile Cancer Institute (NKBCI) at the American University of Beirut Medical Center handles oncology outpatient visits and outpatient treatment protocol infusions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the safety measures put forth by the NKBCI early in the pandemic. METHODS: Oncology patients are amongst the immunosuppressed population, who are at greatest risk of contracting COVID-19 and consequently suffering its complications. In this manuscript, we evaluated the precautionary measures implemented at the NKBCI of AUBMC from March 1(st) to May 31(st) of 2020, by surveying oncology patients on the telephone who had live and virtual appointments in both the oncology outpatient clinics and infusion unit. We conducted a prospective study of 670 oncology patients who had appointments at the NKBCI during this period and used their answers to draw responses about patient satisfaction towards those safety measures. RESULTS: Our results involved 387 responses of oncology patients who visited the NKBCI during the period of March 1(st) to May 31(st) of 2020. 99% of our respondents gave a rating of good to excellent with these new measures. The option of online consultation was given to 35% in the hematology group compared to 19% in those with solid tumors (p=0.001). From the total, 15% of patients opted for the telemedicine experience as a new implemented strategy to provide patient-centered medical care. Of this group of patients, 22% faced problems with connectivity and 19% faced problems with online payment. CONCLUSION: NKBCI was competent in following the WHO guidelines in protecting the oncology patient population. Feedback collected from the surveys will be taken into account by the committee of the NKBCI to develop new safety measures that can better control viral spread while providing patient-centered medical care.","output":"Implemented Interventions at the Naef K.

METHODS We performed a subanalysis of the \\"DWI-FLAIR mismatch for the identification of patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset\\" (PRE-FLAIR) and the \\"AX200 for ischemic stroke\\" (AXIS 2) trials. We developed a prediction model with data from the PRE-FLAIR study by backward logistic regression with the 4.5-hour time window as dependent variable and the following explanatory variables: age and median relative DWI (rDWI) signal intensity, interquartile range (IQR) rDWI signal intensity, and volume of the core. We obtained the accuracy of the model to predict the 4.5-hour time window and validated our findings in an independent cohort from the AXIS 2 trial. We compared the receiver operating characteristic curve to the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch. RESULTS In the derivation cohort of 118 patients, we retained the IQR rDWI as explanatory variable. A threshold of 0.39 was most optimal in selecting patients within 4.5 hours after stroke onset resulting in a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 63%. The accuracy was validated in an independent cohort of 200 patients. The predictive value of the area under the curve of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.64-0.80) was similar to the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch (area under the curve = 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.72; p for difference = 0.18).

One such method uses stably expressed reference genes. Since suitable reference genes appear to be unique for each tissue, we have identified an optimal set of the most stably expressed genes in human blood that can be used for normalization. METHODS: Whole-genome Affymetrix Human 2.0 Plus arrays were examined from 526 samples of males and females ages 2 to 78, including control subjects and patients with Tourette syndrome, stroke, migraine, muscular dystrophy, and autism. The top 100 most stably expressed genes with a broad range of expression levels were identified. To validate the best candidate genes, we performed quantitative RT-PCR on a subset of 10 genes (TRAP1, DECR1, FPGS, FARP1, MAPRE2, PEX16, GINS2, CRY2, CSNK1G2 and A4GALT), 4 commonly employed reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, B2M and HMBS) and PPIB, previously reported to be stably expressed in blood. Expression stability and ranking analysis were performed using GeNorm and NormFinder algorithms. RESULTS: Reference genes were ranked based on their expression stability and the minimum number of genes needed for nomalization as calculated using GeNorm showed that the fewest, most stably expressed genes needed for acurate normalization in RNA expression studies of human whole blood is a combination of TRAP1, FPGS, DECR1 and PPIB. We confirmed the ranking of the best candidate control genes by using an alternative algorithm (NormFinder). CONCLUSION: The reference genes identified in this study are stably expressed in whole blood of humans of both genders with multiple disease conditions and ages 2 to 78. Importantly, they also have different functions within cells and thus should be expressed independently of each other. These genes should be useful as normalization genes for microarray and RT-PCR whole blood studies of human physiology, metabolism and disease.","output":"Identification and validation of suitable endogenous reference genes for gene expression studies in human peripheral blood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shipping has always had a special relationship with competition law and economics. Even if special competition law regimes for the shipping industry continue to exist, most countries nowadays accept the notion that shipping markets should be more competitive. Competition authorities monitor this in a more or less regular fashion, with various market concentration indexes. The liner shipping industry is peculiar in its widespread cooperation schemes between carriers, in the form of vessel sharing agreements, also known as consortia. Carriers engage in cooperation with all of their major competitors in a system of consortia that is highly interlinked. This brings considerable risks of abuse of market power. Yet, the system of inter-linked consortia has never been systematically mapped, nor do competition authorities appear to monitor them. This article addresses this gap, by proposing alternative indicators, in addition to the traditional industry concentration indexes such as the HerfindahlCHirschman Index (HHI), that take the reality of consortia into account. Here, five possible alternative indicators are considered: the market share of consortia and independent operators; the share of consortia exceeding market share thresholds; the industry market concentration of consortia; a modified HHI that takes consortia into account; and interlinkages between consortia. We analyse the current state of concentration of liner shipping on the basis of these indicators using a new and unique database that contains deployed ship capacity of container carriers on all of their liner services. Based on this dataset we provide an overview of differences in industry concentration across world regions and developments over time. Traditional indicators show an increase in industry concentration. For example, over the trade corridors to and from Northern Europe, the HHI scores in 2006 ranged from 604 to 2463, and from 1164 to 4882 in 2021. The alternative criteria show additional industry concentration. We show that in 2021, 704 out of more than 1500 agreements among carrier consortia had a combined market share of at least 30%, and 102 of them had a combined market share of at least 50%. We also observe that in 2021, the carriers active in alliances operated 85% of the consortia capacity. Although carriers that are in the same alliance operate most of these consortia, it is also noteworthy that carriers that are not in the same alliance operate a considerable part (24%) of the consortia. Our calculations of modified HerfindahlCHirschman Index (MHHI)indexes that take consortia into account show that industry concentration is higher when consortia are taken into account: for example on the trade corridor Northern Europe-North America East Coast, the MHHI has reached the threshold of 2500 points, despite an HHI score of around 1500. In the conclusion of the article, we put forward ways in which these alternative indicators could be used by competition authorities.","output":"Alternative approaches to measuring concentration in liner shipping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid ethical access to personal health information (PHI) to support research is extremely important during pandemics, yet little is known regarding patient preferences for consent during such crises. This follow-up study sought to ascertain whether there were differences in consent preferences between pre-pandemic times compared to during Wave 1 of the COVID-19 global pandemic, and to better understand the reasons behind these preferences. METHODS: A total of 183 patients in the pandemic cohort completed the survey via email, and responses were compared to the distinct pre-pandemic cohort (n = 222); all were patients of a large Canadian cancer center. The survey covered (a) broad versus study-specific consent; (b) opt-in versus opt-out contact approach; (c) levels of comfort sharing with different recipients; (d) perceptions of commercialization; and (e) options to track use of information and be notified of results. Four focus groups (n = 12) were subsequently conducted to elucidate reasons motivating dominant preferences. RESULTS: Patients in the pandemic cohort were significantly more comfortable with sharing all information and biological samples (90% vs. 79%, p = 0.009), sharing information with the health care institution (97% vs. 83%, p < 0.001), sharing information with researchers at other hospitals (85% vs. 70%, p < 0.001), sharing PHI provincially (69% vs. 53%, p < 0.002), nationally (65% vs. 53%, p = 0.022) and internationally (48% vs. 39%, p = 0.024) compared to the pre-pandemic cohort. Discomfort with sharing information with commercial companies remained unchanged between the two cohorts (50% vs. 51% uncomfortable, p = 0.58). Significantly more pandemic cohort patients expressed a wish to track use of PHI (75% vs. 61%, p = 0.007), and to be notified of results (83% vs. 70%, p = 0.012). Thematic analysis uncovered that transparency was strongly desired on outside PHI use, particularly when commercialization was involved. CONCLUSIONS: In pandemic times, patients were more comfortable sharing information with all parties, except with commercial entities, where levels of discomfort (~ 50%) remained unchanged. Focus groups identified that the ability to track and receive results of studies using ones PHI is an important way to reduce discomfort and increase trust.

The aim of the study is to systematically review and summarize the currently available randomized controlled trials in English or German language on the impact of passive motion of the lower extremities in sedated and ventilated patients  18 years in the intensive care unit on musculature, inflammation and immune system and the development of intensive care unit-acquired weakness and to evaluate the replicability of interventions and the methodological quality of included studies. A systematic literature search was performed up to 20th February 2022 in the databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PEDro. The description of the intervention (TIDieR checklist) and the methodological quality (Downs and Black checklist) were assessed. Five studies were included in the qualitative syntheses. On average, the studies were rated with 6.8 out of 12 points according to the TIDieR checklist. For the methodological quality an average of 19.8 out of 27 points on the Downs and Black checklist was reported. The results of included studies indicated that muscle loss may be reduced by passive manual movement, passive cycling and passive motion on a continuous passive motion-unit. In addition, positive effects were reported on the reduction of nitrosative stress and the immune response. The impact on the development of ICU-AW remains unclear. In conclusion, passive movement show a slight tendency for beneficial changes on cellular level in sedated and ventilated patients in the ICU within the first days of admission, which may indicate a reduction of muscle wasting and could prevent the development of ICU-AW. Future randomized controlled trials should use larger samples, use complete intervention description, use a comparable set of outcome measures, use rigorous methodology and examine the effect of passive motion on the development of ICU-AW.","output":"Passive motion of the lower extremities in sedated and ventilated patients in the ICU C a systematic review of early effects and replicability of Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The effect of reopening schools on children's contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially within households, remains controversial.

Many newborns are hypothermic on admission despite using polyethylene bags (PBs). Using exothermic mattresses (EMs) in addition to PBs may reduce hypothermia but increase hyperthermia. We wished to determine whether placing preterm newborns in PBs on EMs in the DR results in more infants with rectal temperature outside the range 36.5 to 37.5C on NICU admission. METHODS Infants <31 weeks were randomly assigned before birth to treatment with or without an EM. All infants were placed in a PB and under radiant heat immediately after birth and brought to NICU in a transport incubator. Infants randomly assigned to EM were placed on a mattress immediately after delivery and remained on it until admission. Randomization was stratified by gestational age. Rectal temperature was measured with a digital thermometer on NICU admission. RESULTS The data safety monitoring committee recommended stopping for efficacy after analyzing data from half the planned sample. We report data for 72 infants enrolled at this time. Fewer infants in PBs on EMs had temperatures within the target range (15/37 [41%] vs 27/35 [77%], P = .002) and more had temperatures >37.5C (17/37 [46%] vs 6/35 [17%], P = .009).

In order to enable the continuity of care in these circumstances, many telemedicine applications are currently tested. While physicians preferences are commonly investigated, data regarding the patients point of view are still lacking. We built a 37 items web-based survey exploring patients propensity, awareness, and opinions on telemedicine with the aim to evaluate the sustainability of this approach in MS. Analysing 613 questionnaires out of 1093 that were sent to persons with MS followed at the Multiple Sclerosis Center of Tor Vergata University, Rome, we found that more than half of respondents (54%) were open to having a televisit. Propensity toward telemedicine significantly depended on having a higher income (p = 0.037), living farther from the center (p = 0.038), using computer and tablet (p = 0.010) and using the Internet for other remote activities (p < 0.001), conversely it was not influenced by any specific disease characteristics (i.e. degree of disability). The main advantages and disadvantages of televisit reported by participants were respectively saving time (70%) and impossibility to measure physical parameters (71%). Although the majority of respondents are in favour of televisit, so far this approach is restricted to those displaying better socioeconomic conditions and higher familiarity with technology.

To address the influence of physical distancing, universal masking, and ventilation on very fine respiratory droplets and aerosol particle exposure, a simulator that coughed and exhaled aerosols (the source) and a second breathing simulator (the recipient) were placed in an exposure chamber. When controlling for the other two mitigation strategies, universal masking with 3-ply cotton masks reduced exposure to 0.3-3 m coughed and exhaled aerosol particles by > 77% compared to unmasked tests, whereas physical distancing (0.9 or 1.8 m) significantly changed exposure to cough but not exhaled aerosols.

Results at baseline indicate no significant differences in body compositions among fencing disciplines. We also confirmed no significant changes in body mass during the 1-year investigation period in either sex. There were no time-course changes in mens FFM and FM; however, time-course changes in womens FM were observed. Compared to the baseline, FM values were significantly higher at POST and then returned to baseline levels at POST-4M in women. In conclusion, the 2-month stay-at-home period due to COVID-19 negatively affected womens FM changes, but not their FFM or mens FM.","output":"The Effects of the COVID-19 Environments on Changes in Body Composition in Japanese Elite Fencing Athlete"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To describe the clinical experience with the delivery of intravitreal injection therapy to patients with various indications at a tertiary university hospital during the COVID-19 lockdown in Jordan. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study of patients who received intravitreal injections between April 12th and May 9th, 2020, a period during the national COVID-19 lockdown (March 16th to June 6th, 2020). Special medical and logistic arrangements, priority and visual risk assessment and strict infection control precautions were implemented. Demographics, diagnosis, intravitreal injection history, medical history, ophthalmic examinations and optical coherence tomography data were collected and analyzed. Results: Intravitreal injections were successfully administered to 132 patients with diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and retinal vein occlusion. All logistic and transmission control measures were followed by the medical staff and patients with no incidents. No new exposures or COVID-19 positive cases were traced to our location or time of therapy. No complications related to the injections were recorded. The mean period of delay due to the lockdown from the original scheduled appointment was six weeks. Mean visual acuity significantly decreased from 20/55 before the lockdown to 20/70 after the lockdown, and mean central macular thickness significantly increased from 329 to 370 . Conclusion: The administration of intravitreal injection therapy during the COVID-19 lockdown under special safety precautions was feasible and successful.

However, little is known about long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 00893 (LINC00893) and its role in gastric cancer (GC). Herein we investigated its biological functions and molecular mechanism in GC. LINC00893 was decreased in GC tissues but significantly elevated in AGS cells after treatment with Nutlin-3. In GC patients, it was found that low expression of LINC00893 was correlated with tumor growth, metastasis and poor survival. Functionally, overexpression of LINC00893 suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00893 regulated the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins by binding to RNA binding fox-1 homolog 2 (RBFOX2) and promoting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation, thus suppressing the EMT and related functions of GC. In addition, the transcription factor p53 can regulate the expression of LINC00893 in an indirect way. Taken together, these results suggested that LINC00893 regulated by p53 repressed GC proliferation, migration and invasion by functioning as a binding site for RBFOX2 to regulate its stability and the expression of EMT-related proteins. LINC00893 acts as a tumor-inhibiting lncRNA that is induced by p53 in GC and regulates EMT by binding to RBFOX2, thus providing a novel experimental basis for the clinical treatment of GC.","output":"p53-Induced LINC00893 Regulates RBFOX2 Stability to Suppress Gastric Cancer Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are at risk of developing hypoxic respiratory failure and often require prolonged mechanical ventilation Indication and timing to perform tracheostomy is controversial in patients with COVID-19 Methods This was a single-institution retrospective review of tracheostomies performed on patients admitted for COVID-19 between April 8, 2020 and August 1, 2020 using a modified percutaneous tracheostomy technique to minimize hypoxia and aerosolization Results Twelve tracheostomies were performed for COVID-related respiratory failure Median patient age was 54 years (range: 36-76) and 9 (75%) were male Median time to tracheostomy was 17 days (range: 10-27), and 5 (42%) patients had failed attempts at extubation prior to tracheostomy There were no intraprocedural complications, including hypoxia Post-Tracheostomy bleeding was noted in two patients Eight (67%) patients have been discharged at the time of this study, and there were four patient deaths unrelated to tracheostomy placement No healthcare worker transmissions resulted from participating in the tracheostomy procedure Conclusions A modified percutaneous tracheostomy is feasible and can be safely performed in patients infected with COVID-19 Level of evidence Level V, case series ?","output":"Modified percutaneous tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fear of the disease outbreak news (DONs) has shocked commodity markets and raised the likelihood of economic uncertainty and recession globally.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all SARS-coV2-RNA-positive patients treated with tocilizumab or anakinra in Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Local experts developed and implemented criteria to define COVID19-CS. All variables were extracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS: At tocilizumab initiation (n = 52), 50 (96.2%) were intubated, and only 7 (13.5%) received concomitant corticosteroids. At anakinra initiation (n = 41), 23 (56.1%) were intubated, and all received concomitant corticosteroids. Fewer anakinra-treated patients died (n = 9, 22%) and more were extubated/never intubated (n = 26, 63.4%) compared to tocilizumab-treated patients (n = 24, 46.2% dead, n = 22, 42.3% extubated/never intubated). Patients who died had more severe sepsis and respiratory failure and met COVID-CS laboratory criteria longer (median = 3 days) compared to those extubated/never intubated (median = 1 day). After accounting for differences in disease severity at treatment initiation, this apparent superiority of anakinra over tocilizumab was no longer statistically significant (propensity score-adjusted hazards ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.18C1.20).

We aimed to understand eHealth literacy among a diverse sample of patients with cancer and discuss ways for health systems and cancer centers to ensure that all patients have access to high-quality care. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of patients with cancer and caregivers was conducted at an NCI-designated cancer center to assess access to the Internet, smartphone ownership, use of mobile apps, willingness to engage remotely with the health care team, and use of the patient portal. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were used to assess frequencies and significant differences between variables. RESULTS: Of 363 participants, 55% (n = 201) were female, 71% (n = 241) identified as non-Hispanic White, and 29% (n = 85) reported that their highest level of education was a high school diploma. Most (90%, n = 323) reported having access to the Internet and most (82%, n = 283) reported owning a smartphone. Younger patients or those with a college degree were significantly more likely to own a smartphone, access health information online, know how to download an app on their own, have an interest in communicating with their health care team remotely, or have an account on the electronic patient portal.

Objective: We, a group of psychology students experiencing these impacts, aim to provide an overview of the existing literature on prevention and intervention efforts to effectively reduce the development of, or suffering from, mental health problems in young adults (18-35) during the COVID-19 pandemic.Evidence Review: A rapid systematic review was conducted to identify studies focusing on the implementation of mental health interventions for young adults of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature was searched with Pubmed and Web of Science on June 17, 2021. The quality of each study was assessed by two reviewers with the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers. Findings: Of N = 76 records initially screened, eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Six applied web-based interventions, of which four were randomized controlled trials. Interventions were based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches (n = 5), mindfulness practices, logo-autobiography, and synergistic thinking methods. The interventions varied in length from single sessions to multiple sessions over a period of up to 10 weeks. All interventions were effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as stress with small to medium effect sizes and a symptom reduction up to 78.9%. With only three studies being of high quality, the overall quality was low.Conclusions and Relevance: Research on mental health interventions for young adults in the general population during the pandemic is sparse. However, all interventions resulted in symptoms reductions and thus have been shown to be effective ways of counteracting the potential development of mental disorders during times of uncertainty, with high levels of stress, such as during a pandemic. Therefore, we propose a concept for an innovative and cost-effective web-based platform to structure and raise awareness for existing measures.","output":"The need for accessible mental health interventions for young adults in the COVID-19 pandemic: A student psychologists perspective and rapid systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Government leaders who want to promote a collective response to disrupting events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, need to foster a shared understanding of the crisis through effective communication. However, the tone and content of communication varies across and within countries and led to conflicting results in terms of collective sensemaking. To understand how government leaders' messages shape emotional and cognitive responses of citizens, we designed a 2x2 vignette experiment in which we manipulate the framing (pessimistic vs. optimistic) and content of the message (specific vs. general) delivered by a political leader. Results from 436 participants showed that while the tone of leader's messages has significant implications for the levels of anxiety and evaluation of the government's truthfulness and its overall response to the crisis, the content of the leader's message matters less. Furthermore, these effects were particularly experienced by women and left-leaning participants. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the leader's communication strategies on influencing the public's emotional reactions, as well as the perceptions of government effectiveness in dealing with the crisis.","output":"Better safe than sorry: leadership sensemaking in the time of COVID-19/ Mejor prevenir que curar: el sensemaking del liderazgo en los tiempos de COVID-19/ Melhor prevenir do que remediar: o sensemaking da lideran?a nos tempos da COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Iron is an essential nutrient, and iron supplementation has been shown to reduce the incidence of abomasal bloat in lambs. Additionally, iron deficiency is linked to pica, which may increase uptake of Eimeria oocysts. Coccidiosis in sheep, caused by Eimeria spp., is an important infection, leading to reduced welfare and economic losses. The aims of our study were to investigate: (1) the use of iron supplementation in Norwegian sheep flocks using a questionnaire survey, and (2) whether iron supplementation reduced excretion of Eimeria oocysts and increased the growth rates of young lambs. RESULTS: A questionnaire regarding the use of iron supplementation, sent to all members of the Norwegian Sheep Recording System (n = 4993), showed that 152/1823 farmers iron-supplemented lambs, either orally (56.7%) or by injection (43.3%). The main purpose of supplementation was to prevent abomasal bloat (38.4%), coccidiosis (9.3%), or both (27.8%). In the field study, 102 twin lambs from five flocks were included: one twin (treated) received 600 mg of gleptoferron subcutaneously within 3 days of birth, whereas the control was given saline. McMaster analysis of individual faecal samples obtained at weekly intervals (n = 4 per lamb, starting at turnout) showed no significant difference in oocyst excretion between treatment groups at any sampling, except for one flock 14 days after turnout. Mean growth rates, measured at iron injection, 21 days after turnout, and in the autumn, differed significantly between treated and untreated lambs from iron injection to 21 days after turnout, however, no difference in growth rates was observed in the overall period from iron injection to autumn. Blood analysis suggested that the controls were at risk of developing iron deficiency anaemia during the housed period, but signs of anaemia were not observed. CONCLUSION: Iron supplementation of lambs was used by 8.3% of the farmers responding to the questionnaire, mainly with the intention to prevent abomasal bloat, coccidiosis, or both. The field trial results indicate that iron supplementation of young lambs do not reduce oocyst excretion and only induced a transitory increase in weight gain. However further studies, including more flocks and possibly repeated iron injections, would provide more definitive information.

Comparison of the results of calculations of the epidemic spread, as well as the values of the seven-day incidence values with the corresponding observation data, shows their good correspondence for each of the selected age groups. The greatest influence on the overall spread of the epidemic is in the 20-40 age groups. The relatively low level of vaccination and the high intensity of contact in these age groups contributes to the emergence of new waves of the epidemic, which is especially active when the virus mutates and the lockdown conditions are relaxed. The intensity of the epidemic in the 90+ age group has some peculiarities compared to other groups, which may be explained by differences in contact patterns among individuals in this age group compared to others. Approximate ratios for estimating mortality as a function of the intensity of infection for individual age groups are provided.

The sample is based on 64 Belt and Road (BRI) countries from 2003C2018. Pair-wise correlation results indicate that human development, health expenditure and age structure showed a positive relationship with sustainable development. Two-step System-GMM direct effect outcomes are mixed and reveal that human development, health expenditure per capita, age structure, governance index and population size have a positive impact on sustainable development. On the other hand, e-government, government size, and globalization showed negative effects on SD. Apart from that, the moderating channel of regional integration (RI), interaction term with human development and health expenditure, showed a significant and positive impact on sustainable development. However, age structure interaction with regional integration showed a negative impact on SD. Other socio-economic factors, i.e., governance index and population contribute positively towards SD. It can be concluded that the dynamic nature of sustainable development is positive and the net present value is increasing. Therefore, BRI countries are on the sustainable path from 2003C2018, as suggested by economic and social welfare theory. The integration of BRI can be labeled as an entrance to successful sustainable development.

Failure in its proper operations can seriously impact regional economic development, which is why it is important to evaluate network robustness. Previous analyses of robustness have mainly been conducted with an unweighted approach. In the development of air transport, however, the demand for route configuration has gradually decreased, while the demand for flight adjustments has increased. Consequently, the aviation network has developed unevenly, so adhering to a uniform approach for evaluating network robustness may lead to inaccurate results. Therefore, we examined which centrality sequence is the most sensitive to network robustness in both unweighted and weighted approaches. The air transport network selected for the case study comprised the six subregions of the Eurasian landmass of the Belt and Road region. The study results showed the following: (a) in the network constructed as an unweighted one, betweenness, and degree centrality had higher priorities in preserving network functionalities than eigenvector and closeness centrality;(b) in the network constructed as a weighted one, recursive power had a higher priority in preserving network functionalities than recursive centrality;and (c) no particular centrality measurement had a significant advantage in representing the totality of robustness.

After the introduction of a legal quota for university bodies, for instance, female representation in decision-making bodies increased significantly within a short period of time. However, this did not lead to a cultural change or the abolishment of barriers to womens careers. Research has attributed this paradoxical situation to a lack of reflexivity because the current gender equality policies do not force institutions or individuals to challenge traditional practices, which are perceived to be merit-based and therefore gender neutral. To overcome this paradox, the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science, and Research launched a policy process aimed at strengthening gender competence in all higher education processesmanagement, administration, teaching, and research. This paper provides a critical discussion of the Austrian quota regulation and its implementation.

We identified four themes related to leadership and management of pandemic PPE supply chains, (i) Leadership and management learning for pandemic PPE supply chain management, (ii) Inhibitors of PPE supply chain resilience during a pandemic, (iii) Facilitators employed to manage the immediate impacts of PPE supply chain demands during a pandemic,and (iv) Facilitators proposed to ensure longer term resilience of PPE supply chains during pandemics Our study suggests there has been limited leadership and management learning for PPE supply chains from previous pandemics, however there has been extensive learning through the COVID-19 pandemic. Lessons included the importance of planning, the significance of collaboration and relationship building. Resilience of PPE supply chains was reported to be dependent on multiple levels from individuals to organisation level and also interdependent on (i) sustainability, (ii) the practise of PPE and (iii) long term environmental impact of PPE suggesting the need, long term, to move to a circular economy approach.","output":"What Have We Learnt About the Sourcing of Personal Protective Equipment During Pandemics?

OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical outcomes, cost, and cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation strategies on college campuses. DESIGN: The Clinical and Economic Analysis of COVID-19 interventions (CEACOV) model, a dynamic microsimulation model, was used to examine alternative mitigation strategies. The CEACOV model tracks infections accrued by students and faculty, accounting for community transmissions. DATA SOURCES: Data from published literature were used to obtain parameters related to COVID-19 and contact-hours. TARGET POPULATION: Undergraduate students and faculty at U.S. colleges. TIME HORIZON: One semester (105 days). PERSPECTIVE: Modified societal. INTERVENTION: COVID-19 mitigation strategies, including social distancing, masks, and routine laboratory screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Infections among students and faculty per 5000 students and per 1000 faculty, isolation days, tests, costs, cost per infection prevented, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Among students, mitigation strategies reduced COVID-19 cases from 3746 with no mitigation to 493 with extensive social distancing and masks, and further to 151 when laboratory testing was added among asymptomatic persons every 3 days. Among faculty, these values were 164, 28, and 25 cases, respectively. Costs ranged from about $0.4 million for minimal social distancing to about $0.9 million to $2.1 million for strategies involving laboratory testing ($10 per test), depending on testing frequency. Extensive social distancing with masks cost $170 per infection prevented ($49 200 per QALY) compared with masks alone. Adding routine laboratory testing increased cost per infection prevented to between $2010 and $17 210 (cost per QALY gained, $811 400 to $2 804 600). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were most sensitive to test costs. LIMITATION: Data are from multiple sources. CONCLUSION: Extensive social distancing with a mandatory mask-wearing policy can prevent most COVID-19 cases on college campuses and is very cost-effective. Routine laboratory testing would prevent 96% of infections and require low-cost tests to be economically attractive.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the global point estimate of deaths and risk factors for patients who are admitted to ICUs with severe COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched up to August 1, 2020. Pooled prevalence of participant characteristics, clinical features, and outcome data was calculated with the use of random effects models. Subgroup analyses were based on geographic distribution, study type, quality assessment, sample size, end date, and patient disposition. RESULTS: Forty-five studies with 16,561 patients from 17 countries across four continents were included. Patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to ICUs had a mean age of 62.6 years (95% CI, 60.4-64.7). Common comorbidities included hypertension (49.5%; 95% CI, 44.9-54.0) and diabetes mellitus (26.6%; 95% CI, 22.7-30.8). More than three-quarters of cases experienced the development of ARDS (76.1%; 95% CI, 65.7-85.2). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 67.7% (95% CI, 59.1-75.7) of case, vasopressor support in 65.9% (95% CI, 52.4-78.4) of cases, renal replacement therapy in 16.9% (95% CI, 12.1-22.2) of cases, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 6.4% (95% CI, 4.1-9.1) of cases. The duration of ICU and hospital admission was 10.8 days (95% CI, 9.3-18.4) and 19.1 days (95% CI, 16.3-21.9), respectively, with in-hospital mortality rate of 28.1% (95% CI, 23.4-33.0; I2 = 96%). No significant subgroup effect was observed.

The widespread use of quarantine had the desired impact of controlling the epidemic, although it caused many psychological consequences. To date, compliance of the Italian public with voluntary home quarantine has been very high, but little is known about the impact of psychological health on sociodemographic categories during the quarantine. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in specific sociodemographic categories during the COVID-19 quarantine lockdown and the potential factors that contribute to, or mitigate, these effects. In the very early stage of the nationwide lockdown, 3,672 quarantined Italian adult residents (65% females, ranging from 18 to 85 years) participated in a web-based cross-sectional survey, including measures of depressive symptoms, which were measured by the Teate depression inventory, and state anxiety levels. The overall prevalence was 27.8% for moderate and 9.3% for severe levels of depressive symptoms. A generalized logistic model was used to identify the factors associated with mental health problems. Among these factors, sociodemographic variables (e.g., sex, age, employment status) and adherence to quarantine guidelines were analyzed. Females, younger people, students, singles, residents in northern Italy, people who were reluctant to adhere to quarantine guidelines, and people less worried about being infected with COVID-19 were at high risk of developing depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic, also after controlling for state anxiety. These findings showed that public levels of depressive symptoms did not increase the greater likelihood of being infected. Our study suggested that the monitoring of psychological outcomes for outbreaks could identify groups at higher risk of psychological morbidities due to the current pandemic in order to target future psychological interventions for implementation.","output":"Italians on the Age of COVID-19: The Self-Reported Depressive Symptoms Through Web-Based Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Establishing accurate symptomatology associated with novel diseases such as COVID-19 is a crucial component of early identification and screening.

The appeal of microfluidics for this procedure is partly based on its combination of small size and its ability to process very small liquid volumes, thus minimizing the use of possibly expensive reagents. However, real-world samples are often large and incompatible with the input port and the m-scale channels of a microfluidic device, and very small liquid volumes can be inappropriate in analyzing low concentrations of target analytes. It can be a worthy challenge to take a raw sample, introduce it into a microfluidics-based system, and perform the sample preparation, which may include separation and concentration of the target analytes, so that one can benefit from the reagent-conserving small volumes and obtain the correct answer when finally implementing the assay of interest.","output":"Sample preparation: the weak link in microfluidics-based biodetection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Survivors of acute pancreatitis (AP) have shorter overall survival and increased incidence of new-onset cardiovascular, respiratory, liver and renal disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer compared with the general population, but the mechanisms that explain this are yet to be elucidated.

Objectives: To conduct a within-city analysis of spatial variations in COVID-19 incidence and the estimated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lung lining fluid attributable to fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ?2.5 m [PM(2.5)]). Methods: Sporadic and outbreak-related COVID-19 case counts, testing data, population data, and sociodemographic data for 140 neighborhoods were obtained from the City of Toronto. ROS estimates were based on a mathematical model of ROS generation in lung lining fluid in response to iron and copper in PM(2.5). Spatial variations in long-term average ROS were predicted using a land-use regression model derived from measurements of iron and copper in PM(2.5). Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression models adjusting for covariates identified using a directed acyclic graph and accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Measurements and Main Results: A significant positive association was observed between neighborhood-level ROS and COVID-19 incidence (incidence rate ratio = 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.01C1.15 per interquartile range ROS).

A retrospective study was carried out to evaluate outcomes of treatment in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to a COVID-19 special hospital in Wuhan, China. A total of 75 severe and critical COVID-19 patients were admitted and treated with immunomodulation as the main strategy combined with anti-inflammatory therapy and appropriate anticoagulation. Leukocyte levels in patients with 7-14 days of onset to diagnosis were significantly lower than in those with >14 days. Higher levels of globulin and D-dimer and lower lymphocyte levels were found in the older age group (>65 years) than in the middle-aged group (50-64 years). Patients with comorbidity had higher levels of inflammatory indicators. After treatment, 65 (86.67%) patients were cured, 7 (9.33%) had improved, and 3 (4.00%) had died. Median hospitalization duration was 23 days. Fatal cases showed continuously increased levels of globulin, dehydrogenase (LDH), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), D-dimer, and cytokines during treatment. Time from onset to diagnosis, age, and comorbidity are important influencing factors on treatment effects. The occurrence of immunosuppression, cytokine storm, and thrombosis may be an important cause of death in severely infected cases.

However, for FA and other BMF syndromes, insufficient HSC numbers with functional defects results in delayed hematopoietic recovery and increased risk of graft failure. We and others previously identified the adaptor protein LNK (SH2B3) as a critical negative regulator of murine HSC homeostasis. However, whether LNK controls human HSCs has not been studied. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of LNK via lentiviral expression of miR30-based short hairpin RNAs results in robust expansion of transplantable human HSCs that provided balanced multilineage reconstitution in primary and secondary mouse recipients. Importantly, LNK depletion enhances cytokine-mediated JAK/STAT activation in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Moreover, we demonstrate that LNK depletion expands primary HSPCs associated with FA. In xenotransplant, engraftment of FANCD2-depleted FA-like HSCs was markedly improved by LNK inhibition. Finally, targeting LNK in primary bone marrow HSPCs from FA patients enhanced their colony forming potential in vitro.

METHODS: We performed retrospective evaluation of patients who started mtTKI treatment between 2016 and 2018, with a comparison patient cohort treated with single-target tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stTKIs). SMF amount for each gastrointestinal tract segment (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, terminal ileum, right colon, left colon) was scored as follows: 0 = none; 1 = low amount (<2 mm thick); 2 = high amount (>2 mm layer). For each CT, segment scores were aggregated to create an SMF index (SMFI). Maximal increase in SMFI between pretreatment and posttreatment CTs was documented. SMF a3 was defined as positive. RESULTS: Forty patients treated with mtTKIs and 23 patients receiving stTKIs were included. Maximal increase in SMFI during treatment was 0-1 in 56/63 patients (89%) and 3-6 in 7/63 patients (11%). All patients with positive SMFI received mtTKIs compared to 0 patients treated with stTKIs (17.5% vs. 0%; p = 0.04). mtTKI treatment was associated with higher incidence of nausea/vomiting (4/7) and diarrhea (4/7) when positive SMF was noted, as compared to patients with negative SMF (6/33 patients each; p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal tract SMF deposition occurs in a considerable proportion of patients treated with mtTKIs with association to abdominal symptoms. This may be unique to mtTKIs and was not found in patients receiving stTKIs.","output":"Association between multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors and changes in CT appearance of submucosal fat in the gastrointestinal tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent spread of the disease COVID-19 became classified as a pandemic in March of 2020, leading to global safety measures introduced to limit the impact of the virus. This combination of safety measures has become commonly referred to as lockdown. The associated industry and lifestyle changes led to reductions in the anthropogenic emission of atmospheric pollutants such as black carbon (BC), which is transported from the mid-latitudes into the Arctic during the winter and spring. Measurements of BC and other anthropogenic pollutants are of increasing importance in the Arctic due to the rapid warming observed there in the past few decades. It is believed that BC has a significant role in this warming, and so understanding the Arctic's response to reduced BC emissions at lower latitudes will provide insight into how future changes might mitigate further warming. Reductions in BC have been reported worldwide, and so in this study, the impact of these reductions on BC concentrations at the High Arctic site Villum Research Station was investigated. The effect was examined from March 2020, around when global lockdowns began, to June 2020, when the Arctic haze period ended and BC levels were once again low. Firstly, the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) was used to assess this impact on BC concentrations by adjusting global anthropogenic pollution emission inventories to simulate those observed during the lockdown period and comparing the results to a similar model run with standard emission inventories. Secondly, equivalent BC data from an aethalometer at Villum Research Station were analysed, comparing the concentrations during the lockdown period to both aethalometer data from previous years and DEHM results from the lockdown period. It was found that when adjusted DEHM emission inventories were introduced from the 1st of March, the model predicted a reduction in BC concentrations beginning on the 10th of March and reached a 10% reduction by the 1st of April. This reduction fluctuated around 10% until the end of the Arctic haze period. Aethalometer data did not show any significant change from previous years, and no concentration reduction could be concluded from its comparison with DEHM results. This is likely because the predicted reduction of 10% is smaller than both the inter-annual and intra-annual variability of measured BC concentrations at Villum.","output":"The effect of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown on atmospheric black carbon levels in northeastern Greenland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The changes in the international economic system and in geopolitical power relations over the last decades have had a decisive impact on the ways in which states are now involved in shaping the economy.

High concentrations of royal jelly have an antibacterial effect, which may potentially overcome antibacterial resistance. However, in some cases, antibiotic tolerance can occur due to prolonged stress of low-dose antibacterial agents. This study aimed to investigate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of royal jelly on bacterial growth, pyocyanin production, and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. Methods: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and clinical isolates were cultured in a royal jelly-containing medium to test the antibacterial activity. Pyocyanin production was observed by measuring the absorbance at 690 nm after 36 h culture and determined using extinction coefficient 4310 M-1 cm-1. Static microtiter plate biofilm assay performed to detect the biofilm formation, followed by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Royal jelly effectively inhibited the viability of both strains from a concentration of 25%. The highest production of pyocyanin was observed in the subinhibitory concentration group 6.25%, which gradually decreased along with the decrease of royal jelly concentration. Results of one-way ANOVA tests differed significantly in pyocyanin production of the two strains between the royal jelly groups. Tukey HSD test showed concentrations of 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125% significantly increased pyocyanin production of ATCC 10145, and the concentrations of 12.5% and 6.25% significantly increased production of the clinical isolates. Concentrations of 12.5% and 6.125% significantly induced biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145, in line with the results of the SEM analysis. Conclusions: Royal jelly concentrations of 25% or higher can inhibit bacterial growth; however, subinhibitory concentrations could increase pyocyanin production and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa.

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. METHODS: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. RESULTS: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.

Using single cell RNASeq, we found that mouse taste receptor cells (STRCs) have a gene expression signature reminiscent of Microfold (M) cells, a central player in immune surveillance in the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) such as those in the Peyers patch and tonsils. Administration of Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 11 (TNFSF11, also known as RANKL), a growth factor required for differentiation of M cells dramatically increased M cell proliferation and marker gene expression in the taste papillae and in cultured taste organoids from wild type (WT) mice. Taste papillae and organoids from knockout mice lacking Spib (SpibKO), a RANKL-regulated transcription factor required for M cell development and regeneration on the other hand, failed to respond to RANKL. Taste papillae from SpibKO mice also showed reduced expression of NF-B signaling pathway components and proinflammatory cytokines and attracted fewer immune cells. However, lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of cytokines was strongly upregulated in SpibKO mice compared to their WT counterparts. Like M cells, STRCs from WT but not SpibKO mice readily took up fluorescently labeled microbeads, a proxy for microbial transcytosis. The proportion of STRCs and other taste cell subtypes are unaltered in SpibKO mice; however, they displayed increased attraction to sweet and umami taste stimuli.

Therefore, two different rRNA depletion and exclusion protocols, RiboMinus? technology and non-rRNA binding hexanucleotides, were applied to the microarray sample processing and the outcome was compared with those of the sequence-independent amplification protocol. This study concludes that the two procedures, described to deplete or exclude rRNA, have negligible effect on the microarrays detection and analysis and might only in combination with further techniques result in a significant enhancement of sensitivity.

Machine learning as a service application does not only require accurate predictions but also ensures data privacy and security.

The scalar product is the most common operation that used in the deep neural network so that our proposed protocol can be used to allow a data owner to send her data to a cloud service that hosts a deep model to get a prediction of input data. We show that the cloud service is capable of applying the neural network to make predictions without knowledge of the user's original data. We demonstrate our proposed protocol on an image benchmark dataset MNIST and an real life application dataset - COVID-19. The results show that our model can achieve 98.8% accuracy on MNIST and 95.02% on COVID-19 dataset with very simple network architecture and nearly no reduction in accuracy when compares with the original model.

SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a betacoronavirus. Nucleocapsid protein (NP) is evolutionary high protein homologies and solid structure protein for SARS-CoV-2 detection as opposed to other proteins, that aren\`t reliable as a single viral antigen during diagnostics methods. The viral RNA can be detected from nasal and pharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage samples by PCR assay. However, the wrong collection of samples can lead to false-negative diagnosis and have dangerous consequences at this stage of pandemic. One of efficient and accurate methodological approaches for the screening of pathogens are serological assays. Aim. Evaluation and comparison of the sensitivity of invented DIA?-SARS-CoV-2-Ag-R enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based test system and commercial rapid tests, which detect the viral antigen of SARS-CoV-2. Methods. We carried out a comparison of DIA?-SARS-CoV-2-Ag-R and existed commercial test systems, which are used to detect the antigen of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Rapid tests are intended for nasopharyngeal swabs, but we proposed a protein of our own manufacture C recombinant NP as a calibrator. The detection limit was calibrated by standard CFAR #100982 NIBSC, UK. We had determined levels of NP (1400, 900, 750, 640 and 280 pg/mL) that we used as a sample for the rapid tests. The COVID-19 Ag Rapid Tests were performed according to the manufactures instructions at room temperature. Results. DIA?-SARS-CoV-2-Ag-R detected 10 pg/mL of in-house standard of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 NP. The positive results were observed using 1400, 900, 750 pg/mL, while 640 and 280 pg/mL samples were performed as negative in ABBOTT-PanBio test. The rapid tests manufactured by BU, BIOTIME, Core Technology, SD BIOSENSOR and Turklab showed positive results only in 1400 pg/mL concentration. NP of lower levels was detected as a negative sample. The LEPU MEDICAL test was evaluated as positive sample using 900 pg/mL. The rapid test manufactured by Green Cross Medical Science Corp. showed negative results for all levels of NP. It can mean that the sensitivity of test is lower and demands higher level of antigen to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. The study presented an excellent analytical sensitivity of DIA?-SARS-CoV-2-Ag-R against commercial Antigen rapid tests. Thus, invented ELISA test system can be recommended for widespread usage for detection and confirmation of acute stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ? 2021, Zabolotny Institute of Microbiology and Virology, NAS of Ukraine.

During the pandemic, their well-being and mental health are being shaped by online learning, home confinement, and uncertainty about their future. The overall aim of this study was to examine the frequency of three addictive-like behaviors (i.e., eating, social media, and online gaming) among university students, and their associations with mental health and self-regulation. METHODS: This study was an online-based cross-sectional study involving 178 students from a public university in Sarawak. They were asked to complete a set of questionnaires that were used to measure substance, cigarette, and alcohol use, psychological distress, anxiety towards COVID-19, self-regulation, as well as food, online gaming, and social media addiction. RESULTS: There was a significant increment in the duration of time spent on online gaming and social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of substance use was low, with 3.9% and 12% of the students reported using cigarettes and alcohol, respectively in the last 30 days. Significant positive correlations were found between the three addictive-like behaviors (food, gaming, and social media addiction) and psychological distress. Significant negative correlations were found between self-regulation and the three addictive-like behaviors as well as psychological distress. CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary efforts are needed to mitigate potential pre-existing and potential worsening addictive behaviors among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics and natural disasters.","output":"Addictive Behaviours among University Students in Malaysia during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of mirtazapine, a tetracyclic antidepressant, as monotherapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS This multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between April 2006 and November 2010 at the Tuscaloosa and Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Alabama. US military veterans who met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 39) or mirtazapine (n = 39) titrated up to 45 mg/d for an 8-week double-blind period followed by an 8-week open-label phase of mirtazapine treatment. The primary outcome efficacy measure was the Structured Interview for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (SIP). Secondary measures included other measures of PTSD, depression, and sleep. Analyses of treatment groups involved mixed-model procedures using a random intercept to test the hypotheses that mirtazapine would be more effective than placebo in reducing symptoms of PTSD and depression and improving quality of sleep. RESULTS Seventy-eight participants were randomized with 61 completing the 8-week controlled phase and 48 completing the open-label phase. No significant differences were observed between groups on the primary outcome of SIP scores during the controlled phase (P = .418). In secondary outcomes, significant improvements per the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale were found for the mirtazapine group compared to the placebo group (P = .041). The 8-week open-label phase demonstrated significant symptom improvement in SIP total score (P = .0003) and in scores on the SIP re-experiencing (P = .0007), avoidance (P = .0309), and hyperarousal (P = .0014) subscales. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of adverse events between groups. CONCLUSIONS This study did not show efficacy of mirtazapine monotherapy in the treatment of PTSD.

Methods: : Before the coronavirus outbreak, one-to-one interviews were used, and during the epidemic period, one-to-one question-and-answer telephone surveys were used. The contents of the survey included the hours of staying at home, psychological and emotional state, tobacco use, and willingness to quit smoking. This study adopted a 1:1 propensity score matching method, with education level, whether to take smoking cessation drugs, and whether to participate in regular follow-ups as matching conditions to control the mixed influence of the content of smoking cessation intervention services on the analysis results before the pandemic. After matching, the chi-square statistics, Fisher exact probability method, and the Spearman rank correlation test were used to analyse factors such as changes in smoking behaviour, hours of staying at home, and mental states. Results: : A total of 197 pairs were successfully matched, of which 197 cases had successfully quit smoking before the epidemic, and 197 cases had not completely quit smoking. The changes in smoking volume before and during the epidemic of the incomplete quitters were affected by anxiety, calmness, mental and emotional states similar to usual, other reasons for smoking such as addiction and habits, and their willingness to quit during the epidemic (all P <0.05). The changes in daily smoking volume before and after the epidemic among the ex-smokers were statistically significant in the distribution of relapse thoughts, anxiety, depression, and other reasons for smoking, such as depression and boredom, idle pastimes, addiction and habits( P <0.05). Among the people who did not completely quit smoking before the epidemic, the idea of relapse was affected by depression, calm mental and emotional state, reasons for smoking that relieve boredom and leisure, and the willingness to quit smoking during the epidemic ( P <0.05). And there is a negative correlation between the willingness to quit smoking during the epidemic and the time at home each day( rs =-0.237, P< 0.05). Conclusions: : During the COVID-19, the time at home of the test patients who quit smoking has a certain influence on their willingness to quit smoking. The psychological and emotional changes and idleness at home have a greater impact on the changes in their smoking behaviour and relapse thoughts. It is recommended that family members provide more support and encourage and supervise to help smokers reduce smoking. In the period of normalization of epidemic prevention and control, the smoking cessation services provided should guide the quitters on smoking cessation behavioural therapy, as well as guidance on the relief of negative emotions, and help quitters to break the relationship between existing smoking habits, negative emotions, and environmental temptation situations.

Methods: Case managers began to cancel all in-person services and offer Veterans Affairs (VA) video connect services to their home. Patients with video access scheduled a home VA video connect telerehabilitation evaluation and therapy assessment. Patients who did not have video access waited to schedule a future in-person low vision appointment (postpandemic). Results: Of the in-person canceled appointments, 54% who scheduled the new home telerehabilitation evaluation were delayed on average 25 calendar days. Patients who waited for in-person low vision care were delayed on average 98, 138, or 153 calendar days. Of the 56 new patients referred for low vision optometry services during this 4-month period (COVID-19), 91% scheduled home low vision ocular telerehabilitation evaluations without delay; 5% waited until in-person clinics were open; and 4% waited until rural VA's and community-based outpatient centers were open.

In anaerobic environments, carbohydrates are converted into volatile fatty acids and alcohols. These can be used as building blocks in biotechnological or chemical processes, e.g., to produce bioplastics. In this study, xylose fermentation by mixed microbial cultures was investigated and compared with glucose under the same conditions. The product spectrum obtained with both substrates was comparable. It was observed that, in the case of xylose, a higher fraction of the carbon was converted into catabolic products (butyrate, acetate, and ethanol) and the biomass yield was approximately 20% lower than on glucose, 0.16 versus 0.21 Cmol X/Cmol S. This lower yield is likely related to the need of an extra ATP during xylose uptake. When submitted to a pulse of glucose, the population cultivated on xylose could instantaneously convert the glucose.

Moreover, the results of some recent studies about the role of air pollution on the spread and lethality of the novel coronavirus suggest that air contaminants could be also transmission pathway of the virus. On the other hand, indirect transmission of the virus cannot be discarded. Among many sources of indirect transmission, there is the contamination of inert/inanimate surfaces. This manuscript was aimed at reviewing the scientific literature currently available in PubMed and Scopus. The results of the reviewed studies point out that SARS-CoV-2 can last on different surfaces from hours to a few days. However, rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation is possible by applying commonly available chemicals and biocides on inanimate surfaces. Consequently, although the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces can represent a potential route of the transmission, appropriate disinfection measures should reduce the possibilities of transmission of the coronavirus, and hence, significantly decrease the risks of COVID-19.","output":"Contamination of inert surfaces by SARS-CoV-2: persistence, stability and infectivity.

Multinomial logistic regression showed that exposure to the claims was significantly associated with increased tobacco use (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.20) in current tobacco users (N=280) and increased alcohol use (OR 4.16, 95% CI 2.00 to 8.67) in current drinkers (N=722), adjusting for sex, age, education level, alcohol/tobacco use status, home isolation, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and survey method. CONCLUSION: Our results first showed that exposure to health misinformation that smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19 was associated with self-reported increases in tobacco and alcohol consumption in Chinese during the pandemic.","output":"Exposure to health misinformation about COVID-19 and increased tobacco and alcohol use: a population-based survey in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ARTIC Network provides a common resource of PCR primer sequences and recommendations for amplifying SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The initial tiling strategy was developed with the reference genome Wuhan-01, and subsequent iterations have addressed areas of low amplification and sequence drop out. Recently, a new version (V4) was released, based on new variant genome sequences, in response to the realization that some V3 primers were located in regions with key mutations. Herein, we compare the performance of the ARTIC V3 and V4 primer sets with a matched set of 663 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples sequenced with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. We observe general improvements in sequencing depth and quality, and improved resolution of the SNP causing the D950N variation in the spike protein. Importantly, we also find nearly universal presence of spike protein substitution G142D in Delta-lineage samples. Due to the prior release and widespread use of the ARTIC V3 primers during the initial surge of the Delta variant, it is likely that the G142D amino acid substitution is substantially underrepresented among early Delta variant genomes deposited in public repositories. In addition to the improved performance of the ARTIC V4 primer set, this study also illustrates the importance of the primer scheme in downstream analyses. Importance ARTIC Network primers are commonly used by laboratories worldwide to amplify and sequence SARS-CoV-2 present in clinical samples. As new variants have evolved and spread, it was found that the V3 primer set poorly amplified several key mutations. In this report, we compare the results of sequencing a matched set of samples with the V3 and V4 primer sets. We find that adoption of the ARTIC V4 primer set is critical for accurate sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike region. The absence of metadata describing the primer scheme used will negatively impact the downstream use of publicly available SARS-Cov-2 sequencing reads and assembled genomes.","output":"Analysis of the ARTIC version 3 and version 4 SARS-CoV-2 primers and their impact on the detection of the G142D amino acid substitution in the spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly affected France and has put a strain on its health professionals. As documented by literature, health professionals are at higher risk than the general population regarding their mental welfare. The study's objective was to measure the anxiety levels and its determinants of general practitioners of a French department during the first COVID-19 pandemic containment. Materials and Methods A survey through a self-completion questionnaire was sent to 250 general practitioners of the Bouches-du-Rh?ne department. Their anxiety state was measured using the Spielberg validated questionnaire the STAI-Y. Their experience, work organizations, and doctor/patient relationship were measured by ad hoc items developed during a focus group of five general practitioners. Results Of the 60 general practitioners included in the survey, nearly 40% had high to very high levels of anxiety. The determinants of this anxiety were the female gender, the unsatisfactory working conditions, the constrains required to work reorganization (consultations and waiting room), and the worry of not being able to respond to the fears and questions of patients, thus a lower decision latitude in their work. Conclusion This survey documented the levels of general practitioners anxiety, as well as the determinants of this anxiety. Physicians offered a unanimous opinion of their general feeling of \\"disorganization and loneliness\\". General practitioners have demonstrated great adaptability and flexibility despite the difficulties, which has caused them major anxiety. This pandemic's resultant experiences can help better understand the vulnerability of caregivers to mental anguish/stress in order to strengthen primary prevention strategies.","output":"General

It is a respiratory illness caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was initially reported in late December 2019. In a span of 6 months, this pandemic spread across the globe leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Soon after the identification of the causative virus, questions concerning the impact of environmental factors on the dissemination and transmission of the virus, its persistence in environmental matrices, and infectivity potential begin to emerge. As the environmental factors could have far-reaching consequences on infection dissemination and severity, it is essential to understand the linkage between these factors and the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to improve our current understanding over this topic, the present article summarizes topical and substantial observations made regarding the influences of abiotic environmental factors such as climate, temperature, humidity, wind speed, air, and water quality, solid surfaces/interfaces, frozen food, and biotic factors like age, sex, gender, blood type, population density, behavioural characteristics, etc. on the transmission, persistence, and infectivity of this newly recognized SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further, the potential pathways of virus transmission that could pose risk to population health have been discussed, and the critical areas have been identified which merits urgent research for the assessment and management of the COVID-19 outbreak.

COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020. For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age. This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging. Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19. One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity. Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase. Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication. Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment. Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts. As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease.","output":"COVID-19 and chronological aging: senolytics and other anti-aging drugs for the treatment or prevention of corona virus infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: New South Wales (NSW) correctional system houses 30% of prisoners in Australia and at this time has only had a single documented case of COVID-19 amongst its prisoner population.

Methods A cross-sectional survey study was done to investigate the lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia from August to September 2020. A pre-designed questionnaire was used for data collection and distributed online through social media. The questionnaire included items about sleep patterns, dietary habits, physical activity, employment status, recreation activities, use of social media, and screen time before and during the pandemic. Results A total of 338 adults with a median age of 40 years participated in the study. During the pandemic, employment, smoking decreased significantly (53.3 vs. 55.6%, p<0.001 & 15.7% vs. 18.3%, p=0.049) with significant increases in daily intake of fruits or vegetables (47% to 60.2%, p<0.001), caffeinated beverages (seven or more times caffeine, 3% vs. 0.9%, p<0.001), and water (more than eight water cups daily, 18.4 vs. 11.9, p<0.001). Overweight group increased significantly from 28.5% to 32% (p=0.009). Sleeping more than nine hours increased significantly from 8.3% to 21.8% (p<0.001) with increasing sleeping aids from 11.6% to 15.7% (p<0.001). Both the screen and the social media times increased significantly for six or more hours daily (14.8% vs. 35.3% and 9.5% vs. 28.2% respectively, p=<0.001 for both).

At the current study visit, 99.3% (n=692) had received at least one vaccine dose and 93.1% (n=649) had received at least three vaccine doses. All vaccinated individuals had detectable anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (median AU/ml [IQR]: 13891 [8505 - 23543]), indicating strong protection against severe COVID-19.

The usual treatment of hypercapnia is to increase ventilation. During the recent surge of COVID-19, respiratory acidosis unresponsive to increased mechanical ventilatory support was common. Increasing mechanical ventilation comes at the expense of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise from increasing positive end-expiratory pressures or minute ventilation. Treating acute respiratory acidemia with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial. RECENT FINDINGS: There are no randomized controlled trials of administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidemia. A recent review concluded that alkali therapy for mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis might be useful but was based on the conflicting and not conclusive literature regarding metabolic acidosis. This strategy should not be extrapolated to treatment of respiratory acidemia. Low tidal volume ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has beneficial effects associated with permissive hypercapnia. Whether the putative benefits will be negated by administration of alkali is not known. Hypercapnic acidosis is well tolerated, with few adverse effects as long as tissue perfusion and oxygenation are maintained.

We aimed to explore the role of the lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 in pneumonia and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The expression of KCNQ1OT1, FOXM1, and miR-370-3p was detected in the serum of 24 children with pneumonia and in 24 healthy controls. Normal human embryonic lung-derived diploid fibroblasts (WI-38 cells) were stimulated with LPS (10 g/mL) to simulate the cellular model of pneumonia, and cell viability, apoptosis, and inflammation were analysed. Dual luciferase reporter and/or RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation assays were performed to test the relationship between miR-370-3p and KCNQ1OT1/FOXM1. Mice were intratracheally administered LPS (5 mg/kg) to induce an in vivo model of pneumonia, and pathological injury and inflammation were analysed. RESULTS: The expression of KCNQ1OT1 and FOXM1 was up-regulated, and miR-370-3p was down-regulated in the serum of children with pneumonia, LPS-treated WI-38 cells, and in lung tissues of LPS-treated mice. Silencing of KCNQ1OT1 or overexpression of miR-370-3p suppressed cell apoptosis and inflammation and facilitated cell viability in LPS-treated WI-38 cells. KCNQ1OT1 directly targets miR-370-3p and negatively regulates its expression. FOXM1 was targeted by miR-370-3p and negatively modulated by miR-370-3p. In addition, silencing of KCNQ1OT1 mitigated LPS-induced lung injury and inflammation in mice. The protective effects of KCNQ1OT1 silencing in LPS-treated WI-38 cells and mice were reversed by silencing of miR-370-3p or overexpression of FOXM1.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that there are three different lineages of sarbecoviruses, L1 (SARSr-CoV), L2 (SC2r-CoV), and L-R (a novel CoV lineage from L1 and L2 recombination), in China. Of note, L-R CoVs are only found in R. pusillus. Further macroscopical analysis of the genetic diversity, host specificity for colonization and accidental infection, and geographical characteristics of available CoVs in database revealed the presence of a general geographical distribution pattern for bat sarbecoviruses, with the highest genetic diversity and sequence homology to SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 along the southwest border of China, the least in the northwest of China. Considering the receptor binding motifs for spike gene of sarbecoviruses in Indochina Peninsula show the greatest diversity, our data provide the rationale that extensive surveys in further south and southwest to or of China might be needed for finding closer ancestors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A comprehensive survey of bat sarbecoviruses across China for the origin tracing of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Science diplomacy supposedly builds international cooperation through scientific and technical exchange.

In SARS-CoV-2 infection, NLRP3 inflammasome activation results in the stimulation and synthesis of natural killer cells (NKs), NFB, and interferon gamma (INF-), while inhibiting IL-33 expression. Various efforts have identified selective inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasome. To achieve this, studies are exploring the screening of natural compounds and/or repurposing of clinical drugs to identify potential NLRP3 inhibitors.

Little is known on whether and how patients regain the lost weight. We assessed changes in weight and abdominal adiposity over a three-month follow-up after discharge in COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: In this sub-study of a large prospective observational investigation, we collected data from individuals who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 and re-evaluated at one (V1) and three (V2) months after discharge. Patient characteristics upon admission and anthropometrics, waist circumference and hunger levels assessed during follow-up were analyzed across BMI categories. RESULTS: One-hundred-eighty-five COVID-19 survivors (71% male, median age 62.1 [54.3; 72.1] years, 80% with overweight/obesity) were included. Median BMI did not change from admission to V1 in normal weight subjects (?0.5 [?1.2; 0.6] kg/m(2), p = 0.08), but significantly decreased in subjects with overweight (?0.8 [?1.8; 0.3] kg/m(2), p < 0.001) or obesity (?1.38 [?3.4; ?0.3] kg/m(2), p < 0.001; p < 0.05 vs. normal weight or obesity). Median BMI did not change from V1 to V2 in normal weight individuals (+0.26 [?0.34; 1.15] kg/m(2), p = 0.12), but significantly increased in subjects with overweight (+0.4 [0.0; 1.0] kg/m(2), p < 0.001) or obesity (+0.89 [0.0; 1.6] kg/m(2), p < 0.001; p = 0.01 vs. normal weight). Waist circumference significantly increased from V1 to V2 in the whole group (p < 0.001), driven by the groups with overweight or obesity. At multivariable regression analyses, male sex, hunger at V1 and initial weight loss predicted weight gain at V2.

MethodsFrom February 2020 to April 2021, trained nurses recorded age, gender, occupation, and symptoms in a COVID-19 testing outpatient health center. We allocated data into weekly time fractals and calculated the proportion of COVID-19 positive among HCW vs. non-HCW and incorporated an ARFIMA model (traditionally used in weather forecast) to predict future cases of COVID-19. ResultsAmong 8,998 COVID-19 RT-PCR tests, 3,462 (42%) patients were HCW-D, and 933 (11%) were HCW-A. Overall, 1,914 (21.3%) returned positive, representing 27%, 25% and 19% of HCW-D, HCW-A and non-HCW, respectively. HCW-D or HCW-A were significantly more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than non-HCW (OR=1.5, p<0.0001). The percentage of positive to negative test results remained steady over time. In the positive cases, the percentage of HCW to non-HCW declined significantly over time (Mann-Kendal trend test: tau=-0.58, p<0.0001).

However, little is known about the effectiveness of such control measures in curbing the outbreak in developing countries. In this study, we seek to assess the impact of various outbreak control measures in Kuwait to gain more insight into the outbreak progression and the associated healthcare burden. Methods: We use a SEIR mathematical model to simulate the first wave of the epidemic outbreak of COVID-19 in Kuwait with additional testing and hospitalization compartments. We calibrate our model by using a NBD observational framework for confirmed case and death counts. We simulate trajectories of model forecasts and assess the effectiveness of public health interventions by using maximum likelihood to estimate both the basic and effective reproduction numbers. Results: Our results indicate that the early strict control measures had the effect of delaying the intensity of the outbreak but were unsuccessful in reducing the effective reproduction number below 1. Forecasted model trajectories suggest a need to expand the healthcare system capacity to cope with the associated epidemic burden of such ineffectiveness.

We performed exploratory factor analytic procedures on responses to a sex-positivity scale, followed by multivariable linear regressions to determine sex-positivity's associations with medical mistrust and PrEP conspiracy beliefs. We extracted two sex-positivity factors: sexual freedom ( = 0.90), reflecting openness toward casual sex and rejection of sexual mores, and essence of sex ( = 0.77), reflecting the intimate, relational, and pleasurable qualities of sex.

It is suggested for use in the assessment of the ability of patients to swallow fluid and non-fluid foods separately. It also promotes effective communication between healthcare providers. OBJECTIVES We aimed to investigate the validity and benefit of the Gugging Swallowing Screen. DESIGN This was a systematic review. DATA SOURCE We sourced data from electronic databases including Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, KoreaMed, Research Information Sharing Service, and Korean studies Information Service System. REVIEW METHODS We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases. We included studies published in English and Korean up to November 2018 that pertained to the Gugging Swallowing Screen. We designed strategies that included Medical Subject Headings and keywords, such as \\"dysphagia,\\" \\"swallowing,\\" \\"assessment,\\" \\"screening,\\" and \\"GUSS,\\" used alone or in combination. RESULTS Of the 297 studies that appeared in the search result, 219 articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers after duplicate studies were eliminated. Finally, 8 articles were included in this study. With regard to validity, the Gugging Swallowing Screen had a pooled sensitivity of 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.93-0.99), a pooled specificity of 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.74), and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9381. With regard to benefit, early systematic dysphagia screening using Gugging Swallowing Screen performed by nurses reduced both screening time and pneumonia rate compared to the control group (p = 0.004). The incidence of X-ray-verified pneumonia was significantly lower in the Gugging Swallowing Screen group than in the clinical screening group (p ? 0.01), but no significant difference was observed in the incidence of pneumonia compared to the value predicted using the 10 mL water swallowing test.

By providing a source of Ab at the site of infection, CNS-localized ASC play a critical role in acute viral control and in preventing viral recrudescence. Following coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis, the CNS accumulation of ASC is chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) dependent. This study demonstrates that CNS-expressed CXCR3 ligand CXCL10 is the critical chemokine regulating ASC accumulation. Impaired ASC recruitment in CXCL10(-/-) but not CXCL9(-/-) mice was consistent with reduced CNS IgG and -light chain mRNA and virus-specific Ab. Moreover, the few ASC recruited to the CNS in CXCL10(-/-) mice were confined to the vasculature, distinct from the parenchymal localization in wild-type and CXCL9(-/-) mice. However, neither CXCL9 nor CXCL10 deficiency diminished neutralizing serum Ab, supporting a direct role for CXCL10 in ASC migration. T cell accumulation, localization, and effector functions were also not affected in either CXCL9(-/-) or CXCL10(-/-) mice, consistent with similar control of infectious virus. There was also no evidence for dysregulation of chemokines or cytokines involved in ASC regulation. The distinct roles of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in ASC accumulation rather coincided with their differential localization. While CXCL10 was predominantly expressed by astrocytes, CXCL9 expression was confined to the vasculature/perivascular spaces.

Thus, a component of JMML is associated with a hyperinflammatory state and abundant innate immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. Recently, we showed that the evolutionarily conserved mouse lncRNA Morrbid is specifically expressed in myeloid cells and uniquely represses the expression of the proapoptotic gene Bim to regulate the lifespan of myeloid cells.

In this study, we characterized the role of Morrbid and its target Bim, which are significantly dysregulated in Shp2E76K/+-bearing myeloid cells, in driving JMML.

Categorical prohibition of PFP during the course of an outbreak or epidemic is likely to result in unnecessary harms to patients and families, and violate values such as the moral commitments of families to care for each other. Supporting the option of PFP under particular circumstances, on the other hand, will least infringe these moral considerations. An additional reason for a family presence policy is that it may facilitate voluntary cooperation with isolation and other restrictive measures. We provide an analysis of these considerations for supporting modes of family presence during an outbreak emergency, before defending the riskier option of PFP in the isolation facility from plausible objections and concerns.","output":"Patient Isolation during Infectious Disease Outbreaks: Arguments for Physical Family Presence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00358-X.].","output":"Correction to Lancet Microbe 2022; 3: e173C83"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a currently spotlighted method for cancer treatment, cancer immunotherapy has made a lot of progress in recent years. Among tremendous cancer immunotherapy boosters available nowadays, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists were specifically selected, because of their effective activation of innate and adaptive immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and macrophages. TLR agonists can activate signaling pathways of DCs to express CD80 and CD86 molecules, and secrete various cytokines and chemokines. The maturation of DCs stimulates na?ve T cells to differentiate into functional cells, and induces B cell activation. Although TLR agonists have anti-tumor ability by activating the immune system of the host, their drawbacks, which include poor efficiency and remarkably short retention time in the body, must be overcome. In this review, we classify and summarize the recently reported delivery strategies using (1) exogenous TLR agonists to maintain the biological and physiological signaling activities of cargo agonists, (2) usage of multiple TLR agonists for synergistic immune responses, and (3) co-delivery using the combination with other immunomodulators or stimulants. In contrast to naked TLR agonists, these exogenous TLR delivery strategies successfully facilitated immune responses and subsequently mediated anti-tumor efficacy.","output":"Engineering Therapeutic Strategies in Cancer Immunotherapy via Exogenous Delivery of Toll-like Receptor Agonists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are frequently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where goals of care conversations may result in changes in code status. Previous work has described how changes in code status in ICU patients influence objective measures like length of stay and mortality and the subjective experiences of patients and surrogates. To date, no study has described the code statuses of ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of all patients admitted to the ICU at three hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts confirmed to have COVID-19 by positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction test between March 11, 2020, and May 31, 2020. Differences in code status at admission were examined. Continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR, 1st-3rd) and categorical variables are presented as numbers with percentages. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed for continuous variables and the chi-square test (or Fisher Exact, when appropriate) for categorical variables. RESULTS: A total of 459 patients were admitted to the ICU, of which 421 (91.7%) were Full Code. The median age differed significantly between patients who had a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order and those who were Full Code [80.5 (IQR 64-97) versus 62 (IQR 40-84), p &lt; 0.001]. There were no differences in gender or BMI. At admission, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II) scores were significantly higher in patients with DNR orders (p = 0.028, p &lt; 0.001 respectively). The median Pao2 / Fio2 ratio at admission was 163 (IQR 43-283) and did not differ between groups. Patients who had DNR orders were more likely to be non-Latinx (86.8% vs 50.4%, p &lt; 0.001), white (81.6% vs 54.2%, p &lt; 0.012), and English-speaking (78.9% vs 48.5%, p &lt; 0.001). Patients admitted from a private home, rather than a facility, were significantly more likely to be Full Code (85.0% vs 36.8%, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, patients with DNR orders at admission were older, white, and non-Latinx, consistent with prior research in general ICU populations. We further identified a significant relationship between primary language and code status. Due to the unique barriers to communication imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and pre-existing barriers to communication with patients with limited English proficiency, our results highlight the necessity of specific interventions to overcome these challenges.","output":"Code status orders in patients admitted to the intensive care unit due to coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 reminds us that the emerging and reemerging respiratory virus infections pose a continuing threat to human life. Cytokine storm syndromes of viral origin seem to have a common pathogenesis of the imbalanced immune response with the exaggerated inflammatory reaction combined with the reduction and functional exhaustion of T cells. Immunomodulatory therapy is gaining interest in COVID-19, but this strategy has received less attention in other respiratory viral infections than it deserved. In this review we suggest that based on the similarities of the immune dysfunction in the severe cases of different respiratory viral infections, some lessons from the immunomodulatory therapy of COVID-19 (particularly regarding the choice of an immunomodulatory drug, the selection of patients and optimal time window for this kind of therapy) could be applied for some cases of severe influenza infection and probably for some future outbreaks of novel severe respiratory viral infections.","output":"Influenza infection, SARS, MERS and COVID-19: Cytokine storm - The common denominator and the lessons to be learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of an intervention can be assessed by randomizing patients to different diagnostic tests instead of directly to an intervention and control. This principle is applied by allocating individuals to intervention if the test result is positive (or on one side of a threshold) but allocating individuals to a control if the result is negative (or on the other side of the threshold). This can also be done with different dichotomizing thresholds for one test. The frequencies of the outcome in those with each of the four resulting observations are then used to calculate the risk ratio (RR) for the marginal probabilities by solving simultaneous equations. This assumes that the RR due to intervention compared to control is the same in both test groups created by randomization. The calculations are illustrated by using data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that assessed the efficacy of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in lowering the risk of diabetic nephropathy in patients conditional on urinary albumin excretion rates (AERs). The calculations are also illustrated with simulated data for assessing the effectiveness of test, trace and isolation to reduce transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus by randomizing to RT-PCR or LFD tests. This approach allows the probabilities of outcomes, their RRs and odds ratios (OR) conditional on the results of covariates to be determined, also suggesting a way forward for natural as opposed to active randomization.","output":"The probabilities of an outcome on intervention and control can be estimated by randomizing subjects to different testing strategies, required for assessing diagnostic tests, test trace and isolation and for natural randomisation (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Older adults and people from certain racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately represented in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. METHODS: Using data from the Premier Healthcare Database on 181,813 hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19 during MarchCSeptember 2020 we applied multivariable log-binomial regression to assess the associations between age and race/ethnicity and COVID-19 clinical severity (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV], and death); and determine whether the impact of age on clinical severity differs by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Overall, 84,497 (47%) patients were admitted to the ICU, 29,078 (16%) received IMV, and 27,864 (15%) died in the hospital. Increased age was strongly associated with clinical severity when controlling for underlying medical conditions and other covariates; the strength of this association differed by race/ethnicity. Compared with non-Hispanic White patients, risk of death was lower among non-Hispanic Black patients (adjusted risk ratio [95% CI]: 0.96 [0.92, 0.99]), and higher among Hispanic/Latino patients (RR [95% CI]: 1.15 [1.09, 1.20]), non-Hispanic Asian patients (RR [95% CI]: 1.16 [1.09, 1.23]), and patients of other racial and ethnic groups (RR [95% CI]: 1.13 [1.06, 1.21]). Risk of ICU admission and IMV was elevated among some racial and ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that age is a driver of poor outcomes among hospitalized persons with COVID-19.

It has been hypothesized that acute short-term hypoxia exposure could increase the risk of developing a stroke. Studies assessing the effect of altitude on stroke have provided conflicting results, some analyses suggest that long-term chronic exposure could be associated with reduced mortality and lower stroke incidence rates. Methods: An ecological analysis of all stroke hospital admissions, mortality rates, and disability-adjusted life years in Ecuador was performed from 2001 to 2017. The cases and population at risk were categorized in low (<1,500 m), moderate (1,500-2,500 m), high (2,500-3,500 m), and very high altitude (3,500-5,500 m) according to the place of residence. The derived crude and direct standardized age-sex adjusted mortality and hospital admission rates were calculated. Results: A total of 38,201 deaths and 75,893 stroke-related hospital admissions were reported. High altitude populations (HAP) had lower stroke mortality in men [OR: 0.91 (0.88-0.95)] and women [OR: 0.83 (0.79-0.86)]. In addition, HAP had a significant lower risk of getting admitted to the hospital when compared with the low altitude group in men [OR: 0.55 (CI 95% 0.54-0.56)] and women [OR: 0.65 (CI 95% 0.64-0.66)]. Conclusion: This is the first epidemiological study that aims to elucidate the association between stroke and altitude using four different elevation ranges. Our findings suggest that living at higher elevations offers a reduction or the risk of dying due to stroke as well as a reduction in the probability of being admitted to the hospital.

Objective: The therapeutic effects of octreotide was investigated in an experimental model of enterocutaneous fistula. Methods: In twenty male Wistar rats weighing 21017g a jejunocutaneous fistula was surgically done. After that, the animals had been randomly divided into three groups. In the group A (n=10) octreotide was administered once a day (4 m g/kg/body wt/s.c) while in the group B (n=10) the rats were injected with saline solution in similar amount to the used to dilute octreotide.

The School is a landmark in the history of design as a discipline and the development of design education. The School was also a workplace, commercialising Bauhaus-designed products.

This problem raises the questions: How did the School-workplace generate innovations amid the calamity of post-war Germany, and what is the significance of the Bauhaus for post-pandemic education and workplaces one hundred years on? The concept of transgression is used to understand innovation at the Bauhaus School-workplace. Haraway discusses transgressive practices that disrupt established knowledges, moving ways of thinking and doing in new directions. Analysis of workplace learning research reveals that three interfacing dimensions make up innovation: (1) workplace environments, (2) the culture-order that facilitates innovation, and (3) learning in practice in authentic settings. This qualitative case study reports on how Bauhaus innovation emerged at the intersection of these key dimensions. There are surprising commonalities between the Bauhaus approach to innovation in challenging times and contemporary thinking about supporting innovation which are relevant to education, particularly STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education, and workplaces in a world affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. Thus, encouraging people who challenge boundaries, rules or the way things are can support innovation. This paper addresses a gap in workplace learning research on interrelated dimensions of innovation which the Bauhaus recognized. The study also offers an innovative approach to the examination of innovation across time and space whereas most contemporary studies of innovation focus on the present.

Since the first convictions involving OCSE in 2011,3 the number of reported cases has been rising each year, with more than 800,000 tips of possible OCSE from the Philippines in 2019.4 During the COVID-19 pandemic, tips are reported to have increased by 264 per cent.5 Widespread access to low-cost internet and mobile devices together with high levels of English proficiency and an established commercial sex industry are the most immediate explanations for the prevalence of OCSE in the country.6 Whilst the relevant stakeholders concur that more action is needed to tackle the issue, there is disagreement regarding how the problem is represented and addressed. High profile awareness and online safety campaigns portray OCSE as being perpetrated against young children by adults, usually within the same household.7 However, existing research and the experience of many community-based practitioners suggest that self-generated sexual content/material by children is more common and becoming normalised in many communities with friends and young relatives 'coaching' their peers in how to produce sellable images and access paying customers via anonymous payment systems without an adult 'facilitator'.8 Research suggests a range of motivations for children to engage in this behaviour, including to meet their families' financial needs;to have their own money to purchase clothes, gadgets, or drugs and alcohol;or in the hope of forming relationships with foreign men online.9 The sole study on the impact of OCSE in the Philippines suggests higher levels of post-traumatic stress, lower self-esteem, severe educational delays, and an increased risk of entering prostitution among victims.10 However, the long-term effects of OCSE, whether facilitated by an adult or involving self-generated material, on the mental, physical, sexual, and social wellbeing of children is unknown and research is greatly needed to address this gap. Whilst national legislation in theory supports this approach, multiple factors such as fragmentation of services, lack of sustained funding, and poor cooperation at the local government level limit programme reach and implementation.18 Progress is also disrupted by incongruous government policies and laws, including those that require a guardian's consent for children and youths under 18 years to access SRH services, but hold that children as young 12 can provide sexual consent and be held criminally liable at the age of 15.19 A large body of evidence confirms that comprehensive SRH education can have a significant impact on SRH outcomes.20 Nascent research also suggests that this impact can be extended to related issues and, thus, experts recommend the inclusion of topics such as internet sexuality and gender-based violence.21 However, to be effective, SRH programmes must be holistic and intensive, using activity-based and learner-centred educational methodologies.

RESULTS: One-hundred patients (55  13 years; 71% men) were included and classified as having mild (29%), moderate (12%), or severe (59%) inflammation. The need for mechanical ventilation differed among patients in each group (16%, 50%, and 71%, respectively; P < 0.0001), yielding a 4.1-fold increased risk of requiring mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate inflammation and 5.4 for those with severe inflammation.

The lack of applied hydraulic pressure in FO suggests an energy-efficient and low-cost process. A total of five composite membranes with different MIL-53 (Al) loadings (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 wt%) were fabricated and characterized to assess the effect of MOF incorporation on the physicochemical properties of TFN membranes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis implied that incorporating MIL-53 (Al) in the polyamide selective layer affects the membrane morphology. Water contact angle measurements indicated significant augmentation in the hydrophilicity of modified membranes (20.6 for the optimally modified membrane vs. 80.4 for the unmodified membrane) owing to the increased hydroxyl group in the membrane selective layer. Due to the reduced structural parameter, the optimized membrane exhibited 94.31% enhanced water flux than the unmodified membrane without losing the selectivity. Also, the fouling experiments with organic foulant allude to the prominent antifouling property of this modified membrane with a 96.67% flux recovery ratio.

In this study, we investigated the quantitative effect of some major mutants of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). These mutations are directly related to the Variant of Concern (VOC) including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. Our calculations show that five major mutations (N501Y, E484K, L452R, T478K and K417N), first reported in Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants, all increase the binding of the S protein to ACE2 (except K417N), consistent with the experimental findings. We also studied an additional eight mutations of the Omicron variant that are located on the interface of the receptor binding domain (RDB) and have not been reported in other VOCs. Our study showed that most of these mutations (except Y505H and G446S) enhance the binding of the S protein to ACE2. The computational predictions helped explain why the Omicron variant quickly became dominant worldwide. Finally, comparison of several different computational methods for binding free energy calculation of these mutants was made. The alanine scanning method used in the current calculation helped to elucidate the residue-specific interactions responsible for the enhanced binding affinities of the mutants. The results show that the ASGB (alanine scanning with generalized Born) method is an efficient and reliable method for these binding free energy calculations due to mutations.","output":"Mutational Effect of Some Major COVID-19 Variants on Binding of the S Protein to ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This survey study assesses whether the mental health of high school students improved 1 semester after COVID-19Cassociated remote schooling measures were lifted in Austria in 2021.","output":"Assessment of Mental Health of High School Students 1 Semester After COVID-19CAssociated Remote Schooling Measures Were Lifted in Austria in 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>A large body of research has analyzed individual psychological characteristics as antecedents of strategic decision-making.

The Task Force set out to guide integrative oncology practitioners in providing effective and safe online consultations and treatments for quality-of-life-concerns and symptom management. Online treatments include manual, acupuncture, movement, mind-body, herbal, and expressive art therapies. Methods: The SIO Online Practice Recommendations employed a four-phase consensus process: (1) literature review and discussion among an international panel of SIO members, identifying key elements essential in an integrative oncology visit;(2) development, testing, and refinement of a questionnaire defining challenges and strategies;(3) refinement input from integrative oncology experts from 19 countries;and (4) SIO Executive Committee review identifying the most high-priority challenges and strategies. Results: The SIO Online Practice Recommendations address ten challenges, providing practical suggestions for online treatment/consultation. These include overcoming unfamiliarity, addressing resistance among patients and healthcare practitioners to online consultation/treatment, exploring ethical and medical-legal aspects, solving technological issues, preparing the online treatment setting, starting the online treatment session, maintaining effective communication, promoting specific treatment effects, involving the caregiver, concluding the session, and ensuring continuity of care. Conclusions: The SIO Online Practice Recommendations are relevant for ensuring continuity of care beyond the present pandemic. They can be implemented for patients with limited accessibility to integrative oncology treatments due to geographic constraints, financial difficulties, physical disability, or an unsupportive caregiver.

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated two patients with recurrent cholangitis, jaundice and fever for the presence of difficult bile stones, inaccessible by an endoscopic approach, treated with PTL. Both procedures were conducted using the same protocol, with two different accesses. The treatments were performed using a 10 Fr flexible choledoscopy SpyGlass DS(TM) for visualization and an EH system for lithotripsy. Results: Technical success, clinical success and complications were evaluated. The two procedures were successfully concluded in both patients without any residual stones in the biliary tree. For both patients, a short follow-up period of six months was available, during which they remained asymptomatic. Neither major nor minor complications were registered. Conclusion: PTL was determined to be an effective and safe technique. This procedure allows a direct visualization of the stone, reducing fluoroscopy time and permitting a less invasive and less traumatic method for the percutaneous management of difficult bile stones.

In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the changes in levels of some air pollutants (mainly PM10, NO2 and SO2) in Sal city (North-Western Morocco) during the lockdown measures. In this context, a continuous measurement of PM10, SO2 and NO2 was carried before and during the Covid-19 lockdown period. As a consequence of the security measures and control actions undertaken, the emissions from vehicle exhaust and industrial production were significantly reduced, which contribute to the decrease in the concentrations of the studied pollutants. The obtained results showed that the difference between the concentrations recorded before and during the lockdown period were respectively 75%, 49% and 96% for PM10, SO2 and NO2.

The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment has recently been suggested to influence HSC aging, however the mechanisms whereby BM stromal cells mediate this effect is unknown. Here we show that aging-associated decreased expression of CXCR4 expression on BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) plays a crucial role in the development of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) aging phenotype. The BM MSC from old mice was sufficient to drive a premature aging phenotype of young HSPC when cultured together ex vivo. The impaired ability of old MSC to support HSPC function is associated with reduced expression of CXCR4 on BM MSC of old mice. Deletion of the CXCR4 gene in young MSC accelerates an aging phenotype in these cells characterized by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, senescence, and reduced proliferation. Culture of HSPC from young mice with CXCR4 deficient MSC also from young mice led to a premature aging phenotype in the young HSPC, as evidenced by reduced hematopoietic regeneration and enhanced myeloid differentiation. Mechanistically, CXCR4 signaling prevents BM MSC dysfunction by suppressing oxidative stress, as treatment of old or CXCR4 deficient MSC with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), improved their niche supporting activity, and attenuated the HSPC aging phenotype. Our studies suggest that age-associated reduction in CXCR4 expression on BM MSC impairs hematopoietic niche activity with increased ROS production, driving an HSC aging phenotype. Thus, modulation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in MSC may lead to novel interventions to alleviate the age-associated decline in immune/hematopoietic function.","output":"Aging-Related Reduced Expression of CXCR4 on Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Contributes to Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Defects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine measures have sparked debate regarding their traumatic nature.

The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients in each intervention group who returned for their diagnostic follow-up examination within 60 days (the standard recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was done to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for follow-up within 60 days. RESULTS: This study included 1,987 patients in the preintervention group and 2,211 patients in the postintervention group. The patient follow-up rate within 60 days increased from 90.1% (1,790 of 1,987) in the preintervention group to 93.9% (2,076 of 2,211) in the postintervention group (P < .001). When controlling for imaging site, patients in the postintervention group had 1.78-fold increased odds of returning for a diagnostic follow-up examination within 60 days (95% confidence interval, 1.40-2.27). CONCLUSIONS: Revising an institutions recall lay letter to a lower reading grade level significantly improved timely patient follow-up.","output":"Impact of Improved Screening Mammography Recall Lay Letter Readability on Patient Follow-Up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines garbage dumping as a transboundary water conflict that brought to the surface issues of federalism as it did territorial sovereignty by examining a garbage trial in the town of Amherstburg, along the Detroit River. In June 1895, the collector of the town of the Canadian town of Amherstburg seized an American scow and tug which were accused of dumping garbage into the Detroit River near Canadian waters. As a transboundary waterbody, both the United States and Canada had access to and interest in the Detroit River;it was an important commercial water as well as fishing ground. The garbage contained all sorts of waste including animal offal, much to the chagrin of Amherstburg's residents and officials. In the trial that followed, local officials and residents argued that the garbage interfered with fish catches and was a general nuisance. The collector had seized the vessels only after he had first tried to get a directive from the Ministry of Agriculture. His telegram asking for direction received a reply telegram which was merely an acknowledgement of receipt. When he did hear back, from another ministry, he was told it was a local matter as there was no contravention of a federal policy. To the American owners of the tug and scow, the garbage trial (as it came to be known) was not merely a local issue. Local officials and residents testified to their growing annoyance and the overall inconvenience caused by the dumping at the trail. To federal officials, this remained a local matter. By following the garbage trial and its aftermath, this paper shows how garbage became a local, federal, and transboundary issue, all at once thus exposing the interstitial space that garbage occupies. In so doing, expands our understanding of garbage, pollution, and their evolution as binational issues between the United States and Canada before the formation of the International Joint Commission.","output":"Flotsam: garbage dumping, pollution, and legal tensions in the Detroit River.

Patients with B-cell malignancies including myeloma are at increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality and exhibit variable serologic response to the vaccine. The capacity of vaccine-induced antibodies in these patients to neutralize SARS CoV-2 or its variants is not known. METHODS: Sera from 238 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) undergoing SARS CoV-2 vaccination were analyzed. Antibodies against the SARS CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and viral nucleocapsid were measured to detect serologic response to vaccine and environmental exposure to the virus. The capacity of antibodies to neutralize virus was quantified using pseudovirus neutralization assay and live virus neutralization against the initial SARS CoV-2 strain and the B1.617.2 (Delta) variant. RESULTS: Vaccine-induced nAbs are detectable at much lower rates (54%) than estimated in previous seroconversion studies in MM, which did not monitor viral neutralization. In 33% of patients, vaccine-induced antispike RBD antibodies lack detectable neutralizing capacity, including against the B1.617.2 variant. Induction of nAbs is affected by race, disease, and treatment-related factors. Patients receiving mRNA1273 vaccine (Moderna) achieved significantly greater induction of nAbs compared with those receiving BNT162b2 (Pfizer; 67% v 48%, P = .006). CONCLUSION: These data show that vaccine-induced antibodies in several patients with MM lack detectable virus-neutralizing activity. Vaccine-mediated induction of nAbs is affected by race, disease, vaccine, and treatment characteristics. These data have several implications for the emerging application of booster vaccines in immunocompromised hosts.","output":"Determinants of Neutralizing Antibody Response After SARS CoV-2 Vaccination in Patients With Myeloma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study verifies whether there is a strong correlation between the pro-vaccination, against COVID-19 attitude of the respondents and their belief that most of those around them want to be vaccinated against COVID-19. For this purpose, we analyzed data from a sociological survey conducted in April 2021 in Romania. The sample size was of 1001 respondents, the selection process was randomized and the population included in the sample is representative of the socio-demographic structure of Romania. The tool used to collect the data was CATI (telephonic interview). In order to test the existence of these correlations we performed the following tests: Chi-Square test, Kendall , Spearman  tests and Freemans z-test. The pro-vaccination attitude strongly correlates with the perception of subjects that their primary group accepts vaccination and even correlates with the perception that the general public is rather pro-vaccination. The vaccination decision is closely linked to the social relations system and the rules of the community in which the subject lives.

We examined parents beliefs, attitudes and intentions to allow their daughters to receive the HPV vaccine, as well as the uptake of the vaccine. This cross-sectional study was conducted between September and November 2019 in Jakarta. We invited 680 parents or guardians of year 6 female students from 33 primary schools who were offered the free HPV vaccine to complete a questionnaire; 484 (71%) responded. Analysis was done in two groups: the Decided Group (those parents who allowed or denied for their daughter to receive the HPV vaccination), and the Undecided Group (those parents who did not recall being approached about the HPV vaccine or forgot their response). In the Decided group, 295 (83.6%) parents allowed their daughters to receive the vaccination, while 58 (16.4%) parents refused it. In the Undecided group, 49 (70%) parents reported a strong intention to allow their daughters to receive the vaccination; 21 (30%) had weak intention. Attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control were shown to be significant predictors of HPV vaccine uptake when multilevel multivariate logistic regression analysis was undertaken. On the contrary, no independent variable was seen as a significant predictor for parents intentions to vaccinate their daughter against HPV. No sociodemographic characteristic was significantly associated with parents decisions or intentions regarding HPV vaccine for their daughters.

Using the ResPlexII v2.0 (Qiagen) multiplex PCR, 393 positive results were obtained in 468 clinical samples collected during an influenza season in Germany. The overall distribution of positive results was influenza A 42.0%, influenza B 38.7%, adenovirus 1.5%, bocavirus 0.5%, coronavirus 3.3%, enterovirus 5.6%, metapneumovirus 1.0%, parainfluenza virus 0.8%, rhinovirus 4.1%, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 2.5%. Double infections of influenza virus together with another virus were found for adenovirus B and E, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus and for rhinovirus. These other viruses were rapidly lost upon passages in MDCK 33016PF cells and under conditions as applied to influenza virus passaging. Clinical samples, in which no influenza virus but other viruses were found, were also subject to passages in MDCK 33016PF cells. Using lower inoculum dilutions than those normally applied for preparations containing influenza virus (total dilution of the original sample of 10(4)), the positive results for the different viruses turned negative already after 2 or 3 passages in MDCK 33016PF cells. These results demonstrate that, under practical conditions as applied to grow influenza viruses, contaminating viruses can be effectively removed by passages in MDCK cells. In combination with their superior isolation efficiency, MDCK cells appear highly suitable to be used as an alternative to embryonated eggs to isolate and propagate influenza vaccine candidate viruses.","output":"Isolation of influenza viruses in MDCK 33016PF cells and clearance of contaminating respiratory viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this review from literature appearing over about the past 5 years, we focus on selected selenide reports and related chemistry; we aimed for a digestible, relevant, review intended to be usefully interconnected within the realm of fluorescence and selenium chemistry.

METHODS: Following the methodology framework and analytical strategies used in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, the incidence, death, DALYs and risk factors of RIT were examined by age, gender and states from 1990 to 2019 in the US. All estimates were calculated as counts, age-standardized rates per 100,000 people and percentage change, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In 2019, the age-standardized incidence, death and DALY rates per 100,000 people of RIT were 339,703 (95% CI 303,184 to 382,354), 13.6 (95% CI 12.2 to 14.4) and 384.9 (95% CI 330.6 to 458.6), respectively. Among RIT causes, upper respiratory infection accounted for the large majority of RIT age-standardized incidence rate, while lower respiratory infection constituted the highest proportion of RIT age-standardized death and DALY rates. The age-standardized incidence, death and DALY rates of RIT in 2019 and their temporal trends since 1990 varied widely across states and socio-demographic index. Among all attributable risk factors, smoking was the leading one for age-standardized RIT deaths in 2019, followed by low temperature and alcohol use (the attributable fractions were 17.7%, 15.3% and 6.9%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that RIT remained a major cause of health burden in the US, with large disparities persisting between US states.

Substantial inter-individual variability in individual disease courses is hypothesized to be partially mediated by the differential regulation of the genes that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or are involved in the subsequent host response. Here, we comprehensively investigated non-genetic and genetic factors influencing COVID-19-relevant bronchial epithelial gene expression. METHODS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings obtained from uninfected individuals. We related ACE2 gene expression to host and environmental factors in the SPIROMICS cohort of smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and replicated these associations in two asthma cohorts, SARP and MAST. To identify airway biology beyond ACE2 binding that may contribute to increased susceptibility, we used gene set enrichment analyses to determine if gene expression changes indicative of a suppressed airway immune response observed early in SARS-CoV-2 infection are also observed in association with host factors. To identify host genetic variants affecting COVID-19 susceptibility in SPIROMICS, we performed expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping and investigated the phenotypic associations of the eQTL variants. RESULTS: We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that clinically relevant variation in the expression of COVID-19-related genes is associated with host factors, environmental exposures, and likely host genetic variation.","output":"Genetic and non-genetic factors affecting the expression of COVID-19-relevant genes in the large airway epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging adult military members and veterans (MMV) are experiencing many transitions (e.g., adulthood, military). The sum of these changes can cause stress, anxiety, and mental health challenges. Stigma of mental health and treatment exists, and military populations are often not seeking or engaging in appropriate care. Recent research emphasizes the need to uncover mental health attitudes and self-stigma barriers regarding help seeking. We evaluated the impact of a single motivational-interviewing enhanced interview with 26 MMV, all who reported high risk substance use. In 75-minute interviews with the primary focus of discussing their experiences regarding mental health, substance use, and identity development, the interviewer incorporated motivational interviewing strategies (e.g., affirmations, complex reflections). Participants shared their developmental experiences, stressors transitioning, and barriers and stigma around mental health treatment. Participants completed a survey which included a variety of standardized measures and open-ended questions two weeks before and after the interview. Qualitative follow-up data via open ended questions shows the session was well received by participants as they could share their stories, think critically about their military experiences, and brainstorm solutions for mental health care. We conclude that using individual, confidential interviews to discuss sensitive topics for data collection with MMV is an area to continue developing.

This caused high health pressure that hashad an impact on the Spanish National Health System and Granada has been one of the most affected provincesnationwide. The high healthcare pressure derived from it has had an impact on the National Health System throughout the Spanish territory, with Granada beingone of the most affected provinces nation wide. The increase in the admissions of patients with COVID-19 in such a short time has forced us to optimize hospital resources, prioritizing them in patients with COVID-19 and oncological or urgent pathology. In this context, the increasingly frequent and recurrent lithiasis is treated conservatively. However, the prolongation of the pandemic situation poses the challenge of offering definitive treatment to these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present the rearrangement performed in our Lithotripsy Unit with the aim of developing a comprehensive and alternative protocol for performing ureteroscopies on an outpatient basis, assuming the patient from admission to hospital discharge, with the collaboration of the Anesthesiology service. RESULTS In this new protocol, 35 ureteroscopies were performed without noticing intraoperative complications or during the recovery period developed in the Day Hospital integrated within the Lithotripsy Unit. CONCLUSIONS The redistribution of our resources has allowed us to continue performing ureterorenoscopies on an outpatient basis without the need to use hospital beds and reducing the traffic of patients within the hospital itself with an adequate safety profile.","output":"[Adaptation of surgery practice during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Women in academia pursuing nonlinear career paths experience negative impacts on career trajectory. No published studies have examined how pursuit of nonlinear career paths might perpetuate gender inequities within academic hospital medicine. OBJECTIVE: (1) Compare the frequency of nonlinear career paths by gender among academic hospitalists; (2) assess the perceived impact of two types of nonlinear career pathsextended leave (EL) and non-traditional work arrangements (NTWA) on hospitalists personal lives and careers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional descriptive survey study of adult hospitalist physicians in three academic centers within the USA. INTERVENTION: Electronic survey including closed- and open-ended items assessing respondent utilization of and experiences with nonlinear career paths. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: (1) Associations between EL and demographic variables as well as gender differences in leave length and NTWA strategies using Fishers exact test; 2) grounded theory qualitative analysis of open-text responses. KEY RESULTS: Compared with men, women reported taking EL more often (p = 0.035) and for longer periods (p = 0.002). Men and women reported taking NTWA at similar rates. Women reported negative impacts of EL within domains of personal life, career, well-being, and work-life integration whereas men only reported negative impacts to career. Men and women described positive impacts of NTWA across all domains. CONCLUSIONS: Women academic hospitalists reported taking EL more often than men and experienced disproportionately more adverse impacts to personal lives and careers. Surprisingly, men reported taking NTWA to address burnout and childbirth at similar rates to women.

At the same time, respiratory failure (RF) after ARDS can persist for a long time despite intensive therapy. Therefore, it is important to develop new effective approaches for restoring the ventilation function of the lungs after COVID-19. Here, we present a case report of effective application of short-term inhalations of xenon-oxygen (Xe/O(2)) gas mixture for treatment of RF and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD) associated with COVID-19. The patient inhaled a gas mixture of 70 % Xe and 30 % O(2). We used multispiral computed tomography, evaluated psychometry, studied hematological and biochemical blood parameters, and applied some other methods of clinical studies to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of Xe inhalation. Also, we studied the mechanism of action of xenon with computer modeling. The clinical case showed the high efficacy of Xe/O(2) mixture for treating severe RF and NPD after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Xenon inhalations dramatically increased oxygen saturation and the degree of pneumatization of the lungs. We found out that in coronavirus pneumonia, saturated phospholipids of surfactant are transferred to the solid-ordered phase, which disrupts the surface tension of the alveoli and alveolar gas exchange. Using molecular modeling methods, we demonstrated that the xenon atom increases the distance between the acyl chains of phospholipids due to the van der Waals dispersion interaction. These changes allow for the phase transition of phospholipids from the solid-ordered phase to the liquid phase and restore the functional activity of the surfactant. The findings suggest the feasibility of conducting studies on the effectiveness of Xe/O(2 )inhalations for treating ARDS in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"A case of xenon inhalation therapy for respiratory failure and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A global coronavirus (COVID\\\\19) pandemic occurred at the start of 2020 and is already responsible for more than 74 000 deaths worldwide, just over 100 years after the influenza pandemic of 1918.

Variation in the cannabinoid CB2 receptor gene ( CNR2 ) could affect the endocannabinoids regulatory actions on the immune system, resulting in an increased risk of various inflammatory diseases. The present study investigated the relationship between the CNR2 rs35761398 (Q63R) functional variation and COVID-19 severity. Results: : A total of 200 Iranian COVID-19 patients (100 expired and 100 discharged) were enrolled in the study and genotyped through TaqMan assay. The co-dominant, dominant, recessive, over-dominant, and additive inheritance models were analyzed using SNPStats software. In silico molecular docking was also performed to simulate the effects of Q63R variation on CB2 binding with a ligand and with G-protein. A significant difference in the Q63R allele and genotype distributions was found between COVID-19 expired and discharged patients in co-dominant (OR: 3.33, 95% CI: 1.25-8.88, p = 0.043), recessive (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.16-7.33, p = 0.017), and additive inheritance (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.06-2.48, p = 0.025) models. The molecular docking results showed that the predicted structure of mutant CB2 (63R type) could not bind to G-protein in the correct position.

This evolved during the advent of missionary works when most societies were exposed to Western education, which sought to instil reading of the Bible. In traditional African education, teaching and learning were done orally, through open gatherings around the fire where the elders told stories, or challenged the youngsters in myths, legends, idioms, and solution-oriented quizzes. With the arrival of European missionaries modes of delivery changed as formal classroom setups were introduced. This chapter, which is written from an open distance learning context, looks into ways in which self-reliance and self-directness might be facilitated in an African open learning context. The chapter, which is conceptual in nature, further explores the challenges and possibilities that characterise open and distance learning (ODL). It shall be argued that ODL aims at creating autonomous and self-directed learners who can champion their own learning. The chapter shall draw on the works of Mentz et al.

Thus, through a convergence of ODL and SDL, students employ various interventions to create and co-create knowledge and solutions to their own learning. Against this backdrop, the chapter shall argue that SDL and ODL are pertinent modes of delivery of teaching and learning in times of global crises such as the current COVID-19. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Open Learning in the African Context: Challenges and Possibilities for Self-directed Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serological testing of large representative populations for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is needed to estimate seroprevalence, transmission dynamics, and the duration of antibody responses from natural infection and vaccination.

However, no study has been conducted until now to investigate the precise role of smooth muscle-derived Wnt5a in IPF.

This improvement was based on a significantly lower deposition of collagen in the lung with a reduced number of fibrotic foci in lung parenchyma. Furthermore, the bleomycin-induced cellular infiltration into the airways was not altered in the gene-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice.

We collected 27 melanotic Xp11 neoplasms, the largest series to date, for a comprehensive evaluation. Fourteen of the cases, along with 8 alveolar soft part sarcomas (ASPS), 9 conventional PEComas, and a control group of 7 normal tissues were submitted to RNA sequencing. Follow-up available in 22 patients showed 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 47.6 and 35.7% respectively, which were similar to ASPS and significantly worse than conventional PEComa. Univariate analysis of location (occurring in the kidney versus not kidney), infiltrative growth pattern, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity &#8805;2/50 HPF, necrosis, and lymphovascular invasion were found to be associated with OS and/or DFS. Multivariate analysis identified that location was the only factor found to independently correlate with DFS. More importantly, RNA sequencing-based clustering analysis segregated melanotic Xp11 neoplasm and ASPS, clearly from other tumors including conventional PEComa and Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and formed a compact cluster representative of the largely similar expression signature. In this study, we first clearly define the true biologic nature that melanotic Xp11 neoplasms are distinctive malignant mesenchymal tumors, rather than simply PEComa variants with occasionally unpredictable behavior. Meanwhile, melanotic Xp11 neoplasm and ASPS more likely represent phenotypic variants of the same entity, which is distinct from conventional PEComa and Xp11 translocation RCC.

The performance of EMGdi envelopes extracted by applying fSE and fSE with adaptive filtering was compared to the root mean square (RMS)-based envelope provided by the EMG acquisition device. Automatic onset detection accuracy, using these three envelopes, was evaluated through the root mean square error (RMSE) between the automatic and mean visual onsets (made by two observers). The fSE-based method provided lower RMSE, which was reduced from 298 ms to 264 ms when combined with adaptive filtering, compared to 301 ms provided by the RMS-based method. The RMSE was negatively correlated with the proposed EMGdi quality indices. Following further validation, fSE with KDE, combined with adaptive filtering when dealing with low quality EMGdi, indicates promise for detecting the neural onset of respiratory drive.","output":"Electromyography-Based Respiratory Onset Detection in COPD Patients on Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With a view to help with the urgent socio-economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic, the goal of this paper is to show a possible path to promote, through tax incentives for Responsible Research and Innovation, sound uses of robots in this context.

These intervention-generated inequalities may occur at different stages, including intervention uptake, adherence and effectiveness. We will synthesise evidence on how different measures of inequality moderate the uptake, adherence and effectiveness of behavioural weight management interventions in adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will update a previous systematic literature review from the United States Preventive Services Taskforce to identify trials of behavioural weight management interventions in adults aged 18 years and over that were, or could feasibly be, conducted in or recruited from primary care. Medline, Cochrane database (CENTRAL) and PsycINFO will be searched. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs will be included. Two investigators will independently screen articles for eligibility and conduct risk of bias assessment. We will curate publication families for eligible trials. The PROGRESS-Plus acronym (place of residence, race/ethnicity, occupation, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status, social capital, plus other discriminating factors) will be used to consider a comprehensive range of health inequalities. Data on trial uptake, intervention adherence, weight change and PROGRESS-Plus-related data will be extracted. Data will be synthesised narratively. We will present a Harvest plot for each PROGRESS-Plus criterion and whether each trial found a negative, positive or no health inequality gradient. We will also identify potential sources of unpublished original research data on these factors which can be synthesised through a future individual participant data meta-analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required as no primary data are being collected. The completed systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal, at conferences, and contribute to the lead author's PhD thesis.

In recent years, many methods of time series decomposition have been developed, which extract and reveal different time series properties. Unfortunately, they neglect a very important property, i.e. time series variance. To deal with heteroscedasticity in time series, the method proposed in this work -- a seasonal-trend-dispersion decomposition (STD) -- extracts the trend, seasonal component and component related to the dispersion of the time series.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether preventive negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) could reduce wound complications after open pectus surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS 100 patients after open procedure for the treatment of pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum in the years 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analysed. 50 patients treated with Prevena? (KCI Medical Products GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) were compared with 50 patients whose wounds were covered with OPSITE? film (Smith & Nephew, Hamburg, Germany). Wound closure was performed following a standard procedure as well as the placement of subcutaneous drains. Therefore two comparable groups of patients were formed and analysed by standardised parameters. The wound dressing was placed epicutaneously immediately after wound closure in the operating room and removed after 5 days in each case. Follow-ups were performed immediately after removal of the wound dressing, at the time of discharge from hospital as well as 6 and 12 weeks after operation. The wounds were checked for tenderness, pain, secretion, redness and fistulas. RESULTS The Prevena group showed 10 % wound complications which needed operative treatment, whereas the OPSITE group showed complications in 24 %. Some patients who were treated with Prevena showed superficial skin lesions at the rim of the foam and the film. All of these lesions healed well. CONCLUSION Treating wounds postoperatively with preventive measures (NPWT) showed a remarkable reduction of wound complications following open pectus surgery whereas statistically the difference was not significant (p = 0.074).","output":"[Use of negative pressure wound therapy on surgical incisions (prevena?) after surgery of pectus deformities reduces wound complications]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Co-design has increasingly been posited as a useful approach for Indigenous peoples and other social groups that experience inequities. However, the relatively rapid rise in co-design rhetoric has not necessarily been accompanied by increased understanding of whether co-design works for these social groups, and how equity is addressed. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to identify the current state of co-design as theory and praxis within the context of health and/or disability related interventions or services, with a specific focus on equity considerations for Indigenous and other children and young people from priority social groups. Six electronic databases were searched systematically to identify peer-reviewed papers and grey literature (dissertation and theses) published between January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2020, and a hand-search of reference lists for selected full texts was undertaken. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Although all studies used the term co-design, only three provided a definition of what they meant by use of the term. Nine studies described one or more theory-based frameworks and a total of 26 methods, techniques and tools were reported, with only one study describing a formal evaluation. The key mechanism by which equity was addressed appeared to be the inclusion of participants from a social group experiencing inequities within an area of interest. CONCLUSION: A dearth of information limits the extent to which the literature can be definitive as to whether co-design works for Indigenous and other children and young people from priority social groups, or whether co-design reduces health inequities. It is critical for quality reporting to occur regarding co-design definitions, theory, and praxis. There is an urgent requirement for evaluation research that focuses on co-design impacts and assesses the contribution of co-design to achieving equity. We also recommend culturally safe ethical processes be implemented whenever undertaking co-design.","output":"Co-design for indigenous and other children and young people from priority social groups: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper takes COVID-19-related online rumors as the research object, and explores the law of spreading public opinion in social networks.

Detection dogs could contribute to mass screening. Previous research demonstrated canines' ability to detect SARS-CoV-2-infections but has not investigated if dogs can differentiate between COVID-19 and other virus infections. Methods: Twelve dogs were trained to detect SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Three test scenarios were performed to evaluate their ability to discriminate SARS-CoV-2-infections from viral infections of a different aetiology. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples from individuals and samples from cell culture both infected with one of 15 viruses that may cause COVID-19-like symptoms were presented as distractors in a randomised, double-blind study. Dogs were either trained with SARS-CoV-2 positive saliva samples (test scenario I and II) or with supernatant from cell cultures (test scenario III). Results: When using swab samples from individuals infected with viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 as distractors (test scenario I), dogs detected swab samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with a mean diagnostic sensitivity of 73.8% (95% CI: 66.0C81.7%) and a specificity of 95.1% (95% CI: 92.6C97.7%). In test scenario II and III cell culture supernatant from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, cells infected with other coronaviruses and non-infected cells were presented. Dogs achieved mean diagnostic sensitivities of 61.2% (95% CI: 50.7C71.6%, test scenario II) and 75.8% (95% CI: 53.0C98.5%, test scenario III), respectively.

Conclusion: In all three test scenarios the mean specificities were above 90% which indicates that dogs can distinguish SARS-CoV-2-infections from other viral infections. However, compared to earlier studies our scent dogs achieved lower diagnostic sensitivities. To deploy COVID-19 detection dogs as a reliable screening method it is therefore mandatory to include a variety of samples from different viral respiratory tract infections in dog training to ensure a successful discrimination process.","output":"Discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 Infections From Other Viral Respiratory Infections by Scent Detection Dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, with all its virus variants, remains a serious situation. Health systems across the United States are trying their best to respond. On average, the health care workforce is relatively homogenous, even though it cares for a highly diverse array of patients. This perennial problem in the US health care workforce has only been accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical workers should reflect on the variety of patients they care for and strive to understand their mindsets within the larger contexts of culture, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and socioeconomic realities. Along with talent and skills, diversity and inclusion (D&I) are essential for maintaining a workforce that can treat the myriad needs and populations that health systems serve. Developing hiring strategies that will help achieve greater workforce diversity remains a challenge for health system leaders. OBJECTIVE: The primary aims of this study were to: (1) explore the characteristics of US health systems and their associations with D&I practices and benefits, (2) examine the associations between D&I practices and three pathways to equip workforces, and (3) examine the associations between the three pathways to better equip workforces and business and service benefits. The three pathways are: (1) improving D&I among existing employees (IMPROVE), (2) using multiple channels to find and recruit the workforce (RECRUIT), and (3) collaborating with universities to find new talent and establish plans to train students (COLLABORATE). METHODS: During February to March 2021, 625 health systems in the United States were surveyed with the help of a consultant, 135 (21.6%) of whom responded. We assessed workforce talent- and diversity-relevant factors. We collected secondary data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Compendium of the US Health Systems, leading to a matched data set of 124 health systems for analysis. We first explored differences in diversity practices and benefits across the health systems. We then examined the relationships among diversity practices, pathways, and benefits. RESULTS: Health system characteristics such as size, location, ownership, teaching, and revenue have varying associations with diversity practices and outcomes. D&I and talent strategies exhibited different associations with the three workforce pathways. Regarding the mediating effects, the IMPROVE pathway seems to be more effective than the RECRUIT and COLLABORATE pathways, enabling the diversity strategy to prompt business or service benefits. Moreover, these pathway effects go hand-in-hand with a talent strategy, indicating that both talent and diversity strategies need to be aligned to achieve the best results for a health system. CONCLUSIONS: Diversity and talent plans can be aligned to realize multiple desired benefits for health systems. However, a one-size-fits-all approach is not a viable strategy for improving D&I. Health systems need to follow a multipronged approach based on their characteristics. To get D&I right, proactive plans and genuine efforts are essential.","output":"Valuing Diversity and Inclusion in Health Care to Equip the Workforce: Survey Study and Pathway Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1The reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission from contact tracing applications (apps) depends both on the number of contacts notified and on the probability that those contacts quarantine after notification.

One particular sialic acid called N\\\\glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is widely expressed on most mammalian tissues, but is not easily detectable on human cells. In fact, it provokes an immune response in adult humans. The human deficiency of Neu5Gc is explained by an inactivating mutation in the gene encoding CMP\\\\N\\\\acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase, the rate\\\\limiting enzyme in generating Neu5Gc in cells of other mammals. This deficiency also results in an excess of the precursor sialic acid N\\\\acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) in humans.

First, there is evidence that the human condition can explain differences in susceptibility or resistance to certain microbial pathogens. Second, the functions of some endogenous receptors for sialic acids in the immune system may be altered by this difference. Third, despite the lack of any obvious alternate pathway for synthesis, Neu5Gc has been reported in human tumors and possibly in human fetal tissues, and traces have even been detected in normal human tissues. One possible explanation is that this represents accumulation of Neu5Gc from dietary sources of animal origin.

Historical and current prevention measures for avoiding these problems, such as sanctions, taxes, or responsibility education, have failed to provide significant moderation or resolution. Globally, millions of pets are commercially and privately bred and abandoned annually, damaging biodiversity and ecosystems, and presenting road safety and public health risks, in addition to becoming victims of hardship, abuse, and illegal trafficking, especially in the case of exotic species. This article proposes a novel comprehensive management system for amelioration of overpopulation and abandonment of pets by using greater control of supply and demand of the pet market, highlighting the role of the compulsory owner liability insurance to prevent pet abandonment and all its associated costs. This system aims to act preventatively, through flexible protocols within the proposed management system to be applied to any pet and any country. ABSTRACT: Overpopulation and abandonment of pets are long-standing and burgeoning concerns that involve uncontrolled breeding and selling, illegal trafficking, overpopulation, and pet safety and well-being issues. Abandonment of pets creates numerous negative externalities and multimillion-dollar costs, in addition to severe consequences and problems concerning animal welfare (e.g., starvation, untreated disease, climatic extremes, uncertainty of rescue and adoption), ecological (e.g., invasive species and introduction of novel pathogens), public health and safety (e.g., risks to people from bites, zoonoses, or road hazards), and economic (e.g., financial burdens for governmental and nongovernmental organizations). These interwoven problems persist for several reasons, including the following: (1) lack of an efficient system for the prevention of abandonment and overpopulation, (2) lack of regulatory liability for pet owners, (3) lack of legal alternative to abandonment. This article proposes a novel comprehensive management system for amelioration of overpopulation and abandonment of pets aimed to tackle the current supply and demand dysfunction of the pet market and provide a legal alternative to abandonment.","output":"Amelioration of Pet Overpopulation and Abandonment Using Control of Breeding and Sale, and Compulsory Owner Liability Insurance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To report a case of a 7-year-old male patient with bilateral choroidal caverns (CC) and pachychoroid.

However, the efficiency of the response mounted against the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014 proved that indeed, though challenging, proactive and effective outbreak response is not impossible. With over 20 public health emergencies and infectious disease outbreaks between 2016 and 2018 alone, Nigeria is one of only five members of the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region to report five or more public health events per annum. There are many lessons that can be drawn from Nigeria's experience in handling outbreaks of infectious diseases. In this review, we discuss the history of emerging and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks in Nigeria and explore the response strategies mounted towards each. We also highlight the significant successes and note-worthy limitations, which we have then utilized to proffer policy recommendations to strengthen the Nigerian public health emergency response systems.","output":"Infectious disease outbreak preparedness and response in Nigeria: history, limitations and recommendations for global health policy and practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The well-recognized genome editing ability of the CRISPR-Cas system has triggered significant advances in CRISPR diagnostics. This has prompted an interest in developing new biosensing applications for nucleic acid detection. Recently, such applications have been engineered for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Increased demand for testing and consumables of RT-qPCR assays has led to the use of alternate testing options. Here we evaluate the accuracy and performance of a novel fluorescence-based assay that received EUA authorization for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. METHODS: The Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) technology forms the basis of the Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit using the CRISPR-Cas13a system. Our experimental strategy included selection of COVID-19 patient samples from previously validated RT-qPCR assays. Positive samples were selected based on a broad range of cycle thresholds. RESULTS: A total of 60 COVID-19 patient samples were correctly diagnosed with 100% detection accuracy (relative fluorescence ratios: N gene 95% CI 29.9-43.8, ORF1ab gene 95% CI 30.1-46.3). All controls, including RNase P, showed expected findings. Overall ratios were robustly distinct between positive and negative cases relative to the pre-established 5-fold change in fluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: We have evaluated the accuracy of detecting conserved targets of SARS-CoV-2 across a range of viral loads, including low titers, using SHERLOCK CRISPR collateral detection in a clinical setting. These findings demonstrate encouraging results, especially at a time when COVID-19 clinical diagnosis is in demand. This approach highlights new thinking in infectious disease identification and can be expanded to measure nucleic acids in other clinical isolates.","output":"CRISPR-cas13 enzymology rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 fragments in a clinical setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The mechanism of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the human host cell is through the ACE2 receptor During the pandemic, a hypothesis has been proposed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) could be risk factors for the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection The objective of the study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the association between ACEI or ARB use and SARS-CoV-2 infection severity or mortality Material and methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Google scholar and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for observational studies published between December 2019 and August 4, 2020 Studies were included if they contained data on ACEI or ARB use and SARS-CoV-2 infection severity or mortality Effect statistics were pooled using random-effects models The quality of included studies was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) Data on study design, study location, year of publication, number of participants, sex, age at baseline, outcome definition, exposure definition, effect estimates and 95% CIs were extracted Results: Twenty-six studies (21 cohort studies and 5 case-control studies) were identified for inclusion, combining to a total sample of 361467 participants Mean age was 61 48 (SD 8 26) years and 51 63% were men The mean NOS score of included studies was 7 85 (range: 7-9) Results suggested that ACEI or ARB use did not increase the risk of severe disease or mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0 88, 95% CI: 0 75-1 02, p &gt; 0 05) Conclusions: At present, the evidence available does not support the hypothesis of increased SARS-CoV-2 risk with ACEI or ARB drugs Copyright ? 2020 Via Medica, ISSN 2449-6170","output":"Severity of SARS-COV-2 infection and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: A meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Explorations of the potential of hybrid learning spaces have been accelerated by the rapid transition to online learning caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Educational spaces that accommodate hybrid learning may be seen as more complex spaces to navigate, particularly as the number of potential social and spatial arrangements available to the teacher tends to multiply. This creates a greater need to represent the overarching structure of a learning and teaching session, particularly as some students are co-located and others are remote in time and place. To explore ways of supporting educational practitioners and designers in managing the increasing number of permutations available to them in hybrid learning spaces, this paper turns to musical forms for inspiration. These forms, and the way they are represented diagrammatically, are examined to support thinking around how the sequence of, and interaction between, educational parameters across time may be represented. A discussion of the relationship between temporal and spatial representations of musical form is also used to support a broader notion of space in education, one that may be useful as physical and networked environments become less clear-cut. By exploring how the form of a learning session might be best represented to show the relationship of the parts to the whole in a single image, this paper contributes to the areas of hybridity and learning space design and use.","output":"A Musical Lens on Spatial Representations of Form to Support Designers and Teachers Using Hybrid Learning Spaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increase of urbanization is affecting the urban food system (UFS) in many areas, primarily production, processing, and consumption.

These processes occur over considerably different length and timescales;consequently, linking them to the biomechanical properties of the lungs, and quantifying how they together control the spatiotemporal features of inhalation, remains a challenge. We address this challenge by developing a computational model of the lungs as a hierarchical, branched network of connected liquid-lined flexible cylinders coupled to a viscoelastic thoracic cavity. Each branch opens at a rate and a pressure that is determined by input biomechanical parameters, enabling us to test the influence of changes in the mechanical properties of lung tissues and secretions on inhalation dynamics. By summing the dynamics of all the branches, we quantify the evolution of overall lung pressure and volume during inhalation, reproducing the shape of measured breathing curves. Using this model, we demonstrate how changes in lung muscle contraction, mucus viscosity, and surface tension, and airway wall stiffness - characteristic of many respiratory diseases, including those arising from COVID-19, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and emphysema - drastically alter inhaled lung capacity and breathing duration. Our work, therefore, helps to identify the key factors that control breathing dynamics and provides a way to quantify how disease-induced changes in these factors lead to respiratory distress. ? 2020 authors.

Moreover, computational approaches can help accelerate the process even further. Here we present the application of computational drug repositioning tools based on transcriptomics data to identify drugs that are potentially able to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also to provide insights on their mode of action.

In particular, accurate modeling of lockdown effects on human behaviour and epidemic evolution is a key issue in order e.g. to inform health-care decisions on emergency management. In this regard, the compartmental and spatial models so far proposed use parametric descriptions of the contact rate, often assuming a time-invariant effect of the lockdown. In this paper we show that these assumptions may lead to erroneous evaluations on the ongoing pandemic. Thus, we develop a new class of nonparametric compartmental models able to describe how the impact of the lockdown varies in time. Our estimation strategy does not require significant Bayes prior information and exploits regularization theory. Hospitalized data are mapped into an infinite-dimensional space, hence obtaining a function which takes into account also how social distancing measures and people's growing awareness of infection's risk evolves as time progresses. This also permits to reconstruct a continuous-time profile of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number with a resolution never reached before in the literature. When applied to data collected in Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, our model illustrates how people behaviour changed during the restrictions and its importance to contain the epidemic. Results also indicate that, at the end of the lockdown, around [Formula: see text] of people in Lombardy and [Formula: see text] in Italy was affected by SARS-CoV-2, with the fatality rate being 1.14%. Then, we discuss how the situation evolved after the end of the lockdown showing that the reproduction number dangerously increased in the summer, due to holiday relax, reaching values larger than one on August 1, 2020. Finally, we also document how Italy faced the second wave of infection in the last part of 2020. Since several countries still observe a growing epidemic and others could be subject to other waves, the proposed reproduction number tracking methodology can be of great help to health care authorities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions on human behaviour to contain the spread.","output":"Tracking the time course of reproduction number and lockdown's effect on human behaviour during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic: nonparametric estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has spread rapidly to the world.

Here, we studied the effect of ORF3 deletion on the proliferation of PEDV in Vero cells. To this end, four recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) were rescued using targeted RNA recombination, three carrying the full-length ORF3 gene from different PEDV strains, and one from which the ORF3 gene had been deleted entirely. Our results showed that PEDVs with intact or naturally truncated ORF3 replicated to significantly higher titers than PEDV without an ORF3. Further characterization revealed that the extent of apoptosis induced by PEDV infection was significantly lower with the viruses carrying an intact or C-terminally truncated ORF3 than with the virus lacking ORF3, indicating that the ORF3 protein as well as its truncated form interfered with the apoptosis process. Collectively, we conclude that PEDV ORF3 protein promotes virus proliferation by inhibiting cell apoptosis caused by virus infection.

RESULTS The prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in elderly subjects under COVID-19 quarantine in Qatar was not significantly different from the prevalence in gender and age-matched controls. In the quarantined group, higher depressive, anxiety, and stress scores were associated with the female gender and with lower resilience scores but were not linked to age, psychiatric history, medical history, duration of quarantine, or religiosity.

Moreover, the addition of ECM-like proteins could enhance the biocompatibility of these scaffolds. In this study, soluble eggshell protein (SEP) was first extracted and synthesized from the raw eggshell membrane. The characteristics and biocompatibility of the extracted SEP were evaluated using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis and 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay. For scaffolds fabrication, a three-layer nanofibrous composite structure was produced using the electrospinning technique. The outer layers composed of polyvinyl alcohol, chitosan, and extracted SEP while the middle layer composed of polyethylene oxide, gelatin, and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs). For each layer, the electrospinning parameters were adjusted to form bead-free fibers. To improve fibers' stability against body fluids, the produced fibers were crosslinked using glutaraldehyde vapor. Several techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray, ATR-FTIR, swelling, tensile test, in vitro biodegradation, and MTT assay were implemented to evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological characterization of the fabricated fibers. The results showed that crosslinked fibers have adequate stability in water, suitable mechanical properties, and promising water uptake capacity. The MTT results also revealed that SEP and ZnO-NPs could increase scaffolds biocompatibility. Moreover, SEM photographs of cultured fibroblasts cells on the scaffolds showed that cells were well attached on the scaffolds and preserve their natural spindle shapes.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including children treated for acute appendicitis (January 20th-May 11th, 2020). The data regarding the severity of appendicitis and outcome were collected and compared for two time periods, before and after the nationwide lockdown (March 17th, 2020). RESULTS: The number of cases of acute appendicitis increased by 77% during the lockdown (n = 39 vs. n = 69, p = 0.03).

Many of these projects and networks have produced relevant data, standards, methods, indicators and knowledge that may be lost as these networks become inactive. The aim of this project retrieval and review was to identify health information projects and networks and their produced output; and subsequently facilitate systematic access to this information for policy makers, researchers and interested others via a web-based repository. METHODS: The scope of this article covers 1. population health oriented topics and 2. health system/health services oriented topics. Out of scope are specific infectious diseases; individual rare diseases; and the occurrence and effects of specific medical treatments, interventions and diagnostics; cohort studies; or studies focusing on research methods. We searched bibliographic databases and EU project databases for policy supporting projects and networks and selected those fulfilling our inclusion criteria after more in-depth inspection. We searched for their outputs. In addition, we reviewed country participation in these projects and networks. RESULTS: We identified 36 projects and networks, 16 of which are population health oriented, 6 are health systems and services oriented and 14 cover both. Their total volume of output is not easily retrievable, as many project websites have been discontinued. Some networks and/or their outputs have found continuance within European agencies and/or national institutions. Others are struggling or have gone lost, despite their policy relevance. Participation in the projects was not evenly distributed across Europe. Project information was made available through the Health Information Portal. CONCLUSIONS: EU funded projects and networks have contributed greatly to the evidence-base for policy by providing comparative health information. However, more action is needed to evaluate and conserve their outputs and facilitate continued contribution to the field after project funding stops. The realization of a sustainable infrastructure for these projects and networks is urgent. The Health Information Portal can play an important role in conserving and reusing health information.

For the purpose of improving the performance of non-intrusive load decomposition, a non-intrusive load decomposition method based on a hybrid deep learning model is proposed. In this method, first of all, the data set is normalized and preprocessed. Secondly, a hybrid deep learning model integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) with long short-term memory network (LSTM) is constructed to fully excavate the spatial and temporal characteristics of load data. Finally, different evaluation indicators are used to analyze the mixture. The model is fully evaluated, and contrasted with the traditional single deep learning model. Experimental results on the open dataset UK-DALE show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of the whole network system. In this paper, the proposed decomposition method is compared with the existing traditional deep learning load decomposition method. At the same time, compared with the obtained methods: spectral decomposition, EMS, LSTM-RNN, and other algorithms, the accuracy of load decomposition is significantly improved, and the test accuracy reaches 98%.","output":"Non-intrusive load decomposition based on CNN-LSTM hybrid deep learning model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) care, and to identify underlying stressors in the German model region for complete AMI registration. The analysis was based on data from the population-based KORA Myocardial Infarction Registry located in the region of Augsburg, Germany. All cases of AMI (n = 210) admitted to one of four hospitals in the city of Augsburg or the county of Augsburg from February 10th, 2020, to May 19, 2020, were included. Patients were divided into three groups, namely pre-lockdown, strict lockdown, and attenuated lockdown period. An additional survey was conducted asking the patients for stress and fears in the 4 weeks prior to their AMI. The AMI rate declined by 44% in the strict lockdown period; in the attenuated lockdown period the rate was 17% lower compared to the pre-lockdown period. The downward trend in AMI rates during lockdown was seen in STEMI and NSTEMI patients, and independent of sex and age. The door-to-device time decreased by 70-80% in the lockdown-periods. In the time prior to the infarction, patients felt stressed mainly due to fear of infection with Sars-CoV-2 and less because of the restrictions and consequences of the lockdown. A strict lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic had a marked impact on AMI care even in a non-hot-spot region with relatively few cases of COVID-19.

METHODS: This retrospective study focused on adult convalescent outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 positive serology during the COVID-19 pandemic at NewYork Presbyterian/Weill Cornell. Data collected for descriptive and correlative analysis included SARS-COV-2 immunoglobin G (IgG) levels and history of MetS comorbidities from April 17, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Additional data, including SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lipid levels were collected and analyzed for a second cohort from May 21, 2020 to June 21, 2020.

The consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are devastating and represent the current major public health issue across the globe. At the onset, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the respiratory system as it represents the main point of entry in the host, but it also can affect multiple organs. Although most of the patients do not present symptoms or are mildly symptomatic, some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 that experience more severe multi-organ dysfunction. The severity of COVID-19 is typically combined with a set of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and/or advanced age that seriously exacerbates the consequences of the infection. Also, SARS-CoV-2 can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain during the early phases of the disease. Intestinal dysfunction induces changes in intestinal microbes, and an increase in inflammatory cytokines. Thus, diagnosing gastrointestinal symptoms that precede respiratory problems during COVID-19 may be necessary for improved early detection and treatment. Uncovering the composition of the microbiota and its metabolic products in the context of COVID-19 can help determine novel biomarkers of the disease and help identify new therapeutic targets.

Common clinical manifestations of HLH are acute unremitting fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and multiorgan failure. Due to a massive cytokine release, this clinical condition is considered as a cytokine storm syndrome. HPS has primary and acquired (secondary, reactive) forms. Its primary form is mostly seen in childhood and caused by various mutations with genetic inheritance and, therefore, is called familial HLH. Secondary HLH may be caused in the presence of an underlying disorder, that is, secondary to a malignant, infectious, or autoimmune/autoinflammatory stimulus. This paper aims to review the pathogenesis and the clinical picture of HLH, and its severe complication, the cytokine storm, with a special emphasis on the developed classification criteria sets for rheumatologists, since COVID-19 infection has clinical symptoms resembling those of the common rheumatologic conditions and possibly triggers HLH.

Finally, AND \\"COVID-19\\" was included in this algorithm. The selection is restricted to the past 5 years and limited numbers of earlier key references were manually selected. Only full-text manuscripts, published in an English language peer-reviewed journal were included. Manuscript selection procedure and numbers are given in Fig. 2. Briefly, the database search with the following terms of \\"Hemophagocytic syndrome\\" OR \\"Macrophage activation syndrome\\" OR \\"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\\" OR \\"Cytokine storm\\" yielded 6744 results from inception to April 2020.

HLH is triggered by genetic conditions, infections, malignancies, autoimmune-autoinflammatory diseases, and some drugs. In COVID-19 patients, secondary HLH and cytokine storm may be responsible for unexplained progressive fever, cytopenia, ARDS, neurological and renal impairment. Differentiation between the primary and secondary forms of HLH is utterly important, since primary form of HLH requires complicated treatments such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Spatial analysis indicated that giant pandas at Liziping (but not Daxiangling) showed a shift in habitat use away from populated areas consistent with a risk response to the foray distance of free-roaming dogs (10.9 km path-distance). Most giant panda locations (86%) from the 2014 census in Liziping were clustered around remote dog-free zones. Expanding this analysis across the entire giant panda range revealed that 40% of panda habitat is within the foray distance of dogs.

Considering that the most underprivileged population disproportionately suffers with the reduction in dental care provision, the study hypothesis suggests the presence of a syndemic nature. Methodology: The SUS Outpatient Information System (SIA-SUS) was assessed to gather data on dental care activities and procedures performed between April and July 2018, 2019, and 2020 by dentists registered in the SUS. The 30 most frequent activities and procedures performed by dentists were selected and classified into three categories (urgent dental care, nonemergency dental care, and case-dependent urgency procedures), based on the guidance for dental care during the pandemic published by the American Dental Association. Results: Results demonstrated a reduction in the provision of dental care of all categories during the pandemic. Urgency dental consultations and procedures in primary and specialized dental care services decreased by 42.5 and 44.1%, respectively, between 2020 and 2019. Non-urgent procedures decreased by 92.3%. Although decreases in dental care activities and procedures were reported in all Brazilian regions, the largest relative decreases in urgent procedures - that should have been maintained during the pandemic - occurred in the North and Northeast regions, which are the poorest regions of the country. Conclusions: These results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has a syndemic behavior. Further investigation into the pandemic-syndemic impacts on oral disease burden is necessary.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of dental procedures performed by the Brazilian Unified Health System: a syndemic perspective/ O impacto da pandemia de Covid-19 na oferta de procedimentos odontolgicos realizados pelo Sistema nico de Sade: uma perspectiva sindmica"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We present a 16-year-old male with acute respiratory distress syndrome and BAL findings consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), associated with the use of a disposable nicotine salt vaping device METHODS: A 16-year-old male presented with difficulty breathing, pleuritic chest pain, dry cough, and fever Upon admission he was distressed and hypoxic He had respiratory alkalosis, white blood cell count of 24 7 thou/Cumm with a neutrophilic predominance, lactate of 2 47 mmol/L, and a C Reactive protein of 177 4 mg/L Sars-Cov-2 nucleic amplification assay was negative Upon admission to the PICU vital signs were stable on CPAP except for persistent tachypnea Due to a clinical picture consistent with infective pneumonia, the patient was managed as such During his stay he divulged a history of vape use and provided the team with a PuffBar Lush Ice disposable e-cigarette Due to worsening of his acute hypoxic respiratory failure the patient was intubated and a bronchoscopy with BAL was performed which demonstrated an absence of purulent fluid or signs of bacterial infection BAL samples showed no pathogenic organisms but had a marked Eosinophilia (39%) with concomitant lipid-laden macrophages The patient was treated with Methylprednisolone 125mg every 6 hours for AEP and tapered over 14 days of therapy Ventilator settings were weaned steadily following systemic steroids He was intensely ventilated for 6 days with maximum oxygen index of 13 5, PIPs in the low 30's and a positive end expiratory pressure of 12cmH2O He was discharged on day 16 of admission on steroid wean Pulmonary function testing 2 weeks after discharge remained consistent with restrictive lung disease RESULTS: EVALI is a well-established mechanism of lung injury and an increasingly prevalent cause of ICU admission around the country, it is predominantly associated with Neutrophilia and lipid laden macrophages on BAL This case has an atypical cytology, consisting of an Eosinophilic predominance This is the first report of Eosinophilic Pneumonia secondary to EVALI in a patient under 18 years of age, and it represents the second reported case of this phenomena in all patient populations This incidence involves a poorly regulated nicotine salt disposable device, similar to the popular JUUL","output":"E-cigarette-associated acute eosinophilic pneumonia causing ARDS in a child"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronary CT angiograms are commonly performed for the evaluation of coronary artery disease and coronary arterial anatomy.

Minimal literature is available to guide best practices. APPROACH: The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) implemented a completely virtual interview (VI) process in April/May 2020. Large-group sessions for applicants, interviews with applicants, and ISMMS Admission Committee meetings occurred via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc., San Jose, California). Large-group sessions and committee meetings occurred via communal conference calls, while one-on-one, semi-structured interviews occurred in individual breakout rooms. ISMMS offered live, virtual question-and-answer sessions with students and faculty, plus digital resources describing program features. After the interview day, applicants and interviewers were invited to complete anonymous surveys regarding their experiences with and perspectives of VI. OUTCOMES: Of 125 applicants and 20 interviewers, 99 (79%) and 18 (90%), respectively, completed at least part of the survey. Of the applicants, 85/95 (89%) agreed VI met or exceeded expectations, many praising the day's organization and convenience, and 71/95 (75%) agreed they received a sufficient sense of the student body. A minority (n = 39/95, [41%]) felt limited in their ability to learn about the institution (commonly related to their inability to tour campus), and a majority (n =74/91, [81%]) would have preferred an in-person interview. Most interviewers felt comfortable assessing applicants' verbal communication skills (n = 13/16, [81%]), and most (n = 12/17, [71%]) felt VI should be an option for future applicants. NEXT STEPS: VI, likely to be a temporary-but-universal fixture of upcoming application cycles, may benefit applicants and interviewers alike by saving resources and diversifying those involved. Next steps are developing programming that will permit applicants to virtually explore the institution and connect more with current students. Future research should evaluate potential bias in VI to ensure an equitable application process for all.","output":"Key Insights from the Development and Implementation of a Novel Virtual Interview Process for Medical School Admissions During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a marked decrease in surgical procedures performed worldwide and to numerous other changes in medical practice. We investigated the effect of these changes on surgical trainees. Method: We searched medical records and asked a total of 67 surgical residents from different specialities (general surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, orthopedics-traumatology, neurosurgery) to answer a questionnaire investigating how the total number of surgical procedures and operative role varied for each respondent during the pandemic, the number of medical congresses and handson courses they attended during this time, how much study time was available to them and how the changes in their training modules affected them. Results: Most respondents reported a marked decrease in the number of surgical procedures performed, performing key operative steps with a lower frequency. Most of them believed that their training stagnated or suffered a setback. However, most residents consider the changes in their training during the pandemic a useful experience. Conclusion: The real effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical training should be further studied.

We evaluated the impact of interleukin (IL)-6 blockade with tocilizumab on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and the antibody response in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in patients admitted with COVID-19. Serial nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were measured for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S-IgG/N-IgG titers, respectively. FINDINGS: 138 patients with confirmed infection were included; 76 (55%) underwent IL-6 blockade. Median initial SOFA (p = 0?016) and SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p<0?001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test) were significantly higher among anti-IL-6 users. Patients under IL-6 blockade showed delayed viral clearance in the Kaplan-Meier curves (HR 0?35 [95%CI] [0?15C0?81], log-rank p = 0?014), but an adjusted propensity score matching model did not demonstrate a significant relationship of IL-6 blockade with viral clearance (HR 1?63 [0?35C7?7]). Cox regression showed an inverse association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and the initial viral load (HR 0?35 [0?11C0?89]). Patients under the IL-6 blocker showed shorter median time to seropositivity, higher peak antibody titers, and higher cumulative proportion of seropositivity in the Kaplan Meier curves (HR 3?1 [1?9C5] for S-IgG; and HR 3?0 [1?9C4?9] for N-IgG; log-rank p<0?001 for both). However, no significant differences between groups were found in either S-IgG (HR 1?56 [0?41C6?0]) nor N-IgG (HR 0?96 [0?26C3?5]) responses in an adjusted propensity score analysis. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, IL-6 blockade does not impair the viral specific antibody responses. Although a delayed viral clearance was observed, it was driven by a higher initial viral load. The study supports the safety of this therapy in patients with COVID-19.

The programme includes four parts, each centring on a different aspect of medical practice. Part 4 MOC centres on quality improvement (QI). Surveys by the ABP suggest that paediatricians are dissatisfied with aspects of part 4, but their reasons are unclear. This study sought to explore factors contributing to dissatisfaction with part 4 by focusing on performance improvement modules (PIMs), a popular means of achieving part 4 credit. METHODS: The study used cross-sectional purposive sampling drawing from US physicians working in a range of practice settings: private outpatient, hospital, academic and low-income clinics. The sampling frame was divided by practice characteristics and satisfaction level, derived from a five-point Likert item asking about physician satisfaction regarding a recent PIM. In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 physicians, and the interview data were coded, categorised into themes and analysed using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: Paediatricians expressed nuanced views of PIMs and remain globally dissatisfied with part 4, although reasons for dissatisfaction varied. Concerns with PIMs included: (1) excessive time and effort; (2) limited improvement and (3) lack of clinically relevant topics. While most agreed that QI is important, participants felt persistently dissatisfied with the mechanics of doing PIMs, especially when QI tasks fell outside of their typical work regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Paediatricians agreed that part 4, PIMs, and QI efforts in general still lack clinical relevance and need to be more easily incorporated into practice workflow. Clinicians specifically felt that PIMs must be directly integrated with physicians practice settings in terms of topic, data quality and metrics, and must address practice differences in time and monetary resources for completing large or complex projects.","output":"Exploring paediatricians experiences with performance improvement modules and quality improvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Voltage-gated sodium channels are critical for the generation and propagation of action potentials.

The questionnaire SF-36 (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36) was used to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and OHIP-14 (Oral Health Impact Profile-14) was used to evaluate the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). The severity of xerostomia was evaluated by the Xerostomia Inventory (XI). In the clinical examination, decayed (D-T), missing(M-T), and filled teeth (F-T) (DMF-T), periodontal status, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), unstimulated whole salivary flow rate (UWSFR), and stimulated whole salivary flow rate (SWSFR) were also assessed. Data were analyzed by Student's t tests, chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and Spearman's correlation. RESULTS Individuals with RA had a higher caries index (D-T/p = 0.004) and more frequent periodontal disease (PI/p = 0.017). In the SLE group, there was a significant lower salivary flow (SFR/p = 0.016, SFMS/p = 0.004) and severe xerostomia (p = 0.002). The impact of ORHQoL in individuals with RA occurred due to oral candidiasis, halitosis, and xerostomia, compromising the HRQoL.

Filling defects within the pulmonary arteries were recorded along with pleural and parenchymal findings such as ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy paving, linear consolidation, and pleural effusion. All these variables were compared between patients with and without PAFD. The predictive performance of statistically different parameters was investigated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Results: Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 15/43 patients (35%), whereas CTPA and parenchymal changes related to pulmonary COVID-19 disease were evident in 39/43 patients (91%). The revised Geneva score and the mean D-dimer value obtained using two consecutive measurements were significantly higher in patients with PAFD. The ROC analysis demonstrated that a mean D-dimer value is the parameter with the higher predictivity (AUC 0.831) that is a cut-off value > 1800 g/l which predicts the probability of PAFD with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 78%, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the types of practical and emotional problems that the general population is experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic and to construct an empirically derived inventory based on the findings. METHODS: A total of 396 participants, recruited among members of the general public in Sweden who were experiencing practical and/or emotional problems during the pandemic, accessed a self-guided digital problem-solving intervention for a period of 1 week to report and solve the problems they experienced. Prior to accessing the intervention, the participants completed a short self-assessment regarding symptoms of depression and anxiety. Content analysis was used to account for the types of problems participants reported. A set of items for an inventory was later proposed based on the problem categories derived from the analysis. RESULTS: A majority of participants had clinically relevant symptoms of either depression or anxiety. The problems reported were categorized as 13 distinct types of problems.

Evaluation of early SC2 strains suggested limited viral genetic diversity. However, genetic and epidemiologic investigations in the interim have revealed impressive genetic variability. Many of these viral variants are now defined as variants of concern (VOC) based on genetic alterations in their spike (S) and other proteins that cause enhanced transmissibility, decreased susceptibility to antibody neutralization or therapeutics and or their ability to induce severe disease. The delta () and omicron (o) variants are particularly problematic based on their impressive and unprecedented transmissibility and ability to cause break through infections. The delta variant also accumulates at high concentrations in host tissues and has caused waves of lethal disease. SC2 infection is mediated by S protein binding to cellular ACE2 receptors and subsequent S protein protease processing. Because studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) stimulates ACE2 and S priming proteases, studies were undertaken to determine if interventions that target CHI3L1 are effective inhibitors of SC2 viral variant infection. Here we demonstrate that CHI3L1 augments epithelial cell infection by pseudoviruses that express the alpha, beta, gamma, delta or omicron S proteins and that the CHI3L1 inhibitors anti-CHI3L1 and kasugamycin inhibit epithelial cell infection by these VOC pseudovirus moieties.

Sustainable bioeconomy requires improvement in the productivity level of bioresources, which is included in almost all national bioeconomy strategies. However, the aspects of sustainable bioeconomy were analyzed rather scarcely. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to reveal how productivity (or conversely, intensity) level contributes to the changes in biomass extraction in all EU countries. Applying the decomposition of impact (I), population, (P), affluence, (A); and technology (IPAT) approach, the results showed that in separate EU countries and analyzed periods, the changes in biomass extraction were different. During the period of economic growth (2000C2007) and transition (2008C2012), biomass extraction decreased in more than half of all EU countries. The decline of value added in the agriculture sector and/or reduction in biomass intensity level were the main determinants of these changes. Meanwhile, during the bioeconomy strategy period (2013C2018), the reduction in biomass extractions was observed in only six EU countries. During this period, the productivity level of biomass increased and offset the economic and population growth only in Greece, Italy and Malta. Thus, due to advanced technologies in these countries, the economy grew but biomass extraction decreased. Meanwhile, in Estonia, Germany and Poland, despite the reduction in value added in the agriculture sector, the growth of the intensity level of biomass determined the increase in extraction of biomass. Therefore, this study showed that achievement of sustainable bioeconomy principles in the majority of EU countries remains a great challenge, and countries should make all efforts to enhance the productivity level of biomass.","output":"The main determinants of changes in biomass extraction: the decomposition analysis approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include older age, male sex, obesity, Black or Asian ethnicity and underlying medical conditions.

Increased risk of developing COVID-19 was independently associated with Asian/Asian British vs. White ethnicity (aOR 2.31, 95% CI 1.35-3.95), household overcrowding (aOR per additional 0.5 people/bedroom 1.26, 1.11-1.43), any vs. no visits to/from other households in previous week (aOR 1.33, 1.07-1.64), number of visits to indoor public places (aOR per extra visit per week 1.05, 1.01-1.09), frontline occupation outside health/social care vs. no frontline occupation (aOR 1.49, 1.12-1.98), and raised body mass index (BMI) (aOR 1.51 [1.20-1.90] for BMI 25.0-30.0 kg/m2 and 1.38 [1.05-1.82] for BMI >30.0 kg/m2 vs. BMI <25.0 kg/m2). Atopic disease was independently associated with decreased risk (aOR 0.76, 0.59-0.98). No independent associations were seen for age, sex, other medical conditions, diet, or micronutrient supplement use. Interpretation: After rigorous adjustment for factors influencing exposure to SARS-CoV-2, Asian/Asian British ethnicity and raised BMI were associated with increased risk of developing COVID-19, while atopic disease was associated with decreased risk.","output":"Risk factors for developing COVID-19: a population-based longitudinal study (COVIDENCE UK)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety levels, contamination and responsibility/control obsessions and associated OC behaviors in healthcare versus non-healthcare professionals.

The purpose of this study was to compare the number of postoperative visits in WC to non-WC patients after common upper extremity surgical procedures. Methodology All patients who underwent one of four common surgical procedures (carpal tunnel release, De Quervains release, cubital tunnel release, and trigger finger release) between 2016 and 2019 were identified. A total of 64 surgeries billed under WC were randomly selected and matched 1:1 to surgeries billed outside of WC based on the primary CPT code. Results The most common procedure was carpal tunnel release (42 patients), followed by trigger finger release (30 patients), cubital tunnel release (28 patients), and De Quervains release (16 patients). The average number of postoperative visits was 2.3 (median = 2, range: 1-9) and was significantly higher in the WC group (mean/median = 3.0/3 versus 1.5/1, p < 0.001). Within the 90-day global postoperative billing period, the mean number of visits was 2.2 (median = 2, range: 1-4) in the WC group and 1.4 (median = 1, range: 1-3) in the non-WC group (p < 0.001). The average time to clinical discharge in the WC group was 101 days (range: 10-446 days), and in the non-WC group was 40 days (range: 7-474 days) (p < 0.001). Five patients (7.8%) in the WC group and four patients (6.3%) in the non-WC group were seen for unplanned visits after clinical discharge. Conclusions WC status conferred more postoperative visits after common upper extremity surgical procedures, both within and beyond the global billing period.

Therefore, prevention measures against other infectious diseases among this vulnerable group have gained increased attention. Indeed, the EACS guidelines recommend vaccinations against HAV, HBV, HPV, Influenza, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and VZV in HIV-infected adults. METHODS: All PLWH under cART attending our ID outpatient clinic between April to June 2018, were assessed during consultation for vaccination status regarding pneumococcus, Hepatitis A and B, influenza, varicella, meningococcus and HPV using a pre-defined questionnaire, vaccination certificates and medical records. In addition, the cohort database was screened for Hepatitis A and B serology and HIV surrogate markers. RESULTS: A total of 305 PLWH (82.3% male, 17.7% female) was included, median age was 48 years (IQR 47C51). Median CD4 + T cell count was 543 (IQR 304C770), and for 297 (97.4%) PLWH CD4 + T cell count was  200/ul. The viral load was undetectable (< 40 copies/ml) in 289 (94.8%) cases.

However, reference genomes usually do not represent the full range of genetic diversity of a species as a result of geographical divergence and independent demographic events of different populations. For the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome), which occurs in high copy numbers in cells and is strictly maternally inherited, an optimal reference sequence has the potential to make mitogenome alignment both more accurate and more efficient. In this study, we used three different types of reference sequences for mitogenome mapping, i.e., the commonly used reference sequence (CU-ref), the breed-specific reference sequence (BS-ref) and the sample-specific reference sequence (SS-ref), respectively, and compared the accuracy of mitogenome alignment and SNP calling among them, for the purpose of proposing the optimal reference sequence for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses of specific populations RESULTS: Four pigs, representing three different breeds, were high-throughput sequenced, subsequently mapping reads to the reference sequences mentioned above, resulting in a largest mapping ratio and a deepest coverage without increased running time when aligning reads to a BS-ref. Next, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling was carried out by 18 detection strategies with the three tools SAMtools, VarScan and GATK with different parameters, using the bam results mapping to BS-ref. The results showed that all eighteen strategies achieved the same high specificity and sensitivity, which suggested a high accuracy of mitogenome alignment by the BS-ref because of a low requirement for SNP calling tools and parameter choices. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that different reference sequences representing different genetic relationships to sample reads influenced mitogenome alignment, with the breed-specific reference sequences being optimal for mitogenome analyses, which provides a refined processing perspective for NGS data.

Conclusion. For the working population, male sex and diabetes may be a significant risk factor for developing COVID-19. Influenza vaccination should be considered as a factor in anti- COVID-19 protection. Cardiovascular diseas e and smoking may serve as additional risk factors. ? 2021 Infectious Diseases: News, Opinions, Training.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Three populations-newborn-mother pairs, neonates with sepsis, and infants (3 months) with nonpostinfectious (NPIH) or postinfectious (PIH) hydrocephalus-were evaluated for CMV infection at 3 medical centers in Uganda. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to characterize the prevalence of CMV. RESULTS: The overall CMV prevalence in 2498 samples across all groups was 9%. In newborn-mother pairs, there was a 3% prevalence of cord blood CMV positivity and 33% prevalence of maternal vaginal shedding. In neonates with clinical sepsis, there was a 2% CMV prevalence. Maternal HIV seropositivity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 25.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.43-134.26; p = 0.0001), residence in eastern Uganda (aOR 11.06; 95% CI 2.30-76.18; p = 0.003), maternal age <25 years (aOR 4.54; 95% CI 1.40-19.29; p = 0.02), and increasing neonatal age (aOR 1.08 for each day older; 95% CI 1.00-1.16; p = 0.05), were associated risk factors for CMV in neonates with clinical sepsis. We found a 2-fold higher maternal vaginal shedding in eastern (45%) vs western (22%) Uganda during parturition (n = 22/49 vs 11/50, the Fisher exact test; p = 0.02). In infants with PIH, the prevalence in blood was 24% and in infants with NPIH, it was 20%.

METHODS This open-label, multicenter study enrolled 117 patients with post-herpetic neuralgia, HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy, or painful diabetic neuropathy. Patients received pretreatment with one of three lidocaine 4%-based topical anesthetics (L.M.X.4(?) [Ferndale Laboratories Inc, Ferndale, MI], Topicaine(?) Gel [Estela Basso, Jupiter, FL], or Betacaine Enhanced Gel 4 [Tiberius Inc, Tampa, FL]) for 60 minutes followed by a single 60- or 90-minute NGX-4010 application, and were followed for 12 weeks. Tolerability and safety measures included \\"pain now\\" Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) scores, dermal assessments, medication use for treatment-related pain, adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory parameters, physical examinations, and vital signs. The primary efficacy variable was the percentage change in mean NPRS scores for \\"average pain for the past 24 hours\\" from baseline to weeks 2 through 12. RESULTS Treatment with NGX-4010 following pretreatment with any of the three topical anesthetics was generally safe and well tolerated. Nearly all patients completed 90% of the planned NGX-4010 application duration. The most common treatment-related AEs, application-site burning and application-site pain, were transient, mostly mild or moderate, and could be adequately managed by local cooling or short-acting oral opioid analgesics. Although slightly more patients used medication for treatment-related discomfort following pretreatment with Topicaine compared with L.M.X.4 or Betacaine, there were no statistical differences between the topical anesthetics. Neuropathic pain reduction from baseline to weeks 2 through 12 was approximately 30% and was similar among the topical anesthetics; the proportion of responders ranged from 45% to 50%.

This call to action was answered by creating an innovative Fundamentals of COVID-19 course at the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM). As a group of medical student leaders at IUSM, we developed this online course in order to support our fellow students and the community. METHODS: The study examined the educational effects of completing the Fundamentals of COVID-19 course. In order to examine these effects, the study asked enrolled students to complete both a pre- and post-course self-assessment survey. Students were asked an identical set of questions on each survey about their knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) regarding COVID-19. Composite scores were created for each KSA learning domain. Responses were provided using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. RESULTS: Out of the 724 students enrolled, 645 students completed both the pre- and post-course assessment surveys. Findings show that there were both meaningful and statistically significant differences in students responses to the pre- and post-course surveys. Results show 1.) a significant mean increase in the knowledge composite score of 1.01, 95% CI [0.95, 1.06], t(644) = 36.4, p < .001, d = 1.43; 2.) a significant mean increase in the skills composite score of .55, 95% CI [0.50, 0.60], t(644) = 20.70, p < .001, d = 0.81. and 3.) a significant mean increase of the abilities composite score of 1.02, 95% CI [.97, 1.07], t(644) = 36.56, p < .001, d = 1.44. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the student-developed, online Fundamentals of COVID-19 course resulted in notable and statistically significant educational effects. The increase in students self-reported ratings, especially in the knowledge and abilities domains, indicate that meaningful learning occurred within the course. These findings have notable implications for medical student training during healthcare emergencies, such as a pandemic, as well as within modern clerkship environments. Overall, our findings provide evidence that student-led curricular design and virtual delivery of course content can be effective tools in undergraduate medical education.

This study uses a natural experiment design to investigate the effect of the Covid-19 lockdown on parental mental health, parenting stress and three dimensions of destructive interparental conflict in a heterogeneous sample characterized by pre-existing relationship problems. Results from mixed model regression analyses showed that despite significantly higher levels of parenting stress in the lockdown group (n = 744 families) compared with the control group (n = 427 families), lockdown did not adversely affect parental mental health or levels of destructive conflicts behaviors. In fact, levels of verbal aggression and child involvement in conflict decreased during lockdown among parents living apart. Pre-existing destructive conflict levels, financial problems and age of youngest child did not moderate any of the associations. Thus, findings indicated that pre-existing family vulnerability did not predispose for reduced parental functioning during lockdown, beyond increased parenting stress. Resilient processes and an increased sense of purpose may be potential mechanisms. Caution should be taken when generalizing the findings due to the welfare context of the sample and as long-term lockdown effects were not investigated. Importantly, children in vulnerable families may have been negatively impacted by increased family time, despite relatively stable parental functioning during lockdown.","output":"Effects of Covid-19 lockdown on parental functioning in vulnerable families"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making is an essential principle for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), where asymptomatic people consider lifelong medication and lifestyle changes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and evaluate the first literacy-sensitive CVD prevention decision aid (DA) developed for people with low health literacy, and investigate the impact of literacy-sensitive design and heart age. METHODS: We developed a standard DA based on international standards. The standard DA was based on our existing general practitioner DA. The literacy-sensitive DA included simple language, supporting images, white space, and a lifestyle action plan. The control DA used Heart Foundation materials. A randomized trial included 859 people aged 45-74 years using a 3 (DA: standard, literacy-sensitive, control) 2 (heart age: heart age + percentage risk, percentage risk only) factorial design, with outcomes including prevention intentions and behaviors, gist and verbatim knowledge of risk, credibility, emotional response, and decisional conflict. We iteratively improved the literacy-sensitive version based on end-user testing interviews with 20 people with varying health literacy levels. RESULTS: Immediately after the intervention (n=859), there were no differences in any outcome among the DA groups. The heart age group was less likely to have a positive emotional response, perceived the message as less credible, and had higher gist and verbatim knowledge of heart age risk but not percentage risk. After 4 weeks (n=596), the DA group had better gist knowledge of percentage risk than the control group. The literacy-sensitive DA group had higher fruit consumption, and the standard DA group had better verbatim knowledge of percentage risk. Verbatim knowledge was higher for heart age than for percentage risk among those who received both. CONCLUSIONS: The literacy-sensitive DA resulted in increased knowledge of CVD risk and increased fruit consumption in participants with varying health literacy levels and CVD risk results. Adding heart age did not increase lifestyle change intentions or behavior but did affect psychological outcomes, consistent with previous findings. This tool will be integrated with additional resources to improve other lifestyle outcomes.

Common phenotypes of asthma, referred to as eosinophilic asthma, are characterized by the presence of eosinophilia. Eosinophils are usually considered invariant, terminally differentiated effector cells and have become a primary therapeutic target in severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) and other eosinophil-associated diseases (EADs). Biological treatments that target eosinophils reveal an unexpectedly complex role of eosinophils in asthma, including in SEA, suggesting that not all eosinophils are equal. In this review, we address our current understanding of the role of eosinophils in asthma with regard to asthma phenotypes and endotypes. We further address the possibility that different SEA phenotypes may involve differences in eosinophil biology. We discuss how these differences could arise through eosinophil endotyping, viz. adaptations of eosinophil function imprinted during their development, or through tissue-induced plasticity, viz. local adaptations of eosinophil function through interaction with their lung tissue niches. In doing so, we also discuss opportunities, technical challenges, and open questions that, if addressed, might provide considerable benefits in guiding the choice of the most efficient precision therapies of SEA and, by extension, other EADs.","output":"Eosinophils as Drivers of Severe Eosinophilic Asthma: Endotypes or Plasticity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An introduction is presented in which the editor discusses articles in the issue on topics including comparative and international education, COVID-19 pandemic, and white supremacy.","output":"Comparative Education Review: A 2020 Retrospective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to best protect the world from SARS-CoV-2 as variants emerge and despite limited vaccine supply are ongoing.

Monthly visits were assessed by visit type (new consultation, follow-up), diagnosis, and clinic. Time series analyses compared visit volumes pre- and post-pandemic. Proportion of virtual visits were compared before and during the pandemic. Patient and visit factors were compared between in-person and virtual visits. RESULTS: 8274 patients with 34,021 visits were included. Monthly visits increased by 15% during the pandemic (p < 0.0001). New consultations decreased by 10% (p = 0.0053) but follow-up visits increased by 21% (p < 0.0001).

METHODS: Fifty-three discharged COVID-19 patients were enrolled at Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University, between January 21 and March 10, 2020. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between CT scores and laboratory indicators. Patients were divided into the Wuhan group (lived in or with travel to Wuhan, numbering 30 cases) and non-Wuhan group (close contacts or unknown exposure, totaling 23 cases). The CT and laboratory findings were compared between and within groups during the clinical process. RESULTS: Fever (88.7%), cough (64.2%), fatigue (34%), and abnormal laboratory indicators, including lymphopenia, reduced albumin, albumin/globulin (A/G), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), were mainly observed. Subpleural ground-glass opacities (86.8%) were usually detected at admission. The CT scores were highly correlated with lymphocytes, CRP, albumin, and A/G at initial and follow-ups (all p < 0.05). Four days after admission, most patients (66.7% Wuhan, 47.8% non-Wuhan) showed progression, and the CT scores of Wuhan significantly increased (p = 0.015).

Abstract Community-acquired pneumonias are major causes of hospitalization and death. Immediate assessment of severity, based on accurate clinical criteria, is an important step for rapid intensive care management and control of organ failures. Appropriate microbiological sampling should be performed prior to the antimicrobial therapy that should be initiated promptly after the diagnostic. Despite identification techniques, only 50% of community-acquired pneumonia cases are documented. Antibiotherapy is initially empirical. The goal is to provide optimal therapy for the most commonly identified causes of lethal pneumonia: extracellular and intracellular pathogens. A therapeutic regimen with a -lactam combined with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone is recommended. This combination should be always active against pneumococci. Despite increased pneumococcal penicillin resistance, the recent recommendations are not modified. Respiratory fluoroquinolones may be an alternative in case of major increase of pneumococcal resistance to -lactams. In some special populations, with regard to underlying structural disease of the lung and other risk factors, Pseudomonas aeruginosa must be taken into account. The severity of some community-acquired pneumonias necessitates the use of adjunctive treatments. Reassessment should be undertaken 72 hours after initiation of therapy in order to evaluate the response to treatment, to simplify or to readapt the empirical treatment. Unjustified continuation of wide spectrum antibiotics leads to adverse events and widespread of bacterial resistance. The poor outcome of severe pneumonias justifies research on initial process of care and new therapeutics.","output":"Pneumonies communautaires graves de l'adulte"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research was conducted to examine the extent to which market uncertainty can encourage market players, especially SMEs, to exploit innovation and environmentally friendly orientation to improve their performance. From a supply chain perspective, market uncertainty, which in this study is proxied by the Covid-19 pandemic, has great potential to reduce performance and disrupt production and distribution lines as well as consumer demand. This encourages affected SMEs, such as SMEs that focus on providing tourism products, such as fashion and merchandise, to maintain their performance with product innovation, and minimize the use of non-environmentally friendly products. The object of research is Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) producing tourism souvenirs in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Using the analysis technique of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with 150 respondents, the findings indicate that market uncertainty serves as a catalyst for SMEs to maintain performance through marketing innovation and product reorientation. Specifically, the results show that there is a positive and significant influence between innovation and green orientation on SME performance, and the mediating effect of market uncertainty to increase marketing innovation and environmentally friendly orientation. These findings theoretically contribute to explaining the relationship between supply chain management in the context of market uncertainty.

Increased blood viscosity in microcirculation can lead to a decrease in oxygenation and nutrition of tissues. Therefore erythrocyte aggregation and erythrocyte deformability may be involved in covid-19 severity, leading to tissue hypoxia and a decrease of drug concentration in affected organs.

For comparison, concentration was also measured in immediate surroundings (n = 56) of all the sites. To get preliminary information on safety practices, a survey study was also conducted. The mean TVOC and HCHO concentration in the sites ranged from 1.5?8 mg/m(3) and <0.01C5.5 mg/m(3), respectively. The indoor: outdoor TVOC and HCHO ratio (I/O) was found to be significantly higher (I/O > 1.5 and p < 0.05) in 34 (~61%) and 47 sites (84%), respectively. A strong positive correlation between HCHO and TVOC concentration was observed in furniture industry (R = 0.91) and metal workshops (R = 0.98).

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Many state governors enacted EOs curtailing elective surgery to protect scare resources and generate hospital capacity for patients with COVID-19. Little is known of the effectiveness of an EO on achieving a sustained reduction in elective surgery. METHODS This retrospective cohort study of data from a statewide claims-based registry in Michigan includes claims from the largest private payer in the state for a representative set of elective operations on adult patients from February 2 through August 1, 2020. We reported trends in surgical volume over the period the EO was in place. Estimated backlogs in elective surgery were calculated using case counts from the same period in 2019. RESULTS Hospitals achieved an 91.7% reduction in case volume before the EO was introduced. By the time the order was rescinded, hospitals were already performing elective surgery at 60.1% of pre-pandemic case rates. We estimate that a backlog of 6,419 operations was created while the EO was in effect. Had hospitals ceased elective surgery during this period, an additional 18% of patients would have experienced a delay in surgical care. CONCLUSIONS Both the introduction and removal of Michigan's EO lagged behind the observed ramp-down and ramp-up in elective surgical volume. These data suggest that EOs may not effectively modulate surgical care and could also contribute to unnecessary delays in surgical care.","output":"Association of Elective Surgical Volume with State Executive Order Curtailing Elective Surgery in Michigan During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effect of stent boost subtract (SBS) imaging on stent underexpansion during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by optical coherence tomography (OCT).

Samples were tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1C4, influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and human rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and bocavirus. Results. Of 458 patients, 116 (25%) had respiratory viruses detected pre-HCT. Overall, patients with viruses detected pre-HCT had fewer days alive and out of the hospital and lower survival at day 100 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3C4.5; P = .007) than patients with negative samples; this risk was also present with rhinovirus alone (aHR for mortality, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2C5.5; P = .01).

Sensitive molecular-based assays aid virus detection, but the clinical significance of positive tests remains uncertain as some viruses may be found in both acutely ill and healthy children. We describe disease-pathogen associations of respiratory viruses and quantify virus-specific attributable risk of ARIs in healthy children during the first 2 years of life. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight term newborn babies in Brisbane, Australia, were recruited progressively into a longitudinal, community-based, birth cohort study conducted between September 2010 and October 2014. A daily tick-box diary captured predefined respiratory symptoms from birth until their second birthday. Weekly parent-collected nasal swabs were batch-tested for 17 respiratory viruses by PCR assays, allowing calculation of virus-specific attributable fractions in the exposed (AFE) to determine the proportion of virus-positive children whose ARI symptoms could be attributed to that particular virus. RESULTS: Of 8100 nasal swabs analysed, 2646 (32.7%) were virus-positive (275 virus codetections, 3.4%), with human rhinoviruses accounting for 2058/2646 (77.8%) positive swabs. Viruses were detected in 1154/1530 (75.4%) ARI episodes and in 984/4308 (22.8%) swabs from asymptomatic periods. Respiratory syncytial virus (AFE: 68% (95% CI 45% to 82%)) and human metapneumovirus (AFE: 69% (95% CI 43% to 83%)) were strongly associated with higher risk of lower respiratory symptoms.

This study aimed to systematically assess a broad range of continuous traits to separate their direct effects on coronary and peripheral artery disease from those mediated by type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Our main analysis was a two-step Mendelian randomisation for mediation to quantify the extent to which the associations observed between continuous traits and liability to atherosclerotic CVD were mediated by liability to type 2 diabetes. To support this analysis, we performed several univariate Mendelian randomisation analyses to examine the associations between our continuous traits, liability to type 2 diabetes and liability to atherosclerotic CVD. RESULTS: Eight traits were eligible for the two-step Mendelian randomisation with liability to coronary artery disease as the outcome and we found similar direct and total effects in most cases. Exceptions included fasting insulin and hip circumference where the proportion mediated by liability to type 2 diabetes was estimated as 56% and 52%, respectively. Six traits were eligible for the analysis with liability to peripheral artery disease as the outcome. Again, we found limited evidence to support mediation by liability to type 2 diabetes for all traits apart from fasting insulin (proportion mediated: 70%).

METHODS: From September 2016 to July 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional, community-based study of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases and household contacts of several transmission chains in Kono District, Sierra Leone. We analyzed 154 quarantined households, comprising both reported EVD cases and their close contacts. We used epidemiological surveys and blood samples to define severity of illness as no infection, pauci-/asymptomatic infection, unrecognized EVD, reported EVD cases who survived, or reported EVD decedents. We determine seropositivity with the Filovirus Animal Nonclinical Group EBOV glycoprotein immunoglobulin G antibody test. We defined levels of exposure risk from 8 questions and considered contact with body fluid as maximum exposure risk. RESULTS: Our analysis included 76 reported EVD cases (both decedents and survivors) and 421 close contacts. Among these contacts, 40 were seropositive (22 paucisymptomatic and 18 unrecognized EVD), accounting for 34% of the total 116 EBOV infections. Higher exposure risks were associated with having had EBOV infection (maximum risk: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 12.1 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 5.8C25.4; trend test: P < .001) and more severe illness (maximum risk: AOR, 25.2 [95% CI, 6.2C102.4]; trend test: P < .001).

There is limited evidence that assesses health care workers' depression and its associated factors in the study area during the Coronavirus disease pandemic. Therefore this study aimed to assess depression and associated factors among health care workers in eastern Ethiopia. Method: The cross-sectional study design was conducted from October 26th to November 15, 2020. A total of 265 health care workers from 10 health facilities participated. Patient Health Questionnaire was used for the collection of depressive symptoms. The data were analyzed by using STATA version 14 software. To assess the association between depression and the predictors Adjusted Odds Ratio along with a 95% confidence interval was estimated by using logistic regression analysis. A statistical significance was declared at p-value  0.05. Results: Of the total 265 study participant, 176 (66.4%) and 95% CI: 60.4%, 71.8% of them reported depressive symptoms. Of 176 reported symptoms of depression 27.9, 24.1, 9.4, 3.7, and 1.1% were had minimal, mild, moderate, moderate-severe, and severe depressive symptoms respectively. The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the odds of depression were 2.34 times higher among female participants compared to male participants (AOR: 2.34, 95%CI: 1.09-5.02). In addition, the odds of depression for participants who perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 was 4.05 times higher among their counterpart (AOR: 4.05, 95%CI: 1.12-14.53). Conclusions: Health care workers who experienced depression in the study was high. Health care workers' mental health needs to be protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Female health care workers and health care workers perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 need attention.","output":"Magnitude and Predictors of Health Care Workers Depression During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Health Facility-Based Study in Eastern Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in the dog has resisted progress for decades, due to their unique reproductive physiology. This lack of progress is remarkable given the critical role ART could play in conserving endangered canid species or eradicating heritable disease through gene-editing technologies-an approach that would also advance the dog as a biomedical model. Over 350 heritable disorders/traits in dogs are homologous with human conditions, almost twice the number of any other species. Here we report the first live births from in vitro fertilized embryos in the dog. Adding to the practical significance, these embryos had also been cryopreserved. Changes in handling of both gametes enabled this progress. The medium previously used to capacitate sperm excluded magnesium because it delayed spontaneous acrosome exocytosis. We found that magnesium significantly enhanced sperm hyperactivation and ability to undergo physiologically-induced acrosome exocytosis, two functions essential to fertilize an egg. Unlike other mammals, dogs ovulate a primary oocyte, which reaches metaphase II on Days 4-5 after the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. We found that only on Day 6 are oocytes consistently able to be fertilized. In vitro fertilization of Day 6 oocytes with sperm capacitated in medium supplemented with magnesium resulted in high rates of embryo development (78.8%, n = 146). Intra-oviductal transfer of nineteen cryopreserved, in vitro fertilization (IVF)-derived embryos resulted in seven live, healthy puppies. Development of IVF enables modern genetic approaches to be applied more efficiently in dogs, and for gamete rescue to conserve endangered canid species.","output":"Live Births from Domestic Dog (Canis familiaris) Embryos Produced by In Vitro Fertilization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is defined as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis occurring in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to discuss the incidence, characteristics, diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, and outcomes of hospitalized patients diagnosed with CAPA. METHODS: A literature search was performed through Pubmed and Web of Science databases for articles published up to March 20th, 2021. RESULTS: In 1,421 COVID-19 patients, the overall CAPA incidence was 13.5% (ranging 2.5-35.0%). The majority required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The time to CAPA diagnosis from illness onset varied between 8.0-16.0 days. However, the time to CAPA diagnosis from ICU admission and IMV initiation ranged between 4.0-15.0 days and 3.0-8.0 days. The most common diagnostic criteria were the modified AspICU-Dutch/Belgian Mycosis Study Group and IAPA-Verweij et al. 77.6% of patients had positive lower respiratory tract cultures, other fungal biomarkers of BAL and serum galactomannan were positive in 45.3% and 18.2% of patients. The CAPA mortality rate was high at 48.4%, despite the widespread use of antifungals. Lengthy hospital and ICU LOS ranging between 16.0-37.5 days and 10.5-37.0 days were observed. CAPA patients had prolonged IMV duration of 13.0-20.0 days. CONCLUSION: The true incidence of CAPA likely remains unknown as the diagnosis is limited by the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria that rely solely on microbiological data with direct or indirect detection of Aspergillus in respiratory specimens, particularly in clinical conditions with a low pretest probability. A well-designed, multi-center study to determine the optimal diagnostic approach for CAPA is required.","output":"The Incidence, Diagnosis, and Outcomes of COVID-19-associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA): A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivated by recent advances in technologies, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) have seen a rise in behavioral medicine research that in real-time, informs the context for the behavior and prompts interventions to change that behavior in the natural setting when necessary.

Our objective is to provide a theoretically based perspective for the combined and synergistic use of EMA and EMI to promote person-centered, recovery-based durable changes in functional movement behaviors of stroke survivors. Research abounds for non-stroke populations with emerging evidence for the benefits of using real-time data capture techniques (i.e. EMA) coupled with EMI to better customize the content and timing of interventions to the inherent fluctuations in state and context that encompass the target behavior. We review existing EMA and EMI literature broadly in behavioral medicine and psychological science to identify how real-time repeated sampling technology has been used in the context of stroke rehabilitation and to delineate the pros and cons of this approach in general with non-stroke populations. We propose a coupled EMA and EMI strategy be used in conjunction with existing stroke recovery and rehabilitation practices. There is tremendous potential to effectively personalize recovery-promoting interventions to achieve durable behavior change, and importantly, shift the focus of rehabilitation practice from the health-care provider and clinical environment to the individual and their lived experience in the home and community.","output":"A perspective on the use of ecological momentary assessment and intervention to promote stroke recovery and rehabilitation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to examine the impact of predictability on dual-task performance by systematically manipulating predictability in either one of two tasks, as well as between tasks.

However, it is currently not well understood what drives resource-allocation policy in dual tasks and which resource allocation policies participants pursue. We used a continuous tracking task together with an audiomotor task and manipulated advance visual information about the tracking path in the first experiment and a sound sequence in the second experiments (2a/b). Results show that performance predominantly improved in the predictable task but not in the unpredictable task, suggesting that participants did not invest more resources into the unpredictable task. One possible explanation was that the re-investment of resources into another task requires some relationship between the tasks. Therefore, in the third experiment, we covaried the two tasks by having sounds 250 ms before turning points in the tracking curve. This enabled participants to improve performance in both tasks, suggesting that resources were shared better between tasks.","output":"The impact of predictability on dual-task performance and implications for resource-sharing accounts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous unexplained pneumonia cases were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by Wuhan, China, in December 2020.

Using the validated CFD model, we investigated the effects of the airflow vortex structure on contaminant transmission based on quantitative analysis. It was found that the contaminant source located in a vorticity-dominated region was more likely to be locked in the vortex, resulting in higher 62% higher average concentration and 14% longer residual time than that when the source was on a deformation dominated location. The contaminant concentrations also differed between the front and rear parts of the cabin because of different airflow structures.

So, monitoring mental health issues to understand the mediating factors and inform evidence-based interventions in a timely fashion is vital. PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess generalized anxiety disorder and its associated factors among HCWs fighting COVID-19 in Southern Ethiopia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 798 HCWs from 20 May to 20 June 2020. A pre-tested and structured interviewer-administered KOBO collect survey tool was used to collect data. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique by allocating a proportion to each health institute. The association between the level of generalized anxiety disorder and its independent variables was examined by ordinal logistic regression. Assumptions for the proportional odds model were checked using parallel line tests. An adjusted proportional odds ratio with a 95% CI was used to calculate the strength of the statistical association between the independent and dependent variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of mild and moderate anxiety disorder among HCWs was 29.3% and 6.3%, respectively. Contact with confirmed or suspected cases (aPOR =1.97; 95% CI: 1.239, 3.132), no COVID-19 updates (aPOR=4.816, 95% CI=2.957, 7.842), no confidence on coping with stresses (aPOR=2.74, 95% CI=1.633, 4.606), and COVID-19-related worry (aPOR=1.85, 95% CI=1.120, 3.056) were positively associated with higher-order anxiety disorder. However, not feeling overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life (aPOR=0.52, 95% CI=0.370, 0.733) and feeling cannot make it (aPOR=0.44, 95% CI=0.308, 0.626) were negatively associated with a higher order of anxiety. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that the prevalence of anxiety disorder among HCWs was high in the study area. The findings of the current study suggest immediate psychological intervention for health care workers in the study area is vital. Therefore, proactive measures should be taken by the stakeholders at different hierarchies to promote the psychological wellbeing of HCWs in order to control the impact of the pandemic on the HCWs, and containing the pandemic.","output":"Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Its Associated Factors Among Health Care Workers Fighting COVID-19 in Southern Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is rapidly evolving and affecting healthcare systems across the world.

Several aspects such as environmental, psychological and constitutional factors contribute to OA pain and they were enhanced during and after lockdown, for COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the modified lifestyle forced by lockdown on joint pain using Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) scale. the variation of VAS pain, the reduction of physical activity, the variation of body weight, the stress values defined by Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the use of anxiolytics and antidepressant drugs were measured in OA patiens during the lockdown period. Methods: 74 adult patients affected by primary or secondary OA were included. The median age was 69.8 years old and 55/74 (74%) of the patients were female. Sex, age, comorbidities, pharmacological therapy, variation rate of VAS pain referred to OA symptoms (0-100) during lockdown, weight variation, degree of physical activity (defined as: absent 0 h, low 1-5 h, moderate 6-10 h, high > 10 h) were recorded. Perceived stress using PSS was recorded and patients were divided into two classes: low (0-13) or moderate-high (14-40) stress scale. This observational retrospective real-life study was conducted in May 2020. A linear regression model was used to analyze the different patients groups separately. Overall variables were expressed on analogic scales. To assess the impact on VAS pain, regression models were estimated with VAS pain as dependent variable, and weight increase, physical activity and perceived stress as independent variable. Results: Patients enrolled with a pre lockdown VAS pain < 40 were 30, whereas 44 patients referred a pre lockdown VAS pain > 40. Patients taking anxiolytics, antidepressant, anxiolytics or antidepressant drugs were 14/74 (19%), 7/74 (9%), 19/74 (26%) respectively. PSS score Low (score 0-13), Med (score 14-26), High (score 27-40) was recorded in 34/74 (46%), 36/74 (49%), 4/74 (5%) patients respectively. Patients were divided in two different groups on the basis of baseline pre lockdown VAS pain: low VAS pain (< 40) (n=30) and moderate-high ( 40) (n=44). In the low-VAS group there was an average increase of pain by 1,36 points, an average increase of weight by 0.63 kg, and an average decrease of weekly physical activity by 6.4 hours that was statistically relevant (p< 0.0001). In moderate-high VAS group an average increase of pain and weight, by 2.62 points and 0.35 kg respectively, and a significant decrease of physical activity by 3.15 h weekly (p< 0.0001) has been recorded In low VAS group, 43% of the patients perceived low stress values vs 57% moderate-high. In VAS > 40 group 47% of the patients perceived low stress value vs 53% high-moderate. 80% of low-VAS <group did not take anxiolytics and antidepressant drugs and for this cluster of patients was not recorded a VAS increase regardless of PSS. 16.7% of patients (5/30) with VAS < 40, taking anxiolytics / antidepressant medications and with a moderate-high PSS displayed an average increase of VAS pain by 20 mm. In the VAS > 40 group a VAS variation was not recorded, regardless of taking anxiolytics / antidepressant medications and PSS. Conclusion: Lockdown impact on OA pain has been higher in the cluster of patients who were taking anxiolytics / antidepressant drugs with a moderate-high PSS.

This maneuver is thought to minimize the risk of elevated ICP in the hopes of decreasing cerebral blood and fluid volume and increasing cerebral venous outflow with improvement in jugular venous drainage. However, HOB elevation is based on adult population data due to a current paucity of pediatric TBI studies regarding HOB management. In this prospective study of pediatric patients with severe TBI, the authors investigated the role of different head positions on intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and cerebral venous outflow through the internal jugular veins (IJVs) on postinjury days 2 and 3 because these time periods are considered the peak risk for intracranial hypertension. METHODS: Patients younger than 18 years with a Glasgow Coma Scale score &#8804; 8 after severe TBI were prospectively recruited at a single quaternary pediatric intensive care unit. All patients had an ICP monitor placed, and no other neurosurgical procedure was performed. On the 2nd and 3rd days postinjury, the degree of HOB elevation was varied between 0 (head-flat or horizontal), 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 while ICP, CPP, and bilateral IJV blood flows were recorded. RESULTS: Eighteen pediatric patients with severe TBI were analyzed. On each postinjury day, 13 of the 18 patients had at least 1 optimal HOB position (the position that simultaneously demonstrated the lowest ICP and the highest CPP). Six patients on each postinjury day had 30 as the optimal HOB position, with only 2 being the same patient on both postinjury days. On postinjury day 2, 3 patients had more than 1 optimal HOB position, while 5 patients did not have an optimal position. On postinjury day 3, 2 patients had more than 1 optimal HOB position while 5 patients did not have an optimal position. Interestingly, 0 (head-flat or horizontal) was the optimal HOB position in 2 patients on postinjury day 2 and 3 patients on postinjury day 3. The optimal HOB position demonstrated lower right IJV blood flow than a nonoptimal position on both postinjury days 2 (p = 0.0023) and 3 (p = 0.0033). There was no significant difference between optimal and nonoptimal HOB positions in the left IJV blood flow. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with severe TBI, the authors demonstrated that the optimal HOB position (which decreases ICP and improves CPP) is not always at 30. Instead, the optimal HOB should be individualized for each pediatric TBI patient on a daily basis.","output":"Head of bed elevation in pediatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"En respuesta al aumento de las tasas de obesidad infantil, Estados Unidos y algunos pases de Latinoamrica han financiado numerosos estudios que analizan estrategias e intervenciones innovadoras.

Emerging reports of atypical and delayed clinical presentations in these patients generate further concerns for widespread disease transmission to medical personnel and the community. The striking similarities between COVID-19 and other outbreaks that took place over the past two decades, like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, highlight the severity of the situation and dictate that extra measures should be taken by the transplant programs to avoid adverse outcomes. Transplant organizations are currently calling for strict screening and isolation protocols to be established in all transplant programs, for both organ donors and recipients. As the situation escalates, more radical measures might be necessary, including a temporary hold on non-urgent transplantations, resulting in serious ethical dilemmas between the survival of these patients and the safety of the community.

Stroke patients are able to train the upper limb function using serious games at home. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of MERLIN training on the upper limb function of patients with unilateral upper limb paresis in the chronic phase of stroke (> 6 months post stroke). METHODS: Patients trained task specific serious games for three hours per week during six weeks using an unactuated version of a robotic device. Progress was monitored and game settings were tailored through telerehabilitation. Measurements were performed six weeks pre-intervention (T0), at the start (T1), end (T2) and six weeks post-intervention (T3). Primary outcome was the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). Secondary outcomes were other arm function tests, quality of life, user satisfaction and motivation. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included, ten completed the training. From start of the intervention to six weeks follow up, WMFT improved significantly with 3.8 points (p = .006), which is also clinically relevant. No significant changes in quality of life were observed. Patients were overall satisfied with the usability of the device. Comfort and the robustness of the system need further improvements.

CG plant were extracted using the methanol extraction technique; then, the methanolic extract was characterized using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LCCMS). Afterwards, a six-millimetre (mm) excision wound was induced in 60 male Balb/c mice. Mice were classified into two classes; each class consisted of three groups of 10 mice. In the non-infected wound class, the group I was assigned as control and received normal saline. Group II received gentamicin treatment, and group III treated with CG-methanolic extract. In the Staphylococcus aureus-infected class, group IV received normal saline, and groups V and VI were treated with gentamicin and CG-methanolic extract, respectively. The colonization of infected wounds was determined using colony-forming units (CFUs), and the percentage of wound contraction was measured in all groups. Finally, the histopathologic semi-quantitative determination of wound healing was evaluated by inflammatory cell infiltration, the presence of collagen fibres and granulation tissue, and the grade of re-epithelization. Composition analysis of the methanolic extract confirmed the presence of a high amount of ceramide (69%) and, to a lesser extent, hexosylceramide (18%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (7%) of the total amount.

We hypothesize that the progression of neurological damage will be related to an imbalance between neurodegeneration, neuroinflammatory, and neuroprotective markers, therefore suggesting a potential mechanism for the emergence of adverse, chronic outcomes. METHODS: 105 patients admitted to an urban, academic hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were enrolled. Serum neuroprotective (clusterin, fetuin), neurodegenerative (, phosphorylated , amyloids, TDP43, NRGN, NCAM-1, and KLK6), and neuroinflammatory (CCL23, YKL40, MIF) markers were collected. These were analyzed longitudinally in conjunction with immune system activators (RAGE, IL-34) using the multiplex platform. Electronic medical records were used to collect demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: Of the 105 patients, 5 were diagnosed with stroke within 28 days of admission, followed by an additional 6 strokes occurring by 6 months, or a 9.5% occurrence of stroke overall. Serum levels of Amyloid 42 declined significantly for the general population 7 days after admission when compared to initial collections (p< 0.001), while Amyloid 40, KLK6, and MIF declined and recovered within the same 7 days (p< 0.001, p< 0.001, p=0.003). The neuroprotective markers fetuin and clusterin were particularly dynamic with fetuin decreasing and restoring in less than 7 days (p=0.02) and clusterin remaining low after admission (p< 0.001). Most patients had persistently elevated CCL23 levels, with the stroke patient cohort having the highest values (p=0.018). The IL-6 levels of stroke patients were significantly higher compared to their non-stroke counterparts one week after admission (p=0.001), while IL-8 levels fluctuated before declining (p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveals elevations in neuronal damage in the 7 days following hospital admission for COVID-19 patients. The down-regulation of fetuin and clusterin is particularly compelling as their declines may be linked to the elevated neuronal injury seen with increased neuroinflammatory markers, specifically CCL23 and IL-6. Serum levels of neurodegeneration markers proved complex, therefore possibly suggesting a more dynamic relationship to the neural abnormalities seen in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Longitudinal changes of neurospecific serum proteins in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The wide spectrum of COVID-19 clinical manifestations demonstrates the determinant role played by the individual immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the course of the disease.

RECENT FINDINGS Impairment of types I and III interferon responses may facilitate the occurrence of severe COVID-19 with reduced antiviral activity associated to potent inflammation. The human T and B-cell germline repertoire contain the specificities able to react against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Although inflammation disrupts the structure of germinal centers, memory T and B cells can be found in the blood of patients after mild and severe COVID 19. SUMMARY Further studies are indispensable to better understand the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The diversity of the individual reaction may contribute to explain the clinical manifestation spectrum. Immunological memory can be demonstrated in patients, convalescent from mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, but we do not know whether asymptomatic individuals have memory of the virus.

Cardiovascular involvement can also occur, such as thrombosis or myocarditis, generally associated with pulmonary lesions. Little is known about SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis. We report the case of a 69-year-old man suffering from a refractory cardiogenic shock, without significant lung involvement. Prior to death, several nasopharyngeal swabs and distal bronchoalveolar lavage were sampled in order to perform RT-PCR analyses for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, which all gave negative results. Autopsy showed coronary atherosclerosis, without acute complication. Microscopic examination of the heart revealed the existence of an intense multifocal inflammatory infiltration, in both ventricles and septum, composed in its majority of macrophages and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4/CD8 ratio: 0.11). Immunohistochemistry for anti-SARS nucleocapsid protein antibody was strongly positive in myocardial cells, but not in lung tissue. RT-PCR was realized on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung and heart tissue blocks: only heart tissue was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In conclusion, this exhaustive post-mortem pathological case study of fulminant myocarditis demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in heart tissue, without significant lung involvement. Immunohistochemistry showed that the virus was specifically localized in cardiomyocytes and induced a strong cytotoxic T cells inflammatory response.

The particle filter, as a non-linear approximator, is an appropriate tracking framework for such thin and elongated structures; however, the robust 'vesselness' measurement is essential for extracting coronary centerlines. Importantly, we employed the DNN to robustly measure the vesselness using patch images, and we integrated softmax values to the likelihood function in our particle filtering framework. Tangent patches represent cross-sections of coronary arteries of circular shapes. Thus, 2D tangent patches are assumed to include enough features of coronary arteries, and the use of 2D patches significantly reduces computational complexity. Because coronary vasculature has multiple bifurcations, we also modeled a method to detect branching sites by clustering the particle locations.

Infants in Group 1 were orally fed while on NCPAP, while infants in Group 2 were only allowed oral feedings after ceasing NCPAP. RESULTS: Although infants in Group 2 started feeds at a later postmenstrual age (PMA), they reached full oral feeding at a similar PMA compared with Group 1.

Delinquency in proper disposal of used facial masks endangers the environment with a new form of non-biodegradable plastic waste that will take hundreds of years to break down. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the resourceful recycling of such waste in an environmentally friendly way. This study presents an efficient solution by using waste masks in fibered or crushed form to produce environmentally friendly and affordable green concrete. This investigation assessed the mechanical and durability properties of waste masks-incorporated concrete. A total of six mixes were prepared for standardized tests to determine compressive strength, split cylinder tensile strength and rapid chloride penetration test (RCPT), and freeze-thaw resistance. The percentage of mask fibers used were 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2% of concrete by volume, while crushed masks were used at 0.5% only. The mask waste in both forms was found suitable to be used in concrete. One percent of waste mask fibers was found as an optimum value to increase compressive and tensile strength, reduce chloride permeability, and increase freeze-thaw resistance. Besides this, 0.5% crushed mask fiber also performed well, especially for producing less permeable and highly durable concrete. It is thus corroborated that waste masks that increase pollution worldwide can be utilized sustainably to help build green buildings. By reutilizing waste masks to produce improved concrete with better strengths and higher durability, circular economy and sustainability are achieved, along with efficient waste management.","output":"Recycling of Waste Facial Masks as a Construction Material, a Step towards Sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cellular entry of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is mediated by interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor that is expressed on both lung and intestinal epithelial cells We performed a quantitative proteomic analysis to investigate the expression of possible receptors for SARS-CoV-2 in the intestinal mucosa of 23 patients with chronic colitis ACE2 expression was low and remained unaltered in the gut of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), intestinal Beh?et's disease (BD), and intestinal tuberculosis (TB), when compared with that of healthy individuals Additionally, the expression levels of some probable co-receptors, including dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), aminopeptidase N (AMPN), and glutamyl aminopeptidase (AMPE), were unchanged in the affected UC, CD, intestinal BD, and intestinal TB colon mucosa samples In conclusion, gut inflammation associated with chronic colitis does not mediate a further increase in the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2","output":"Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of the Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Receptors in the Gut of Patients with Chronic Enterocolitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep-learning (DL)-based image processing has potential to revolutionize the use of smartphones in mobile health (mHealth) diagnostics of infectious diseases.

Rapid and accurate detection of lower respiratory tract colonization and/or infection with P. aeruginosa may advise targeted preventive (antibody-based) strategies and antibiotic therapy. To investigate this, we compared semi-quantitative culture results from 80 endotracheal aspirates (ETA) collected from mechanically-ventilated patients, to two culture and two non-culture-based methods for detection of P. aeruginosa. METHODS: P. aeruginosa-positive (n = 40) and -negative (n = 40) ETAs from mechanically ventilated patients analyzed initally by (i) routine semi-quantitative culture, were further analyzed with (ii) quantitative culture on chromogenic ChromID P. aeruginosa and blood agar; (iii) enrichment in brain heart infusion broth followed by plating on blood agar and ChromID P. aeruginosa; (iv) O-antigen acetylase gene-based TaqMan qPCR; and (v) GeneXpert PA PCR assay. RESULTS: Of the 80 ETA samples included, one sample that was negative for P. aeruginosa by semi-quantitative culture was found to be positive by the other four methods, and was included in an extended gold standard panel. Based on this extended gold standard, both semi-quantitative culture and the GeneXpert PA assay showed 97.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The quantitative culture, enrichment culture and O-antigen acetylase gene-based TaqMan qPCR had a sensitivity of 97.6%, 89.5%, 92.7%, and a specificity of 97.4%, 100%, and 71.1%, respectively.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to (i) determine depression prevalence and (ii) identify the risk and protective factors of depression among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). METHODS: The protocol was registered on Open Science Framework (registration ID: https://osf.io/rdv27). We searched five databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Al Manhal, Google Scholar) till July 22, 2020 without language restrictions. We included studies from the EMR using a depression screening or diagnostic instrument to measure the depression prevalence among HCWs. Studies were assessed and data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis based on the Cochrane handbook. RESULTS: The systematic review identified 108 studies from 12 EMR countries with varying quality. Working long hours, poor sleep quality and being female were risk factors for depression in EMR HCWs. The meta-analysis comprised 77 studies providing 122 prevalence measures across 7 EMR countries. The pooled prevalence of depression among EMR HCWs was 33.03% (95% CI = 27.40C39.19%). Emergency HCWs had markedly higher rates of depression [53.14% (95% CI = 26.63C77.99%)] compared to HCWs of other specialties. Most studies had an appropriate sample size.

Objectives: To explore the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a web-based, peer-supported exercise program for people with hip or knee OA. Methods: This study was a single-group, pre-post feasibility study. Patients aged 40-80 years with hip or knee OA who were not candidates for surgery were eligible. The 12-week intervention was delivered through a patient-organizations (The Norwegian Association for Rheumatic Diseases) web-based platforms, and included weekly exercise programs, weekly motivational messages, an OA and exercise website and assigned peer-supporters. Feasibility was evaluated by calculating the proportion of eligible patients who were enrolled and retained at follow-up, as well as time resources used on delivery of the intervention. Acceptability was evaluated by calculating proportion of patients who had valid baseline accelerometer data and completed the maximal cardiorespiratory exercise test according to protocol. Primary efficacy measures were change in PA assessed by accelerometers and change in exercise capacity (VO2peak) assessed by indirect maximal cardiorespiratory exercise test. Secondary efficacy measures were change in patient reported outcomes assessed by HOOS and KOOS (www. koos.nu) (a 10-point change in normalized scores was considered a minimally important change). Data was analysed using paired sample t-test, given as mean change (95% confidence interval) and p-values. Results: We identified 49 eligible patients of which 35 (71%) consented and were enrolled. Among those who consented, 22 (63%) were retained. Time resources used on delivery of the exercise programs and motivational messages were mean (SD) 7.31.1 min per week/patient. Compliance with wearing the accelerometer was mean (SD) 6.11.0 valid days (mean (SD) 13.81.3 hours/day). Twenty (67%) out of 30 patients who attended baseline testing performed the maximal cardiorespiratory exercise test, of which 18 completed according to protocol. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, follow-up testing of primary efficacy measures included only eight patients. For these patients there was a significant increase from baseline to follow-up on moderate-to-vigorous PA (mean change 16.4 minutes/day;95% CI 6.9, 25.9, p=0.005) and VO2peak (mean change 1.83 ml/ kg/min;95% CI 0.29, 3.36, p=0.026).

METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of trauma patients transfused at a level 1 Trauma Center from 2001 to 2004. Between 2002 and 2003, LR blood was transfused. Prior to that time and subsequent to it, non-leukoreduced (NLR) blood was transfused. This created two historical comparison groups. Data collected included patient demographics, units of blood transfused, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital days, ventilator days, injury severity score (ISS), mortality, presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and infectious complications. A multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) score was calculated. RESULTS: The distribution of patients was as follows: 284 patients received only NLR blood, 153 received only LR blood, and 58 received at least one unit of each. The mean ISS was similar (NLR: 26, LR: 24; P > 0.1).

Presumably during minus-strand synthesis, the nascent RNA strand is transferred from one site in the genomic template to another, a process guided by conserved transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) at these template sites. Subgenomic RNA species are produced in different but constant molar ratios, with the smallest RNAs usually being most abundant. Factors thought to influence sg RNA synthesis are size differences between sg RNA species, differences in sequence context between body TRSs, and the mutual influence (or competition) between strand transfer reactions occurring at different body TRSs. Using an Equine arteritis virus infectious cDNA clone, we investigated how body TRS activity affected sg RNA synthesis from neighboring body TRSs. Flanking sequences were standardized by head-to-tail insertion of several copies of an RNA7 body TRS cassette. A perfect gradient of sg RNA abundance, progressively favoring smaller RNA species, was observed. Disruption of body TRS function by mutagenesis did not have a significant effect on the activity of other TRSs. However, deletion of body TRS-containing regions enhanced synthesis of sg RNAs from upstream TRSs but not of those produced from downstream TRSs.

Intracellular expression of SARS-CoV-2 E protein increases intra-Golgi pH. By targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E protein to the plasma membrane, we show that it forms a cation channel, viroporin, that is modulated by changes of pH. This method for studying the activity of viroporins may facilitate screening for new antiviral drugs to identify novel treatments for COVID-19. ABSTRACT: The envelope (E) protein of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 is proposed to form an ion channel or viroporin that participates in viral propagation and pathogenesis. Here we developed a technique to study the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 in mammalian cells by directed targeting using a carboxyl-terminal fluorescent protein tag, mKate2. The wild-type SARS-CoV-2 E protein can be trafficked to intracellular organelles, notably the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex, where its expression increases pH inside the organelle. We also succeeded in targeting SARS-CoV-2 E to the plasma membrane, which enabled biophysical analysis using whole-cell patch clamp recording in a mammalian cell line, HEK 293 cells, and two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus oocytes. The results suggest that the E protein forms an ion channel that is permeable to monovalent cations such as Na+ , Cs+ and K+ . The E current is nearly time- and voltage-independent when E protein is expressed in mammalian cells, and is modulated by changes of pH. At pH 6.0 and 7.4, the E protein current is activated, whereas at pH 8.0 and 9.0, the amplitude of E protein current is reduced, and in oocytes the inward E current fades at pH 9 in a time- and voltage-dependent manner. Using this directed targeting method and electrophysiological recordings, potential inhibitors of the E protein can be screened and subsequently investigated for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and possible efficacy in treating COVID-19.","output":"The envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 increases intra-Golgi pH and forms a cation channel that is regulated by pH"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we have generated 3D structures of glycoforms of the spike (S) glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2, based on reported 3D structures and glycomics data for the protein produced in HEK293 cells.

The occurrence of trans-placental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains highly debated. Placental positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in selected cases, but infection or virus-associated disease of fetal tissues or newborns remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We screened for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein expression placentas from 101 women who delivered between February 7 and May 15, 2020, including 15 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 34 tested negative, and 52 not evaluated as they did not meet testing criteria (32), or delivered before COVID-19 pandemic declaration (20). Immunostain for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) was performed in the placentas of all COVID-19 positive women. One placenta resulted positive for the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, which was further studied by RNA-in situ hybridization and RT-PCR for S transcripts, and by electron microscopy. A comprehensive immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis of the placental inflammatory infiltrate completed the investigations. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins were strongly expressed in the placenta of a COVID-19 pregnant woman whose newborn tested positive for viral RNA and developed COVID-19 pneumonia soon after birth. SARS-CoV-2 antigens, RNA and/or particles morphologically consistent with coronavirus were identified in villous syncytiotrophoblast, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, in maternal macrophages, and in Hofbauer cells and fetal intravascular mononuclear cells. The placenta intervillous inflammatory infiltrate consisted of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages expressing activation markers. Absence of villitis was associated with an increase in the number of Hofbauer cells, which expressed PD-L1. Scattered neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were identified by immunofluorescence. INTERPRETATION: We provide first-time evidence for maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely propagated by circulating virus-infected fetal mononuclear cells. Placenta infection was associated with recruitment of maternal inflammatory cells in the intervillous space, without villitis. PD-L1 expression in syncytiotrophoblast and Hofbaeur cells, together with limited production of NETs, may have prevented immune cell-driven placental damage, ensuring sufficient maternal-fetus nutrient exchanges.","output":"SARS-CoV2 vertical transmission with adverse effects on the newborn revealed through integrated immunohistochemical, electron microscopy and molecular analyses of Placenta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of the novel 2019 coronavirus pandemic in December 2019 (COVID-19), numerous modellers have used diverse techniques to assess the dynamics of transmission of the disease, predict its future course and determine the impact of different control measures. In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st, 2020 to October 30th, 2020. We further examined the reliability and correctness of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths. From an initial 4311 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 242 were fully analysed. Most studies were done on Asian (46.52%) and European (27.39%) countries. Most of them used compartmental models (namely SIR and SEIR) (46.1%) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (31.8%) while few used artificial intelligence (6.7%), Bayesian approach (4.7%), Network models (2.3%) and Agent-based models (1.3%). For the number of cumulative cases, the ratio of the predicted over the observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 indicating cases of inaccurate and imprecise predictions, and large variation across predictions. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. In 75% of predictions that provided CI or CrI, observed values fall within the 95% CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted. Only 3.7% of the studies predicted the cumulative number of deaths. For 70% of the predictions, the ratio of predicted over observed cumulative deaths was less or close to 1. Also, the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than classical statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small number of predictions within our dataset (9 in total). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation (rhoa?=a?- 0.56, pa?=a?0.021) between this ratio and the length (in days) of the period covered by the modelling, suggesting that the longer the period covered by the model the likely more accurate the estimates tend to be. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, some were relatively accurate and precise while other not.","output":"On the reliability of predictions on Covid-19 dynamics: A systematic and critical review of modelling techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are occupational disparities in the risk of contracting COVID-19.

However, the prevalence of mental health problems in frontline medical staff after fighting COVID-19 is still unknown. METHODS: Medical workers in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province were invited to participate a cross-sectional and convenience sampling online survey, which assessed the prevalence of anxiety, insomnia, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: A total of 1,091 responses (33% male and 67% female) were valid for statistical analysis. The prevalence was anxiety 53%, insomnia 79%, depression 56%, and PTSD 11%. Healthcare workers in Wuhan were more likely to face risks of anxiety (56% vs. 52%, P = 0.03) and PTSD (15% vs. 9%, P = 0.03) than those in other cities of Hubei. In terms of educational attainment, those with doctoral and masters (D/M) degrees may experience more anxiety (median of 7.0, [interquartile range (IQR) 2.0C8.5] vs. median 5.0 [IQR 5.0C8.0], P = 0.02) and PTSD (median 26.0 [IQR 19.5C33.0] vs. median 23.0 [IQR 19.0C31.0], P = 0.04) than those with lower educational degrees.

This study investigated medical students perceptions of the effectiveness of online video-based learning for musculoskeletal physical examination skills. METHODS: For one academic year, undergraduate medical students were instructed online through video-based learning before bedside teaching about the physical examination of knee and shoulder joints. At the end of the course, the students participated in a survey to assess their perceptions of the online video-based learning module using a pre-validated questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of closed-ended and open-ended questions. The closed-ended question responses were assessed using a Likert scale; the open-ended responses were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: In total, 242 out of 310 students who participated in the online video-based learning responded to the survey. Most students found the teaching approach to be satisfactory and preferable to traditional teaching methods. However, they also felt that these modules could not replace hands-on practice. The most helpful aspects of the training modules were a better understanding of the specific tests, technique, and sequence of administering the physical examination. Perceived limitations included the inadequately addressed theoretical basis of the physical examination and the special tests, the need for more time to explain clinical anatomy, and the practical implications of the positive special tests. CONCLUSION: Undergraduate medical students perceive VBL as helpful for MPES learning. The positive aspects of the VBL approach in teaching MPES are that it is comprehensive, easily accessible, offers standardized teaching, save times, and it includes demonstrations of special tests, examination techniques, and the sequence and organization of the clinical examination.

Cancer was more often associated with a more severe course, but not necessarily with a bad prognosis. Our data show that both children and adults with immunosuppression seem to have a favorable disease course, as compared to the general population. Conclusion Immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19 seem to be few in relation to the overall figures, and to present a favorable outcome as compared to other comorbidities.

During severe hypoxia, the production of ATP decreases, leading to cell damage or death. Conversely, excessive oxygen causes oxidative stress that is equally damaging to cells. To mitigate pathological outcomes, organisms have evolved mechanisms to adapt to fluctuations in oxygen levels. Zebrafish embryos are remarkably hypoxia-tolerant, surviving anoxia (zero oxygen) for hours in a hypometabolic, energy-conserving state. To begin to unravel underlying mechanisms, we analyze here the distribution of the N-myc Downstream Regulated Gene (ndrg) family, ndrg1-4, and their transcriptional response to hypoxia. These genes have been primarily studied in cancer cells and hence little is understood about their normal function and regulation. We show here using in situ hybridization that ndrgs are expressed in metabolically demanding organs of the zebrafish embryo, such as the brain, kidney, and heart. To investigate whether ndrgs are hypoxia-responsive, we exposed embryos to different durations and severity of hypoxia and analyzed transcript levels. We observed that ndrgs are differentially regulated by hypoxia and that ndrg1a has the most robust response, with a ninefold increase following prolonged anoxia. We further show that this treatment resulted in de novo expression of ndrg1a in tissues where the transcript is not observed under normoxic conditions and changes in Ndrg1a protein expression post-reoxygenation.

It has become the go-to methodology for tackling image restoration and has outperformed the traditional non-local class of methods. However, the top-performing networks are generally composed of many convolutional layers and hundreds of neurons, with trainable parameters in excess of several million. We claim that this is due to the inherently linear nature of convolution-based transformation, which is inadequate for handling severe restoration problems. Recently, a non-linear generalization of CNNs, called the operational neural networks (ONN), has been shown to outperform CNN on AWGN denoising. However, its formulation is burdened by a fixed collection of well-known non-linear operators and an exhaustive search to find the best possible configuration for a given architecture, whose efficacy is further limited by a fixed output layer operator assignment. In this study, we leverage the Taylor series-based function approximation to propose a self-organizing variant of ONNs, Self-ONNs, for image restoration, which synthesizes novel nodal transformations on-the-fly as part of the learning process, thus eliminating the need for redundant training runs for operator search. In addition, it enables a finer level of operator heterogeneity by diversifying individual connections of the receptive fields and weights. We perform a series of extensive ablation experiments across three severe image restoration tasks.

For typical compartmental models such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) [Formula: see text] represents the severity of an epidemic. It is an estimate of the early-stage growth rate of an epidemic and is an important threshold parameter used to gain insights into the spread or decay of an outbreak. Models typically use incidence counts as indicators of cases within a single large population; however, epidemic data are the result of a hierarchical aggregation, where incidence counts from spatially separated monitoring sites (or sub-regions) are pooled and used to infer [Formula: see text]. Is this aggregation approach valid when the epidemic has different dynamics across the regions monitored? We characterize bias in the estimation of [Formula: see text] from a merged data set when the epidemics of the sub-regions, used in the merger, exhibit delays in onset.

Such information would provide invaluable guidance for the future rational design of live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines. RESULT: To compare vaccine strains encoded with different antigen delivery and expression strategies, a series of recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium strains were constructed that expressed either the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a fragment of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein from the H5N1 influenza virus, as model antigens. The antigens were expressed from the chromosome, from high or low-copy plasmids, or encoded on a eukaryotic expression plasmid. Antigens were targeted for expression in either the cytoplasm or the outer membrane. Combinations of strategies were employed to evaluate the efficacy of combined delivery/expression approaches. After investigating in vitro and in vivo antigen expression, growth and infection abilities; the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant Salmonella strains was evaluated in mice. Using the soluble model antigen EGFP, our results indicated that vaccine strains with high and stable antigen expression exhibited high B cell responses, whilst eukaryotic expression or colonization with good construct stability was critical for T cell responses. For the insoluble model antigen HA, an outer membrane expression strategy induced better B cell and T cell responses than a cytoplasmic strategy. Most notably, the combination of two different expression strategies did not increase the immune response elicited. CONCLUSION: Through systematically evaluating and comparing the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant Salmonella strains in mice, we identified their respective advantages and deleterious or synergistic effects. Different construction strategies were optimally-required for soluble versus insoluble forms of the protein antigens. If an antigen, such as EGFP, is soluble and expressed at high levels, a low-copy plasmid-cytoplasmic expression strategy is recommended; since it provokes the highest B cell responses and also induces good T cell responses. If a T cell response is preferred, a eukaryotic expression plasmid or a chromosome-based, cytoplasmic-expression strategy is more effective. For insoluble antigens such as HA, an outer membrane expression strategy is recommended.","output":"Comparative immunological evaluation of recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium strains expressing model antigens as live oral vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vasoproliferative retinal disorder that can have devastating visual sequelae if not managed appropriately.

This requires coordination and communication between providers, ancillary staff, and most importantly, effective communication with the patient's family members and caregivers. Often, factors related to the social determinants of health play a significant role in effective communication and care coordination with the family, and it is important for ophthalmologists to recognize these risk factors. The aim of this article is to (1) review the literature related to disparities in preterm birth outcomes and infants at risk for ROP; (2) identify barriers to ROP care and appropriate follow up, and (3) describe patient-oriented solutions and future directions for improving ROP care through a health equity lens.","output":"Health Equity and Disparities in ROP Care: A Need for Systematic Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Handwashing with water and soap, is among the most a cost-effective interventions to improve public health. Yet billions of people globally lacking handwashing facilities with water and soap on premises, with gaps particularly found in low- and middle-income countries. Targeted efforts to expand access to basic hygiene services require data at geospatially explicit scales. Drawing on country-specific cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys with georeferenced hygiene data, we developed an ensemble model to predict the prevalence of basic hygiene facilities in Malawi, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan and Uganda. The ensemble model was based on a multiple-level stacking structure, where five predictive modelling algorithms were used to produce sub-models, and a random forest model was used to generalise the final predictions. An inverse distance weighted interpolation was incorporated in the random forest model to account for spatial autocorrelation. Local coverage and a local dissimilarity index were calculated to examine the geographic disparities in access. Our methodology produced robust outputs, as evidenced by performance evaluations (all R2 were above 0.8 with the exception of Malawi where R2 = 0.6). Among the five study countries, Pakistan had the highest overall coverage, whilst Malawi had the poorest coverage. Apparent disparities in basic hygiene services were found across geographic locations and between urban and rural settings. Nigeria had the highest level of inequalities in basic hygiene services, whilst Malawi showed the least segregation between populations with and without basic hygiene services. Both educational attainment and wealth were important predictors of the geospatial distribution of basic hygiene services. By producing geospatially explicit estimates of the prevalence of handwashing facilities with water and soap, this study provides a means of identifying geographical disparities in basic hygiene services. The method and outputs can be useful tools to identify areas of low coverage and to support efficient and precise targeting of efforts to scale up access to handwashing facilities and shift social and cultural norms on handwashing.","output":"Mapping access to basic hygiene services in low- and middle-income countries: A cross-sectional case study of geospatial disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report off-label use patterns for medications repurposed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at 318 US hospitals Inpatient hydroxychloroquine use declined by 80%, whereas corticosteroids and tocilizumab were initiated 2 days earlier in May versus March 2020 Two thirds of ventilated COVID-19 patients were already receiving corticosteroids during March-May 2020, resembling pre-COVID use in mechanically ventilated influenza patients","output":"Real-World Inpatient Use of Medications Repurposed for Coronavirus Disease 2019 in United States Hospitals, March-May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing and particularly staying at home are effective public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

There were clearly positive tendencies in the spread of COVID-19 to February - first half of March 2021. However, in April-May 2021 there was a significant deterioration in the epidemiological situation. From June to August 2021, the epidemiological situation with Covid-19 in Georgia became very difficult. In this work results of the next statistical analysis of the daily data associated with New Coronavirus COVID-19 infection of confirmed (C), recovered (R), deaths (D) and infection rate (I) cases of the population of Georgia in the period from June 01, 2021 to August 31, 2021 are presented. It also presents the results of the analysis of two-week forecasting of the values of C, D and I. As earlier, the information was regularly sent to the National Center for Disease Control & Public Health of Georgia and posted on the Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/Avtandil1948/. The analysis of data is carried out with the use of the standard statistical analysis methods of random events and methods of mathematical statistics for the non-accidental time-series of observations. In particular, the following results were obtained. Georgia's ranking in the world for Covid-19 monthly mean values of infection and deaths cases in summer 2021 (per 1 million population) was determined. Among 159 countries with population [] 1 million inhabitants in August 2021 Georgia was in the 1 place on new infection cases and on Death. A comparison between the daily mortality from Covid-19 in Georgia in summer 2021 with the average daily mortality rate in 2015-2019 shows, that the largest share value of D from mean death in 2015-2019 was 66.0 % (26.08.2021 and 31.08.2021), the smallest 6.0 % (09.07.2021). The statistical analysis of the daily and decade data associated with coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic of confirmed, recovered, deaths cases and infection rate of the population of Georgia are carried out. Maximum daily values of investigation parameters are following: C = 6208 (17.08.2021), R = 6177 (29.08.2021), D = 79 (26.08.2021 and 31.08.2021), I = 13.0 % (17.08.2021). Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: C = 5019 (2 Decade of August 2021), R = 4822 (3 Decade of August 2021), D = 69 (3 Decade of August 2021), I = 10.88 % (2 Decade of August 2021). It was found that as with September 2020 to February 2021 and in spring 2021 [7,8], from June to August 2021 the regression equations for the time variability of the daily values of C, R and D have the form of a tenth order polynomial. Mean values of speed of change of confirmed -V(C), recovered - V(R), deaths - V(D) and infection rate V(I) coronavirus-related cases in different decades of months in the summer 2021 were determined. Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: V(C) = +134 cases/day (1 Decade of August 2021), V(R) = +134 cases/day (2 Decade of August 2021), V(D) = +2.4 cases/day (3 Decade of August 2021), V(I) = + 0.25 %/ day (1 decades of August 2021). Cross-correlations analysis between confirmed COVID-19 cases with recovered and deaths cases shows, that the maximum effect of recovery is observed 19 days after infection (RC=0.95), and deaths - after 16 and 18 days (RC=0.94). In Georgia in the summer 2021, the duration of the impact of the delta variant of the coronavirus on people (recovery, mortality) could be up to two months. Comparison of real and calculated predictions data of C, D and I in Georgia are carried out. It was found that in summer 2021 two-week daily and mean two-week real values of C, D and I practically fall into the 67% - 99.99% confidence interval of these predicted values.

These have led to changes in our practice such as loss of the paper EROS patient companion and routine use of intrathecal morphine starting in 2019. We reviewed the impact of such challenges on the delivery of EROS. Methods: We audited compliance to EROS protocols as defined by our department over a 10-week period from JulyCSeptember 2020. We compared results with data collected in the 6-week period immediately after the introduction of EROS in 2017. Data were analysed using Students t-test and Fishers exact test. Results: EROS outcomes are listed in the table: [Formula presented] Discussion: Our compliance with EROS suffered mostly in our pre-op interventions resulting in an increase in prolonged fasting. When questioned, 35% of women felt that the level of pre-op information could be improved. We believe the absence of key members of the EROS MDT, combined with the trust switching to electronic medical records contributed to a decline in the delivery and understanding of information before eCD. Moreover, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, women avoiding face-to-face appointments may also have had an impact;especially since half of our cases were first time eCDs. Encouragingly, we found that the percentage of women achieving a discharge on post-op day 1 remained consistent at approximately 50%. This is above the national average of 36%2 and demonstrates the impact of strong intra- and post-operative EROS processes. We believe that maintaining EROS champions in all of the MDT specialties involved would improve the consistency of pre-op information delivery.

In this phase II study, we investigated the efficacy and safety profiles of FTD/TPI in mCRC according to RAS mutation status. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were mCRC refractory or intolerant to all standard therapies other than FTD/TPI and regorafenib. Patients received 4-week cycles of treatment with FTD/TPI (35 mg/m2, twice daily, days 1-5 and 8-12) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg, days 1 and 15). The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR). The null hypothesis of DCR in both RAS wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) cohorts was 44%, assuming a one-sided significance level of 5.0%. The necessary sample size was estimated to be 49 patients (target sample size: 50 patients) for each cohort. RESULTS Between January and September 2018, 102 patients were enrolled, and 97 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria (48 in the RAS WT cohort and 49 in the RAS MUT cohort). DCRs in the RAS WT and MUT cohort were 66.7% [90% confidence interval (CI), 53.9%-77.8%, P = 0.0013] and 55.1% (90% CI, 42.4%-67.3%, P = 0.0780), respectively.

We found that the activation of P2X7R by BzATP caused the death of AEC I by suppressing Wnt/-catenin signaling through stimulating glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and proteasome. On the other hand, the activation of Wnt/-catenin signaling by Wnt3a, GSK-3 inhibitor, or proteasome inhibitor blocked the P2X7R-mediated cell death. More importantly, Wnt3a attenuated the AEC I damage caused by intratracheal instillation of BzATP in rats or LPS in ventilated mice.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center case series included 157 pediatric patients admitted to Wuhan Childrens Hospital with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data were collected from January 25 to April 18, 2020. EXPOSURES: Documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical and immunologic characteristics were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were observed until April 18, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 157 pediatric patients with COVID-19, 60 (38.2%) had mild clinical type with pneumonia, 88 (56.1%) had moderate cases, 6 (3.8%) had severe cases, and 3 (1.9%) were critically ill. The 148 children with mild or moderate disease had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 84 (18-123) months, and 88 (59.5%) were girls. The most common laboratory abnormalities were increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (median [IQR], 16.0 [12.0-26.0] U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (median [IQR], 30.0 [23.0-41.8] U/L), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) activity (median [IQR], 24.0 [18.0-34.0] U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (median [IQR], 243.0 [203.0-297.0] U/L), which are associated with liver and myocardial injury. Compared with mild cases, levels of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor , and interferon  were unchanged, whereas the level of immune suppressive interleukin 10 was markedly increased in moderate cases compared with mild cases (median [IQR], 3.96 [3.34-5.29] pg/mL vs 3.58 [3.10-4.36] pg/mL; P = .048). There was no statistically significant difference in absolute number of lymphocytes (including T cells and B cells) between mild and moderate cases, but moderate cases were associated with a decrease in neutrophil levels compared with mild cases (median [IQR], 2310/L [1680/L-3510/L] vs 3120/L [2040/L-4170/L]; P = .01).

The acceptability of these measures is the backbone of their successful implementation. However, population compliance with these measures within a community is uncertain, even when mandatory. At the beginning of the 2020-2021 academic year, the University of Liege complemented these measures, by organizing a weekly screening by saliva testing on a voluntary basis for all its workers and students. Their compliance with the different measures was necessary for effective control program and an intensive communication plan was implemented throughout the 2020-2021 academic year for that purpose METHOD AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An on-line survey was launched upon the implementation of the saliva testing in order (i) to assess the level of acceptance of the different measures by the university workers and students, (ii) to identify the factors determining their acceptance (based on the Health Belief Model) and their reported level of implementation. A total of 921 responses was received and analysed by sub-group comparison, structural equation modelling and multivariable ordinal logistic regression.

All isolated flavonoids (1-6) inhibited PLpro in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 ranging between 4.2 and 38.4 M. Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots and their secondary replots indicated that inhibitors (1-6) were mixed inhibitors of PLpro. The analysis of KI and KIS values proved that the two most promising compounds (3 and 5) had reversible mixed type I mechanisms.","output":"Phenolic phytochemical displaying SARS-CoV papain-like protease inhibition from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, clinical dietitians, as other clinicians, have had to shift their elective in-person clinical encounters to online consultations Adequate planning and use of tools are essential to minimize delay in delivering medical nutrition therapy to existing and new clients This article describes the steps required to launch a successful e-nutrition clinic during these times of crisis During Covid-19 pandemic, clinical dietitians have had to shift their elective in-person clinical encounters to online consultations This article describes the steps required to launch a successful telenutrition clinic","output":"COVID-19 and Telenutrition: Remote Consultation in Clinical Nutrition Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The chapter describes bacerial, viral, parasitic and fungal infections commonly detected in pet birds.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a retrospective analysis with offline comprehensive conventional measurement of bilateral heart function and develop an appropriate prognostic model for in-hospital death. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 37 consecutive patients with COVID-19, confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay, who had undergone clinically indicated standard two-dimensional echocardiographic studies in intensive care wards. Offline comprehensive measurement was also performed. We further integrated the echocardiographic findings as paired evidence of vital organ involvement (possible respiratory distress assessed using right ventricular functional parameters, possible myocardial injury assessed using increased wall thickness, effusion or asynergy) and circulatory failure (suspected low flow status assessed using stroke volume index, suspected congestion assessed using elevated right or left atrial pressure). We evaluated its value for in-hospital death along with other echocardiographic findings. RESULTS: The most common features included a normal-sized left atrium and left ventricle with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, despite deteriorated left ventricular flow volume. Less frequent findings, such as abnormalities in the right heart and left ventricular abnormalities suggesting myocarditis, were observed. Although the single echocardiographic parameters failed to show predictive values for in-hospital death, integration of the echocardiographic findings suggested predictive value (p = 0.04, odds ratio: 12.28). CONCLUSION: Standard TTE at the bedside with offline comprehensive conventional measurement may provide prognostic information that is valuable for the management of patients with COVID-19.

The current analysis aimed to examine whether the prevailing narrative that GBD is a minority view among experts is true. METHODS: The citation impact and social media presence of the key GBD and JSM signatories was assessed. Citation data were obtained from Scopus using a previously validated composite citation indicator that incorporated also coauthorship and author order and ranking was against all authors in the same Science-Metrix scientific field with at least five full papers. Random samples of scientists from the longer lists of signatories were also assessed. The number of Twitter followers for all key signatories was also tracked. RESULTS: Among the 47 key GBD signatories, 20, 19 and 21, respectively, were top-cited authors for career impact, recent single-year (2019) impact or either. For comparison, among the 34 key JSM signatories, 11, 14 and 15, respectively, were top cited. Key signatories represented 30 different scientific fields (9 represented in both documents, 17 only in GBD and 4 only in JSM). In a random sample of n=30 scientists among the longer lists of signatories, five in GBD and three in JSM were top cited.

The interest in ESG investing has created greater demand for ESG data, ratings and rankings together with a proliferation of agencies offering these products which are unquestioningly relied on by investors, academics and regulators. Research highlights that different ESG ratings and rankings produce significantly different assessments of the ESG performance of companies. In this paper, we examine the causes of the differences in the ratings and ranking produced by different agencies. It is found that the divergences between raters can be attributed to differences in defining ESG constructs (i.e., theorisation problem) and methodological differences (i.e., commensurability problem). While users of ESG ratings and rankings are advised to study the definitions and methodologies prior to their use, lack of transparency about the data sources, weightings and methodologies makes it difficult to ensure that companies true ESG performance is accounted for when making portfolio selection and investment decisions. As a solution, we suggest that instead of attempting to compare and contrast ratings and rankings of different agencies, investors should determine ESG constructs material to their investment strategy and match them with an ESG ratings/rankings product that closely resemble those constructs.","output":"Sustainable Investing: The Black Box of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Ratings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider the non-equilibrium zero frequency noise generated by a temperature gradient applied on a device composed of two normal leads separated by a quantum dot. We recall the derivation of the scattering theory for non-equilibrium noise for a general situation where both a bias voltage and a temperature gradient can coexist and put it in a historical perspective. We provide a microscopic derivation of zero frequency noise through a quantum dot based on a tight binding Hamiltonian, which constitutes a generalization of the pioneering work of Caroli et al. for the current obtained in the context of the Keldysh formalism. For a single level quantum dot, the obtained transmission coefficient entering the scattering formula for the non-equilibrium noise corresponds to a Breit-Wigner resonance. We compute the delta-$T$ noise as a function of the dot level position, and of the dot level width, in the Breit-Wigner case, for two relevant situations which were considered recently in two separate experiments. In the regime where the two reservoir temperatures are comparable, our gradient expansion shows that the delta-$T$ noise is dominated by its quadratic contribution, and is minimal close to resonance. In the opposite regime where one reservoir is much colder, the gradient expansion fails and we find the noise to be typically linear in temperature before saturating. In both situations, we conclude with a short discussion of the case where both a voltage bias and a temperature gradient are present, in order to address the potential competition with thermoelectric effects.","output":"Scattering Theory of Non-Equilibrium Noise and Delta $T$ current fluctuations through a quantum dot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic forced nursing faculty to transform an international study abroad service-learning course into a virtual community health clinical experience with a global focus.

Preliminary evidence suggests that numbers of preterm births greatly reduced following implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise fashion on March 9, March 15, and March 23, 2020, on the incidence of preterm birth. METHODS: We used a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach. We used data from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme (2010-20) cross-validated against national perinatal registry data. Stratified analyses were done according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity analyses were done to assess robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by neighbourhood socioeconomic status, sex, and small-for-gestational-age status. FINDINGS: Data on 1a599a547 singleton neonates were available, including 56a720 births that occurred after implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures on March 9, 2020. Consistent reductions in the incidence of preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding March 9 (a2 months [n=531a823] odds ratio [OR] 077, 95% CI 066-091, p=00026; a3 months [n=796a531] OR 085, 073-098, p=0028; a4 months [n=1a066a872] OR 084, 073-097, p=0023). Decreases in incidence observed following the March 15 measures were of smaller magnitude, but not statistically significant. No changes were observed after March 23. Reductions in the incidence of preterm births after March 9 were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in sensitivity analyses. They appeared confined to neighbourhoods of high socioeconomic status, but effect modification was not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: In this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures was associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of preterm births in the following months, in agreement with preliminary observations elsewhere. Integration of comparable data from across the globe is needed to further substantiate these findings and start exploring underlying mechanisms.

Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of more than one month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment scores. RESULTS: Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease. Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: LT can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction that could contraindicate LT, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs.

The recent improvement in automated cancer classification using deep learning methods has reached a human-level performance requiring a large amount of annotated data assembled in one location, yet, finding such conditions usually is not feasible. Recently, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train decentralized models in a privacy-preserved fashion depending on labeled data at the client-side, which is usually not available and costly. To address this, we propose \\\\verb!FedPerl!, a semi-supervised federated learning method. Our method is inspired by peer learning from educational psychology and ensemble averaging from committee machines. FedPerl builds communities based on clients' similarities. Then it encourages communities members to learn from each other to generate more accurate pseudo labels for the unlabeled data. We also proposed the peer anonymization (PA) technique to anonymize clients. As a core component of our method, PA is orthogonal to other methods without additional complexity and reduces the communication cost while enhancing performance. Finally, we propose a dynamic peer-learning policy that controls the learning stream to avoid any degradation in the performance, especially for individual clients. Our experimental setup consists of 71,000 skin lesion images collected from 5 publicly available datasets. We test our method in four different scenarios in SSFL.

Wastewater surveillance has increasingly been introduced to support the monitoring, and thus mitigation, of COVID-19 outbreaks and transmission. Monitoring of buildings and sub-sewershed areas via a wastewater surveillance approach has been a cost-effective strategy for mass testing of residents in congregate living situations such as universities. A series of spatial and spatiotemporal data are involved with wastewater surveillance, and these data must be interpreted and integrated with other information to better serve as guidance on response to a positive wastewater signal. The management and analysis of these data poses a significant challenge, in particular, for the need of supporting timely decision making. In this study, we present a web-based spatial decision support system framework to address this challenge. Our study area is the main campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. We develop a spatiotemporal data model that facilitates the management of space-time data related to wastewater surveillance. We use spatiotemporal analysis and modeling to discover spatio-temporal patterns of COVID-19 virus abundance at wastewater collection sites that may not be readily apparent in wastewater data as they are routinely collected. Web-based GIS dashboards are implemented to support the automatic update and sharing of wastewater testing results. Our web-based SDSS framework enables the efficient and automated management, analytics, and sharing of spatiotemporal data of wastewater testing results for our study area. This framework provides substantial support for informing critical decisions or guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19 outbreak and the mitigation of virus transmission on campus.","output":"A Web-based Spatial Decision Support System of Wastewater Surveillance for COVID-19 Monitoring: A Case Study of a University Campus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Findings on the cognitive, behavioral, and psychological functioning of individuals with sagittal synostosis (SS) are highly disparate, limiting their clinical utility. Objective To identify and review research on individuals with SS and to determine whether, and to what extent, they experience cognitive, behavioral, and psychological difficulties compared with their healthy peers or normative data for each measure. Data Sources PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched through January 2021 with no date restrictions. Scopus citation searches and manual checks of the reference lists of included studies were conducted. Study Selection Studies included participants of any age who had received a diagnosis of single-suture (isolated or nonsyndromic) SS or scaphocephaly and who had been assessed on cognitive, behavioral, and psychological outcomes. Data Extraction and Synthesis Data were independently extracted by 2 reviewers. Case-control outcomes (individuals with SS vs healthy peers or normative data) were compared using random-effects models with 3 effect sizes calculated: weighted Hedges g (gw), odds ratios (ORs), and mean prevalence rates. This study follows the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines. Main Outcomes and Measures Findings were categorized by surgical status (conservatively managed, presurgery, postsurgery, or combined); domain (eg, general cognition); type of cognitive, behavioral, or psychological measure (objective or subjective); and source of comparison data (peers or normative data). Results Data from 32 studies, involving a pooled sample of 1422 children and adults with SS (mean [SD] age at assessment, 5.7 [6.6] years; median [interquartile range] age, 3.3 [0.5-10.3] years), were analyzed. Data on sex were available for 824 participants, and 642 (78%) were male. Individual study results varied substantially. Objective tests identified significant moderate group differences on 3 of 16 examined domains: presurgical motor functioning (3 studies; gw = -0.42; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.18; P < .001), postsurgical short-term memory (2 studies; gw = -0.45; 95% CI, -0.72 to -0.17; P < .001), and postsurgical visuospatial ability (6 studies; gw = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.44; P < .001). Prevalence estimates and ORs varied widely, with 15 studies showing prevalence estimates ranging from 3% to 37%, and 3 studies showing ORs ranging from 0.31 (95% CI, 0.01 to 6.12) for processing speed in the conservatively managed sample to 4.55 (95% CI, 0.21 to 98.63) for postsurgical visuospatial abilities. Conclusions and Relevance In this meta-analysis, findings for the functioning of participants with SS were highly disparate and often of low quality, with small samples sizes and control groups rarely recruited. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that some individuals with SS experience negative outcomes, necessitating routine assessment.","output":"Sagittal Synostosis and Its Association With Cognitive, Behavioral, and Psychological Functioning: A Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets are a viable method to lose weight that have regained popularity in recent years. Technology in the form of mobile health (mHealth) apps allows for scalable and remote delivery of such dietary interventions and are increasingly being used by the general population without direct medical supervision. However, it is currently unknown which factors related to app use and user behavior are associated with successful weight loss. OBJECTIVE: First, to describe and characterize user behavior, we aim to examine characteristics and user behaviors over time of participants who were enrolled in a remotely delivered clinical weight loss trial that tested an mHealth ketogenic diet app paired with a breath acetone biofeedback device. Second, to identify variables of importance to weight loss at 12 weeks that may offer insight for future development of dietary mHealth interventions, we aim to explore which app- and adherence-related user behaviors characterized successful weight loss. METHODS: We analyzed app use and self-reported questionnaire data from 75 adults with overweight or obesity who participated in the intervention arm of a previous weight loss study. We examined data patterns over time through linear mixed models and performed correlation, linear regression, and causal mediation analyses to characterize diet-, weight-, and app-related user behavior associated with weight loss. RESULTS: In the context of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet intervention delivered remotely through an mHealth app paired with a breath acetone biofeedback device, self-reported dietary adherence seemed to be the most important factor to predict weight loss (=C.31; t(54)=C2.366; P=.02). Furthermore, self-reported adherence mediated the relationship between greater app engagement (from c=C0.008, 95% CI C0.014 to C0.0019 to c=C0.0035, 95% CI C0.0094 to 0.0024) or higher breath acetone levels (from c=C1.34, 95% CI C2.28 to C0.40 to c=C0.40, 95% CI C1.42 to 0.62) and greater weight loss, explaining a total of 27.8% and 28.8% of the variance in weight loss, respectively. User behavior (compliance with weight measurements and app engagement) and adherence-related aspects (breath acetone values and self-reported dietary adherence) over time differed between individuals who achieved a clinically significant weight loss of >5% and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Our in-depth examination of app- and adherence-related user behaviors offers insight into factors associated with successful weight loss in the context of mHealth interventions. In particular, our finding that self-reported dietary adherence was the most important metric predicting weight loss may aid in the development of future mHealth dietary interventions.

While most vaccine strategies for these viruses are developed around a programmed antibody response, relatively less attention is paid to our innate immune defenses that can determine the outcome of a viral infection via the production of antiviral cytokines like Type I Interferons. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the cytokine storm induced by aberrant activation of the innate immune response against a viral pathogen may sometimes offer replicative advantage to the virus thus promoting disease pathogenesis. Thus, it is important to fine tune the responses of the innate immune network that can be achieved via a deeper insight into the candidate molecules involved. Several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like the Toll like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) like receptors (RLRs) recognize cytosolic RNA viruses and mount an antiviral immune response. RLRs recognize invasive viral RNA produced during infection and mediate the induction of Type I Interferons via the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) molecule. It is an intriguing fact that the mitochondrion, one of the cells most vital organelle, has evolved to be a central hub in this antiviral defense. However, cytokine responses and interferon signaling via MAVS signalosome at the mitochondria must be tightly regulated to prevent overactivation of the immune responses. This review focuses on our current understanding of the innate immune sensing of the host mitochondria by the RLR-MAVS signalosome and its specificity against some of the emerging/re-emerging RNA viruses like Ebola, Zika, Influenza A virus (IAV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that may expand our understanding for novel pharmaceutical development.","output":"Picking up a Fight: Fine Tuning Mitochondrial Innate Immune Defenses Against RNA Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeDrawing on the behavioral theory of the firm (BTF), this study aims to understand the role of organizational slack in the manufacturing industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachUsing panel data of publicly traded manufacturing firms in the USA over a 12-quarter time period, this study uses generalized least squares modeling to test the hypothesized relationships.FindingsResults show that the COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on manufacturing firms performance and organizational slack weakens the negative relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and firm performance.

The decrease in volume has not only important implications for cancer diagnosis, surveillance, and management, but also for revenue generation by gynecologic oncology practices. We sought to explore how the implementation of telehealth could aid in maintaining revenue in a time of limited in-person encounters. We created a model to calculate the outpatient clinic production of a theoretical gynecologic oncology practice with a volume of 600 patients per month in revenue value units (RVUs) and US dollars. We modeled 3 scenarios including a baseline case with all in-person visits, a 30% drop in volume with all in-person visits, and a 30% telehealth/70% in-person visit scenario at baseline volume. We determined the loss of revenue and number of in-person visits avoided in each scenario. Additionally, we modeled how revenue may change if the incorporation of additional telehealth visits allowed for an increased number of in-person new patient visits. A practice with a monthly volume of 600 in-person patient visits would generate 1050 RVUs/$66,150 per month. If this theoretical practice suffered a 30% decrease in volume to 420 in person visits per month, production would drop to 736 RVUs/$46,368 per month. This decrease in $19,844 of monthly revenue would avoid 180 in-person encounters. If baseline practice volume was maintained by transitioning to 30% telehealth/70% in-person visits, revenue only drops by $7,372 per month, while avoiding 180 in-person encounters. If clinic structure utilizes independent advance practitioners for in-person encounters, clinic density can increase if physicians concurrently perform televisits. This increased clinic density and the downstream revenue generating effect of more new patient visits results in higher practice revenue. If transitioning 2 follow-up patients to telehealth allowed for one additional in-person new patient per clinic, production would increase by 308 RVUs/$19,404 per month. If transitioning 4 patients to telehealth allowed 2 additional new patient visits, production would increase by 656 RVUs/$41,476 per month. Though the optimal telehealth strategy for oncology is still unknown, implementing telehealth during a time of limited in-person visits may help ameliorate the financial loss to a practice. Additionally, if utilization of advanced practitioners and telehealth allows for more new patient evaluations and increased clinic density, a practice may stand to increase revenue substantially. A thorough understanding of the tradeoffs associated with telehealth are essential for establishing an optimal strategy for delivering, safe high-quality cancer care during this unprecedented global pandemic.

By using bone marrow-derived macrophages, we have recently demonstrated that M1 macrophages are much more susceptible than M0 and M2 subtypes of macrophages to necrotic cell death. Moreover, we showed that the enhanced necroptosis in M1 macrophages is dependent on the kinase activity of receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and may involve the upregulation of key necroptosis signaling molecules including RIPK3, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein, and Z-DNA/ RNA binding protein 1.

A decisive step in preventing or slowing the outbreak is the use of mobility interventions, such as government stay-at-home orders. However, different socio-demographic groups might have different responses to these orders and regulations. In this paper, we attempt to fill the current gap in the literature by examining how different communities with different age groups performed social distancing by following orders such as the national emergency declaration on March 13, as well as how fast they started changing their behavior after the regulations were imposed. For this purpose, we calculated the behavior changes of people in different mobility metrics, such as percentage of people staying home during the study period (March, April, and May 2020), in different age groups in comparison to the days before the pandemic (January and February 2020), by utilizing anonymized and privacy-protected mobile device data. Our study indicates that senior communities outperformed younger communities in terms of their behavior change.

Compared to migraineurs or normal control, medication overuse headache (MOH) patients are more likely to experience a worse psychological distress and poorer outcome in non-COVID-19 time. However, in COVID-19 pandemic, whether MOH patients would have greater physical and mental symptom deterioration or worse relief of headache symptoms and medications overuse remained unclear. We aim to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on MOH patients to guide for a better management in this study. METHODS: We enrolled MOH patients who were diagnosed and treated at headache clinic of West China Hospital. Information of the pre-pandemic 3 months period and COVID-19 pandemic period was collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify independent factors associated with changes in headache symptoms and drug withdrawal. RESULTS: Seventy-eight MOH patients were enrolled into the study ultimately. In comparison to pre-pandemic period, fewer MOH patients reported decreased headache days, intensity and days with acute medications per month during the pandemic. Available access to regular prophylactic medications was significantly associated with a reduction of at least 50% in headache days and decrease in headache intensity per month with respective odds ratios of 39.19 (95% CI 3.75C409.15, P = 0.002) and 10.13 (95% CI 2.33C44.12, P = 0.002). Following abrupt withdrawal and high educational level were both significant factors in decreasing headache intensity. Male sex was significantly associated with decrease in days with acute medication per month during the pandemic (odds ratios 4.78, 95%CI 1.44C15.87, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reflect that MOH patients experienced a worse relief of headache symptoms and drug withdrawal during the pandemic. Available access to regular prophylactic medications was the significant independent factor for improvement of headache symptoms. Male sex was significantly associated with decreased days with acute medications per month.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on headache symptoms and drug withdrawal among patients with medication overuse headache: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The article analyzes the epidemiological and political logics of protest against containment policies in Germany.

Although doctor recommendation methods have been proposed, they fail to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, and electronic medical records (EMRs), patient preferences, potential interest of service providers and the changes over time are largely under-explored. Therefore, this study develops a self-adaptive telemedicine specialist recommendation method that incorporates specialist activity and patient utility feedback from the perspective of privacy protection to fill the research gaps. Methods: First, text vectorization, view similarity and probabilistic topic model are used to construct the patient and specialist feature models based on patients EMRs and specialists long- and short-term knowledge backgrounds, respectively. Second, the recommended specialist candidate set and recommendation index are obtained based on the similarity between patient features. Then, the specialist long-term knowledge feature model is used to update the newly registered specialist recommendation index and the recommended specialist candidate set to overcome the data sparsity and cold-start issues, and the specialist short-term knowledge feature model is adopted to extend the recommended specialist candidate set at the semantic level. Finally, we introduce the specialists activity and patients perceived utility feedback mechanism to construct a closed-loop adjusted and optimized specialist recommendation method. Results: An empirical study was conducted integrating EMRs of telemedicine patients from the National Telemedicine Center of China and specialists profiles and ratings from an online healthcare platform. The proposed method successfully recommended relevant and active telemedicine specialists to the target patient, and increased the recommended opportunities for newly registered specialists to some extent. Conclusions: The proposed method emphasizes the adaptability and acceptability of the recommended results while ensuring their accuracy and relevance. Specialists activity and patients perceived utility jointly contribute to the acceptability of recommended results, and the recommendation strategy achieves the organic fusion of the two.

With no vaccine or treatment during the early days of the pandemic, it is of paramount importance to assess the publics awareness about COVID-19 so that prevention-focused educational campaigns can be sufficiently deployed. This study aimed to gauge the Syrian publics adherence to infection control measures by assessing attitudes and practices during the pandemic which ravaged an already war-torn Syria. METHODS: The web-based cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2020, nearly 11 years into the Syrian crisis. The survey contained 3 sections: socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes, and practice. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with good practices and negative attitudes. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25.0. RESULTS: Of the 3586 participants, 68.2% were females, 50.8% were unemployed, and 79.2% were college-educated. Only 1402 (39.1%) participants wore face masks when leaving their homes. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that female, age, and residence were factors associated with good practices such as avoiding mass gatherings, wearing face masks, and maintaining a 1-meter interpersonal distance. However, age and occupation were factors associated with negative attitudes towards the closure of universities and schools, travel bans, and quarantines for travellers. CONCLUSION: This survey highlights the need to address specific populations using various measures; there should be a specialized method of prevention for each occupation, age group, and place of residence to contain further outbreaks of COVID-19. This can be achieved through targeted awareness campaigns.","output":"A cross-sectional survey of COVID-19: attitude and prevention practice among Syrians()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze nucleic acid detection results of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients' nasal swabs and sputum specimens, and we provide reference for clinical sampling methods","output":"A comparative study of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid assay for nasal swab and sputum samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Learning efficient representation of graphs has recently been studied extensively for simple networks to facilitate various downstream applications. In this paper, we deal with a more generalized graph structure, called multigraph (multiple edges of different types connecting a pair of nodes) and propose Multigraph2Vec, a random walk based framework for learning multigraph network representation. Multigraph2Vec samples a heterogeneous neighborhood structure for each node by preserving the inter-layer interactions. It employs Lvy flight random walk strategy, which allows the random walker to travel across multiple layers and reach far-off nodes in a single step. The transition probabilities are learned in a supervised fashion as a function of node attributes (metadata based and/or network structure based). We compare Multigraph2Vec with four state-of-the-art baselines after suitably adopting to our setting on four datasets. Multigraph2Vec outperforms others in the task of link prediction, by beating the best baseline with 5.977% higher AUC score; while in the multi-class node classification task, it beats the best baseline with 5.28% higher accuracy.

In this fast and busy world, collecting blood from a healthy and voluntary donor is quite challenging due to time constraints. Many blood donors who wish to donate blood were unable to go to the blood bank because of simultaneous operational timings of the blood bank and office hours of the donors. We dealt with this concern by extending the donation hours and also started collecting blood on the weekends following LAARC (Listen, Acknowledge, Assess, Respond, Confirm) methodology as a pilot project for improving blood donor convenience and satisfaction at the blood bank. METHODOLOGY: It was a prospective observational pilot study conducted at the government tertiary care institute in the Department of Transfusion Medicine from December 2018 to June 2019. All blood donations were made as per the guidelines laid down by the Drug and Cosmetic Act. The donation timings were divided as office-hour donations (8 am to 5 pm on weekdays) and off-hours donations (5 pm to 8 pm, weekends and holidays). RESULTS: In this pilot project, over 7 months out of a total of 1,591 donations, 664 donations (41.73%) were done during the off-hours. The donor experiences were pleasing, and they felt extra cared due to the convenient donation timings. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the donation base needs more donor-friendly timings for the pleasant donation experience without hampering their work.

The microbes in its intestinal lumen play an essential role in the growth and health of the host. However, it is still unknown how the ileal microbes affect the body weight of the host. In this study, we used Muscovy ducks as an animal model to investigate the relationship between the ileal microbes and body weight and further explore the potential mechanism. The ileum tissue and ileal contents of 200 Muscovy ducks were collected for mRNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR, as well as DNA separation and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. With body weight being ranked, the bottom 20% (n = 40) and top 20% (n = 40) were set as the low and high groups, respectively. Our results showed that in the ileum of Muscovy ducks, the Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla with the 10 most abundant genera, namely Candidatus Arthromitus, Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Vibrio, Romboutsia, Cetobacterium, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Terrisporobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, and Lactobacillus. We identified Streptococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, Candidatus Arthromitus, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Oscillospira were closely correlated to the growth of Muscovy ducks. Streptococcus and Escherichia-Shigella were negatively related to body weight (BW), while Candidatus Arthromitus, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Oscillospira were positively associated with BW. In addition, we found that the relative expression levels of tight junction proteins (Claudin 1, Claudin 2, ZO-1 and ZO-2) in the high group showed an upward trend, although this trend was not significant (P > 0.05). The expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1, IL-2 and TNF-) decreased in the high group, while the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 increased. Of course, except IL-2, these differences were not significant (P > 0.05). Finally, the correlation analysis showed that Escherichia-Shigella was significantly positively correlated with IL-1 (P < 0.05).

The aim of our work was to better understand the impact of misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 on epidemic curves. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 28 May 2020). There is presently no information of sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of laboratory tests used in Canada for the causal agent for COVID-19. Therefore, we examined best attainable performance in other jurisdictions and similar viruses. This suggested perfect Sp and Sn 60C95%. We used these values to re-calculate epidemic curves to visualize the potential bias due to imperfect testing. If the sensitivity improved, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60C70% range. These issues are minor early in the epidemic, but hundreds of undiagnosed cases are likely later on. It is therefore hazardous to judge progress of the epidemic based on observed epidemic curves unless quality of testing is better understood.

Therefore, intensive treatment with three agents might be better still, providing it does not cause undue bleeding. OBJECTIVE To compare the safety and efficacy of intensive therapy with guideline antiplatelet therapy for acute ischaemic stroke and TIA. DESIGN International prospective randomised open-label blinded end-point parallel-group superiority clinical trial. SETTING Acute hospitals at 106 sites in four countries. PARTICIPANTS Patients > 50 years of age with acute non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or TIA within 48 hours of ictus (stroke). INTERVENTIONS Participants were allocated at random by computer to 1 month of intensive (combined aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole) or guideline (combined aspirin and dipyridamole, or clopidogrel alone) antiplatelet agents, and followed for 90 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the incidence and severity of any recurrent stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic; assessed using the modified Rankin Scale) or TIA within 90 days by blinded telephone follow-up. Analysis using ordinal logistic regression was by intention to treat. Other outcomes included bleeding and its severity, death, myocardial infarction (MI), disability, mood, cognition and quality of life. RESULTS The trial was stopped early on the recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee after recruitment of 3096 participants (intensive, n = 1556; guideline, n = 1540) from 106 hospitals in four countries between April 2009 and March 2016. The incidence and severity of recurrent stroke or TIA did not differ between intensive and guideline therapy in 3070 (99.2%) participants with data [93 vs. 105 stroke/TIA events; adjusted common odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.20; p = 0.47]. Major (encompassing fatal) bleeding was increased with intensive as compared with guideline therapy [39 vs. 17 participants; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.23, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.96; p = 0.006]. There were no differences between the treatment groups in all-cause mortality, or the composite of death, stroke, MI and major bleeding (aHR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.35; p = 0.88). LIMITATIONS Patients and investigators were not blinded to treatment. The comparator group comprised two guideline strategies because of changes in national guidelines during the trial. The trial was stopped early, thereby reducing its statistical power. CONCLUSIONS The use of three antiplatelet agents is associated with increased bleeding without any significant reduction in recurrence of stroke or TIA. FUTURE WORK The safety and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy (combined aspirin and clopidogrel) versus aspirin remains to be defined. Further research is required on identifying individual patient response to antiplatelets, and the relationship between response and the subsequent risks of vascular recurrent events and bleeding complications.

In this study, an artificial soil containing PFOA was used to evaluate the biological toxicity of PFOA to earthworms Eisenia fetida. Six kinds of oxidative stress biomarkers, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO), as well as lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) and DNA damage in earthworms were detected after exposure to 0, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 120 mg kg-1 PFOA in the soil for 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 days. The results of multi-biomarker responses indicated that PFOA can induce various adverse effects on earthworms, including growth inhibition, oxidative stress and genotoxicity, resulting in lipid membrane peroxidation, decreased lysosomal membrane stability and DNA damage. LPO, LMS and DNA damage all presented dose- and time-dependent relationships. An integrated biomarker response (IBR) index was applied to summarize the multi-biomarker responses to star plots, and the IBR value was calculated as the area of the plots to indicate the integrated stress of PFOA on earthworms. The IBR index showed that the integrated stress induced by PFOA increased markedly throughout the exposure period, exhibiting a concentration-related and exposure time-related effect. The graphical changing trend of the IBR star plots, along with the multi-biomarker responses, suggested that the biomarkers of the antioxidant defense system in earthworms are sufficiently sensitive for short-term PFOA biomonitoring programs, while the bioindicators that indicate actual damage in organisms are more suitable to be employed in long-term monitoring programs for the risk assessment of PFOA. This is the first study evaluating the biological toxicity of PFOA by using an integrated biomarker approach.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT) for UTI in hospitalized older adults. DESIGN: We performed a prospective cohort study of older adults (65 years old) admitted to a single hospital with evidence of pyuria on urinalysis. PCT was tested on initial blood samples. The reference standard was a clinical definition that included the presence of a positive urine culture and any symptom or sign of infection referable to the genitourinary tract. We also surveyed the treating physicians for their clinical judgment and performed expert adjudication of cases for the determination of UTI. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty-nine study participants at a major academic medical center. MAIN MEASURES: We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of PCT for the diagnosis of UTI. KEY RESULTS: In this study cohort, 61 (27%) participants met clinical criteria for UTI. The median age of the overall cohort was 82.6 (IQR 74.9C89.7) years. The AUC of PCT for the diagnosis of UTI was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.46C0.65). A series of sensitivity analyses on UTI definition, which included using a decreased threshold for bacteriuria, the treating physicians clinical judgment, and independent infectious disease specialist adjudication, confirmed the negative result. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that PCT has limited value in the diagnosis of UTI among hospitalized older adults. Clinicians should be cautious using PCT for the diagnosis of UTI in hospitalized older adults.

The daily increase in COVID-19 instances is due to a lack of and restricted availability of detection techniques for determining the disease's presence. Therefore, detecting positive results as soon as feasible is important to preventing the spread of this epidemic and treating infected people as soon as possible. As a result of these constraints, the demand for clinical decision-making systems based on predictive algorithms has increased. The article describes a recurrent neural network (RNN) for identifying Coronavirus (COVID-19) and tries to improve the detection method. Different machine learning methodologies, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), were used to create a detection system with a deep learning algorithm called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The research describes a method for detecting COVID-19 in tagged CT images of patients. Various common picture features, such as central moments, Gabor wavelets, and GLCM-related features, are discussed. Ant colony optimization-ant lion optimization (ACO-ALO) is used to select optimum subsets of SVM parameters. The results show that SVM parameters such as penalty and kernel parameters have a positive effect on SVM model correctness and complexity. Besides, the findings revealed that the proposed method may be employed as a system of aid to diagnose COVID-19 disease. The findings uncover that the suggested strategy has promising behavior in terms of increasing classification accuracies as well as optimal feature selection.

In this single-center cohort study, comprising 300 participants, two phone interviews were conducted (2-week and 1-month after hospitalization) and symptoms were queried with a standardized form. This form included musculoskeletal symptoms and other COVID-19 symptoms. Considering all symptoms (musculoskeletal and other), 100.0%, 86.7%, and 72.0% of patients reported one or more symptoms, at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. Considering only musculoskeletal symptoms, 92.3%, 72.7%, and 56.3% of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively.

This strategy allows to collect and screen multiple specimen samples in a single test, thus immensely saving the assay time and consumable expenses. Nevertheless, when the outcome of a pooled testing is positive, it necessitates repetitive retesting steps for each sample which can pose a serious challenge during a rising infection wave of increasing prevalence. In this work, we develop a unique barcoded primer-assisted sample-specific pooled testing strategy (Uni-Pool) where the key genetic sequences of the viral pathogen in a crude sample are extracted and amplified with concurrent tagging of sample-specific identifiers. This new process improves the existing pooled testing by eliminating the need for retesting and allowing the test results-positive or negative-for all samples in the pool to be revealed by multiplex melting curve analysis right after real-time polymerase chain reaction. It significantly reduces the total assay time for large-scale screening without compromising the specificity and detection sensitivity caused by the sample dilution of pooling. Our method was able to successfully differentiate five samples, positive and negative, in one pool with negligible cross-reactivity among the positive and negative samples. A pooling of 40 simulated samples containing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pseudovirus of different loads (min: 10 copies/L; max: 103 copies/L) spiked into artificial saliva was demonstrated in eight randomized pools.

METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey recruited multidisciplinary health professionals (HPs) who were members of the Cooperative Trials Group for Neuro-Oncology involved in management of patients diagnosed with HGG in Australian hospitals. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Fisher's exact test was used to explore differences between groups. RESULTS: 42 complete responses were received. A majority of MDT meetings were attended by a: neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, radiologist, and care coordinator. Less than 10% reported attendance by a palliative care nurse; physiotherapist; neuropsychologist; or speech therapist. Most could access referral pathways to a cancer care coordinator (76%), neuropsychologist (78%), radiation oncology nurse (77%), or psycho-oncologist (73%), palliative care (93C100%) and mental health professionals (60C85%). However, few routinely referred to an exercise physiologist (10%), rehabilitation physician (22%), dietitian (22%) or speech therapist (28%). Similarly, routine referrals to specialist mental health services were not standard practice. Nearly all HPs (94%) reported HGG patients were advised to present to their GP for pre-existing conditions/comorbidities; however, most HPs took responsibility ( 36% referred to GP) for social issues, mental health, symptoms, cancer complications, and treatment side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: While certain services are accessible to HGG patients nationally, improvements are needed.

METHODS Forty-eight patients undergoing emergency laparotomy were divided into AKI and non-AKI groups by the kidney diseases: improving global outcome (KDIGO) criteria. Ten patients were included in the AKI group. Urinary L-FABP, albumin, N-acetyl--D-glucosaminidase (NAG), TIMP-2, IGFBP7, serum creatinine (SCr), and blood presepsin were measured perioperatively and compared between groups. Perioperative urinary L-FABP was also evaluated qualitatively using a POC kit. RESULTS L-FABP and albumin levels were significantly higher in the AKI group at all measurement points. NAG was significantly higher only postoperatively in the AKI group. There were no inter-group differences in [TIMP-2]  [IGFBP7] at any measuring point. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of urinary L-FABP was greater than 0.8 perioperatively, which was larger than that of other biomarkers throughout the study period. The correlation coefficient at 2 h after entering the operating room between quantitative and qualitative tests for urinary L-FABP was 0.714, which was the maximum. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of the urinary L-FABP POC kit at 2 h after entry were 55.6%, 91.9%, and 89.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION Quantitative L-FABP analyses is suitable for predicting postoperative AKI earlier in the perioperative period of emergency laparotomy.

RESULTS: We show that the number of rumors related to the COVID-19 pandemic fluctuated widely in China between December 1, 2019 and April 15, 2020. Rumors mainly occurred in 3 provinces: Hubei, Zhejiang, and Guangxi. Personal social media accounts constituted the major source of media reports of the 4 most widely distributed rumors (the novel coronavirus can be prevented with Shuanghuanglian: 7648/10,664, 71.7%; the novel coronavirus is the SARS coronavirus: 14,696/15,902, 92.4%; medical supplies intended for assisting Hubei were detained by the local government: 3911/3943, 99.2%; asymptomatically infected persons were regarded as diagnosed COVID-19 patients with symptoms in official counts: 322/323, 99.7%). The number of rumors circulating was positively associated with the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic (=0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.93). The release of correction articles was associated with a substantial decrease in the proportion of rumor reports compared to accurate reports. The proportions of negative sentiments appearing among comments by citizens in response to media articles disseminating rumors and disseminating correct information differ insignificantly (both correct reports: (1)(2)=0.315, P=.58; both rumors: (1)(2)=0.025, P=.88; first rumor and last correct report: (1)(2)=1.287, P=.26; first correct report and last rumor: (1)(2)=0.033, P=.86).

METHODS: A total of 40 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Baseline clinical data, CT images, and laboratory testing results were collected from all patients. We defined that ROIs in the absorption group decreased in the density and scope in GGO, and ROIs in the progress group progressed to consolidation. A total of 180 ROIs from absorption group (n = 118) and consolidation group (n = 62) were randomly divided into a training set (n = 145) and a validation set (n = 35) (8:2). Radiomics features were extracted from CT images, and the radiomics-based models were built with three classifiers. A radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated by a linear combination of selected features. The Rad-score and clinical factors were incorporated into the radiomics nomogram construction. The prediction performance of the clinical factors model and the radiomics nomogram for prognosis was estimated. RESULTS: A total of 15 radiomics features with respective coefficients were calculated. The AUC values of radiomics models (kNN, SVM, and LR) were 0.88, 0.88, and 0.84, respectively, showing a good performance. The C-index of the clinical factors model was 0.82 [95% CI (0.75-0.88)] in the training set and 0.77 [95% CI (0.59-0.90)] in the validation set. The radiomics nomogram showed optimal prediction performance. In the training set, the C-index was 0.91 [95% CI (0.85-0.95)], and in the validation set, the C-index was 0.85 [95% CI (0.69-0.95)]. For the training set, the C-index of the radiomics nomogram was significantly higher than the clinical factors model (p = 0.0021). Decision curve analysis showed that radiomics nomogram outperformed the clinical model in terms of clinical usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: The radiomics nomogram based on CT images showed favorable prediction performance in the prognosis of COVID-19.

This infection can cause mild to very severe respiratory and systemic illness mainly related with a cytokine storm. The epidemiology of COVID-19 is under continuous evolution, and studies are ongoing aiming at identifying the possible factors facilitating the diffusion of this infection. It is documented that air pollution and smoking are a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality globally, and can increase the risk of many diseases, including respiratory diseases. Overall, a linear relationship between exposure to atmospheric pollutants and diffusion of the Sars-Cov2 virus seems to exist. However, this correlation, cannot be regarded as a cause-effect relationship. The available data show that air pollution is responsible for inflammation and hyper-activation of innate immunity that are associated with the worst outcomes of covid-19 but do not allow to conclude that atmospheric particulate is responsible for increased contagion. As to smoking, nicotine activation of nicotinic receptors leads to enhanced protease activation, apoptosis and inflammatory signaling through the same pathways (Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) used by the virus increasing the inflammatory/destructive action of the virus itself. The increase in non-communicable diseases and of chronic inflammatory diseases is in line with environmental pollution, related climate changes, and with an augmented susceptibility to infectious diseases with increased contagiousness and morbidity.

However, a significant number of infected people present as asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic. In this prospective assessment of at-risk healthcare workers (HCWs) we seek to determine whether pre-existing antibody or T cell responses to previous seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV) infections affect immunological or clinical responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. METHODS: A cohort of 300 healthcare workers, confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 exposure upon study entry, will be followed for up to 1 year with monthly serology analysis of IgM and IgG antibodies against the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and the four major seasonal human coronavirus - HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. Participants will complete monthly questionnaires that ask about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure risks, and a standardized, validated symptom questionnaire (scoring viral respiratory disease symptoms, intensity and severity) at least twice monthly and any day when any symptoms manifest. SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing will be performed any time participants develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19. For those individuals that seroconvert and/or test positive by SARS-CoV-2 PCR, or receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, additional studies of T cell activation and cytokine production in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools and analysis of Natural Killer cell numbers and function will be conducted on that participants cryopreserved baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Following the first year of this study we will further analyze those participants having tested positive for COVID-19, and/or having received an authorized/licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, quarterly (year 2) and semi-annually (years 3 and 4) to investigate immune response longevity. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the frequency of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of at-risk healthcare workers. Baseline and longitudinal assays will determine the frequency and magnitude of anti-spike glycoprotein antibodies to the seasonal HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63, and may inform whether pre-existing antibodies to these human coronaviruses are associated with altered COVID-19 disease course. Finally, this study will evaluate whether pre-existing immune responses to seasonal HCoVs affect the magnitude and duration of antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, adjusting for demographic covariates.

METHODS The leadership of our academic hospital medicine group designed a geographic rounding intervention with the goal of improving provider satisfaction and mitigating burnout. Our quantitative analysis compared the pre-intervention and post-intervention time periods with regard to progress note completion time, after-hours progress note completion, secure messaging communication volume, and Mini-Z survey results. A post-intervention qualitative analysis was performed to further explore the relationship between geographic rounding and the drivers of burnout. RESULTS Following the intervention, 97% of geographic rounders were localized to one or two geographic areas and 77% were localized to a single geographic area. Following the implementation of geographic rounding, progress notes were completed an average of 29 minutes earlier (p<0.001). The proportion of progress notes completed after-hours decreased from 25.1% to 20% (p<0.001). The volume of secure messages received by hospitalists decreased from 1.95 to 1.8 per patient per day (p<0.001). The proportion of hospitalists reporting no burnout increased from 77.8% to 93% after implementing geographic rounding, a change that did not reach statistical significance (p=0.1).

Antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infection neutralize the virus by focused targeting of Spike and there is limited serum cross-neutralization of the closely-related SARS-CoV. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants are rapidly emerging, exemplified by the B.1.1.7, 501Y.V2 and P.1 lineages, it is critical to understand if antibody responses induced by infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus or the current vaccines will remain effective against virus variants. In this study we evaluate neutralization of a series of mutated Spike pseudotypes including a B.1.1.7 Spike pseudotype. The analyses of a panel of Spike-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that the neutralizing activity of some antibodies was dramatically reduced by Spike mutations. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies in the serum of patients infected in early 2020 remained active against most mutated Spike pseudotypes. The majority of serum samples were equally able to neutralize the B.1.1.7 Spike pseudotype, however potency was reduced in a small number of samples (3 of 36) by 5C10-fold.

The ability of a cast to maintain a desired shape is termed moldability. Clinicians use plaster, fiberglass, and soft casts. To our knowledge the biomechanical molding characteristics of these 3 materials have never been reported. We hypothesized that moldability of plaster would be better than fiberglass and fiberglass would be better than soft cast. METHODS We compared 12.7 cm wide casts of plaster, fiberglass, and soft cast. Casts were 5 layers thick, prepared in 40C water, and placed over 2 layers of cotton padding on 5.1 cm and 15.2 cm diameter foam cylinders. A loading device simulated loads applied by clinicians when molding casts for 4 conditions: clubfoot (thumb-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), DDH (thumb-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model), forearm fracture (palm-shaped 50 N load on 5.1 cm model), and femur fracture (palm-shaped 100 N load on 15.2 cm model). The loading device applied molding for 7 minutes. Five casts of each material were made for each model. Casts were removed, photographed, and the area of maximal deformation was compared with an unmolded cast. A large area of maximal deformation meant that the deformation was spread out over a large area, less precise molding. RESULTS In the clubfoot model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.002) and soft cast (P<0.0001). In the DDH model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P<0.0001) and soft cast (P<0.0001) and fiberglass was more precise than soft cast (P<0.0001).In the femur fracture model, plaster was more precise than fiberglass (P=0.001) and soft cast (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS The moldability of plaster is better than fiberglass and soft cast and fiberglass is better than soft cast. CLINICAL RELEVANCE If precise molding is required, plaster has the best moldability. In cases not requiring precise molding, fiberglass and soft cast are lightweight, waterproof, and available in child-friendly colors.","output":"What is the best material for molding casts in children?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis ligand (TRAIL) is a promising antitumor agent candidate for its selective proapoptotic activity to various tumor cells. However, TRAIL showed limited efficacy in clinical trials despite of good tolerability. One important reason might be attributed to the poor tumor-homing ability of TRAIL. Herein, we designed an EGFR-targeting TRAIL (Z-TRAIL) by genetically fusing an EGFR-antagonistic affibody (ZEGFR:1907) to the N-terminus of TRAIL. Z-TRAIL was produced as a soluble protein with high yield in E. coli and it maintained the trimeric state of active TRAIL. Under the EGFR-binding mediated by ZEGFR:1907, Z-TRAIL showed a a5 to 20-fold enhancement of cytotoxicity compared to TRAIL on tumor cells in vitro. Furthermore, fusion to ZEGFR:1907 endowed TRAIL with a a1.8-fold increase of tumor uptake and a dramatical stronger apoptosis-inducing ability in the mice bearing EGFR-overexpressing A431 tumor xenografts. More importantly, Z-TRAIL exhibited significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy against whether EGFR high-expressing or low-expressing tumors than TRAIL in vivo. In addition, repeated injection of high-dose Z-TRAIL did not show obvious acute toxicity in mice.

In the absence of a common approach to ensure access to this essential health service, we sought to describe the variability of abortion policies during the outbreak in Europe in order to identify strategies that improve availability and access to abortion in times of public health crises. METHODS: We collected information from 46 countries/regions: 31 for which country-experts completed a survey and 15 for which we conducted a desk review. We describe abortion regulations and changes to regulations and practice during the pandemic. RESULTS: During COVID-19, abortions were banned in six countries and suspended in one. Surgical abortion was less available due to COVID-19 in 12 countries/regions and services were not available or delayed for women with COVID-19 symptoms in eleven. No country expanded its gestational limit for abortion. Changes during COVID-19, mostly designed to reduce in-person consultations, occurred in 13 countries/regions. Altogether eight countries/regions provided home medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol beyond 9 weeks (from 9 weeks+6 days to 11 weeks+6 days) and 13 countries/regions up to 9 weeks (in some instances only misoprostol could be taken at home). Only six countries/regions offered abortion by telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of a unified policy response to COVID-19 restrictions has widened inequities in abortion access in Europe, but some innovations including telemedicine deployed during the outbreak could serve as a catalyst to ensure continuity and equity of abortion care.","output":"Abortion regulation in Europe in the era of COVID-19: a spectrum of policy responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The world is currently in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has led to an increase in internet usage including social media. This study was carried out in order to discover how the pandemic affected the Maltese population who use social media networks daily. METHODS: A dataset comprising more than 50,000 comments and in excess of 150,000 interactions were extracted from Facebook over four months. The method was quantitative and qualitative. Pearson correlation was used to analyse trends. RESULTS: Online interaction increased 200% between February-April 2020, with a significant positive correlation. There was also a significant correlation between online interaction and engagement and the Covid-19 situation in Malta (p a?a 0.0001). Online posts portraying a sense of care, affection, and unity increased by more than 300% over the same period, and this also significantly correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases in Malta (p a?a 0.0001). An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases had an emotional impact mainly on anxiety and agitation. DISCUSSION: The pandemic has unleashed a veritable 'infodemic' (an over-abundance of information - some accurate and some not). Social media engagement may have been resorted to not only to seek information but also to interact with friends and family who were not physically accessible due to social distancing measures.

Primary outcomes were postpartum length of stay (LOS), presentations to the emergency department (ED), and readmissions 30 days or longer after discharge. Following Bonferroni correction, p < 0.016 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In total, 3377 women were included: 640, 914, and 1823 in groups A, B, and C, respectively.

Yet, discussions in scholarly circles often emphasise his tectonic genius related to sublime formgiving and structural-material experiments. Less attention is given to how his sense of empathy and concern for the well-being of users influenced his design process. To address this absence, we explored how training students in a user empathic design process can be integrated in an architectural and engineering design approach. First, we outline a theoretical framework grounded in the 1) scholarship on tectonic thinking by Jonathan Hale and Marco Frascari and 2) cognitive-neuroscientific understanding of how human beings interact with their surroundings in an embodied and emotional manner. Architectural experience is thus co-produced in an on-going meeting between structures, spaces, and human bodies. Secondly, we present a case study of an experiment with storyboarding as a technique to visualize the intangible aspects of designing for well-being and emotional experience. Placing the body and experience at the center of the design process calls for greater sensitivity to diversities within user groups. We argue for an adjusted tectonic design toolbox focused around translating experiences, emotions, and behaviors as a means of joining user-oriented, architectural, and engineering principles in the early design phases. This paper intends to spark a debate about tectonics of well-being and to discuss whether storyboarding as a narrative design tool can help join structural-material genius with socio-cultural realms of human experience in tectonic design.","output":"Stories of structures, spaces and bodies: towards a tectonics of well-being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, it became imperative to adopt emergency measures to prevent a crisis in the health system in northeastern Brazil In this context, Miguel Bastos, manager of Sistema Indstria, a class entity in the northeastern industrial sector, dedicated all his efforts to coordinate an emerging network of institutions involved in research, development, innovation, manufacturing, and maintenance of products demanded by a health system Thus, this teaching case aims to allow students to understand the context of a cooperation network created to meet the needs of the health sector in combating the pandemic of COVID-19 Given the difficulties inherent in a leadership process involving seven different institutions, how should the protagonist organize this network to meet the expected demands?

APPROACH AND RESULTS: Medical records of 616 pneumonia patients who were admitted to the Yichang Central Peoples Hospital in Hubei, China, from January 1 to March 23, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated in the dedicated COVID-19 units, and the patients with CAP were admitted to regular hospital campus. Risks of VTE were assessed using the Padua prediction score. All the patients received pharmaceutical or mechanical VTE prophylaxis. VTE was diagnosed using Duplex ultrasound or computed tomography pulmonary angiogram. Differences between COVID-19 and CAP groups were compared statistically. All statistical tests were 2 sided, and P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data managements and analyses were performed by IBM SPSS, version 24, software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). Of the 616 patients, 256 had COVID-19 pneumonia and 360 patients had CAP. The overall rate of VTE was 2% in COVID-19 pneumonia group and 3.6% in CAP group, respectively (P=0.229). In these two groups, 15.6% of the COVID-19 pneumonia patients and 10% of the CAP patients were categorized as high risk for VTE (Padua score, >4), which were significantly different (P=0.036). In those high-risk patients, the incidence of VTE was 12.5% in COVID-19 pneumonia group and 16.7% in CAP group (P=0.606). Subgroup analysis of the critically ill patients showed that VTE rate was 6.7% in COVID-19 group versus 13% in CAP group (P=0.484). In-hospital mortality of COVID-19 and CAP was 6.3% and 3.9%, respectively (P=0.180). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with hypercoagulable state.

Here we exploit a natural experiment whereby Colombian cities implemented varied lockdown policies based on ID number and gender to analyse the impact of these policies on urban mobility. Using mobile phone data, we find that the restrictiveness of cities' mobility quotas (the share of residents allowed out daily according to policy advice) does not correlate with mobility reduction. Instead, we find that larger, wealthier cities with more formalized and complex industrial structure experienced greater reductions in mobility. Within cities, wealthier residents are more likely to reduce mobility, and commuters are especially more likely to stay at home when their work is located in wealthy or commercially/industrially formalized neighbourhoods. Hence, our results indicate that cities' employment characteristics and work-from-home capabilities are the primary determinants of mobility reduction. This finding underscores the need for mitigations aimed at lower income/informal workers, and sheds light on critical dependencies between socio-economic classes in Latin American cities.","output":"COVID-19 policy analysis: labour structure dictates lockdown mobility behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a world increasingly vulnerable to extremesbe they related to resource scarcity, economic shocks, social disturbances, or other issuesa greater emphasis is being placed on our resilience and ability to recover.

Here we present a case of acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis after initiating therapy with inhaled amikacin. CASE PRESENTATION: An 82 year old male with a history of pulmonary MAC infection and chronic hypoxemia on 2L oxygen presented with progressive non-productive cough and dyspnea. He had been diagnosed with pulmonary MAC three years prior to presentation and had been treated with azithromycin, rifampin, and ethambutol. CT chest imaging demonstrated multifocal bronchiectasis, tree in bud nodules, and cavitary lesions. Respiratory AFB cultures were positive for MAC. He was prescribed oral rifampin and azithromycin. Intravenous amikacin was considered given cavitary disease but deferred in light of age and comorbidities. Inhaled amikacin was prescribed but unable to be started as an outpatient. One week later, he was admitted with new fevers, progressive dry cough, dyspnea, and increased oxygen requirement. CT chest was negative for pulmonary embolism and showed new multifocal ground glass opacities (Image #1). He was admitted for suspected superimposed bacterial or viral pneumonia. COVID-19 and respiratory viral testing were negative. Sputum culture was unable to be obtained due to non-productive cough. Rifampin and azithromycin were continued and nebulized amikacin was initiated. Broad spectrum antibiotics were started to cover for bacterial pneumonia. He initially defervesced but on hospital day #5, his dyspnea and hypoxemia worsened. He required up to 15 liters 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask. He was empirically diuresed and antibiotic coverage was broadened without improvement. Echocardiogram showed unchanged cardiac function. CT chest imaging on hospital day #7 demonstrated progressive multifocal ground glass opacities with intralobular and interlobular septal thickening (Image #2). Clinical picture was concerning for drug induced pneumonitis. Amikacin was discontinued and oral prednisone was started. His respiratory symptoms improved and he was weaned to 2L via nasal cannula prior to discharge. Nebulized amikacin was not restarted. DISCUSSION: In this patient, initiation of inhaled amikacin was temporally related to the development of an acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis associated with significant hypoxemia which improved promptly with the discontinuation of inhaled amikacin and initiation of corticosteroids. Trial data investigating inhaled liposomal amikacin in pulmonary MAC has reported a 3% incidence of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled amikacin is a useful adjunctive therapy in the treatment of refractory pulmonary MAC infection. The development of hypersensitivity pneumonitis should prompt immediate discontinuation of the drug and consideration for corticosteroid therapy in severe cases.

She had two hospitalisations, a total of 19 RT-PCR tests, mostly positive, and criteria for releasing from home isolation at the end of 97 days. Methods. The viral genome was sequenced in seven serial samples and in the diagnostic sample from an infected close relative. A human genome-wide array (>900K) was screened on the seven samples, and in vitro culture was conducted on isolates from three late samples. Results. The patient had co-infection by two SARS-CoV-2 strains, affiliated in distinct clades and diverging by six variants. The 20A lineage was absolute at the diagnosis (shared with a cohabitating relative), but nine days later the 20B lineage had 3% frequency, and two months later the 20B lineage had 100% frequency. The 900K profiles confirmed the identity of the patient in the serial samples, and allowed us to infer that she had polygenic risk scores for hospitalization and severe respiratory disease within the normal distributions for a Portuguese population cohort.

RESULTS: Overall patients reported low awareness of and an indifferent attitude towards TB, although all reported understanding the need to adhere to treatment. Participants reported complex pathways to care, often requiring visits to multiple healthcare facilities. Some participants reported visiting traditional Tibetan medicine (TTM) providers. Participants reported various barriers to accessing care including challenges physically reaching care, out-of-pocket payments for tests, diagnostics and transport. Barriers to maintaining care included medication side effects and worry about treatment effectiveness. Enablers to accessing care identified included knowledge or past experience with TB, integrated models of TTM and western care, supportive village doctors who conducted home visits, free TB treatment and other subsidies, as well as having family support with care and social support as barriers and facilitators to maintaining treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We identified barriers and facilitators to accessing services in rural communities in Xigaze from the perspective of persons impacted by TB. Challenges include complex pathways to care, travel distances, wait times and low awareness. Tuberculosis care in the region could be strengthened by ongoing culturally tailored educational campaigns to increase awareness, partnerships with TTM providers, providing comprehensive treatment subsidies and strengthening the role of family members in comprehensive TB care.

OBJECTIVE To determine in a retrospective study, the prevalence of hBoV, compared with common respiratory viruses (RV), in respiratory specimens from patients with ARD. STUDY DESIGN A total of 335 specimens obtained over 7 years were examined. Two hundred were nasal swabs from infants hospitalized for ARD, 84 were nasal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavages from adults with pneumonia, bronchopneumonia or asthma, and 51 were nasal swabs from healthy children. RESULTS The overall rate of hBoV detection in specimens from infants with ARD, which was 4.5%, varied slightly from year to year, except for the period 2000-2002, when no specimen was positive. Unlike other RV, no seasonal variation in hBoV incidence was noted. Infants with hBoV infection suffered either from bronchiolitis or from bronchopneumonia and 5 out of 9 cases yielded no co-infecting viral pathogen. Only one sample from an adult was hBoV positive. None of the nasal swabs from healthy subjects tested hBoV-positive.

We examined the reach, engagement and effectiveness of online delivery of lifestyle change programs (LCP) modelled after the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in a multistate, real-world setting. METHODS: Longitudinal, non-randomized study comparing online and in-person LCP in a large multistate sample delivered over 1 year. Sample included at-risk adults (n = 26,743) referred to online (n = 9) and in-person (n = 11) CDC-recognized LCP from a multi-state registry (California, Florida and Colorado) between 2015 and 2018. The main outcome was effectiveness (proportion achieving > 5% weight loss) at one-year. Our secondary outcomes included reach (proportion enrolled among referred) and engagement (proportion  9 sessions by week 26). We used logistic regression modelling to assess the association between participant- and setting -level characteristics with meaningful weight loss. RESULTS: Online LCP effectiveness was lower, with 23% of online participants achieving > 5% weight loss, compared with 35% of in-person participants (p < 0.001). More adults referred to online programs enrolled (56% vs 51%, p < 0.001), but fewer engaged at 6-months (attendance at 9 sessions 46% vs 66%, p < 0.001) compared to in-person participants. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to adults referred to in-person LCP, those referred to online LCP were more likely to enroll and less likely to engage. Online participants achieved modest meaningful weight loss. Online delivery of LCP is an attractive strategy to deliver and scale DPP, particularly with social distancing measures currently in place. However, it is unclear how to optimize delivery models for maximal impact given trade-offs in reach and effectiveness.

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is known to be downregulated by hypoxia and modulate junctional complexes, which are crucial structures maintaining the intestinal barrier. This study aimed to investigate whether CFTR plays a role in both regulating the intestinal barrier and mediating EBT post severe burn, as well as the signaling pathways involved in these processes. METHODS: An in vitro Caco-2 cell model subjected to hypoxic injury and an in vivo mouse model with a 30% total body surface area full-thickness dermal burn were established. DF 508 mice (mice with F508del CFTR gene mutation) were used as an in vivo model to further demonstrate the role of CFTR in maintaining normal intestinal barrier function. QRT-PCR, western blot, ELISA, TER assay and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect the expression and localization of CFTR and tight junction proteins, as well as the function of tight junctions. RESULTS: Our data indicated that, in Caco-2 cells, the hypoxia condition significantly reduced CFTR expression; activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and nuclear factor-B signaling; elevated secretion of inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1 and interleukin-8); downregulated zonula occludens-1, occludin and E-cadherin expression; decreased transepithelial electrical resistance values; and led to a cellular mislocation of ZO-1. More importantly, knockdown of CFTR caused similar alterations. The upregulation of inflammatory factors and downregulation of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) induced by knockdown of CFTR could be reversed by specific extracellular signal-regulated kinase or nuclear factor-B inhibition. In support of the in vitro data, exuberant secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and EBT was observed in the intestine of severely burnt mice in vivo. EBT occurred in DF508 mice (mice with the F508del CFTR gene mutation), accompanied by augmented tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1 and interleukin-8 levels in the ileum compared to wildtype mice. In addition, vitamin D3 was shown to protect the intestinal epithelial barrier from hypoxic injury. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the present study illustrated that CFTR and downstream signaling were critical in modulating the intestinal epithelial junction and EBT post severe burn.","output":"Molecular mechanism mediating enteric bacterial translocation after severe burn: the role of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus disease) pandemic is deeply concerning because of its massive mortality and morbidity, creating adverse perceptions among patients likely to impact on their overall medical care. Thus, we evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of primary care consultations within a Shanghai health district. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was performed, with data analyzed concerning the pattern of patient visits to general practitioners within the Tongren Hospital network (the sole provider of general practice to the population of 700,000). Data from all general practice consultations for adults were collected for the first 6 months of 2020, which included a 60-day lockdown period (January 24CMarch 24, 2020) and compared to corresponding data from the first 6 months of 2019. We evaluated changes to the numbers and patterns of primary care consultations, including subgroup analysis based on age, sex, and primary diagnosis. Results: A substantial reduction in patient visits, associated with increased median age, was observed during the first wave of the pandemic in the first 6 months of 2020, compared to the same interval during 2019. Additionally, reduced reappointments and waiting times, but increased costs per visit were observed. When analyzed by primary disease diagnosis, patient visits were reduced for all the major systems. The most striking visit reductions were in cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, and gastrointestinal diseases. However, psychological disorders were increased following lockdown, but there was also a dramatic fall in consultations for depression. Reduced monthly patient numbers correlated with both rate of reappointment and average waiting time during the first 6 months of both 2019 and 2020, but an inverse correlation was observed between cost per visit and monthly patient numbers. Specifically during the lockdown period, there was ~50% reduced patient visits. Conclusions: The lockdown has had a serious impact on patients' physical and psychological health. Our analysis provides objective health-related data that may inform the current controversy concerning the balance between the detrimental effects of the use of lockdown vs. the use of a more targeted approach to eliminate viral transmission. These data may improve decision-making in medical practice, policy, and education.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Primary Care General Practice Consultations in a Teaching Hospital in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we establish a three-layer coupled network model to analyze the co-evolution of negative vaccine-related information, vaccination behavior, and epidemic spread.

Then, we use the micro-Markov chain (MMC) method to derive the system dynamics equations and the epidemic threshold. The analytical results show that the proportion of efficaciously vaccinated individuals and the topology of the epidemic spread layer both determine the epidemic threshold. Finally, a large number of simulation experiments are conducted to investigate the impact of various factors on the epidemic spread, which include negative vaccine-related information diffusion, rational judgment and herd mentality during the process of vaccination decision, and cost of vaccine. The results demonstrate the role of negative vaccine-related information diffusion and vaccination behavior spread in epidemic control, and may provide some valuable clues for policymakers to formulate appropriate measures to prevent and control epidemics.","output":"Impact of co-evolution of negative vaccine-related information, vaccination behavior and epidemic spreading in multilayer networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues, frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients are experiencing severe fatigue and mental stress.

Ammonia is thought to be part of the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. Zinc is an essential trace element, one of the cofactor enzymes that is essential for the conversion of ammonia to urea. AIM: To assess the effect of zinc supplementation on psychomotor performance in cirrhotic patients with MHE. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled trial recruited 69 cirrhotic patients (age 18-75 years) diagnosed with MHE by neuropsychometric (NP) tests comprised of the number connection test part A (NCT-A), number connection test part B (NCT-B), serial dot test (SDT), line tracing test (LTT) and digit symbol test (DST). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-based system block of four randomizations to receive 45 mg of elemental zinc or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in NP tests from baseline to 12-weeks of zinc supplement compared with placebo. The assessment of changes of the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the Short Form survey-36 (SF-36) questionnaire, as well as biochemical parameters including serum ammonia, was also conducted in both groups. RESULTS: From January to December 2020, 125 eligible cirrhotic patients were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, of whom 69 (55%) had MHE and were randomly assigned to treatment: 35 patients were assigned to receive 45 mg of elemental zinc and the others 34 patients to receive placebo. Significant improvements in NP tests were established in the zinc supplement group when compared with the placebo group (NCT-A, p = 0.029; NCT-B, p = 0.008; SDT, p = 0.002; DST, p = <0.001). A significant improvement of HRQOL assessed by the SF-36 score was only seen in the zinc group (p<0.001). In the zinc supplement group, not only was an improvement in psychomotor performance reported, but quality of life was also improved, irrespective of baseline zinc level. CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of zinc supplement in cirrhotic patients with MHE not only had a positive effect on psychomotor performance but also improved HRQOL irrespective to baseline zinc level.","output":"Efficacy of Zinc Supplement in Minimal hepatic Encephalopathy: A prospective, Randomized Controlled Study (Zinc-MHE Trial)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a new strain of coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is spreading rapidly worldwide.

PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and sixty\\\\four ED sites in 33 states from January 1, 2019 to November 15, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: We measured daily ED visit counts for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, sepsis, fall, and hip fracture, as well as deaths in the ED, by age categories. We estimated Poisson regression models comparing early and post\\\\early pandemic periods (defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to the pre\\\\pandemic period.

The platform offers a 30-min turnaround time with a detection limit of 10 DNA/RNA molecules per assay and single nucleotide discrimination. RESULTS: We demonstrate the Synestia System performance and utility with three distinct molecular applications: 1) detection of 20 genetic loci and 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms in human genomic DNA; 2) detection and genotyping of 43 unique bacterial species associated with human urinary tract infections; and 3) detection and profiling human respiratory viral pathogens including SARS-CoV-1/2, seasonal coronaviruses, Influenza A/B, and human respiratory syncytial viruses. In addition, the single-nucleotide specificity of our label-free microarray probes allowed for robust identification and discrimination of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages, such as B.1.1.7 (a.k.a. UK), B.1.351 (a.k.a. South African), P.1 (a.k.a. Brazilian), and B.1.617 (a.k.a. Indian). CONCLUSION: The Torus Synestia System has broad applicability in both clinical and research environments. We are confident that the Torus Synestia System will revolutionize syndromic diagnostics at the point of care (PoC) and lead to improved response times during future epidemic and pandemic pathogen outbreaks.

As-prepared flexible electromagnetic manipulator can reach maximum velocity of 8.1m/s and acceleration of 627m/s2 respectively at an applied voltage of 360V. The working mechanism of this flexible electromagnetic manipulator has been studied based on the Maxwell and Abaqus simulation. Diverse parameters, including the length of magnetic tube (the cylindrical magnet) and the whole manipulators and applied voltage values, have been considered to tune the ejecting performances of the manipulators. Furthermore, flexible electromagnetic manipulators can be upgraded to capture various objects by attaching a mechanical force triggered gripper to their top pads. With this design, the velocity of gripper can be significantly improved(the maximum velocity of this is 8.1m/s. However, the soft gripper in the previous research does not have the characteristics of fast movement ), thus making it possible to get objects without approaching them, in another word, we can catch objects even though they are far away from us ,which provide a possibility of long-distance capture.We believe this kind of bio-inspired fabrication is a powerful strategy to design and synthesize flexible even stretchable manipulators, extending the boundaries of conventional manipulators for soft robots.","output":"Flexible electromagnetic capturer with a rapid ejection feature inspired by a biologically ballistic tongue."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19, colleges organized online education on a massive scale. To make better use of online education in the post-epidemic era, this paper conducts an online education satisfaction survey with four types of colleges and 129,325 students propose a fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) method based on the cloud model to rank the satisfaction of different colleges. Firstly, based on the characteristics of online education during the COVID-19, we build an evaluation indicator system from four dimensions: technology, instructor, learner and environment including, 10 indicators and 94 sub-indicators. Secondly, the cloud model is used to quantitatively describe the natural language and uncertainty in a large amount of assessment information. The cloud model generator is used for sub-indicators and achieves an effective and flexible conversion between linguistic information and quantitative values. The cloud model of indicators are presented by integrating the corresponding sub-indicators. The weights of indicators are determined by the entropy method based on the cloud model and possibility degree matrix, which eliminates the judgment of decision-makers and has great power for handling practical problems with unknown weight information. Finally, a fuzzy TOPSIS method based on the cloud model is proposed to rank the satisfaction of online education of different colleges. The proposed method is compared with other existing methods to shown its merits. The experimental result is consistent with the proportion of students who accept online education in the post-epidemic era. According to the second questionnaire, as the qualitative evaluation of the cloud model of indicators increases, the qualitative evaluation of satisfaction of different types of colleges will also increase. It indicates that the method proposed in this paper is practical.","output":"Online education satisfaction assessment based on cloud model and fuzzy TOPSIS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not required.","output":"Rescheduling/scheduling of endoscopic procedures during Phase-Two: which precautions should be taken?

METHODS: In this cohort study of mild COVID-19 patients, we assessed viral load (VL) by RT-qPCR at two/three time points during acute infection, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by ELISA and plasma neutralizing responses using a pseudovirus assay at day 60. RESULTS: Seventy-one individuals (65% female, median 42 years old) were recruited and grouped into high viral load (VL) >7.5 Log(10) copies/mL (n=20), low, VL 7.5 Log(10) copies/mL (n=22), or as Non-early seroconverters with a positive PCR (n=20), and healthy individuals with a negative PCR (n=9). Individuals with high or low VL showed similar titers of total neutralizing antibodies at day 60, irrespective of maximal VL or viral dynamics. Non-early seroconverters had lower antibody titers on day 60, albeit similar neutralizing activity as the groups with high or low VL. Longer symptom duration and older age were independently associated with increased humoral responses.

METHODS: The crucial points of the protocol were defined: vessel selection criteria, device used, technique of insertion, choice of securement and dressing device, and procedures had been created for correct management. RESULTS: During April and December 2020, 50 AC were inserted, two dislocations and one malfunction were observed. No major complications (Catheter Related Bloodstream Infection, thrombosis, bleeding, pseudoaneurysms, hematoma, artery occlusion - even temporary - and skin irritation) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors knowledge, this is the first article describing the insertion and management of ACs for on-demand utilization outside the intensive care unit. The safe and effective use of this technique could be clinically relevant in patients requiring multiple ABG without need of invasive monitoring; it also allows the reduction of both artery sticks and workload of health care providers.

This study aimed to assess trends in diagnosis as well as treatment of acute appendicitis in the Netherlands during the first and second COVID-19 infection wave. METHODS: All consecutive patients that had an appendectomy for acute appendicitis in nine hospitals from January 2019 to December 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the number of appendectomies for acute appendicitis. Secondary outcomes included time between onset of symptoms and hospital admission, proportion of complex appendicitis, postoperative length of stay and postoperative infectious complications. Outcomes were compared between the pre-COVID group and COVID group. RESULTS: A total of 4401 patients were included. The mean weekly rate of appendectomies during the COVID period was 44.0, compared to 40.9 in the pre-COVID period. The proportion of patients with complex appendicitis and mean postoperative length of stay in days were similar in the pre-COVID and COVID group (respectively 35.5% vs 36.8%, p = 0.36 and 2.0  2.2 vs 2.0  2.6, p = 0.93).

The NHS long term plan outlines reducing face to face consultations and implementing digitally-enabled outpatient care. Virtual clinics have been reported in literature and have established use in adult medicine. Within Paediatrics, specialty groups like Orthopaedics, Diabetes and Respiratory have been running virtual consultations with good parent satisfaction. Little published data exists evaluating the perspective of children and young people (CYP) on virtual services.At our tertiary centre, face-to-face, telephone or video consultations were delivered to patients following clinicians triage of referrals as part of our outpatient transformation.ObjectivesWe sought to evaluate virtual clinics from the perspective of patients, parents/carers, clinicians and administrative staff by seeking their opinions regarding virtual clinics as compared with traditional face to face appointments. Stakeholder views are an essential and integral aspect of planning outpatient services .Together, we can shape services fit for the future by embedding the voices of CYP in their rightful position at the heart of all that we do.MethodsOur working group of paediatricians, nursing and administrative colleagues co-designed surveys with the input of a CYP reference group.Following their participation in a virtual clinic appointment, patients and their parents/carers were placed into subgroups according to patient age;8C12 years, >12 years. The Envoy Messenger service was used to send a message enclosing links to an evaluative online survey corresponding to the subgroup. Clinicians and administrative staff were contacted via email. 210 survey responses were reviewed and analysed.ResultsResponses were obtained from each group - the highest response rate seen from parent/guardians.In all groups, the majority opinion of the virtual consultations was positive;70% of clinicians felt they worked well for patients, 65% of CYP >12 rated their appointment as good/great, 85% of CYP 8C12 felt the virtual appointment was better than face-to-face and 77% of parent/guardians were satisfied/very satisfied.Interestingly, the majority of CYP in both age groups (54C65%) reported a preference for face-to-face consultation, in contrast to 56% of parent/guardians with a preference for virtual for their next appointment.75% of consultations reported by the parent/guardian group were conducted over the phone. A common theme from parent feedback was an expressed preference for video appointments highlighting the importance of offering a choice where feasible.Themes identified from staff responses included a need for formal training prior to delivery (70%), technical issues impacting on consultations (62%) and an increased workload for administrative staff.ConclusionsThe patient experience of virtual clinics at our centre was overwhelmingly positive. Insights gained from actively seeking the CYP voice served to highlight specific areas for improvement for the future.A focus on understanding the CYP preference for face-to-face consultations despite a positive overall experience with virtual appointments would help us to adapt the service to their needs.Virtual consultations are now an established means of delivering outpatient care within Paediatrics.

Objective: To determine the independent associations of voluntary behavioral change, school closures, and bans on large gatherings with the incidence and mortality due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based, interrupted-time-series analysis of lagged independent variables used publicly available observational data from US states during a 60-day period from March 8 to May 18, 2020. The behavioral measures were collected from anonymized cell phone or internet data for individuals in the US and compared with a baseline of January 3 to February 6, 2020. Estimates were also controlled for several state-level characteristics. Exposures: Days since school closure, days since a ban on gatherings of 10 or more people, and days since residents voluntarily conducted a 15% or more decline in time spent at work via Google Mobility data. Main Outcomes and Measures: The natural log of 7-day mean COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results: During the study period, the rate of restaurant dining declined from 1 year earlier by a mean (SD) of 98.3% (5.2%) during the study period. Time at work declined by a mean (SD) of 40.0% (7.9%); time at home increased by a mean (SD) of 15.4% (3.7%). In fully adjusted models, a delay of 1 day in implementing mandatory school closures was associated with a 3.5% reduction (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.965; 95% CI, 0.946-0.984) in incidence, whereas each day of delay in behavioral change was associated with a 9.3% reduction (IRR, 0.907; 95% CI, 0.890-0.925) in incidence. For mortality, each day of delay in school closures was associated with a subsequent 3.8% reduction (IRR, 0.962; 95% CI, 0.926-0.998), and each day of delay in behavioral change was associated with a 9.8% reduction (IRR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.869-0.936). Simulations suggest that a 2-week delay in school closures alone would have been associated with an additional 23a?000 (95% CI, 2000-62a?000) deaths, whereas a 2-week delay in voluntary behavioral change with school closures remaining the same would have been associated with an additional 140a?000 (95% CI, 65a?000-294a?000) deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: In light of the harm to children of closing schools, these findings suggest that policy makers should consider better leveraging the public's willingness to protect itself through voluntary behavioral change.","output":"Association of the Timing of School Closings and Behavioral Changes With the Evolution of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunosuppression increases the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This concept is slowly moving beyond the theory and notions of discussions and manifesting even at the level of village clusters with adequate interventions from the policymakers. Despite the socio-cultural restrictions, the conspicuous role played by women at the household and community levels remains undeniable. This case study, through the concept of community kitchens, ideally captures the scenario in which Didis have become empowered and are able to add value to their family and community. Through a qualitative analysis it was found that the major themes associated with empowerment are community, decisions, family and values thus showcasing the economic and social implications.Research Questions/ObjectivesCan the concept of women empowerment be de-urbanized?Do women through formalized initiatives feel empowered and experience heightened self-esteem?Can the setting up of micro-entrepreneurial ventures at the village level provide an impetus to alter the existing social structures and power inequalities?Links to Theory:Women Empowerment, group approach and power, self-esteemPhenomenon Studied and Case Context:The Didis of the community kitchen were members registered as self-help groups with the Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society. These community kitchens or Ajeevika Didi kitchens were essentially started and implemented during the COVID pandemic period in a five-phase manner for a period of 3 months from April to June 2020. There were around 450 women who got associated in running these community kitchens. The discourses by these Didis on their association with the micro-entrepreneurial venture and their feelings of empowerment are portrayed in the case.Findings:Semi-structured interviews for the sample respondents were conducted and then auto-coded themes, namely, community, decisions, family and values were obtained using the NVivo software. The sentiment analysis of the transcribed interview conversations revealed more of positive sentiments that were centred around the belief that such micro-entrepreneurial opportunities can largely improve their lives and ease out the inequalities that are experienced by them on the power and control fronts.

It is hypothesized that the overall number of orthopaedic trauma encounters (OTEs), the number of OTEs related to both high and low severity injuries, and the proportion of OTEs related to high severity versus low severity injuries decreased compared with previous years. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of OTEs between 2016 and 2020. High and low severity OTEs were classified according to an algorithm created by the researchers. Data were statistically analyzed and compared with external data for traffic counts, motor vehicle accidents, and Transportation Security Administration checkpoints. RESULTS A 45.1% decrease (P = 0.0005) was seen in OTEs from March and April 2016-2019 compared with 2020. The decrease began approximately 12 days before the shelter-in-place order. There was a 58.8% decrease in high severity injuries with a fracture (P = 0.013) and a 42.9% decrease in low severities injuries (P = 0.0003). The proportion of high to low severity OTEs was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS The quantity of OTEs was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and Michigan shelter-in-place order. A decrease in both high and low severity OTEs was found; however, there was no statistically significant change in the ratio of high to low severity OTEs compared with previous years.

Here, we use an extended SEIR for SARS-COV-2 transmission sequentially calibrated to data on cases and interventions implemented in the state of Florida to explore how these factors may interact to govern potential pandemic futures. Our data-driven forecasts indicate while the introduction of vaccinations could lead to the permanent, albeit drawn-out, ending of the pandemic if the immunity generated through vaccinations and natural infections acts over the long-term, additional futures could become possible if this immunity wanes over time. These futures will be marked by repeated waves of infection, the amplitude and periodicity of which will depend on the duration over which the immunity generated in a population will operate.

The purpose of this study is to report on our management of the handling and delivery of biological medications to patients during periods of lockdown in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). METHODS: A descriptive study conducted at our 380-bed tertiary care hospital. Managing the delivery of the biological medications was organized in six phases: (1) taskforce development, (2) identification of the relevant biological medications, (3) identification of patients, (4) organization of transportation, (5) medication delivery/pickup and (6) locating patients with unidentified addresses. The study was approved by our hospital's Institutional Review Board. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Biological medications were delivered to 1235/1373 (90%) patients. This included 1875/2036 (92%) prescriptions. 900 prescriptions were delivered to 570 patients living in 95 cities and villages across the kingdom. 141 patients received 183 prescribed oral biological medications and 477 patients received 787 prescribed parenteral biological medications delivered with temperature control. 224 parenteral biological medication were delivered by car to 116 patients living in less accessible cities in the west of the country. The car deliveries of parenteral biological medications required particularly careful handling, packaging and temperature control. Delivering biological medications to patients during the curfew was a unique experience. However, the approach we have used ensured safe access to medications under appropriate conditions. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Delivering biological medications to patients during the lockdown was challenging. With the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19, hospitals should have a standardized process in-place for delivering such medications.","output":"Safe handling and delivery of biological medications during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 started in Wuhan province of china and spread in a faster rate covering all continents in the world The pandemic has affected the socio-economic, political fabric of all countries, and exacerbated undernutrition and food insecurity problems of Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) COVID-19 has also disrupted the health system, resulted in low level utilization of essential services, such as childhood immunization, labor and childbirth, and treatment for children with serious illness Unless the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic slows down, Ethiopia and other low income countries are at the verge of losing all the progresses made in health and wellbeing over the last two decades ? 2020, African Field Epidemiology Network All rights reserved","output":"Covid-19 in ethiopia: Current situation, missed opportunities, and the risk of health system disruptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2005, the World Health Organization adopted the revised International Health Regulations, or IHR (2005), to establish obligations for detecting and responding to public health emergencies of international concern.

Methods Data from 216 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) (n = 126) or distal pancreatectomy (DP) (n = 90) between August 2014 and November 2020 were reviewed. All drains were closed but not suctioned. DFAA was calculated by multiplying the DFAC and daily drainage fluid volume. DFAC and DFAA were recorded on d 1 and 3 after pancreatectomy. The cutoff value of CR-POPF was determined using the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results CR-POPF was found in 75 patients (35%) (PD: 30%, DP: 41%, P = .111); the mortality rate was zero. The cutoff value of DFAC-day 1 was 1757 U/L (sensitivity [SE]: 84%, specificity [SP]: 62%, and accuracy [AC]: 69%). The cutoff value of DFAA-day 1 was 139 U (SE: 71%, SP: 72%, and AC: 71%). The cutoff value of DFAC-day 3 was 1044 U/L (SE: 73%, SP: 79%, and AC: 78%). The cutoff value of DFAA-day 3 was 21 U (SE: 68%, SP: 72%, and AC: 70%). Multivariate analysis indicated that a nondilated pancreatic duct and high DFAC-day 3 were independently associated with CR-POPF after PD, indicating that a prolonged operative duration, massive blood loss, and high DFAC-day 3 are independently associated with CR-POPF after DP.

Accordingly, they are a group whose human rights can be impacted where equal access to supports, services, and accessible information is compromised. The current COVID\\\\19 pandemic is a global humanitarian emergency that has had a devastating impact across the world, for all people. Growing concern has been raised about the impact of the COVID\\\\19 virus on the health of people with disabilities and there has been subsequent development of strategies and protocols to promote equal access to information, health supports, and services. People with IDD have high levels of underlying comorbidity that increases their risk of contracting COVID\\\\19 and measures to protect them from infection are critically important. However, those measures may trigger behaviors of concern and increase the risk of being subjected to restrictive practices.

An immediate medical breakthrough is needed. However, parallel to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is the proliferation of information regarding the pandemic, which, if uncontrolled, cannot only mislead the public but also hinder the concerted efforts of relevant stakeholders in mitigating the effect of this pandemic. It is known that media communications can affect public perception and attitude toward medical treatment, vaccination, or subject matter, particularly when the population has limited knowledge on the subject. OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to systematically scrutinize media communications (Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts) to understand the prevailing sentiments regarding COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. METHODS: A total of 637 Twitter posts and 569 Google News headlines or descriptions, retrieved between February 2 and May 5, 2020, were analyzed using three standard computational linguistics models (ie, TextBlob, Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner, and Word2Vec combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network). RESULTS: Our findings revealed that, contrary to general perceptions, Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts within the stated period were generally passive or positive toward COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. It was possible to understand these patterns in light of increasingly sustained efforts by various media and health actors in ensuring the availability of factual information about the pandemic.

However, to the knowledge of the authors, little bibliometric quantitative or qualitative analysis has been carried out to evaluate herpes zoster research. This study aimed to use a bibliometric analysis to evaluate current publication trends and hotspots on herpes zoster research worldwide, in order to advance research in this field. METHODS: Relevant publications from January 2012 to December 2021 were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Citespace (V5.8.R3) was used to analyze the research points, including publication countries, institutions and authors, cited author, cited reference and their clustering, and keyword co-occurrence, and burst keyword to acquire research trends and hotspots. RESULTS: A total of 9,259 publications were obtained, with a steady increase in the number of annual publications during the decade. Articles were the main type of publication. The United States is the leading country in this research, and the University of Colorado has the highest influence in this field. Oxman is the most representative author, with a main research interest in herpes zoster vaccines. The top five cited authors' publications focused on herpes zoster vaccines, molecular mechanisms, and postherpetic neuralgia. A co-citation map resulted 19 main clusters, and revealed that vaccines, postherpetic neuralgia, treatments, varicella zoster virus and its mechanisms, and epidemiology of herpes zoster were the current research focus after clustering co-cited publications. Human herpesviruses, antiviral prophylaxis, rheumatoid arthritis, recombinant zoster vaccine, varicella vaccination and postherpetic neuralgia were the top clusters after co-occurrence keywords analysis. Moreover, burst keywords detection showed that the subunit vaccine was the new hotspot in the field of herpes zoster. CONCLUSION: This bibliometric study defined the overall prospects in the field of herpes zoster and provided valuable instruction for the ongoing research. The keyword subunit vaccine indicated that a vaccine for herpes zoster prevention was the hotspot.

RESULTS: 26,121 cases and 2,369,020 controls from LTCH and the community were included in this analysis. Many of the drugs and drug classes evaluated did not yield significant associations with SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, some drugs and drug classes appeared significantly associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 detection, including cardioprotective drug classes such as statins (weighted OR 0.91, standard p-value <0.01, adjusted p-value <0.01) and beta-blockers (weighted OR 0.87, standard p-value <0.01, adjusted p-value 0.01), along with individual agents ranging from levetiracetam (weighted OR 0.70, standard p-value <0.01, adjusted p-value <0.01) to fluoxetine (weighted OR 0.86, standard p-value 0.013, adjusted p-value 0.198) to digoxin (weighted OR 0.89, standard p-value <0.01, adjusted p-value 0.02).

RESULTS: S-AIDP patients more frequently developed respiratory failure (83.3% vs. 25%, P=0.000) and required intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization (58.3% vs. 31.3%, P=0.000). In C-AIDP, distal motor latencies (DMLs) were more frequently prolonged (70.9% vs. 26.2%, P=0.000) whereas in S-AIDP distal compound muscle action potential (dCMAP) durations were more frequently increased (49.5% vs. 32.4%, P=0.002) and F waves were more often absent (45.6% vs. 31.8%, P=0.011).

CONCLUSION: Increased dCMAP duration, thought to be a marker of acquired demyelination, can also be oserved in critical illness myopathy. In S-AIDP patients, an increased dCMAP duration dissociated from prolonged DML, suggests additional muscle fiber conduction slowing, possibly due to a COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory state.

Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland.

Big data has played and will continue playing an important role in public health.","output":"A simple model to assess Wuhan lock-down effect and region efforts during COVID-19 epidemic in China Mainland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in critical care for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), some survivors in the acute phase are unable to wean from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or mechanical ventilation. To date, little is known regarding whether lung transplantation confers a survival benefit for irreversible ARDS. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted using the United Network for Organ Sharing database (May 2005CDecember 2018). Patients with restrictive lung disease were divided into two groups: patients with and without ARDS. Propensity score matching identified recipients without ARDS for the control group. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients with ARDS were waitlisted for lung transplantation, while 39 received a lung transplant after a median waitlist duration of 8 days. Seventy\\\\eight patients were matched as controls. In the ARDS group, the median age was 30 years, and the median lung allocation score was 88.4. Among the 39 recipients, 30 (76.9%) received ECMO support prior to transplantation. Lung transplantation for ARDS and restrictive lung disease showed similar 90\\\\day (87.2% vs. 88.5%, p = .80), 1\\\\year (82.1% vs. 85.9%, p = .52), and 3\\\\year (69.2% vs. 65.4%, p = .94) survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantation provides acceptable outcomes in selected patients with irreversible ARDS.","output":"Lung transplantation for the treatment of irreversible acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study uses image analysis techniques for comparative analysis of the lung HRCT features and RT-PCR of 325 suspected patients to COVID-19 pneumonia. Our findings propose more caution in the interpretation of RT-PCR data, promoting, instead, also the quantification of age and sex-based risk factors using HRCT images. Statistical analysis of our methodology reveals a direct relation between intensity, skewness and kurtosis of the radiological features and the gender of patients. Moreover, we investigate the effect of the age of patients on the appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia in the HRCT images. We have also applied our methodology to investigate the effect of time on the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia within the lungs. Subsequently, we find a strong relationship between image analysis and the informed medical diagnosis asserted by the radiologists. Additionally, our results also indicate increase in the severity of lung infection in the first and second week after the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Thereafter, a gradual decrease in the lung damage is observed during the third week. The proposed image analysis methodology can be used as a simple complementary tool for infectious disease diagnostics as demonstrated in this study with an example of SARS-CoV-2 to provide better understanding of the disease for drug and vaccine development.","output":"Clinical evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Lung HRCT and RT-PCR Techniques: Towards risk factor based diagnosis of infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When one of the UK's first COVID-19 patients was diagnosed at my hospital last March, it struck me that many of my colleagues may be experiencing the same rollercoaster of emotions I once did as an HIV nurse There are many parallels between nursing in the coronavirus pandemic and the HIV epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s All the staff exposed to that patient with COVID-19 were sent home to self-isolate: two weeks to wait to get sick or not Back when I worked with people with HIV, staff feared needlestick injuries In the event of such exposure, we had to wait three months to see if we were antibody-negative [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Nursing Management - UK is the property of RNCi and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Nurses did not sign up for this kind of pressure: Similarities between the early days of HIV and the COVID-19 pandemic shed light on the challenges nurses are facing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data on cleaner and disinfectant exposure and misuse-related acute intoxications in Italy during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are still lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyse and describe cleaner and disinfectant-related intoxications during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in an Italian poison control centre. Data were obtained from the toxicological consultations requested to the Toxicology Unit and Poison Centre, Careggi University Hospital, Florence (Italy). We compared data from January 1st to April 30th of 2019 and 2020. Data concerning probable or acute intoxication from any causative agent in the general population (all age groups), from private individuals or from Regional and National health structures, were included in the analysis. A toxicological evaluation was also performed to calculate the Poisoning Severity Score.In 2019, 451 phone counselling sessions were performed and compared to a total of 410 calls received during the same period of 2020. In both periods, the majority of events occurred in paediatric (0-17 years) and adult (18-65 years) patients, who were mainly exposed to one toxic agent, and intoxications took place principally at home due to domestic accidents. The oral route of intoxication was the most frequently observed one, followed by inhalation of toxic agents, which increased by 4.7% in 2020. In 2020, sanitizers and cleaners were reported in 21.6% of cases compared to 12.5% in 2019. This is the first study describing cleaner and disinfectant-related intoxications in Italy. Our results suggested a possible misuse of these products during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, underling the effects of home isolation on mental health and unintentional toxic exposures.","output":"Exposures and suspected intoxications during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: preliminary results from an Italian poison control centre"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(D,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/17.md","filePath":"doctor/17.md"}'),V={name:"doctor/17.md"},z=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
