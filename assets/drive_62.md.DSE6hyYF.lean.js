With the uncontrolled circulating information about medications, supplements, and herbs that are believed to treat COVID-19, self-medication and misused might escalate. Therefore, this study aims to determine the consumption of anti-COVID agents and the mental health of mothers with school-age children in Indonesia. METHODS: Online questionnaires regarding medications/supplements for COVID-19 prevention and treatment of anti-COVID consumption behavior and mental health using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) were distributed among Indonesian mothers with school-age children. Data (n = 610) were analyzed; descriptive and association between sociodemographic factors, anti-COVID medications consumption, and mental health were presented. RESULTS: A quarter of the respondents were categorized as having mental disorders, with higher scores of DASS-21 was higher in the housewives group. The incidence associated with age, family expenses, and marital status in the working mothers group, and only with family expense in the housewives group. Moreover, the result showed 80% of the respondents consumed anti-COVID medications or supplements to prevent COVID-19, with 75% did self-medication without consulting with a healthcare professional. Friends/family and social media were two primary sources of information regarding the anti-COVID products. In the housewives group, their consumption behavior was influenced by education. Meanwhile in the working mothers group, the consumption behavior was influenced by age, family income, and family expense. In addition, there was no association between the usage of medications/supplements with the respondents mental health status. CONCLUSION: This study showed the importance of controlling information and expanding the mothers knowledge to find the correct information to minimize the unwanted effect in the post COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing awareness of mental health issues in the community, especially in the vulnerable population such as mother with school-age children, is necessary to avoid detrimental effects that might occur in the future.","output":"Anti-COVID-19 Medications, Supplements, and Mental Health Status in Indonesian Mothers with School-Age Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of face-to-face, digital, and virtual modes of dancing for people living with Parkinson's disease (PD). DESIGN: Systematic review informed by Cochrane and PRIMSA guidelines. Data Sources. Seven electronic databases were searched: AMED, Cochrane, PEDro, CINHAL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and MEDLINE. METHODS: Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT) and other trials with quantitative data. The PEDro scale evaluated risk of bias for RCTs. Joanna Briggs Institute instruments were used to critically appraise non-RCTs. The primary outcome was the feasibility of dance interventions, and the secondary outcomes included gait, balance, quality of life, and disability. RESULTS: The search yielded 8,327 articles after duplicates were removed and 38 met the inclusion criteria. Seven were at high risk of bias, 20 had moderate risk of bias, and 11 had low risk of bias. There was moderately strong evidence that dance therapy was beneficial for balance, gait, quality of life, and disability. There was good adherence to digital delivery of dance interventions and, for people with PD, online dance was easy to access. CONCLUSION: Dancing is an accessible form of exercise that can benefit mobility and quality of life in people with PD.

But a question still remains unanswered: speckle tracking echocardiography might also be suitable to detect residual myocardial involvement after acute stage of COVID-19? Methods: and results: We studied 100 patients recovered from COVID-19 with STE to evaluate global (GLS) and segmentar longitudinal strain (LS) and compared with a control group of 100 healthy individuals. STE was performed at a median of 130.35 +/- 76.06 days after COVID-19 diagnostic. Demographic and echocardiographic parameters are similar in both groups. Left ventricular ejection faction (LVEF) and GLS were normal in COVID-19 patients (66.20 +/- 1.98% and -19.51 +/- 2.87%, respectively). A reduction in mean LS for the basal segments was found in COVID-19 (16.48 +/- 5.41%) when compared to control group (19.09 +/- 4.31%) (p<0.001). Conclusion: The present study suggests that COVID-19 induced cardiac involvement could persist after recovery of the disease and may be detected by deformation abnormalities using STE.

Glycyrrhizin (GL), a traditional Chinese medicine for liver disease, binds to HMGB1, thereby inhibits tissue injury. However the mode of action of GL for chronic liver disease remains unclear. We investigated the effects of glycyrrhizin (GL) and its derivatives on liver differentiation using human iPS cells by using a flow cytometric analysis. GL promoted hepatic differentiation at the hepatoblast formation stage. The GL derivatives, 3-O-mono-glucuronyl 18-glycyrrhetinic acid (Mono) and 3-O-[glucosyl (1  2)-glucuronyl] 18-glycyrrhetinic acid increased AFP(+) cell counts and albumin(+) cell counts. Glucuronate conjugation seemed to be a requirement for hepatic differentiation. Mono exhibited the most significant hepatic differentiation effect. We evaluated the effects of ()-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (DP), a T1R3 antagonist, and sucralose, a T1R3 agonist, on hepatic differentiation, and found that DP suppressed Mono-induced hepatic differentiation, while sucralose promoted hepatic differentiation. Thus, GL promoted hepatic differentiation via T1R3 signaling. In addition, Mono increased -catenin(+) cell count and decreased Hes5(+) cell count suggesting the involvement of Wnt and Notch signaling in GL-induced hepatic differentiation. In conclusion, GL exerted a hepatic differentiation effect via sweet receptor (T1R3), canonical Wnt, and Notch signaling.","output":"Glycyrrhizin and its derivatives promote hepatic differentiation via sweet receptor, Wnt, and Notch signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Rowing is a sport that involves constant gripping, pulling/pushing, and rotational movements of the hands, in a cyclic periodic manner with every stroke, with hundreds of strokes being taken within a short period of time. Dermatological issues on rowers hands (fingers and palms) in the form of blisters and calluses are common knowledge within the community, but their prevalence and the rowers perceptions and pain tolerance to them has never been systematically evaluated. This work addresses these lacunae. Materials and Methods: Analysis of data collected from a survey on a sample of competitive (117) and noncompetitive rowers (28) who row on-water (total 145). Results: It was found that approximately 69% of rowers participating in this study have calluses on their hands for most of their time (considered by them as not painful). The incidence of blisters was found to be lower (but perceived as more painful). Their incidence was found to be fairly independent of the frequency and intensity of training, but they seem to affect most rowers equally at the beginning of season or during a change of position (nonconditioned hands). Blisters and calluses were reported to be mainly located on the proximal phalanges and metacarpo-phalangeal joint area of both hands, i.e., on the lower parts of the fingers and the upper inner palms. Conclusions: Rowers demonstrated a sense of acceptance of these dermatological issues, even a sense of pride in what they represent. The incidence of blisters becoming infected was estimated to be so low that most rowers would not have encountered such serious, albeit rare, consequences.","output":"Blisters and Calluses from Rowing: Prevalence, Perceptions and Pain Tolerance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is still little research on the association between COVID\\\\19\\\\related stress and insufficient sleep.

Implementation of a mandatory home intravenous hydration protocol can avoid this. We aim to evaluate the impact of mandatory home intravenous hydration for patients with newly created ileostomies. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients at a single, tertiary care center who underwent ileostomy creation during a period of sporadic home intravenous hydration (February 2011-December 2013) and mandatory protocol hydration (March 2016-December 2018) were reviewed for incidence of dehydration, readmissions, and emergency department visits. RESULTS 241 patients were evaluated. 119 were in the \\"sporadic\\" group and 122 were in the \\"protocol\\" group. Operative approach differed among both groups, with hydration protocol patients undergoing 15% less open procedures and 4.9% more hand-assisted laparoscopic procedures (P = .0017). Prior to protocol implementation, 23.5% of patients were sent home with intravenous hydration. Length of hospital stay after index ileostomy creation was shorter for \\"protocol\\" patients by 3.3 days (P < .0001). 15.1% of \\"sporadic\\" patients experienced dehydration as compared to 7.4% of \\"protocol\\" patients (P = .0283). Following protocol implementation, the number of patients readmitted due to dehydration increased from 13 to 14 (P = .01). DISCUSSION Standardized, mandatory at-home intravenous hydration following ileostomy creation leads to a significant reduction in postoperative incidence of dehydration and dehydration-associated readmissions. This protocol should be followed for all patients with newly created ileostomies, so long as adequate home health nursing support and active surveillance are available.","output":"Protocol-Based Intravenous Fluid Hydration for Newly Created Ileostomies Decreases Readmissions Secondary to Dehydration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Disease Control Section in the Public Health Directorate is responsible for contact tracing amid the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

What programs/processes/procedures are being utilized now to assist TAYEH in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic? Design Qualitative Method were utilized to conduct a content analysis of the data collected via recorded virtual Interviews. Setting The study was conducted on a virtual platform focusing on multiple agencies across the United States. Participants Three organizations agreed to be interviewed, with four representatives being interviewed in total. Interventions There was no intervention. This was a qualitative content analysis. Main Outcome Measures Findings from the interviews indicated increased numbers of youth trying to access services during the pandemic. In addition, the agencies interviewed were seeing increased numbers of youth with mental and behavioral health issues, including substance abuse, PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Results The increase in need from TAYEH resulted in permanent services being added to their organization to help this population. The increase in need of services during the COVID-19 pandemic from TAYEH may have been due to limitations on the number of individuals allowed to occupy a space. It was agreed through the interviews that there could be ways to improve the services and resources for the behavioral needs of youth in their agencies.

DESIGN: Analysis of cross-sectional data from Phase 1 (April 23 - July 21, 2020) of the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey, a weekly national online survey. SETTING: California, and three Californian Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), including San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario MSAs. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18 years and older living in households. RESULTS: Among the three metropolitan areas, food insufficiency rates were lowest in the San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley MSA. Measures of disadvantage (e.g. having low-income, being unemployed, recent loss of employment, and pre-pandemic food insufficiency) were widely associated with household food insufficiency. However, disadvantaged households in the San Francisco Bay Area, the area with the lowest poverty and unemployment rates, were more likely to be food insufficient compared to those in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario MSAs. CONCLUSIONS: Food insufficiency risk among disadvantaged households differed by region.

We hypothesize that it is possible due to at least three factors: outdoor places chosen for alcohol consumption, behavioral changes induced by alcohol, and possible stronger attraction of human hosts after alcohol consumption to ticks. Many important clues are coming from social studies about peoples preference of places to consume alcohol and from studies regarding the attraction of people consuming alcohol to mosquitos. These data, however, cannot be directly transferred to the case of alcohol consumption and ticks. Therefore, we suggest that more detailed studies are needed to better understand the possible individual attractiveness of people to ticks and ways alcohol may influence it.","output":"Similar Trajectories in Current Alcohol Consumption and Tick-Borne Diseases: Only Parallel Changes in Time or Links Between?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Web-based counseling and support has become increasingly commonplace for children and young people (CYP). Currently, there is limited research that focuses on the mechanisms of change within complex telepsychology platforms, a factor that makes designing and implementing outcome measures challenging. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to articulate a theory of change (ToC) for Kooth, a web-based therapy and support platform for CYP. METHODS: A collaborative qualitative research design involving professional staff, academic partners, and young people was used to develop the ToC. The following three major reflective phases were engaged: a scoping workshop involving professional staff and academic partners, a series of explorative projects were completed to inform the development of the ToC, and the draft ToC was reviewed for coherence by key stakeholders (young people, online professionals, and service managers). RESULTS: A collaboratively developed ToC was presented. This was divided into the conditions that lead to individuals wanting to access web-based therapy and support (eg, individuals wanting support there and then or quickly), the mode of service delivery (eg, skilled and experienced professionals able to build empathetic relationships with CYP), and the observed and reported changes that occur as a consequence of using the service (eg, individuals being better able to manage current and future situations). CONCLUSIONS: Developing the ToC helps to shed light on how web-based therapy and support services aid the mental health and well-being of CYP. Furthermore, it helps to understand the development of positive virtual ecosystems and can be used to devise evaluative tools for CYP telepsychology providers.","output":"A Theory of Change for Web-Based Therapy and Support Services for Children and Young People: Collaborative Qualitative Exploration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: International and UK data suggest that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups are at increased risk of infection and death from COVID-19. We aimed to explore the risk of death in minority ethnic groups in England using data reported by NHS England. Methods: We used NHS data on patients with a positive COVID-19 test who died in hospitals in England published on 28th April, with deaths by ethnicity available from 1st March 2020 up to 5pm on 21 April 2020. We undertook indirect standardisation of these data (using the whole population of England as the reference) to produce ethnic specific standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) adjusted for age and geographical region. Results: The largest total number of deaths in minority ethnic groups were Indian (492 deaths) and Black Caribbean (460 deaths) groups. Adjusting for region we found a lower risk of death for White Irish (SMR 0.52; 95%CIs 0.45-0.60) and White British ethnic groups (0.88; 95%CIs 0.86-0.0.89), but increased risk of death for Black African (3.24; 95%CIs 2.90-3.62), Black Caribbean (2.21; 95%CIs 2.02-2.41), Pakistani (3.29; 95%CIs 2.96-3.64), Bangladeshi (2.41; 95%CIs 1.98-2.91) and Indian (1.70; 95%CIs 1.56-1.85) minority ethnic groups. Conclusion: Our analysis adds to the evidence that BAME people are at increased risk of death from COVID-19 even after adjusting for geographical region. We believe there is an urgent need to take action to reduce the risk of death for BAME groups and better understand why some ethnic groups experience greater risk. Actions that are likely to reduce these inequities include ensuring adequate income protection (so that low paid and zero-hours contract workers can afford to follow social distancing recommendations), reducing occupational risks (such as ensuring adequate personal protective equipment), reducing barriers in accessing healthcare and providing culturally and linguistically appropriate public health communications.","output":"Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups in England are at increased risk of death from COVID-19: indirect standardisation of NHS mortality data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantum computing is increasingly becoming a big player in digitization and will provide competitive advantages in industry and business.

DESIGN We performed a systematic review, prospectively registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018110063). DATA SOURCES We searched Medline and Scopus databases for population-based studies. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the study quality using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklists. RESULTS The 51 included articles performed 67 analyses. Most were based on retrospective cohorts and US populations. The median quality scores were 19/22 for cohorts and 15/16 for cross-sectional studies. Most analyses focused on hospice care (n=37). Older patients, men, people with haematological cancer or treated in small centres had less specialised interventions. Palliative and hospice facilities addressed different populations. Older patients received less palliative care but more hospice care. Patients with high-stage tumours had more palliative care while women and patients with a low comorbidity burden received more hospice care. CONCLUSION Main disparities concerned older patients, men and people with haematological cancer.

The analysis revealed that within the testis network TMPRSS2, ADAM10, SERPING1, and CCR5 were present, while within the ovary network we found BST2, GATA1, ENPEP, TLR4, TLR7, IRF1, and IRF2. Our findings could provide potential targets for forthcoming experimental investigation related to SARS-CoV-2 treatment.","output":"Candidate genes of SARS-CoV-2 gender susceptibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Neurosurgical patients are at a higher risk of having a severe course of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to determine morbidity, hospital course and mortality of neurosurgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in a multi-center health care system. Methods A retrospective, observational study was conducted to identify all hospitalized neurosurgical patients positive for COVID-19 from 3/11/20 to 11/02/20 at Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Clinic Health System. Results Eleven hospitalized neurosurgical patients (0.68%) were positive for COVID-19. Four patients (36.6%) were men and 7 (63.3%) were women. The mean age was 65.7 years (range: 35-81 years). All patients had comorbidities. The mean length of stay was 13.4 days (range: 4-30 days). Seven patients had a central nervous system malignancy (4 metastases, 1 meningioma, 1 glioblastoma, and 1 schwannoma). Three patients presented cerebrovascular complications including two spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhages and 1 ischemic large vessel stroke. One patient presented with an unstable traumatic spinal burst fracture. Four patients underwent neurosurgical/neuroendovascular interventions. Discharge disposition was to home in 5, rehabilitation facility in 3 and hospice in 3 patients. Five patients expired on follow-up, three within 30-days from COVID-19 complications and two from progression of their metastatic cancer. Conclusion COVID-19 is rare among the inpatient neurosurgical population. In all cases, patients had multiple comorbidities. All symptomatic patients from the respiratory standpoint had complications during their hospitalization. Three patients, who expired within 30-days of hospitalization were all related to COVID-19 complications.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with an unfavourable outcome in this population. DESIGN Prospective, descriptive, monocentric study conducted in the surgical ICU of a French university hospital. METHODS Patients aged 75 years admitted in the surgical ICU for a predicted length of stay 48 hours were included. Patients received an initial and a 6-months nutritional and functional assessment performed by physicians and nurses. The outcome was considered as favourable if the Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) variation (ADL delta = 6-months ADL - ICU admission ADL) was between 0 and -0.5 point 6 months after ICU discharge and unfavourable if the ADL delta decreased by more than 0.5 points or if the patient had died 6 months after ICU discharge. RESULTS Fifty-six patients-32 (57%) male-aged 79 [77; 83] y were included. ICU mortality was 19%; 6-month mortality was 22%. Median ADL delta was -0.5 [-0.5-0] points. A low ADL score (P = .0438) and a low albumin level (P = .0213) at admission were the two independent factors associated with an unfavourable outcome. CONCLUSION Mortality and loss of independence were high in this elderly population during and after their surgical ICU stay. The benefit of a systematic collaboration between intensive care specialists, ICU nurses, and geriatricians, to assess and manage nutritional and functional problems and to prevent a pejorative outcome in patients over 75 years old admitted in surgical ICU needs to be studied.

Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. Viruses are among the major pathogenic agents that cause number of serious diseases in humans, animals and plants. Viruses cause many diseases in humans, from self resolving diseases to acute fatal diseases. Developing strategies for the antiviral drugs are focused on two different approaches: Targeting the viruses themselves or the host cell factors. Antiviral drugs that directly target the viruses include the inhibitors of virus attachment, inhibitors of virus entry, uncoating inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, inhibitors of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase and the inhibitors of integrase. The inhibitors of protease (ritonavir, atazanavir and darunavir), viral DNA polymerase (acyclovir, tenofovir, valganciclovir and valacyclovir) and of integrase (raltegravir) are listed among the Top 200 Drugs by sales during 2010s. Still no effective antiviral drugs are available for many viral infections. Though, there are a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, many for influenza and some new antiviral drugs for treating hepatitis C infection and HIV. Action mechanism of antiviral drugs consists of its transformation to triphosphate following the viral DNA synthesis inhibition. An analysis of the action mechanism of known antiviral drugs concluded that they can increase the cell's resistance to a virus (interferons), suppress the virus adsorption in the cell or its diffusion into the cell and its deproteinisation process in the cell (amantadine) along with antimetabolites that causes the inhibition of nucleic acids synthesis.

Whereas the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccine and adenovirus-vectored vaccine was similar between PLHIV in stable condition and healthy adults, the effects of inactivated vaccines are not known. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal observational study in real-world setting. METHODS: Adult PLHIV in care and planning to receive either inactivated (Day 0 and 28) or mRNA-based (Day 0 and Day 21) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 were recruited, with blood samples collected over 6amonths for surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT). Demographic and clinical data including age, gender, CD4 count, and suppressed viral load (SVL) status were transcribed for analyses, by simple and multivariable linear regression models, and multivariable linear generalised estimating equations (GEE). RESULTS: A total of 611 HIV patients, 91% male, were recruited, of whom 423 and 184 have received mRNA-based and inactivated vaccine respectively. The seroconversion rate was 99% for mRNA-based vs 86% for inactivated vaccine (ORa=a21.56, pa=a0.004). At 6amonths, mRNA-based vaccine continued to give a higher response (94% vs 57%, pa<a0.001). The temporal pattern varied between the 2 vaccines. By GEE, mRNA-based vaccine (Ba=a40.59, pa<a0.001) and latest SVL status (Ba=a10.76, pa=a0.01) were positively associated with sVNT level, but not latest CD4 count. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV patients, inactivated vaccine gave a lower peak and shorter duration of sVNT responses compared to mRNA vaccine.

METHODS We searched PubMed and CENTRAL for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) (years 2000-2019, adult human subjects) of IV non-opioid analgesics (IV NSAIDs or IV Acetaminophen) used to treat acute pain after abdominal, hysterectomy, bunionectomy or orthopedic procedures. A Bayesian NMA was conducted in R to rank treatments based on the standardized mean differences in sum of pain intensity difference from baseline up to 24 h postoperatively (sum of pain intensity difference: SPID 24). The probability and the cumulative probability of rank for each treatment were calculated, and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was applied to distinguish treatments on the basis of their outcomes such that higher SUCRA values indicate better outcomes. The study protocol was prospectively registered with by PROSPERO (CRD42019117360). RESULTS Out of 2313 screened studies, 27 studies with 36 comparative observations were included, producing a treatment network that included the four non-opioid IV pain medications of interest (MIV, ketorolac, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen). MIV was associated with the largest SPID 24 for all procedure categories and comparators. The SUCRA ranking table indicated that MIV had the highest probability for the most effective treatment for abdominal (89.5%), bunionectomy (100%), and hysterectomy (99.8%). MIV was associated with significantly less MME utilization versus all comparators for abdominal procedures, hysterectomy, and versus acetaminophen in orthopedic procedures. Elsewhere MME utilization outcomes for MIV were largely equivalent or nominally better than other comparators. Odds of ORADEs were significantly higher for all comparators vs MIV for orthopedic (gastrointestinal) and hysterectomy (respiratory). CONCLUSIONS MIV 30 mg may provide better pain reduction with similar or better safety compared to other approved IV non-opioid analgesics.

The World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a worldwide pandemic on March 11, 2020, due to its widespread infectivity pattern. Because of the catastrophic COVID-19 outbreak, the development of safe and efficient vaccinations has become a key priority in every health sector throughout the globe. On the 13th of January 2021, the vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 was launched in India and started the administration of two types of vaccines known as Covaxin and Covishield. Covishield is an adenovirus vector-based vaccine, and Covaxin was developed by a traditional method of vaccine formulation, which is composed of adjuvanted inactivated viral particles. Each vaccines utility or efficiency is determined by its formulation, adjuvants, and mode of action. The efficacy of the vaccination depends on numeral properties like generation antibodies, memory cells, and cell-mediated immunity. According to the third-phase experiment, Covishield showed effectiveness of nearly 90%, whereas Covaxin has an effectiveness of about 80%. Both vaccination formulations in India have so far demonstrated satisfactory efficacy against numerous mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2. The efficacy of Covishield may be diminished if the structure of spike (S) protein changes dramatically in the future. In this situation, Covaxin might be still effective for such variants owing to its ability to produce multiple antibodies against various epitopes.

The information on OOPE is scarce from low- and middle-income countries. We aimed to estimate annual OOPE for children with T1D attending our diabetes clinic located in North India. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among parents of 380 children with T1D (mean age: 10.3  4.6 years). Modified BG Prasad scale was used to estimate the socioeconomic status (SES). RESULTS: The mean duration of T1D was 3.6  2.6 years; 54.9% of children were boys. The median HbA1c (IQR) was 7.9% (5C15%). 51.9% belonged to lower or lower-middle SES. Mean annual spending on glucose monitoring, insulin administration, and laboratory investigations were Indian Rupee (INR) 21,576, INR 28,965, and INR 5069, respectively (total INR 55,185, IQR: 26,575C105,027). The cost of a single visit to the doctor was approximately INR 2889. Thirty children required hospitalization during the last year, which costs INR 27,495 on average. 30.3% had more than 50% of their total family income spent on diabetes care, with a significant negative correlation with their SES (r = C 0.738, p = 0.00). Only 11.6% were receiving financial support from any agency. 36.6% of families had to borrow money; the OOPE exceeded income from all sources in 8.2% of families.

The aim of the extended home visit programme was to provide support for first-time parents in order to improve the overall health of the child and family and contribute to better conditions for equal health. Instead of two home visits during the 1st year, a subsample of first-time parents would receive six visits during the child's first 15 months. These six visits would be conducted by CHC nurses and social workers, midwives, and dental assistants. In the present paper, we describe a research project related to the regional extended home visit programme; the project aims to illuminate the experiences of the participants and to investigate the perceived benefits of the programme in relation to improved health, social and emotional interaction between parent and child, and attitudes toward authorities and surrounding society. Method/Analysis: In order to evaluate the introduction of the intervention, three qualitative interview studies and one quantitative study with follow-up questionnaires will be conducted. Since the research project also comprises studies focusing on the implementation and expectations of politicians, civil servants, organizational managers, and professionals working within the programme, interviews within these fields will be conducted.

Although the effects of stiffness on cardiac differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (h-iPSCs) have been reported, whether stiffness of polydimethylsiloxane-based substrates could enhance differentiation of h-iPSCs toward heart valve endothelial cells lineage (VECs) or not remains unknown. Herein, we modulated the substrate stiffness to evaluate its effect on the differentiation of h-iPSCs into valve endothelial-like cells (h-iVECs) in vitro and determine the suitable stiffness. The results revealed that VECs-related genes (PECAM1, CDH5, NFATC1, etc.) were significantly increased in h-iVECs obtained from the three substrates compared with h-iPSCs. Gene expression levels and differentiation efficiency were higher in the medium group than in the stiff and soft groups. An increase in substrate stiffness to 2.8 GPa decreased the efficiency of h-iPSCs differentiation into h-iVECs and downregulated VECs specific genes. Through mRNA sequencing, we determined the key genetic markers involved in stiffness guiding the differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells into h-iVECs. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that medium substrates were more suitable for the differentiation of h-iPSCs into h-iVECs in vitro. Moreover, this process is regulated by the WNT/Calcineurin signaling pathway. Overall, this study demonstrates how stiffness can be used to enhance the VECs differentiation of iPSCs and emphasizes the importance of using substrate stiffness to accomplish a more specific and mature differentiation of iPSCs for future therapeutic and tissue engineering valve applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Several studies have examined the stiffness-induced cell fate from pluripotent stem cells during the stage of mesoderm cell differentiation. This is the first research that rigorously examines the effect of substrate stiffness on human valve endothelial cells (h-iVECs) differentiation from cardiac progenitor cells. We found that the medium stiffness can increase the differentiation efficiency of h-iVECs from 40% to about 60%, and this process was regulated by the WNT/CaN signaling pathway through the activation of WNT5a. Substrate stiffness not only increases the differentiation efficiency of h-iVECs, but also improves its cellular functions such as low-density lipoprotein uptake and NO release. This study emphasizes the importance of using substrate stiffness to accomplish a more specific and mature differentiation of h-iVECs.","output":"Substrate stiffness regulates differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into heart valve endothelial cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Overburdened systems and concerns of adverse outcomes have resulted in deferred cancer surgeries with devastating consequences. In this COVID pandemic, the decision to continue elective cancer surgeries, and their subsequent outcomes, are sparsely reported from hotspots. METHODS: A prospective database of the Department of Surgical Oncology was analysed from March 23rd to April 30th, 2020. FINDINGS: Four hundred ninety-four elective surgeries were performed (377 untested and 117 tested for Covid 19 before surgery). Median age was 48 years with 13% (n = 64) above the age of 60 years. Sixty-eight percent patients were American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) grade I. As per surgical complexity grading, 71 (144%) cases were lower grade (I-III) and 423 (85.6%) were higher grade complex surgeries (IV - VI).Clavien-Dindo &#8805; grade III complications were 5.6% (n = 28) and there were no postoperative deaths.

It is not known if post-traumatic osteoarthritis can be prevented or delayed following a knee injury. It has been established that symptoms (e.g., knee-related pain, stiffness, locking etc.) and functional deficits (i.e., quadriceps weakness, balance, hopping performance) can persist for years following an intra-articular knee injury. We hypothesized that a neuromuscular training program that targets quadriceps strength and frontal plane knee control could improve knee-related symptoms in young adults 3 to 15 years after an injury. Furthermore, it is possible that improved function could reduce the risk or delay the onset of osteoarthritis, the illness. The purpose of this study was to describe the effect of pilot 8-week physiotherapist-led neuromuscular training intervention on self-reported knee symptoms in individuals with a 3 to 15-year history of a youth sport-related intra- articular knee injury. Methods: This is a preliminary analysis of a pilot stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial. Participants include a sub-sample of the Alberta Youth Prevention of Early Osteoarthritis (PrE-OA) historical cohort who experienced a time-loss, medical attention youth sport-related intra-articular injury 3-15 years previously. The present study is limited to the participants who completed their baseline testing before the in-person testing and exercise intervention were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. After providing informed consent and completing a baseline Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to immediate (intervention) and 8-week delayed (control) groups in permuted blocks of varying size and stratified during randomization by sex. To ensure allocation concealment, the trial biostatistician, who was not involved in participant recruitment or the intervention, generated the randomization sequence. The allocation was concealed in a computer file only accessible by the biostatistician and a designated research assistant. Once the baseline KOOS was completed, the physiotherapist leading the intervention contacted the research assistant who provided the randomization information. As a result, the study physiotherapist (AMR) was not blinded to group status. The KOOS was repeated at 8-weeks. The 8-week intervention consisted of twice weekly 60-minute physiotherapist-led group exercise classes and once weekly 30-minute independent home exercise session. Exercise classes were delivered in a multi-purpose room at the University of Calgary using standard exercise equipment (e.g., step boards, mats, 5-15 pound dumbbells). Each class consisted of a warm-up, three sets of seven exercises (i.e., squats, single-leg squats, lunges, jumping and landing, hip adductor strength, hamstring strength, trunk control), followed by five minutes of exercises addressing additional functional movement patterns (e.g. lateral movements, deceleration). Each exercise had 4 to 6 levels of progression. Decision to progress to the next level was shared between the physiotherapist and the participant. Knee-related pain was monitored at the beginning and end of each class and 24 hours following the class. The primary outcome was the change in KOOS Symptoms subscale score from baseline to 8-week intervention/delay. This subscale is comprised of 7 questions, each scored on 5-point Likert scale, ranging from no problems to extreme problems. The scores were totalled and the total was transformed to a 0-100 scale with higher scores indicating better outcome. Between-group differences in KOOS symptoms change were assessed with the Mann-Whitney U test (p &lt; 0.05). Results: Nineteen participants were recruited and randomized to immediate (n=10) and delayed (n=9) exercise program delivery. One participant dropped out of the immediate delivery and three participants in the delayed delivery group were unable to participate in the follow-up testing due to COVID-19-related restrictions. Fifteen participant were included in the analysis. Nine participants (6 women, 3 men;age 27.63.2 years;height 170.29.6 cm;weight 86.517.7 kg;body mass index 30.17.2) completed the 8-week intervention and 6 participants (3 women, 3 men;age 25.72.2 years;height 176.18.3 cm;weight 82.211.2 kg;body mass index 26.52.3) in the delayed group served as controls. Scores for the KOOS subscales are presented in Table 1. The median change in symptoms from baseline to 8-week follow-up was -3.6 (range -10.7 to 3.6) in the immediate and -1.8 (range -3.6 to 3.6) in the delayed group. There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.22, Z= -1.33) in the change in the symptom score between those completing the intervention and the delayed group over the 8-week period. The change in the KOOS Symptom subscale for each participant is presented in Figure 1. Conclusions: There were no differences found between groups when comparing change in knee-related symptoms in individuals 3-15 following an intra-articular knee injury after an 8-week exercise intervention, compared to those waiting for the intervention. Some individuals reported more knee-related symptoms after the intervention, even though the exercises were adapted for individual needs and pain was monitored. It is important to bear in mind that the change in the KOOS symptoms score in both groups is less than the Minimal Detectable Change that previous studies have reported to be 5 to 8.5 points in populations with knee injury. It is possible that the increased focus on the knee during the study leads to decreased scores in knee-related symptoms at follow-up. It should also be taken into consideration that it is possible that the 8-week intervention is too short to elicit positive changes in knee-related symptoms. In the future, the impact of an exercise intervention on knee-related symptoms will be explored in a larger group to allow for more robust analysis in which potentially confounding factors can be considered (e.g., time since injury, sex).

Diabetes is the most common cause of diabetic nephropathy, which is attributed to hyperglycemia. COVID-19 produces severe complications in people with diabetes mellitus. This article explains how SARS-CoV-2 causes more significant kidney damage in diabetic patients. Importantly, COVID-19 and diabetes share inflammatory pathways of disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE-2 causes depletion of ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) from blood vessels, and subsequently, angiotensin-II interacts with angiotensin receptor-1 from vascular membranes that produce NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen phosphate) oxidase, oxidative stress, and constriction of blood vessels. Since diabetes and COVID-19 can create oxidative stress, we hypothesize that COVID-19 with comorbidities such as diabetes can synergistically increase oxidative stress leading to end-stage renal failure and death. Antioxidants may therefore prevent renal damage-induced death by inhibiting oxidative damage and thus can help protect people from COVID-19 related comorbidities. A few clinical trials indicated how effective the antioxidant therapy is against improving COVID-19 symptoms, based on a limited number of patients who experienced COVID-19. In this review, we tried to understand how effective antioxidants (such as vitamin D and flavonoids) can act as food supplements or therapeutics against COVID-19 with diabetes as comorbidity based on recently available clinical, preclinical, or in silico studies.","output":"Does Oxidative Stress Management Help Alleviation of COVID-19 Symptoms in Patients Experiencing Diabetes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Authors:  Edith P Mitchell, MD, MACP, FCPP, Clinical Professor of Medicine and Medical Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology Director, Center to Eliminate Cancer Disparities Associate Director, Diversity Affairs Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Jefferson, 116th President National Medical Association  Owen Garrick, MD, President & CEO, Bridge Clinical Research  Gerren Wilson, PharmD, Head, Inclusion Strategy and Alliance, Chief Diversity Office, Genentech Abstract Title: Bold Action Required: Overcoming Clinical Research Disparities in the COVID-19 Era by Advancing Inclusive Research?

Its causative agent is a severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus which has been officially named SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the discovery of extremely low CG abundance in its open reading frames. We found that CG reduction in SARS-CoV-2 is achieved mainly through mutating C/G into A/T, and CG is the best target for mutation. Meanwhile, 5-untranslated region of SARS-CoV-2 has high CG content and is capable of forming an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to recruit host ribosome for translating its RNA. These features allow SARS-CoV-2 to reproduce efficiently in host cells, because less energy is consumed in disrupting the stem-loops formed by its genomic RNA. Notably, genomes of cellular organisms also have very low CG abundance, suggesting that mutating C/G into A/T occurs universally in all life forms. Moreover, CG is the dinucleotide related to CpG island, mutational hotspot and single nucleotide polymorphism in cellular organisms. The relationship between these features is worthy of further investigations.","output":"Human SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to reduce CG dinucleotide in its open reading frames"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has been compared with 3- or 4-port LC.

Here, the spatial and temporal distributions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and O3 in 348 cities of China based on the hourly concentrations data during 2015C2020 were investigated, and the relationships among NO2, O3 and meteorological and socioeconomic parameters were explored. It is shown that higher NO2 and O3 concentrations were mainly distributed in North, East and Central China, which are economically developed and densely populated regions. The annual mean concentrations of NO2 increased from 2015 to 2017 but decreased from 2017 to 2020. The annual variations in O3 generally exhibited an upward trend in 2015C2019 but decreased by 5% from 2019 to 2020. About 74% and 78% of cities had a decline in NO2 and O3 in 2020, respectively, compared to 2019, due to the limits of the motorized transports and industrial production activities during COVID-19 lockdown. The monthly mean concentrations of NO2 showed an unusual decrease in February in all regions due to the reduced emissions during the Chinese Spring Festival holidays. Compared to 2019, the mean concentrations of NO2 in January, February and March, 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown decreased by 16%, 28% and 20%, respectively;O3 increased by 13% and 14% in January and February, respectively, but decreased by 2% in March, 2020. NO2 and O3 concentrations are likely associated with anthropogenic and natural emissions.

Recently, we described a high incidence of inter-individual regional heterogeneity in terms of asymmetry of plaque burden and microglial activation in -amyloid mouse models of AD as assessed by positron-emission-tomography (PET). We now investigate the regional associations between amyloid plaque burden, microglial activation, and impaired spatial learning performance in transgenic mice in vivo. METHODS In 30 AppNL-G-F mice (15 female, 15 male) we acquired cross-sectional 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO-PET, 18F-GE-180) and -amyloid-PET (18F-florbetaben) scans at ten months of age. Control data were obtained from age- and sex-matched C57BI/6 wild-type mice. We assessed spatial learning (i.e. Morris water maze) within two weeks of PET scanning and correlated the principal component of spatial learning performance scores with voxel-wise -amyloid and TSPO tracer uptake maps in AppNL-G-F mice, controlled for age and sex. In order to assess the effects of hemispheric asymmetry, we also analyzed correlations of spatial learning performance with tracer uptake in bilateral regions of interest for frontal cortex, entorhinal/piriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, using a regression model. We tested the correlation between regional asymmetry of PET biomarkers with individual spatial learning performance. RESULTS Voxel-wise analyses in AppNL-G-F mice revealed that higher TSPO-PET signal in the amygdala, entorhinal and piriform cortices, the hippocampus and the hypothalamus correlated with spatial learning performance. Region-based analysis showed significant correlations between TSPO expression in the right entorhinal/piriform cortex and the right amygdala and spatial learning performance, whereas there were no such correlations in the left hemisphere. Right lateralized TSPO expression in the amygdala predicted better performance in the Morris water maze ( = -0.470, p = 0.013), irrespective of the global microglial activation and amyloid level. Region-based results for amyloid-PET showed no significant associations with spatial learning. CONCLUSION Elevated microglial activation in the right amygdala-entorhinal-hippocampal complex of AppNL-G-F mice is associated with better spatial learning. Our findings support a protective role of microglia on cognitive function when they highly express TSPO in specific brain regions involved in spatial memory.","output":"Microglial Activation in the Right Amygdala-Entorhinal-Hippocampal Complex is Associated with Preserved Spatial Learning in AppNL-G-F mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionSpanish Governmen declared state of emergency in March 2020 to prevent coronavirus COVID-19 from spreading.

However, the influence of infectious insults, such as endophthalmitis, on the risk of ACS among AS patients has not been studied yet. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between endophthalmitis in patients with AS and the incidence of ACS. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study extracted medical records from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2015. The primary outcome was the incidence of ACS. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses with and without Fine and Grays competing risk model and KaplanCMeier survival curve were used for the analyses. Spearmans rank correlation coefficient was performed for sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We identified 530 AS patients with endophthalmitis and 2,120 AS patients without endophthalmitis for comparison. The incidence rate of endophthalmitis in our study population was 2.66%. The overall incidence rate of ACS was 1,595.96 per 100,000 person-years in AS patients with endophthalmitis and 953.96 per 100,000 person-years in AS patients without endophthalmitis (adjusted HR = 1.787; 95% CI: 1.594C2.104, p < 0.001). In comparison to those without comorbidities, higher adjusted HRs were found in AS patients with endophthalmitis and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and coronary artery disease. Besides, the age  60 years revealed a high risk for ACS in AS patients with endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: Endophthalmitis was found to be an independent risk factor for ACS in patients with AS.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a quasi-experimental study to be implemented over 4 months at 12 intervention and 12 comparison cART sites from four geographical regions of Uganda. Per region, two blocks each with a tertiary, secondary and primary care cART site will be selected by simple random sampling. Blocks per region will be randomly assigned to intervention and comparison arms.Study units will include cART sites and PLHIV receiving cART. PLHIV at intervention sites will be assigned to peer supporters to empower them to report ADRs directly to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre (NPC). Peer supporters will be expert clients from among PLHIV and/or recognised community health workers.Direct patient reporting of ADRs to NPC will leverage the Med Safety App and toll-free unstructured supplementary service data interface to augment traditional pharmacovigilance methods.The primary outcomes are attrition rate measured by number of study participants who remain in the study until the end of follow-up at 4 months; and number of ADR reports submitted to NPC by PLHIV as measured by questionnaire and data abstraction from the national pharmacovigilance database at baseline and 4 months.

There has been an immediate need for research to understand the clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 that can help predict deterioration including mechanical ventilation, organ support, and death. Studies thus far have addressed the epidemiology of the disease, common presentations, and susceptibility to acquisition and transmission of the virus; however, an accurate prognostic model for severe manifestations of COVID-19 is still needed because of the limited healthcare resources available. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to evaluate published reports of prediction models for severe illnesses caused COVID-19. METHODS Searches were developed by the primary author and a medical librarian using an iterative process of gathering and evaluating terms. Comprehensive strategies, including both index and keyword methods, were devised for PubMed and EMBASE. The data of confirmed COVID-19 patients from randomized control studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies published between January 2020 and May 2021were retrieved. Studies were independently assessed for risk of bias and applicability using the Prediction Model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). We collected study type, setting, sample size, type of validation, and outcome including intubation, ventilation, any other type of organ support, or death. The combination of the prediction model, scoring system, performance of predictive models, and geographic locations were summarized. RESULTS A primary review found 445 articles relevant based on title and abstract. After further review, 366 were excluded based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seventy-nine articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Inter observer agreement on inclusion 0.84 (95%CI 0.78 - 0.89).When the PROBAST tool was applied, 70 of the 79 articles were identified to have high or unclear risk of bias, or high or unclear concern for applicability. Nine studies reported prediction models that were rated as low risk of bias and low concerns for applicability. CONCLUSION Several prognostic models for COVID-19 were identified, with varying clinical score performance. Nine studies that had a low risk of bias and low concern for applicability, one from a general public population and hospital setting. The most promising and well-validated scores include Clift et al.15 , and Knight et al.18 , which seem to have accurate prediction models that clinicians can use in the public health and emergency department setting.","output":"Prediction Models for Severe Manifestations and Mortality due to COVID-19: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are considered a high\\\\risk group for viral pneumonia, with an increased probability of fatal outcome.

Major influences on mortality were high IL\\\\6 levels at Covid\\\\19 diagnosis (HR = 6.95, P = .0121) and age  65 years (HR = 6.22, P = .0156). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to an age\\\\matched noncancer cohort, we did not observe an association between a cancer diagnosis and a more severe disease course or higher fatality rate in patients with Covid\\\\19. Patients with a hematological malignancy showed a trend towards a longer duration until clinical improvement and longer hospitalization time compared to patients with a solid cancer.

Sizing and landing zone predictions are still very challenging steps in the procedure. Virtual stent deployment may help therapeutic planning, device choice, and hemodynamic simulations. We aimed to assess the predictability of our recently developed virtual deployment model by comparing in vivo and virtual stents implanted in a consecutive series of patients presenting with intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Virtual stents were implanted in patient-specific geometries of intracranial aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device. The length and cross-section of virtual and real stents measured with conebeam CT were compared. The influence of vessel geometry modifications occurring during the intervention was analyzed. RESULTS The virtual deployment based on pre- and poststent implantation 3D rotational angiography overestimated (underestimated) the device length by 13%  11% (-9%  5%). These differences were highly correlated (R2 = 0.67) with the virtual-versus-real stent radius differences of -6%  7% (5%  4%) for predictions based on pre- and poststent implantation 3D rotational angiography. These mismatches were due principally to implantation concerns and vessel-shape modifications. CONCLUSIONS The recently proposed geometric model was shown to predict accurately the deployment of Pipeline Embolization Devices when the stent radius was well-assessed. However, unpredictable delivery manipulations and variations of vessel geometry occurring during the intervention might impact the stent implantation.","output":"Virtual-versus-Real Implantation of Flow Diverters: Clinical Potential and Influence of Vascular Geometry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To report the incidence of avascular osteonecrosis (AVN) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven SARS patients who had large joint pain between March 2003 and May 2003 underwent both plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination on the same day. All patients received steroids and ribavirin treatment. All plain radiographs and MR images were analysed by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. Any abnormalities, location, extent, morphology, the number, size and signal intensity of lesions were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were identified with AVN, The mean time to diagnosis of AVN was 119 days after the onset of SARS, or 116 days after steroid use. Three patients had early bilateral AVN of the femoral head, four patients of one femoral head, five patients of the bilateral hips and knees, four patients of the ipsilateral hip and knees, 10 patients of the knee(s), one patient of the right proximal fibula, and one patient of the knees and talus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted 3 experiments using 30 rats. In experiment 1, we administered either ferucarbotran (n = 6) or saline (n = 4), acquired T2*-weighted images (T2*-WIs) of the liver by using a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner, and subsequently performed RFA of healthy liver lobes. We acquired follow-up T2*-WIs up to day 7 and histologically analyzed the liver specimens. In another 4 rats, we performed sham operation, instead of RFA, in ferucarbotran-accumulated liver lobes, followed by the same image acquisition and histological analysis. In experiment 2, we administered 59Fe-labeled ferucarbotran, subsequently performed either RFA (n = 4) or sham operation (n = 4) in the liver, and acquired autoradiograms of the liver specimens on day 7. In experiment 3, we conducted RFA treatment for 8 rats bearing orthotopic hepatic tumors after ferucarbotran administration and monitored tumor growth by using serial T2*-WIs. RESULTS On days 4 and 7 of the experiment 1, T2*-WIs of 6 rats with systemic ferucarbotran administration and subsequent hepatic RFA showed low-signal regions indicative of ablated liver tissues, whereas high-signal areas were seen in 4 saline-administered rats. Neither high nor low signal areas were detected in 4 sham-operated rats. Histologically, larger amounts of iron were observed in the RFA-induced necrotic liver tissues in the ferucarbotran-administered rats than in the saline-administered-rats. The 59Fe autoradiography of the rats in experiment 2 revealed accumulation of ferucarbotran-derived iron in necrotic liver tissues. Among 6 hepatic tumors grown in 6 rats of the experiment 3, a total of 4 tumors were stable in size, but the other 2 increased markedly on day 7. Retrospectively, T2*-WIs showed the former tumor sites surrounded completely by low-signal areas on day 4. CONCLUSIONS The RFA of ferucarbotran-accumulated healthy liver tissues in the rats caused excess iron deposition in the ablated liver tissues and produced sustained T2*-weighted hypointense regions.

DESIGN We reviewed vital statistics data to identify deaths registered in Los Angeles County between March 15, 2020, and August 15, 2020. Deaths with an ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) code for pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 listed as an immediate or underlying cause of death were classified as PIC deaths. Expected deaths were calculated using negative binomial regression. Excess mortality was determined by subtracting the expected from the observed number of weekly deaths. The Department of Public Health conducts surveillance for COVID-19-associated deaths: persons who died of nontraumatic/nonaccidental causes within 60 days of a positive COVID-19 test result were classified as confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Deaths without a reported positive SARS-Cov-2 polymerase chain reaction result were classified as probable COVID-19 deaths if COVID-19 was listed on their death certificate or the death occurred 60 to 90 days of a positive test. We compared excess PIC deaths with the number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths ascertained by surveillance. SETTING Los Angeles County. PARTICIPANTS Residents of Los Angeles County who died. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Excess mortality. RESULTS There were 7208 excess all-cause and 5128 excess PIC deaths during the study period. The Department of Public Health also reported 5160 confirmed and 323 probable COVID-19-associated deaths. CONCLUSIONS The number of excess PIC deaths estimated by our model was approximately equal to the number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths identified by surveillance. This suggests our surveillance definition for confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths might be sufficiently sensitive for capturing the true burden of deaths caused directly or indirectly by COVID-19.","output":"Excess Mortality Associated With the COVID-19 Pandemic-Los Angeles County, March-September 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) may provide a noninvasive way to monitor cerebral oxygenation in patients with traumatic brain injury, therein allowing for timely intervention aimed at reversing regional brain tissue hypoxia.

The pandemic has exerted a negative impact on the social support of individuals, and as a result, the behavior of a person is more likely to be at risk and has resulted in psychological crisis in people/individuals. Methods A sample of 3137 graduate students responded to the instrument developed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the academic activities and performance, Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Self-rating Depression Scale. Results The results showed that: 1) the pandemic impacted the academic support and performance of graduate students in varying degrees, 21% of graduate students experienced anxiety, and 33.9% of graduate students experienced depressive symptoms in varying degrees;2) academic support variables (ie, academic exchange with mentors and peers) and academic performance variables (ie, data collection and thesis writing) were significantly associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms;3) the model fitted the data well (RMSEA = 0.029;SRMR = 0.014;TLI = 0.99;CFI = 0.996).

Therefore, we predicted and analyzed LULC changes in future scenarios (SSP1-26, SSP2-45, SSP5-85) in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MYRB). We obtain historical (i.e., 2005-2020) LULC data from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using the random forest (RF) classification method. LULC data for different future scenarios are also obtained by the driving factors of LULC changes in future shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (SSP-RCP) scenarios (i.e., 2035-2095) and the patch-generated land use simulation (PLUS) model. The major findings are as follows: (1) simulation using the PLUS model based on the acquired classification data and the selected drivers can obtain accurate land use data in MYRB and a Kappa coefficient of 89.6% and 0.82, respectively; (2) as for the LULC changes in the MYRB, forests increased by 3.9% and decreased by 1.2% in the SSP1-26 and SSP5-85 scenarios, respectively, while farmland decreased by 9.2% and increased by 13.4% in SSP 1-26 and SSP 2-45, respectively, during 2080-2095; and (3) the main conversions in LULC in the MYRB were farmland to forest, forests/water bodies to farmland, and forests/grasslands to farmland/buildings in SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP 5-8.5, respectively.

Several varieties of stem cells can potentially be applied to periodontal regeneration, including dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs), nonodontogenic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In particular, these stem cells possess extensive immunoregulatory capacities. In periodontitis, these cells can exert anti-inflammatory effects and regenerate the periodontium. Stem cells derived from infected tissue possess typical stem cell characteristics with lower immunogenicity and immunosuppression. Several studies have demonstrated that these cells can also regenerate the periodontium.

We utilize the scale uncertainty among various receptive field sizes of a segmentation FCN to obtain infection regions. The receptive field sizes can be defined as the patch size and the resolution of volumes where patches are clipped from. This paper proposes an infection segmentation network (ISNet) that performs patch-based segmentation and a scale uncertainty-aware prediction aggregation method that refines the segmentation result. We design ISNet to segment infection regions that have various intensity values. ISNet has multiple encoding paths to process patch volumes normalized by multiple intensity ranges. We collect prediction results generated by ISNets having various receptive field sizes. Scale uncertainty among the prediction results is extracted by the prediction aggregation method. We use an aggregation FCN to generate a refined segmentation result considering scale uncertainty among the predictions. In our experiments using 199 chest CT volumes of COVID-19 cases, the prediction aggregation method improved the dice similarity score from 47.6% to 62.1%.","output":"COVID-19 Infection Segmentation from Chest CT Images Based on Scale Uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a serious emerging zoonosis. It is characterized by severe infection of the respiratory tract in humans. Dromedary camels are considered to be the most probable origin of the pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This cross-sectional survey was carried out to ascertain the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels at Illela border and human patients in a secondary care hospital in Illela, Sokoto State, Nigeria from November 2016 to January 2017. Serum samples from 74 camels and 39 human patients were collected while a data form was administered to the camel handlers (40) and human patients to obtain information on zoographic characteristics of dromedary camels, demographic characteristics of camel handlers and human patients and some practices of both groups which are likely to predispose to MERS-CoV infection. The serum samples were analyzed for antibodies against MERS-CoV using the indirect Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA). All the camels sampled were seropositive against MERS-CoV and 74% of the human patients had antibodies against MERS. All handlers treated their camels without consulting veterinarians and there was little or no biosecurity measures undertaken. Age, sex, and occupation were not significant determinants for the presence of MERS-CoV antibody in human patients sampled. This study serves as a baseline for similar researches and due to the high seroprevalence obtained in this study for both camels and humans, there is need for trained personnel, surveillance and diagnostic tools at our border posts and animal markets.

Although apathy is considered a symptom, it has been recently reconsidered as a syndrome characterised by three dimensions: cognitive symptoms, affective symptoms and behavioural symptoms. Recent studies have shown that apathy can be considered as a prodromal symptom of Alzheimers disease (AD), but also an indicator of the transition from mild cognitive impairment to AD. According to this scenario, an early detection of apathy in subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Mild AD can be a valid psychometric strategy to improve an early diagnosis and promote a prompt intervention. The Apathy Evaluation Scale is a validated tool composed of 18 items that assess and quantify emotional, behavioural and cognitive aspects of apathy. The aim of this study is to assess the specific reliability and validity of the Italian version of the Apathy Evaluation ScaleClinician Version (AES-C) to detect apathy both in amnestic MCI and mild AD patients. In the present paper, we therefore examined the psychometric properties and the invariance of the Italian Version of the AES-C conducted on a sample composed of an experimental group of amnestic MCI and AD patients (N = 107) and a control group (N = 107) constituted by Age- and Sex-matched healthy controls. Results confirm the goodness of the scale. Confirmatory factory analysis confirmed that the AES-C Italian Version presents the same stability of one second-order factor and three first-order factors identified in the original version, and all items are predicted by a single general factor. Moreover, the scale was found to be invariant across both populations. Moreover, reliability and discriminant analysis showed good values. We found in the experimental group a negative correlation between the AES-C and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) (rs = ?0.21, p < 0.001) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (rs = ?0.04, p < 0.001), while a positive correlation was found between the AES-C and Hamilton psychiatric Rating scale for Depression (HAM-D) scores (rs = 0.58, p < 0.001) Overall, our data demonstrated the validity of the Italian version of the AES-C for the assessment of apathy both in MCI and in AD patients.","output":"The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C): Psychometric Properties and Invariance of Italian Version in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimers Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesTo assess the humoral and cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant after BNT162b2 vaccination in PLWHIV.

MethodsAnti-SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain IgG antibodies (anti-RBD IgG) were quantified and their neutralization capacity was evaluated using an ELISA (GenScript) and a virus neutralization test (VNT), against historical strain, Beta and Delta variants before vaccination (day 0) and one month after a complete vaccination schedule (M1). Results97 patients were enrolled in the study: 85 received 2 vaccine doses (11 previous COVID-19 and 1 premature exit). The seroconversion rate in anti-RBD IgG was 97% CI95[90%; 100%] at M1. Median (IQR) anti-RBD IgG titer was 0.97 (0.97-5.3) BAU/ml at D0 and 1219 (602-1929) at M1. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) capacity improved between D0 (15% CI95[8%; 23%]) and M1 (94% CI95[87%; 98%]) with the GenScript assay (p<0.0001).

Impaired autonomic development (assessed by heart rate variability (HRV)) is associated with brain injury in other high-risk neonatal populations. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether impaired early neonatal HRV is associated with pre-operative brain injury in CHD. METHODS: In infants with critical CHD, we evaluated HRV during the first 24 h of cardiac ICU (CICU) admission using time-domain (RMS 1, RMS 2, and alpha 1) and frequency-domain metrics (LF, nLF, HF, nHF). Pre-operative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was scored for injury using an established system. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to determine the association between HRV and pre-operative brain injury. RESULTS: We enrolled 34 infants with median birth gestational age of 38.8 weeks (IQR 38.1-39.1). Median postnatal age at pre-operative brain MRI was 2 days (IQR 1-3 days). Thirteen infants had MRI evidence of brain injury. RMS 1 and RMS 2 were inversely correlated with pre-operative brain injury. CONCLUSIONS: Time-domain metrics of autonomic function measured within the first 24 h of admission to the CICU are associated with pre-operative brain injury, and may perform better than frequency-domain metrics under non-stationary conditions such as critical illness. IMPACT: Autonomic dysfunction, measured by heart rate variability (HRV), in early transition is associated with pre-operative brain injury in neonates with critical congenital heart disease. These data extend our earlier findings by providing further evidence for (i) autonomic dysfunction in infants with CHD, and (ii) an association between autonomic dysfunction and brain injury in critically ill neonates. These data support the notion that further investigation of HRV as a biomarker for brain injury risk is warranted in infants with critical CHD.","output":"In infants with congenital heart disease autonomic dysfunction is associated with pre-operative brain injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hantaviruses are members of the Bunyaviridae family carried by small mammals and causing human hemorrhagic fevers worldwide.

KSHV-mediated upregulation of the host cell circRNA, circHIPK3, is a key component of this network, functioning as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-30c, leading to increased levels of the miR-30c target, DLL4. Dysregulation of this network highlights a novel mechanism of cell cycle control during KSHV lytic replication in B cells.

In this context, the study focuses on how CO(2) emissions, the primary cause of global warming and climate change, respond to changes in tourism development. In order to do so, the impact of tourism development on CO(2) emissions in the most visited countries is investigated. A panel data from 2000 to 2017 for top 70 tourist countries are analysed using a spatial econometric method to investigate the spatial effect of tourism on environmental pollution. The direct, indirect, and overall impact of tourism on CO(2) emissions are estimated using the most appropriate generalized nested spatial econometric (GNS) method. The findings reveal that tourism has a positive direct effect and a negative indirect effect; both are significant at the 1% level. The negative indirect effect of tourism is greater than its direct positive effect, implying an overall significantly negative impact. Further, the outcome of financial development and CO(2) emissions have an inverted U-shaped and U-shaped relationship in direct and indirect impacts. Population density, trade openness, and economic growth significantly influence environmental pollution. In addition, education expenditure and infrastructure play a significant moderating role among tourism and environmental pollution.

We report a polymyxin B-heteroresistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) isolate from an individual in the community with asymptomatic bacteriuria. RESULTS: The NYTJ35 isolate had multiple virulence genes that encoded a mucoid phenotype regulator (rmpA), aerobactin (iucABCD-iutA), salmochelin (iroBCDN), yersiniabactin (irp1C2 and ybtAEPQSTUX), and a truncated rmpA2. Infection of galleria mellonella larvae indicated the isolate was hypervirulent. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed it was susceptible to all tested antibiotics except polymyxin B. The proportion of surviving bacteria was 1.2  10(? 7) based on the population analysis profile (PAP) method, suggesting the presence of polymyxin B heteroresistance. The isolate was not hypermucoviscous, but it was a strong biofilm producer. It had capsular serotype K1 and belonged to sequence type 23 (ST23).

The final ensemble stack and individual classifiers were then applied to the testing dataset to assess model performance. RESULTS: Feature selection identified HE4, CA125, and transferrin as three predictive parameters of malignancy. Assessment of the ensemble stack on the testing dataset outperformed all individual ML classifiers in predicting malignancy. The ensemble stack demonstrated an accuracy of 97.1%, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.951, and a sensitivity of 93.3% with a specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Combining the measurement of three distinct biomarkers with the stacking of multiple ML classifiers into an ensemble can provide valuable preoperative diagnostic predictions for patients with a pelvic mass.","output":"Stacking Machine Learning Algorithms for Biomarker-Based Preoperative Diagnosis of a Pelvic Mass"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) and in vitro ADME properties of GS-441524, a potential oral agent for the treatment of Covid-19, were studied.

METHODS: This prospective cohort study surveyed nurses three times - surveying personal factors, working conditions, family dynamics, and attitude towards COVID-19 - between March 31 and May 4, 2020. Nurses' mental health was assessed through Depression Anxiety Stress Scales - short version (DASS-21); their sleep quality was assessed through a 5-point Likert scale question. RESULTS: Nurses' sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress presented a positive variation over the COVID-19 outbreak. The only factors which are directly related to the COVID-19 outbreak and that were associated with the positive variation in nurses' symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were the fear to infect others and the fear to be infected (higher fear of being infected or to infect someone corresponded to increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress). CONCLUSIONS: Although the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have had an immediate impact on nurses' mental health, a psychological adaptation phenomenon was also observed.

Since then, the virus has also rapidly spread among Latin American, Caribbean, and African countries. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study is to identify new emerging COVID-19 clusters over time and space (from January 21 to mid-May 2020) in Latin American, Caribbean, and African regions, using a prospective spaceCtime scan measurement approach. The second aim is to assess the impact of real-time population mobility patterns between January 21 and May 18, 2020, under the implemented government interventions, measurements, and policy restrictions on COVID-19 spread among those regions and worldwide. METHODS: We created a global COVID-19 database, of 218 countries and territories, merging the World Health Organization daily case reports with other measures such as population density and country income levels for January 21 to May 18, 2020. A score of government policy interventions was created for low, intermediate, high, and very high interventions. The populations mobility patterns at the country level were obtained from Google community mobility reports. The prospective spaceCtime scan statistic method was applied in five time periods between January and May 2020, and a regression mixed model analysis was used. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 emerging clusters within these five periods of time increased from 7 emerging clusters to 28 by mid-May 2020. We also detected various increasing and decreasing relative risk estimates of COVID-19 spread among Latin American, Caribbean, and African countries within the period of analysis. Globally, population mobility to parks and similar leisure areas during at least a minimum of implemented intermediate-level control policies (when compared to low-level control policies) was related to accelerated COVID-19 spread. Results were almost consistent when regional stratified analysis was applied. In addition, worldwide population mobility due to working during high implemented control policies and very high implemented control policies, when compared to low-level control policies, was related to positive COVID-19 spread. CONCLUSIONS: The prospective spaceCtime scan is an approach that low-income and middle-income countries could use to detect emerging clusters in a timely manner and implement specific control policies and interventions to slow down COVID-19 transmission. In addition, real-time population mobility obtained from crowdsourced digital data could be useful for current and future targeted public health and mitigation policies at a global and regional level.","output":"Estimating the COVID-19 Spread Through Real-time Population Mobility Patterns: Surveillance in Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To gain a better understanding of the genetic diversity and evolution of PRRSV in the Ningxia Hui Nationality Autonomous Region (Ningxia) of China, the nsp2 genes from a series of PRRSV strains collected from the region in 2007 were partially sequenced.

The discovery of these new RNAs created a new avenue for treating various human diseases. However, RNA is relatively unstable and is degraded fairly rapidly once administered; this has led to the development of novel delivery mechanisms, such as nanoparticles to increase stability as well as to prevent off-target effects of these molecules. Current advances in RNA-based therapies have substantial promise in treating and preventing many human diseases and disorders through fixing the pathology instead of merely treating the symptomology similarly to traditional therapeutics. Although many RNA therapeutics have made it to clinical trials, only a few have been FDA approved thus far. Additionally, the results of clinical trials for RNA therapeutics have been ambivalent to date, with some studies demonstrating potent efficacy, whereas others have limited effectiveness and/or toxicity.

Sociodemographic data, comorbidities, and clinical data were collected. Our novel SAS score was constructed using 3 easily available parameters, namely Sex, Age, and Oxygen Saturation at presentation (Table 1 and 2). Primary endpoint was mortality. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was done and the model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) with area under ROC (AUROC) to determine the optimal cutoff for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] RESULTS: The mean age of survivors was 61 compared to 75 years for non-survivors (standard deviation 16 vs 13.8, p< 0.0001), and 1298 (51.1%) were men.

Reduced mortality, on the other hand, does not per se prove to be an evolutionary advantage. I then implement this model as an agent-based simulation model in order to explore its aggregate dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations show that a) containment policy design has an impact on both speed and direction of viral evolution, b) the virus may circulate in the population indefinitely, provided that containment efforts are too relaxed and the propensity of the virus to escape immunity is high enough, and crucially c) that it may not be possible to distinguish between a slowly and a rapidly evolving virus by looking only at short-term epidemiological outcomes. Thus, what looks like a successful mitigation strategy in the short run, may prove to have devastating long-run effects.

However, if only diarrhoeic on the day of birth, no negative effect on ADG was seen. Piglets originating from severely affected litters were estimated to have a reduced ADG of 38 g. The study did not show an overall effect of diarrhoea on mortality, but herd of origin, sow parity, birth weight, and gender were significantly associated with mortality. In one of the herds, approximately 25% of the diarrhoeic piglets vs. 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets died, and 74% of necropsied piglets were diagnosed with enteritis.

However, the study showed that diarrhoea restricted to the day of birth did not affect ADG and suggested this phenomenon to be unrelated to the syndrome. Since the diarrhoeal status of the litter had important effects on ADG, future research on NNPDS probably ought to focus on piglets from severely affected litters. The study showed important dissimilarities in the course of diarrhoea between the herds, and one herd was considerably more affected than the others. Within this herd, NNPDS seemed to be associated with a higher mortality, whereas in general the study did not show lethal effects of NNPDS.","output":"The effect of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) on average daily gain and mortality in 4 Danish pig herds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory conditions constitute many of the diseases affecting all avian species, including gallinaceous birds.

The health impact of public transport services, such as social exclusion, is a widely discussed research topic. Social exclusion is a paramount concern for older adults health in the wake of emerging global challenges. However, there remains a significant research gap on how psychosocial barriers faced by older adults in using public transport services influence the social exclusion behavior. The present research provides empirical evidence and shows the impact of certain psychosocial barriers of public transportation on older adults social exclusion. A total of 243 Pakistani older adults (aged 60C89 years old) voluntarily participated in this cross-sectional study. The participants provided self-reports on their psychosocial barriers (including perceived norms, attitude, personal ability, habits, neighborhood social constraints, and intention) and the corresponding social exclusion. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was utilized for the data analysis. The structural path model supported the significant associations between psychosocial barriers and social exclusion. Except for perceived descriptive norms, all other psychosocial barriers predicted older adults social exclusion. The research portrays the significance of the psychosocial factors to examine social exclusion and offers practical implications for urban and transport planners.

In this international study, healthcare professionals were invited to complete an online survey of their attitudes and practice in the management of excess body weight. A total of 335 clinicians completed the survey of whom approximately half were based in Europe. A key finding from the survey is that, while participants are generally confident in their ability to manage overweight and obesity effectively, they also report that most of their patients are not successful in achieving their weight loss goals. At the same time, participants tended to overestimate the effectiveness of current medical management in maintaining reductions in body weight.

The purpose of this study is to examine applicant data to gain insight on residency match trends and evaluate these findings within the backdrop of a novel match year. METHODS AND MATERIALS: National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) data between 2009 and 2020 were assessed for the number of applicants, programs, and positions available, number of ranked applicants needed to fill positions, and successfully matched applicant data. Additionally, Electronic Residency Application Service data were evaluated for race/ethnicity identification among applicants. RESULTS: The number of applicants who ranked radiation oncology as their preferred specialty has declined for 3 consecutive years from 223 in 2017 to 155 in 2020. In 2020 the applicant-to-position ratio was at an all-time low at 0.82, and the unmatched position rate increased to 18.5%. The percentage of Black or African American applicants applying to radiation oncology has also declined to 4.9%, and this population represents 7.2% of all applicants. The number of ranked applicants needed to fill the available radiation oncology PGY2 positions increased from 4.0 in 2010 to 6.0 in 2020. CONCLUSION: Declining interest in radiation oncology among applicants, and an even further decline of black applicants, along with the challenges of interview and travel restrictions during the pandemic provide heightened concern for this years match.

In this regard, saving energy resources of the university offers an opportunity to get out of the crisis. The purpose of the study is to develop a management system for energy complexes with non-conventional renewable energy sources in the context of preventing a new outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: The method of Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Nachhaltiges Bauen was used to conduct energy audits, construct energy profiles of university offices. The cluster analysis was used to perform energy certification of university offices according to the indicators of integral energy efficiency potential and the level of annual specific energy consumption. Fuzzy methods made it possible to classify all the buildings into 3 categories (A, B, C) to prioritize their use in the light of Covid-19 pandemic. The system for monitoring the attained level of energy efficiency is based on the use of discriminant analysis. FINDINGS: Implementation of the weighted strategy has proved that the classes will be given online, 23% of all offices. Category A (administrative, technical, service buildings;laboratories with unique equipment with 24-hour service) will be used in a pessimistic scenario (continuation of Covid-19 pandemic). In the optimistic scenario (end of Covid-19 pandemic), by means of the suggested energy efficiency monitoring system, the probability of using category A offices makes 100%, B offices- 50% and C offices - 13%. CONCLUSION: Implementation of the developed energy efficiency action plan will offer the opportunity for the University to use reasonably the common connection point of knowledge management of energy complexes with non-conventional renewable energy sources in the context of preventing a new outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The profitability of implementing a weighted energy efficiency strategy is 15%, with a payback period of 6.7 years for the purchase and installation of non-conventional renewable energy equipment. In the future, it would be advisable to convert gradually all of the remaining 14 university buildings to the autonomous use of non-conventional renewable energy sources, using a common connection point for the knowledge management of the energy complexes.","output":"Energy-innovation knowledge common connection point management in preventing outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in a university"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System was established in 2009 to use routinely collected electronic health data for improving the national capability to assess post-market medical product safety.

Protection from homologous re-challenge was recently demonstrated in cats recovered from primary infection. Here, we determined if cats recovered from Cand. M. turicensis infection were protected against infections with the more pathogenic M. haemofelis. Ten specified pathogen-free cats were exposed to M. haemofelis. Five of the ten cats had recovered from Cand. M. turicensis bacteremia (group A), and five cats were na?ve controls (group B). No cross-protection was observed. By contrast, the Cand. M. turicensis-recovered cats displayed faster M. haemofelis infection onset (earlier PCR-positive and anemic) than the controls. No Cand. M. turicensis was detected in any cat. M. haemofelis shedding was observed in saliva, feces and urine. In both groups, evidence of a Th1 response was observed (high IFN-, low IL-4), but IL-10 levels were also high. In group A, total, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased within days after M. haemofelis exposure. At times of maximal bacteremia, macrocytic hypochromic anemia, neutropenia, monocytosis and a decrease in leukocyte, eosinophil, and lymphocyte counts and subsets thereof (B- and T-cells, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD25+ cells) were particularly significant in group A. Moreover, an increase in protein concentrations, hypoalbuminemia and a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia were observed. Five of ten M. haemofelis-infected cats subsequently cleared bacteremia without antibiotic treatment.

Herein, a novel single-line-based LFA (sLFA) strip, which combines test and control line, is developed by exploiting an orthogonal emissive upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) as a signal reporter on the test line, where one emission can be used as a reporting signal and the other as a calibrating signal.

As a proof-of-concept, this novel sLFA strip is successfully explored to accurately and rapidly detect aflatoxin B1. Moreover, due to the removal of control lines, such a novel strategy greatly reduces the strip size, facilitating the design of a testing array for multiple detections of different samples. The test line herein is designed in a ring shape, and several test rings are assembled to be a chip for the testing of multiple samples.

RESULTS: To address these challenges, we present an efficient likelihood-based approach to analyzing associations of quantitative traits with haplotypes or untyped SNPs. This approach properly accounts for within-family trait correlations and can handle general pedigrees with arbitrary patterns of missing genotypes. We characterize the genetic effects on the quantitative trait by a linear regression model with random effects and develop efficient likelihood-based inference procedures.

The COVID-19 pandemic magnified and accelerated the impact of longstanding discrimination and health inequity among historically marginalized groups and low-income populations. Black and Latinx populations have a higher COVID-19 contraction and mortality rate, higher rates of unemployment, less access to health care, and are at higher risk of eviction during the pandemic, among other significant inequities. Without robust and swift government interventions, the impacts of the pandemic will be wide and deep. This article analyzes mechanisms of discrimination and barriers to health in the pandemic setting using the health justice framework to address discrimination and poverty. The health justice framework offers four overarching principles to prevent and eliminate health disparities during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. First, legal and policy responses must address the impacts of discrimination and poverty on the social determinants of health, which in turn threaten to exacerbate the health, financial, and social impacts of a public health emergency on low-income communities, communities of color, and other marginalized communities. Second, interventions mandating healthy behaviorssuch as staying at home from work when sick, mask wearing, and minimizing close contacts outside the homemust be accompanied by legal protections, accommodations, and social supports to enable those behaviors while minimizing economic, social, and cultural harms. Third, because emergencies typically exacerbate long-standing and interconnected crises in low-income communities and communities of color, legal and policy responses must address root problems in addition to immediate needs. Fourth, historically marginalized communities must be engaged as leaders in the development of any interventions and the attainment of health justice. To demonstrate the application of the health justice framework and principles, this article focuses upon three pillars that support resilience and equip marginalized communities to withstand the immediate and long-term impacts of the pandemic: health care, housing, and employment. This article explains how health care discrimination is a social determinant of health, how lack of access to health care operated as a barrier to health justice during the COVID-19 pandemic, and applies the health justice framework to address health inequity. Then this article explains how housing and eviction are social determinants of health, how housing discrimination is a barrier to health justice during the COVID-19 pandemic, and suggests way to achieve health justice in housing. Finally, this article discusses how poverty and employment inequity are social determinants of health, how structural discrimination is an accelerator of employment inequity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and suggests how health justice principles can help achieve equity in employment. Ultimately, the framework can be adopted across numerous social determinants of health and structures to ensure the elimination of discrimination, poverty, and poor health among marginalized people during and after the pandemic.","output":"Health Justice Strategies to Combat the Pandemic: Eliminating Discrimination, Poverty, and Health Disparities During and After COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have mainly focused on hospitalized patients or those with severe disease.

The primary outcome was clinical worsening, defined as hospitalization or death within 1 month after symptom onset. RESULTS: Among 43 103 patients, mean age was 42.9 years (SD 14.3 years); 93.0% (n = 40 081) of patients were <65 years old and 61.9% (n = 26 688) were women. Of these 43 103 patients, 67.5% (n = 29 104) completed a medical questionnaire on co-morbidities and symptoms. The main reported co-morbidities were asthma (12.8%; n = 3685), hypertension (12.3%; n = 3546) and diabetes (4.8%; n = 1385). A small proportion of all eligible patients (4.1%, 95% CI 3.9-4.2; 1751/43 103) experienced clinical worsening.

Methods: The study includes 419 participants who have completed the Perceived Stress Scale 10, the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, the modified Nature Exposure Scale, and complementary questions related to the lockdown period from April 19 to May 11, 2020. Multiple regression models were constructed to evaluate the relationship of nature exposure and physical exercise with overall stress perception and psychological health in France and Germany when considering a broad range of covariates. Results: Exposure to nature during the lockdown (p(2) = 0.034, p < 0.001), amount of physical activity p(2) = 0.014, p < 0.001), and psychological health (p(2) = 0.041, p < 0.001) were greater in German compared with French participants. Godin Index and Nature Exposure Scale total score were both inversely correlated to stress perception and positively correlated to psychological health. The stress and psychological health regression models explained 10% of the results' variance. Physical activity (Godin Index) was a significant for both models. Nature Exposure Scale total score was a significant predictor only for psychological health. When including all significant covariates, the regression models explained 30.7% for the perceived stress and 42.1% for the psychological health total overall variance. Conclusion: Physical activity and nature exposure are significant predictors of psychological health. Even though both variables are associated with stress perception, only physical activity is a significant predictor of stress perception. Our results suggest that physical activity and nature exposure were key factors to go through the lockdown period in France and Germany.","output":"The Importance of Nature Exposure and Physical Activity for Psychological Health and Stress Perception: Evidence From the First Lockdown Period During the Coronavirus Pandemic 2020 in France and Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has kept the world in suspense for the past year. In most federal countries such as Germany, locally varying conditions demand for state- or county-level decisions to adapt to the disease dynamics. However, this requires a deep understanding of the mesoscale outbreak dynamics between microscale agent models and macroscale global models. Here, we use a reparameterized SIQRD network model that accounts for local political decisions to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the pandemic in Germany at county resolution. Our optimized model reproduces state-wise cumulative infections and deaths as reported by the Robert Koch Institute and predicts the development for individual counties at convincing accuracy during both waves in spring and fall of 2020. We demonstrate the dominating effect of local infection seeds and identify effective measures to attenuate the rapid spread. Our model has great potential to support decision makers on a state and community politics level to individually strategize their best way forward during the months to come.

To this, we here established a human kidney organoid model promoting early hallmarks of diabetic kidney disease development. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, diabetic-like kidney organoids exhibited higher viral loads compared with their control counterparts. Genetic deletion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in kidney organoids under control or diabetic-like conditions prevented viral detection. Moreover, cells isolated from kidney biopsies from diabetic patients exhibited altered mitochondrial respiration and enhanced glycolysis, resulting in higher SARS-CoV-2 infections compared with non-diabetic cells. Conversely, the exposure of patient cells to dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of aerobic glycolysis, resulted in reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our results provide insights into the identification of diabetic-induced metabolic programming in the kidney as a critical event increasing SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility, opening the door to the identification of new interventions in COVID-19 pathogenesis targeting energy metabolism.","output":"A diabetic milieu increases ACE2 expression and cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infections in human kidney organoids and patient cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relevance of the study of mobile learning as an upcoming trend in education in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is not denied. Thestudy of students ability and motivation to use modern technologies of mobilelearning is characterized by novelty. However, the problematic issue of studyingthe motivation of students and teachers for mobile learning in todays pandemicremains relevant. The purpose of the study is to examine some aspects of theformation of students motivation (intrinsic motivation: interest in the subject ofstudy, understanding of its significance for further career;extrinsic motivation:points, awards, recognition), as well as the role of teachers in this process andthe influence of cognitive abilities of a person on their motivation and academicachievement. The study is based on the method of experiment as well as the interviewsand analysis of student reports. There were 185 students (19C22 years old)from Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University and Far Eastern FederalUniversity participating in the study. After the participants had listened to anonline lecture on the topic Neuro-linguistic programming, they were asked tomake a report on the topic of the same name and expand the information. Next,the students were interviewed. The results showed that 89% of students wereinterested in the issue and 69% noted a desire to learn more information on thistopic;100% of participants actively use mobile devices with Internet access foreducational purposes and, in particular, for making the required report. However,only 12% of respondents believe that mobile learning alone can be used in orderto study specialized disciplines at their university. Thus, 43% of students find itdifficult to perceive information from the screen of a smartphone (tablet);61%of students prefer traditional education to mobile learning, which is probablydue to the novelty of this process;65% of respondents noticed that their knowledgeis deteriorating due to the use of mobile (distance) learning. In connectionwith the results obtained, the following recommendations were made to improvethe educational process: to explain to students the importance and usefulnessof the topic under study;to use adequate pedagogical methods in the context ofmobile learning;to provide feedback and the ability to communicate to studentsduring mobile learning;to take into account the personality and learning style of a student;to use all types of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of students inaccordance with specific circumstances. The most popular motivation factors formobile learning are possibility of improving exam grades (65%), possibility ofimproving knowledge (25%), and broadening horizons and deep interest in thetopic (10%). Developing applications that will take into account the needs of aparticular university and specialty will also make a contribution. Teachers arealso encouraged to use a play-based approach and a student reward system inorder to increase the level of motivation (additional points, a simplified examscheme, etc.). The practical significance and prospects for further research arepresented by the opportunities of increasing students motivation in the contextof mobile learning, and, consequently, the success of their studies.

Meniscus allograft transplantation for patients immediately after meniscectomy has not been reported. HYPOTHESIS Compared with the conventional delayed MAT, immediate MAT might provide better clinical results and reduce joint degeneration. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS The study was performed with 18 transplanted menisci (6 medial, 12 lateral) from 16 patients. Eight menisci were transplanted immediately after meniscectomy (IM group); 10 menisci, from patients who complained of knee symptoms at a mean time of 35 months (range, 9-92 months) after total meniscectomy, underwent delayed transplantation (DE group). Fourteen patients undergoing meniscectomy during the same period were included as controls (ME group). Degenerative changes in knee joints were evaluated by plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Allograft extrusion and relative percentage of extrusion were measured on MRI. Other outcome assessments included preoperative and postoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner, and Lysholm scores; visual analog scale (VAS) for pain; and range of motion and isokinetic muscle strength evaluation. RESULTS The mean length of follow-up was 50.8 months (range, 44-62 months) for the IM group, 72.0 months (range, 44-94 months) for the DE group, and 54.3 months (range, 45-62 months) for the ME group. A statistically significant difference in favor of the IM and ME groups was found on the VAS (0.4 [IM group] vs 1.1 [ME group] vs 2.5 [DE group]) and muscle strength (P < .05). The mean IKDC score in the IM group was significantly higher than that in the DE group (93 [range, 85-99] vs 74 [range, 38-95], respectively; P < .05). The IM group showed significantly less preoperative to postoperative cartilage degeneration changes on radiographs and MRI when compared with the DE and ME groups (Kellgren-Lawrence score changes: 0.25 [IM group] vs 1.0 [DE group] vs 1.7 [ME group]; Yulish score changes: 0.25 [IM group] vs 1.0 [DE group] vs 1.1 [ME group]; P < .05). Extrusion of the allograft was observed in the body of the menisci in all patients. No significant difference was found in terms of the Lysholm score, Tegner score, joint narrowing, or meniscus extrusion (P > .05). CONCLUSION Compared with delayed MAT, immediate MAT led to more satisfactory subjective results, less joint degeneration, and less muscle strength deficits. The short-term results of delayed meniscus transplantation were close to those of meniscectomy.","output":"Comparative study on immediate versus delayed meniscus allograft transplantation: 4- to 6-year follow-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Relevant DLA Piper articles published since the previous submission in February","output":"CSLR - EU Update - April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bronchoscopy is an extremely useful diagnostic and therapeutic procedure that finds an invaluable place in Pulmonology practice Due to aerosol generation, bronchoscopy carries a high risk of infection transmission to health care workers and other patients This fact is even more important in the present times of COVID-19 pandemic owing to its droplet- (and possibly aerosol-) mediated spread With this background, a working group extracted literature through electronic search of PubMed and Google Scholar databases All relevant documents were comprehensively reviewed and consensus recommendations formulated based on the level of available evidence Where evidence was insufficient, Usual Practice Points were formulated based on expert opinion This resultant document attempts to present clinical recommendations for performing flexible bronchoscopy in COVID-19 suspect/confirmed patients It outlines important general considerations for bronchoscopy in these cases, provides an algorithmic approach to patient selection for bronchoscopy during these extraordinary times, and enlists critical do's and don'ts that should be followed before, during, and after the procedure To conclude, flexible bronchoscopy must be cautiously performed amid the COVID-19 crisis Judicious case selection and meticulous contact and airborne precautions are important to minimise infection transmission","output":"Flexible bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic: A concise clinical review and practical recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently there are approximately 291,000 people suffering from a spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. SCI is associated with traumatic changes in mobility and neuralgia, as well as many other long-term chronic health complications, including metabolic disorders, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, osteoporosis, and elevated inflammatory markers. Due to medical advances, patients with SCI survive much longer than previously. This increase in life expectancy exposes them to novel neurological complications such as memory loss, cognitive decline, depression, and Alzheimers disease. In fact, these usually age-associated disorders are more prevalent in people living with SCI. A common factor of these disorders is the reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis. Inflammation, which is elevated after SCI, plays a major role in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis. While there is no clear consensus on the mechanism of the decline in hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition after SCI, we will examine in this review how SCI-induced inflammation could modulate hippocampal neurogenesis and provoke age-associated neurological disorders.

The lockdown due to Covid-19 is modeled as a shock that wipes out the physical market, temporarily leaving digital consumption as the only option. Under plausible assumptions on digital demand and supply, the model predicts that such temporary shock produces an irreversible rise of the digital markets. This happens for three distinct reasons. First, by temporarily eliminating the physical market, Covid-19 provides a strong incentive for firms to carry out the fixed investments necessary to venture into the digital market (supply channel). Secondly, by forcing even the most reluctant consumers into the digital market, Covid-19 pushes them to familiarize with digital platforms, and this confidence endures in the post-Covid era (demand channel). Finally, if consumers' taste for digitalization is affected by the size of the digital market, a market may be entrapped into a low-digital equilibrium indefinitely. In such context, the lockdown due to the pandemic is the shock that may unleash the forces of digitalization and tilt the entire sector towards a high-digital equilibrium (network externalities channel).","output":"The Digital Revolution and Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With increasing rise of COVID-19 infected patients in India and worldwide, examining and detecting COVID-19 among such large number of populations is becoming a humongous task for the medical practitioners and civic authorities. RT-PCR, real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique is widely accepted and one of the reliable methods for detection of novel COVID-19.However, being a time consuming, laborious and expensive method for declaring results for the patients in over 6-8 hours to even 3 days in remote places, this technique is not being widely used. The high and very fast spread rate of COVID-19 and low availability of RT-PCR kit, is making the use of computer assisted technologies an inevitable and a potentially faster response mechanism catering to a large population with least human error and a cost-effective solution. Therefore, an intelligent system COVIZONE has been presented, in the proposed work, designed using state of the art pre-trained CNN model to analyze and detect COVID-19 presence in the lungs using Chest X-Ray and CT-Scan Images. In the proposed work, a multi-class classification (Normal, Pneumonic and COVID-19) of patients using ResNet and ResNext CNN model has been done. Both the models show similar performance with high accuracy of 96% and 97% respectively on public dataset of COVID-19, Pneumonia and Normal CXR and CT-Scans.

Of the gammacoronaviruses that mainly infect birds, little is known about the activation of the host immune response. We show that the prototypical Gammacoronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), induces a delayed activation of the IFN response in primary renal cells, tracheal epithelial cells, and a chicken cell line. In fact, Ifn expression is delayed with respect to the peak of viral replication and the accompanying accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In addition, we demonstrate that MDA5 is the primary sensor for Gammacoronavirus infections in chicken cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that accessory proteins 3a and 3b of IBV modulate the response at the transcriptional and translational levels. Finally, we show that, despite the lack of activation of the IFN response during the early phase of IBV infection, the signaling of nonself dsRNA through both MDA5 and TLR3 remains intact in IBV-infected cells. Taken together, this study provides the first comprehensive analysis of host-virus interactions of a Gammacoronavirus with avian innate immune responses. IMPORTANCE Our results demonstrate that IBV has evolved multiple strategies to avoid the activation of the type I interferon response.

But profiles of loneliness during the pandemic and risk factors remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to examine if and how loneliness levels changed during the strict lockdown and to explore the clustering of loneliness growth trajectories. METHODS: Data from 38,217 UK adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a panel study collecting data weekly during the pandemic) were analysed during the strict lockdown period in the UK (23/03/2020C10/05/2020). The sample was well-stratified and weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and geographical location. Growth mixture modelling was used to identify the latent classes of loneliness growth trajectories and their predictors. RESULTS: Analyses revealed four classes, with the baseline loneliness level ranging from low to high. In the first a few weeks of lockdown, loneliness levels increased in the highest loneliness group, decreased in the lowest loneliness group, and stayed relatively constant in the middle two groups. Younger adults (OR = 2.17C6.81), women (OR = 1.59), people with low income (OR = 1.3), the economically inactive (OR = 1.3C2.04) and people with mental health conditions (OR = 5.32) were more likely to be in highest loneliness class relative to the lowest. Further, living with others or in a rural area, and having more close friends or greater social support were protective. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived levels of loneliness under strict lockdown measures due to COVID-19 were relatively stable in the UK, but for many people these levels were high with no signs of improvement.

As for all paramyxoviruses, proteolytic activation of the NiV-F protein is an indispensable prerequisite for viral infectivity. Interestingly, proteolytic activation of NiV-F differs principally from other paramyxoviruses with respect to protease usage (cathepsins instead of trypsin- or furin-like proteases), and the subcellular localization where cleavage takes place (endosomes instead of Golgi or plasma membrane). To allow efficient F protein activation needed for productive virus replication and cell-to-cell fusion, the NiV-F cytoplasmic tail contains a classical tyrosine-based endocytosis signal (Y(525)RSL) that we have shown earlier to be needed for F uptake and proteolytic activation. In this report, we furthermore revealed that an intact endocytosis signal alone is not sufficient for full bioactivity. The very C-terminus of the cytoplasmic tail is needed in addition. Deletions of more than four residues did not affect F uptake or endosomal cleavage but downregulated the surface expression, likely by delaying the intracellular trafficking through endosomal-recycling compartments.

The objective of this study was to gain insight into clinicians initial experiences with the provision of interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation via videoconferencing. DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional design. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve team members (specialists in rehabilitation medicine -MD-, psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists) from a tertiary expertise centre in pain rehabilitation. METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected via a digital survey. Theme-based content analysis was performed for qualitative data. RESULTS: The themes that emerged were: the compulsory context; prerequisites for proper use of videoconferencing methods, which are strongly associated with the clinicians experiences; changes experienced in specific components of pain rehabilitation; and overarching changes experienced, including opportunities and limitations (sub-themes: therapeutic relationship, system involvement, efficiency, hands-on possibilities, interdisciplinary teamwork, and formalities). Overall, clinicians expressed moderate agreement with the statements that the quality of the pain rehabilitation programme can be maintained using videoconferencing, and that the COVID-19 pandemic offers opportunities for growth and innovation in telehealth. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to provide valid and satisfactory pain rehabilitation via videoconferencing. This study identified facilitators and barriers to the use of videoconferencing, and great potential for integrating aspects of telehealth into standard care after the pandemic.","output":"Clinicians Initial Experiences of Transition to Online Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic had an unequal impact on the employment and earnings of different labourers, consequently affecting households per capita income and income inequality. Combining a multisector computable general equilibrium model of China with a micro-simulation approach, this study aims to analyse the unequal effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on Chinas labour market and income inequality. The results confirm the unequal impact of the pandemic on the employment and earnings of different labourer types. Labourers who are female, live in urban areas, and have relatively low education levels would suffer greater losses in employment and earnings. The pandemic would reduce household per capita income by 8.75% for rural residents and 6.13% for urban residents. While the pandemic would have a larger negative impact on the employment and earnings of urban labourers, it would have a greater negative impact on the household per capita income of rural residents. Moreover, the per capita income of low-income households is more vulnerable to the pandemic, and the number of residents living below the poverty line would increase significantly. Thus, the pandemic would aggravate income inequality in China and threaten the livelihoods of poor families.

METHODS A systematic review used MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify published literature from 2005 to 2016 addressing how stakeholders-patients, caregivers, and others-assisted researchers conducting pharmacoepidemiologic research. Three pairs of Workgroup members screened titles and abstracts to select articles for full-text review and analysis. Two Workgroup members abstracted the following data: research focus, characterization and role of stakeholders, and type(s) of engagement strategy employed. Data were summarized descriptively. RESULTS We identified 5717 references for abstract screening. Of these, 69 met the criteria for full-text screening, and 11 were selected for data abstraction. Of these 11 studies, seven focused on the development of a research agenda and eight had stakeholders react or advise on an aspect of the study. Although patients were the most commonly identified stakeholders, advocacy groups and health care professionals were also frequently identified. Some studies reported the engagement of other stakeholders, including local government or policy experts. Engagement strategies varied, with five studies using more than one strategy. Studies often did not indicate the involvement of stakeholders in developing the study design or with implementation.

OBJECTIVE.-: To investigate the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes. DESIGN.-: All suspected cases of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted into one center in Wuhan from January 20 to March 19, 2020, were included. Detailed clinical data of those pregnancies with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS.-: Twenty-seven pregnant women (4 early pregnancies included) with laboratory or clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 24 neonates born to the 23 women in late pregnancy were analyzed. On admission, 46.2% (13 of 27) of the patients had symptoms, including fever (11 of 27), cough (9 of 27), and vomiting (1 of 27). Decreased total lymphocytes count was observed in 81.5% (22 of 27) of patients. Twenty-six patients showed typical viral pneumonia by chest computed tomography scan, whereas 1 patient confirmed with COVID-19 infection showed no abnormality on chest computed tomography. One mother developed severe pneumonia 3 days after her delivery. No maternal or perinatal death occurred. Moreover, 1 early preterm newborn born to a mother with the complication of premature rupture of fetal membranes, highly suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, was SARS-CoV-2 negative after repeated real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. Statistical differences were observed between the groups of women in early and late pregnancy with COVID-19 in the occurrence of lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia.

With available individual patient data reporting on repeatedly SARS-CoV-2 positive (RSP) patients, case reports, and case series were included in this analysis. We performed a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics of repeatedly positive cases. We assessed the cases according to the length of their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative interval between the two episodes. Risk factors for the severity of second episodes were evaluated. Overall, we included 123 patients with repeated positivity from 56 publications, with a mean repeated positivity length of 47.8  29.9 days. Younger patients were predominant in the delayed (>90 days) recurrent positive group. Furthermore, comparing patients with RSP intervals of below 60 and above 60 days, we found that a more severe disease course can be expected if the repeated positivity interval is shorter.

Intensive care unit (ICU) nurses are at risk of burnout and the COVID-19 pandemic may increase this risk. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of burnout risk and identify risk factors among ICU nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Web-based survey performed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in French speaking Belgium. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Risk of burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory scale. RESULTS A total of 1135 ICU nurses responded to the questionnaire. The overall prevalence of burnout risk was 68%. A total of 29% of ICU nurses were at risk of depersonalisation (DP), 31% of reduced personal accomplishment (PA), and 38% of emotional exhaustion (EE). A 1:3 nurse-to-patient ratio increased the risk of EE (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.07-2.95) and DP (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09-2.40). Those who reported having a higher perceived workload during the COVID-19 pandemic were at higher risk for all dimensions of burnout. Shortage of personal protective equipment increased the risk of EE (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.35-3.34) and nurses who reported having symptoms of COVID-19 without being tested were at higher risk of EE (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.68-1.87).

This is particularly concerning for medical students underrepresented in medicine (UIM) due to the potential of widening existing disparities in applicant and workforce composition. To proactively address this, we created a Radiation Oncology Intensive Shadowing Experience (RISE) to expose UIM students to the field of radiation oncology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Key stakeholders within the residency program, including both UIM faculty and residents with experience in health disparities and medical education designed a one-week virtual Radiation Oncology Intensive Shadowing Experience (RISE) intended for fourth year UIM students recruited through established national organizations serving UIM medical students. A one-week disease specific curriculum was developed using four components: 1) foundational exposure to radiation oncology, 2) didactic teaching, 3) mentorship opportunities, and 4) a capstone experience. Mentorship was continuously weaved through the experience by attendings, peer resident mentors and a UIM resident panel to optimize exposure. RESULTS: RISE was successfully initiated at two academic medical centers with twelve UIM students enrolled through August. Anonymized pre- and post- clerkship surveys were developed for students, residents and faculty involved in RISE to evaluate participants satisfaction, resident and attending time burden, and perceptions of program effectiveness.

The pandemic generated by COVID-19 has increased these waiting lists. In this study two objectives were pursued: on the one hand, to determine which are the resources that are determining the number of persons that are in a surgery waiting list per 1,000 inhabitants; on the other hand, to estimate the impact that the current pandemic has on the latter. METHODS To estimate which are the resources that are having a greater impact on the waiting lists and to forecast the effect that the COVID-19 has on them, we use dynamic panel data models. The data on the surgery resources and on the waiting lists by autonomous communities is obtained from the Surveys on Health, Hospital Statistics and reports on waiting lists of the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Well Being and the Counsels. The sample period is 2012-2017 (last published year for surgery resources). In addition, a literature review is conducted and it shows the important and complexity of waiting list like a gestion tool of health system (Science, SciELO and Dialnet web data bases). RESULTS COVID-19 will increase the waiting lists by approximately 7.6% to 19.14%, depending on the autonomous community. Not all the available surgery resources have the same relevance nor an equal effect on the reduction of the waiting lists. The most significant resources are the beds and operating rooms per 1,000 inhabitants. The hospital expenditure is not so relevant.

We collected clinical and demographic data of patients who were newly diagnosed with lung cancer at our hospital between February 2019 and July 2020. Overall, 387 patients with lung cancer were divided into two groups for analysis: epidemic group (from February to July 2020) and pre-epidemic group (from February to July 2019). The source of diagnosis and clinical characteristics of the two groups were analysed. T-test and Mann-Whitney U were used for continuous variables, and Chi-squared or Fishers exact test for categorical variable. We found that during the epidemic period, 110 cases of lung cancer were incidentally diagnosed during COVID-19 screening, accounting for 47.6% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer cases at our hospital. The proportions of patients who were diagnosed based on symptoms and physical examination in the epidemic group were 34.2 and 18.2%, respectively, while that in the pre-epidemic group were 41.7 and 58.3%, respectively. There was significant difference in the source of diagnosis between the two groups. In a subgroup analysis of the epidemic group, the average tumour volume of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 screening was significantly smaller than that of the patients diagnosed with symptoms and physical examination.

METHODS: While for PCR diagnostics the validation of a PCR assay is well established, there is no common validation strategy for antigen tests, including RDT. In this proof-of-principle study we present the establishment of a panel of 50 pooled clinical specimens that cover a SARS-CoV-2 concentration range from 1.1  10(9) to 420 genome copies per mL of specimen. The panel was used to evaluate 31 RDT in up to six laboratories. RESULTS: Our results show that there is considerable variation in the detection limits and the clinical sensitivity of different RDT. We show that the best RDT can be applied to reliably identify infectious individuals who present with SARS-CoV-2 loads down to 10(6) genome copies per mL of specimen. For the identification of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2 loads corresponding to less than 10(6) genome copies per mL, only three RDT showed a clinical sensitivity of more than 60%.

During chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection however, excessive production of MCP-1 has been linked to disease pathogenesis. High MCP-1 serum levels are detected during the viremic phase of CHIKV infection and correlate with the virus titre. In vitro CHIKV infection was also shown to stimulate MCP-1 production in whole blood; yet the role and the mechanism of MCP-1 production upon infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells remain unknown. Here we found that active CHIKV infection stimulated production of MCP-1 in monocytes. Importantly however, we found that communication with other leukocytes is crucial to yield MCP-1 by monocytes upon CHIKV infection. Indeed, blocking interferon-/ receptor or the JAK1/JAK2 signalling downstream of the receptor abolished CHIKV-mediated MCP-1 production. Additionally, we show that despite the apparent correlation between IFN type I, CHIKV replication and MCP-1, modulating the levels of the chemokine did not influence CHIKV infection. In summary, our data disclose the complexity of MCP-1 regulation upon CHIKV infection and point to a crucial role of IFN in the chemokine secretion.

A 54-year-old man presented with left persistent tinnitus of 4 months' duration. Cerebral angiography revealed a Borden type II left lateral tentorial sinus-DAVF associated with retrograde cortical venous reflux draining into the vein of Labb. In the venous phase, the ipsilateral transverse-sigmoid sinus was recognized as a functional sinus and the posterior temporal vein drained into the transverse sinus near the drainage channel. We planned to perform transarterial Onyx embolization using a short-length sinus protection balloon to protect against Onyx migration. During transarterial Onyx injection, a 7  7-mm HyperForm balloon was navigated into the affected sinus and positioned to cover the drainage channel from the shunt. After confirming the change in Borden classification with angiography, transarterial Onyx embolization was performed via the middle meningeal artery. This procedure resulted in complete obliteration of the fistula with good patency of both the transverse-sigmoid sinus and neighboring normal cortical veins. No procedure-related complications were observed and the patient remained free of recurrence during the 24-month follow-up period.

At present, the researchers focus on possibility to use IVM in treatment of certain forms of cancer and viral diseases such as COVID-19. The mechanisms of IVM action are not clear. It is assumed that IVM affects chloride channels and increases cytoplasmic concentration of chloride. This study examines the effect of IVM on chloride currents induced by glycine (I(Gly)). Experiments were carried out on isolated pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus with whole-cell patch clamp. A short-term (600 msec) application of IVM in a concentration of 10 M induced a slow inward current, which persisted after washing the neurons. The low concentrations (0.1-1000 nM) of IVM did not induce any novel current, but it rapidly and reversibly reduced the peak amplitude and accelerated desensitization of I(Gly) in a dose-dependent manner. The threshold concentrations of IVM sufficient to reduce peak amplitude of I(Gly) and to accelerate desensitization of I(Gly) were 100 nM and 0.1 nM, respectively.

While some concurrent-object operations are designed to behave atomically, each witnessing the atomic effects of predecessors in a linearization order, others forego such strong consistency to avoid complex control and synchronization bottlenecks. For example, contains (value) methods of key-value maps may iterate through key-value entries without blocking concurrent updates, to avoid unwanted performance bottlenecks, and consequently overlook the effects of some linearization-order predecessors. While such weakly-consistent operations may not be atomic, they still offer guarantees, e.g., only observing values that have been present. In this work we develop a methodology for proving that concurrent object implementations adhere to weak-consistency specifications. In particular, we consider (forward) simulation-based proofs of implementations against relaxed-visibility specifications, which allow designated operations to overlook some of their linearization-order predecessors, i.e., behaving as if they never occurred. Besides annotating implementation code to identify linearization points, i.e., points at which operations logical effects occur, we also annotate code to identify visible operations, i.e., operations whose effects are observed; in practice this annotation can be done automatically by tracking the writers to each accessed memory location. We formalize our methodology over a general notion of transition systems, agnostic to any particular programming language or memory model, and demonstrate its application, using automated theorem provers, by verifying models of Java concurrent object implementations.","output":"Verifying Visibility-Based Weak Consistency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Investigations on the concordance in monozygotic (MZ) as compared to dizygotic (DZ) twins may reveal if there is a genetic component increasing the susceptibility or resistance against an infectious disease.

The curriculum that should be used for standardized Japanese post-graduate training has long been debated. Multiple studies show that post-graduate trainees who trained with CRPs were more satisfied and confident and gained more clinical experience than those who trained with LRPs. However, a comparison of objective measurements of the clinical knowledge of Japanese post-graduate trainees has not been reported. The aim of this study is to objectively measure and compare the clinical knowledge of trainees in CRPs and LRPs using a component of the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board test (PLAB test). METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted in February and March 2020. Post-graduate trainees who graduated from medical school were voluntarily recruited from general hospitals in Japan. To objectively measure the trainees basic clinical knowledge, the PLAB test was adapted from the UK. The cut-off point was set at 63%, as recommended by the UK General Medical Council. A statistical analysis was conducted to determine whether post-graduate programme differences contributed to the trainees test scores. RESULTS: Twenty-two facilities volunteered to participate after recruitment, and 97 trainees from 19 facilities participated in the study. Thirty-one participants (32%) were in a CRP, and 66 participants (68%) were in an LRP. According to multiple logistic regression, the adjusted odds ratio of CRP trainees being in the high-scoring group was 5.16 (95% CI: 1.28-20.73, p<0.05). Mean differences in the scores in paediatrics, mental health and neurology were statistically higher among CRP trainees than LRP trainees. CONCLUSION: Post-graduate trainees who were in a CRP had better basic clinical competence knowledge (PLAB test) scores and performed better when tested in a wider range of subspecialties.

This vision required a growing Russian presence regionally and globally, which in turn necessitated restoration of Russian military power. It resulted in growing self-confidence, internal repressions, and external military interventionism.

This sudden conversion has led to changes in the patterns of knowledge sharing (from teachers to students and among students). The aim of this paper is to investigate how universities may benefit from experiences of businesses that were also forced to use remote forms of business operations. Large companies, operating in the international context may be a valuable source of information on how to improve knowledge sharing processes among university students and between students and teachers. Methodology: The paper uses a qualitative research method (in-depth interviews) to explore the possibilities of knowledge sharing improvements at the university-level teaching, based on the experiences elicited in the business sector. The theoretical sampling was used to find informants familiar with both transition to remote teaching and shift to online business operations forced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Interviews were conducted with experienced managers participating in an MBA programme. During the outburst of the COVID-19 pandemic the programme has been switched to a remote mode. At the same time, the interviewed managers had to cope with the transition to remote mode at work. Their work-related ordeals were contrasted and compared with their university-related experiences regarding knowledge sharing. Conclusions and recommendations have been formulated on the basis of evidence gathered during the interviews. Research limitations: This paper is of an exploratory character. The triangulation of findings presented here is limited. The sample consists of participants of one MBA programme only, hence the conclusions cannot be generalised. At this stage the paper may serve as a basis for further development. Practical implications: The paper presents possible improvements to be introduced by academia in the remote mode teaching. Business sector and especially large businesses may offer experience-based solutions that allow to boost knowledge sharing processes among students and increase the efficiency of knowledge sharing between teachers and students. Originality/value: The topic of the paper is very up-to-date and of considerable significance. Knowledge sharing processes at the university-level teaching have been significantly distorted by the COVID-19 pandemic outburst. Using experiences from the business sector can be very helpful in this regard. ? The Authors, 2021.

Next, real-world evaluations followed supporting biomarker guided management of AKI in clinical practice. Also, proposals for better nephrotoxin management, a major modifiable exposure to prevent AKI, were provided with the foresight in identifying high-risk patients.

Delirium and POCD are each associated with decreased quality of life, early retirement, increased 1-year mortality, and long-term cognitive decline. Multiple investigators have thus suggested that anesthesia and surgery place severe stress on the aging brain, and that patients with less ability to withstand this stress will be at increased risk for developing postoperative delirium and POCD. Delirium and POCD risk are increased in patients with lower preoperative cognitive function, yet preoperative cognitive function is not routinely assessed, and no intraoperative physiological predictors have been found that correlate with lower preoperative cognitive function. Since general anesthesia causes alpha-band (8-12 Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) power to decrease occipitally and increase frontally (known as \\"anteriorization\\"), and anesthetic-induced frontal alpha power is reduced in older adults, we hypothesized that lower intraoperative frontal alpha power might correlate with lower preoperative cognitive function. Here, we provide evidence that such a correlation exists, suggesting that lower intraoperative frontal alpha power could be used as a physiological marker to identify older adults with lower preoperative cognitive function. Lower intraoperative frontal alpha power could thus be used to target these at-risk patients for possible therapeutic interventions to help prevent postoperative delirium and POCD, or for increased postoperative monitoring and follow-up. More generally, these results suggest that understanding interindividual differences in how the brain responds to anesthetic drugs can be used as a probe of neurocognitive function (and dysfunction), and might be a useful measure of neurocognitive function in older adults.","output":"Intraoperative Frontal Alpha-Band Power Correlates with Preoperative Neurocognitive Function in Older Adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) has been used to treat different residual solid tumors after tumor removal and has shown many advantages over other treatment methods.

With medical histories taken beforehand, 8 of these patients were diagnosed with Masaoka stage IIA and 6 with Masaoka stage IIB; furthermore, 5 of the patients were diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG). INTRABEAM radiation (8-10 Gy, low energy) was delivered to the postoperative tumor bed of each patient during surgery. The intra- and postoperative complications were observed and evaluated, and the improvement in symptoms was assessed. An additional 23 patients with stage II thymoma undergoing radical surgery from April to August 2016 were chosen as the control group.One month after the operation, only 1 patient in the IORT group had cough, increased levels of leucocytes and neutrophils, and pulmonary inflammation on chest computed tomography. Reactive inflammation and pleural effusion in the 2 groups were similar (P > .05). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the improvement of myasthenia gravis (P > .05). Postoperative chest computed tomography and routine blood examination at 3 and 12 months showed that all the patients recovered, with normal hemogram levels and no pulmonary fibrosis around the radiation field.

Further, large amount of confidential and personal medical records is often stored on cloud environments. However, outsourcing medical data possibly brings the great security and privacy issue, since the confidential records are shared to the third party.

For watermark embedding, the maximum entropy component of X-Ray carrier image is firstly decomposed using NSCT. Then, low and high frequency details of carrier and mark image is obtained using MSVD. Further, conceal the watermark detail through modifying the detail of carrier image via the suitable factor. Finally, Shamir's (k, n) secret sharing algorithm is employed to obtain secure marked carrier image.

No significant difference was observed in the percentage of patients achieving 40% T > MIC between the different infusion modes with the same dosage, although the two-step groups exhibited a significantly shorter T(max) compared with the extended groups (0.5 g q6h: 1.5  0.8 vs. 2.0  0.0 h; 1.0 g q8h: 1.0  0.6 vs. 2.0  0.0 h; both, p < 0.05). All four groups achieved 40% T > MIC when MIC was 0.5C4.0 g/ml, but only regimens with a higher dose (1.0 g q8h) achieved target when MIC was 8 g/ml. CONCLUSION: The two-step and extended regimens of imipenem are comparable to the PK/PD target in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock. A higher dose (1.0 g q8h) should be considered for target achievement at an MIC of > 8 g/ml. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02616354.

Existing methods for detecting and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 infection are typically based on viral genome detection or measuring COVID-19-specific antibody levels. Despite their value, these methods are unable to predict disease outcomes in patients. Given the critical role of innate immune cells, particularly natural killer (NK) cells, in antiviral defense, this study sought to determine the prognostic value of serum secretory MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (sMICA) levels as an essential ligand for the NKG2D receptor, the master regulator of NK cell development and responsiveness. Serum MICA levels were measured by ELISA assay. Sera (n = 60) from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were collected, and disease severity was determined using clinical criteria. The patient group included 30 patients with mild disease and 30 severely ill patients, as well as 30 healthy controls. Our findings revealed that serum MICA levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls, especially in cases with severe complications (P < .0001). Higher serum MICA levels may be associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19 and may serve as a marker of clinical severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, particularly when clinical manifestations are insufficient to make a confident prediction.","output":"Prognostic Value of Serum MICA Levels as a Marker of Severity in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The specifics of the current state of the meat market in China are largely determined, like the vast majority of production-consumption relationships in global socio-economic processes, by the current organizational constraints aimed at preventing the spread of the COVID-19 disease.

It is unclear if pandemic-related risk mitigation behaviors (e.g., limiting attendance at social gatherings, mask wearing) influence social isolation. We leveraged data from 9,514 patients with cancer, or at high risk for cancer, from Moffitt Cancer Center to examine whether social isolation is associated with sociodemographic factors and risk mitigation behaviors. Eligible patients who had an appointment at the cancer center in the past five years, reported an email address, and had consented to the institutional biobanking protocol were invited to complete a survey regarding demographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors as well as social isolation measured using the 4-item PROMIS Social Isolation scale. The raw PROMIS score was converted to a T-score and was split at 50, the average for the general U.S. population, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression was performed. Behavioral factors were measured on a Likert scale, ranging from never or not at all, to very often or a lot, and were evaluated continuously. Most participants were female (60.5%), Non-Hispanic White (90.3%), and had been diagnosed with cancer (89.6%);mean age was 64 years old. Only 3.5% reported ever testing positive for COVID-19, and 4.6% reported currently smoking. In univariable models, younger age, women, current smokers, and Hispanic ethnicity or Non-White race were associated with higher odds of social isolation. Among risk mitigation behaviors, leaving the house less often, attending social gatherings less often, a greater change in day-to-day life due to the pandemic, less physical contact with others outside their home, and wearing a mask more often were also associated with increased odds of social isolation. In the multivariable model including significant univariate factors, older patients (OR, per one year: 0.97;95%CI: 0.97-0.98) and males (OR, vs. females: 0.64;95%CI: 0.58-0.71) had lower odds of social isolation.

HV and RCC patients underwent a randomised, controlled, 4-way cross-over study comparing the effect of 4 interventions on capsaicin evoked coughing and UTC. The interventions comprised immersing a hand in i) noxious cold-water, ii) warm water, iii) warm water but instructed to voluntarily supress coughing and iv) no intervention. The co-primary outcomes were numbers of evoked coughs and UTC scores.Twenty HV (mean age 50.1(SD14.2), M:F 10:10) and 20 RCC (age 60.1(7.9), M:F 9:11) participated.

The ability to evaluate functional status of COVID-19 survivors early on at ICU and hospital discharge can help minimize ICU-acquired weakness, promote rapid functional recovery, and improve quality of life Methods: The modified Mental Status, ICU Mobility, and Barthel Index scores at ICU and hospital discharge were tabulated for 118 COVID-19 survivors treated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). These functional scores were compared with pre-admission functional status, discharge durable medical equipment, discharge medical follow-up recommendation, duration on IMV, duration post IMV, demographics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, and vital signs at ICU and hospital discharge. Results: The majority of COVID-19 IMV patients were not functionally independent at hospital discharge (22% discharged with cane or rolling walker, 49% discharged with durable medical equipment, and 14% admitted to a rehabilitation facility), although they were prior to COVID-19 illness. Half of the patients were discharged with supplemental oxygen equipment. The most prevalent medical follow-up recommendations were cardiology, vascular medicine, pulmonology, endocrinology, and neurology with many patients receiving multiple medical follow-up recommendations.

METHODS: Prospective observational cohort of 211 patients (118 women, mean age 65 years, range: 18 to 99) hospitalized for COVID-19. All patients were tested for LA at admission and retested six months after discharge. RESULTS: The LA test was positive in 128 patients (60.7%). The survival probability at 31 days was clearly worse in the LA-positive group (60%) than in the LA-negative group (90%) (P = 0.023). This notable difference in survival was confirmed by multivariate analysis (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.04C14.5, P = 0.04). However, it was not explained by differences in thrombotic events (three in either group, P = 0.6).

A hyperinflammatory state has been theorized to be the driving factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19. We discuss the case of a patient who received sarilumab for severe Covid infection and later developed CMV pneumonitis. IL- 6 inhibitors have been associated with secondary bacterial infections;however, the data on secondary viral and atypical infections are limited. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old male with no known past medical history presented to the hospital with complaints of worsening cough and shortness of breath. The patient was found to be COVID positive 3 days prior to presentation. CT chest on admission showed extensive peripheral ground-glass and consolidative lung opacities. Treatment with Decadron and Remdesivir was initiated.On hospital day 9, the patient had worsening respiratory status requiring up to 40 liters of vapotherm at 100% FiO2. After ruling out superimposed bacterial infection, he was treated with Sarilumab 400mg for worsening acute hypoxemic respiratory failure felt to be due to a hyperimmune syndrome from COVID-19. 10 days following treatment with Sarilumab, the patient's CRP normalized and his oxygen requirement decreased, he eventually weaned down to 5L nasal cannula.On hospital day 27, the patient again developed acute respiratory distress requiring intubation. A repeat chest CT showed evolving ground-glass and consolidative opacities with new basilar predominant traction bronchiectasis and architectural distortion. Additional lab testing revealed, CMV IgG >10 ( 0.00-0.59 U/ml) CMV IgM of 37.2 (0.0-29.9 AU/ml), CMV PCR DNA of 325000 ( not detected), and negative fungitell. Samples from bronchoalveolar lavage showed a CMV PCR of 46500 IU/ml ( not detected). Treatment with ganciclovir 5mg/kg q12h was initiated. Following treatment, the patient had progressive improvement in respiratory status, was weaned from the ventilator, and eventually discharged from the hospital. DISCUSSION: Cytokine storm is thought to play a key role in the lung injury seen in COVID 19 and IL-6 is essential in the propagation of cytokine Storm. There is an ongoing concern for bacterial infections in the setting of IL-6 inhibitors but the data on viral infections in this setting is limited. Van Duin et al describes a case of CMV reactivation in the setting of treatment with tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient developed fever and shortness of breath following the 2nd infusion of tocilizumab. A CT scan of the chest showed pneumonitis. Labs were significant for viremia on CMV PCR and positive CMV IgG. The patient had improvement after treatment with ganciclovir, similar to our case. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse effects of IL-6 inhibitors are not fully understood. Based on our limited experience we recommend checking CMV IgG before initiation of IL-6 inhibitors.

Methods: Study population included 512 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals of the Attica region of Greece. Patients demographic characteristics, comorbidities, allergies, previous vaccination for seasonal influenza virus, admission to ICU, intubation, and death were recorded. Potential predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified by regression analysis. Results: The mean age of hospitalized patients was 60.4 years, and was higher in patients who deceased. The most common comorbidities were respiratory diseases, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, dyslipidemia, mental health diseases, asthma, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The need for ICU care and intubation was significantly higher among patients who died. The mortality rate was 15.8% (81 out of 512). Age []65 years, cancer, chronic kidney disease, endocrine diseases, central nervous system disorders, anemia, and intubation were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality, while allergies and previous influenza vaccination were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality.

Among those, 23 (22.8%) presented with subjective worsening of psychiatric symptomatology during the COVID-19 outbreak. In this group, the most frequent symptom was depression (82.6%), followed by insomnia (52.2%). Subjective worsening of neurological symptoms (Wald = 24.03, df = 1, p = 0.001) and lifetime irritability (Wald = 6.35, df = 1, p = 0.020), together with younger age (Wald = 5.06, df = 1, p = 0.038) and female sex (Wald = 9.07 df = 1, p = 0.007), resulted as specific risk factors for ingravescence of psychiatric presentation. Lifetime pre-existing delusions, having received antipsychotics, and not having received mood stabilizer were also associated with subjective worsening of psychiatric symptomatology due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Individuals with PD and lifetime history of psychiatric symptoms may be exposed to increased vulnerability to the stressful effect of COVID-19 outbreak. Interventions aimed at reducing irritability and mood instability might have an indirect effect on the health of patients with PD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and Psychiatric Symptoms: The Impact on Parkinson's Disease in the Elderly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the volatility transmission across stocks, gold and crude oil markets before and during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis. Design/methodology/approach: A multivariate vector autoregression (VAR)-Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model (BEKK-GARCH) is used to assess volatility transmission across the examined markets. The sample is divided as follows. The first period ranging from 02/01/2019 to 10/03/2020 defines the pre-COVID-19 crisis. The second period is from 11/03/2020 to 05/10/2020, representing the COVID-19 crisis period. Then, a robustness test is used using exponential GARCH models after including an exogenous variable capturing the growth of COVID-19 confirmed death cases worldwide with the aim to test the accuracy of the VAR-BEKK-GARCH estimated results. Findings: Results indicate that the interconnectedness among the examined market has been intensified during the COVID-19 crisis, proving the lack of hedging opportunities. It is also found that stocks and Gold markets lead the crude oil market especially during the COVID-19 crisis, which explains the freefall of the crude oil price during the health crisis. Similarly, results show that Gold is most likely to act as a diversifier rather than a hedging tool during the current health crisis. Originality/value: Although the recent studies in the field focused on analyzing the relationships between different markets during the first quarter of 2020, this study considers a larger data set with the aim to assess the volatility transmission across the examined international markets Amid the COVID-19 crisis, while it shows the most significant impact on various financial markets compared to other diseases. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Volatility transmission across international markets amid COVID 19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The visualization and assessment of retinal microvasculature are important in the study, diagnosis, monitoring, and guidance of treatment of ocular and systemic diseases. With the introduction of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), it has become possible to visualize the retinal microvasculature volumetrically and without a contrast agent. Many lab-based and commercial clinical instruments, imaging protocols and data analysis methods and metrics, have been applied, often inconsistently, resulting in a confusing picture that represents a major barrier to progress in applying OCTA to reduce the burden of disease. Open data and software sharing, and cross-comparison and pooling of data from different studies are rare. These inabilities have impeded building the large databases of annotated OCTA images of healthy and diseased retinas that are necessary to study and define characteristics of specific conditions. This paper addresses the steps needed to standardize OCTA imaging of the human retina to address these limitations. Through review of the OCTA literature, we identify issues and inconsistencies and propose minimum standards for imaging protocols, data analysis methods, metrics, reporting of findings, and clinical practice and, where this is not possible, we identify areas that require further investigation. We hope that this paper will encourage the unification of imaging protocols in OCTA, promote transparency in the process of data collection, analysis, and reporting, and facilitate increasing the impact of OCTA on retinal healthcare delivery and life science investigations.","output":"Towards standardizing retinal optical coherence tomography angiography: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is locally synthesized in taste bud cells and that GLP-1 receptor exists on the gustatory nerves in close proximity to GLP-1-containing taste bud cells. This local paracrine GLP-1 signalling seems to be specifically involved in the perception of sweets. However, the role of GLP-1 in taste perception remains largely unaddressed in clinical studies. Whether any weight-reducing effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists are mediated through the modulation of taste perception is currently unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an investigator-initiated, randomized single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. We will enrol 30 women with obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either semaglutide 1.0 mg or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary endpoints are alteration of transcriptomic profile of tongue tissue as changes in expression level from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks of treatment, measured by RNA sequencing, and change in taste sensitivity as detected by chemical gustometry. Secondary endpoints include change in neural response to visual food cues and to sweet-tasting substances as assessed by functional MRI, change in body weight, change in fat mass and change in eating behaviour and food intake. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to investigate the role of semaglutide on taste perception, along with a neural response to visual food cues in reward processing regions. The study may identify the tongue and the taste perception as a novel target for GLP-1 receptor agonists.

While analysis of nasal and throat swabs from patients is the main way to detect COVID-19, analyzing chest images could offer an alternative method to hospitals, where health care personnel and testing kits are scarce. Deep learning (DL), in particular, has shown impressive levels of performance when analyzing medical images, including those related to COVID-19 pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to perform a systematic review with a meta-analysis of relevant studies to quantify the performance of DL algorithms in the automatic stratification of COVID-19 patients using chest images. METHODS: A search strategy for use in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science was developed, where we searched for articles published between January 1 and April 25, 2020. We used the key terms \\"COVID-19,\\" or \\"coronavirus,\\" or \\"SARS-CoV-2,\\" or \\"novel corona,\\" or \\"2019-ncov,\\" and \\"deep learning,\\" or \\"artificial intelligence,\\" or \\"automatic detection.\\" Two authors independently extracted data on study characteristics, methods, risk of bias, and outcomes. Any disagreement between them was resolved by consensus. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which included 5896 chest images from COVID-19 patients. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the DL models in detecting COVID-19 were 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.95) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.96-0.97), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98. The positive likelihood, negative likelihood, and diagnostic odds ratio were 19.02 (95% CI 12.83-28.19), 0.06 (95% CI 0.04-0.10), and 368.07 (95% CI 162.30-834.75), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing other types of pneumonia from COVID-19 were 0.93 (95% CI 0.92-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.95), respectively. The performance of radiologists in detecting COVID-19 was lower than that of the DL models; however, the performance of junior radiologists was improved when they used DL-based prediction tools. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings show that DL models have immense potential in accurately stratifying COVID-19 patients and in correctly differentiating them from patients with other types of pneumonia and normal patients. Implementation of DL-based tools can assist radiologists in correctly and quickly detecting COVID-19 and, consequently, in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Application of Artificial Intelligence for Screening COVID-19 Patients Using Digital Images: Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sport is often utilized as a tool by governments and nation-states in building a favorable international image, seeking external political legitimacy, and strengthening nation-building endeavors across borders Given its universal appeal, sport is often perceived as a valuable soft power asset for conveying positive messages to foreign publics Against this backdrop, the present study aims to introduce the sports diplomacy approach of Hungary, specifically focusing on the state-led utilization of sport in public diplomacy under the recent government of Viktor Orbn (2010C2020) With the institutionalization of sport in public diplomacy, Hungary has become a pioneering country in Central and Eastern Europe that can provide an example for other nation-states in the region The Hungarian governments sports diplomacy ambitions have not been curbed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the country continues to invest large amounts of public funding in attracting and organizing international sporting competitions Hosting the Summer Olympic Games in Budapest remains the ultimate goal of the current governments sports diplomacy strategy, which focuses on elite sport","output":"Sport as a tool for public diplomacy in Hungary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The search for sensitive and specific markers enabling timely identification of patients with a life-threat-ening novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is important for a successful treatment.

An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management. OBJECTIVES Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'. MAIN RESULTS We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta2-agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta2-agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta2-agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta2-agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.","output":"Interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children: an overview of Cochrane Reviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to evaluate the preparedness of retirement and nursing homes in the city of Sassari at the end of the first wave of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic, first by investigating the risk perception of epidemic outbreaks by the facility managers and subsequently by carrying out a field assessment of these facilities To perform the field assessment, a checklist developed by the CDC (Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Tool for Nursing Homes Preparing for COVID-19) and adapted to the Italian context was used Fourteen facilities took part in the survey (87 5%) The application of good practices for each survey area was expressed as a percentage with the following median values: restriction policies (87 5%), staff training (53 8%), resident training (67 6%), availability of personal protective equipment (41 7%), infection control practices (73 5%) and communication (80%) Among the facilities, considerable variability was observed in these evaluation fields: only the restriction policies and communication activities were applied uniformly A discrepancy was found between perceived risk and real danger in the facilities, requiring targeted communication actions At present, it is necessary to promote a new approach based on the prediction of critical events, thereby providing the means to effectively address them","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Epidemics in Retirement and Nursing Homes in Italy: A New Preparedness Assessment Model after the First Epidemic Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The crude mortality rate in critical pneumonia cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reaches 49%. This study aimed to test whether levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in combination with D-dimer were predictors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. The clinical characteristics of 305 COVID-19 patients were analysed and were compared between the survivor and non-survivor groups. Of the 305 patients, 85 (27.9%) died and 220 (72.1%) were discharged from hospital. Compared with discharged cases, non-survivor cases were older and their BUN and D-dimer levels were significantly higher (P < 0.0001). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable Cox regression analyses identified BUN and D-dimer levels as independent risk factors for poor prognosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated levels of BUN and D-dimer were associated with increased mortality (log-rank, P < 0.0001).

Recent observations suggest it could act via S1P(1)/S1P(5)-dependent anti-inflammatory and pro-myelination effects on CNS-resident cells. OBJECTIVE: Generate preclinical evidence confirming siponimod's CNS penetration and activity. METHODS: Siponimod's CNS penetration and distribution was explored in rodents and non-human primates (NHPs) using: Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) using (14)C-radiolabeled siponimod or non-invasive single-photon emission CT (SPECT) with a validated (123)I-radiolabeled siponimod analog. Functional CNS activity was investigated by S1P(1) receptor quantification in brain homogenates. RESULTS: In mice/rats, siponimod treatments achieved dose-dependent efficacy and dose-proportional increase in drug blood levels, with mean brain/blood drug-exposure ratio ((Brain/Blood)DER) of 6C7. Efficacy in rat brain tissues was revealed by a dose-dependent reduction in brain S1P(1) levels. QWBA distribution analysis in rats indicated that [(14)C]siponimod related radioactivity could readily penetrate CNS, with particularly high uptakes in white matter of cerebellum, corpus callosum, and medulla oblongata versus lower exposures in other areas such as olfactory bulb. SPECT monitoring in NHPs revealed CNS distribution with a (brain/blood)DER of 6, as in rodents.

Although previously thought to mediate protection solely in the extracellular environment, recent research has revealed that antibody-mediated protection extends to the cytosolic compartment of cells. This postentry viral defense mechanism requires binding of the antibody to a cytosolic Fc receptor named tripartite motif containing 21 (TRIM21). In contrast to other Fc receptors, TRIM21 shows remarkably broad isotype specificity as it does not only bind IgG but also IgM and IgA. When viral pathogens coated with these antibody isotypes enter the cytosol, TRIM21 is rapidly recruited and efficient neutralization occurs before the virus has had the time to replicate. In addition, inflammatory signaling is induced. As such, TRIM21 acts as a cytosolic sensor that engages antibodies that have failed to protect against infection in the extracellular environment. Here, we summarize our current understanding of how TRIM21 orchestrates humoral immunity in the cytosolic environment.","output":"TRIM21: a cytosolic Fc receptor with broad antibody isotype specificity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of July 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has over 17 million reported cases, causing more than 667,000 deaths. Countries irrespective of economic status have succumbed to this pandemic. Many aspects of the lives, including health, economy, freedom of movement have been negatively affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Numerous strategies have been taken in order to prevent the outbreak. Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale lockdown, while others took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics, for example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings, restricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown strategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social interactions between the people are primarily affected by the lockdown, psychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting the South American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the impact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the Spanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology approach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33 million feeds in order to understand people's interaction over the months of this on-going coronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the beginning of the pandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) which declined over time even though the actual pandemic is worsening by having more positive cases, and inflicting more deaths.

PARTICIPANTS: Symptomatic, nonhospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or probable COVID-19 and high-risk exposure within 4 days of symptom onset. INTERVENTION: Oral hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days) or masked placebo. Measures: Symptoms and severity at baseline and then at days 3, 5, 10, and 14 using a 10-point visual analogue scale. The primary end point was change in overall symptom severity over 14 days. RESULTS: Of 491 patients randomly assigned to a group, 423 contributed primary end point data. Of these, 341 (81%) had laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or epidemiologically linked exposure to a person with laboratory-confirmed infection; 56% (236 of 423) were enrolled within 1 day of symptoms starting.

Globalisation is under significant threat as governments scramble to reduce their vulnerability to the virus by limiting global trade and flows of people. With the imposition of border closures and strict migration measures, there have been major disruptions in Africas global supply chains with adverse impacts on employment and poverty. The African economies overly reliant on single export-orientated industries, such as oil and gas, are expected to be severely hit. This situation is further aggravated by tumbling oil prices and a lowered global demand for African non-oil products. The agricultural sector, which should buffer these shocks, is also being affected by the enforcement of lockdowns which threaten peoples livelihoods and food security. Lockdowns may not be the answer in Africa and the issue of public health pandemic response will need to be addressed by enacting context-specific policies which should be implemented in a humane way. In addressing the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on African nations, we argue that governments should prioritize social protection programmes to provide people with resources to maintain economic productivity while limiting job losses.

All patients underwent: i), 1.5T CMR with pre and post contrast T1 mapping sequence and ECV computation; ii), serum quantification of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and iii), myocardial biopsies were collected during surgery to assess collagen volume fraction (CVF). Patients with coronary artery disease were excluded. Correlation between native T1, ECV, CVF and serum biomarkers were assessed using Pearson correlation test. Agreement between basal anteroseptal ECV with global ECV was assessed using Bland-Altman test. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, 16 with aortic stenosis and 5 with aortic regurgitation were included. There were 12 men and 9 women with a mean age of 74.16.8 (SD) years (range: 32-84 years). Mean global ECV value was 26.72.7 (SD) % (range: 23.4-32.5%) and mean CVF value was 12.49.7% (range: 3.2-25.7%). ECV assessed at the basal anteroseptal segment correlated moderately with CVF (r=0.6; P=0.0026). There was a strong correlation and agreement between basal anteroseptal ECV and global ECV, (r=0.8; P<0.0001; bias 5.46.1%) but no correlation between global ECV and CVF (r=0.5; P=0.10).

We assessed the short-term impact of a COVID-19 immunization program with varying constraints on population health and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) needs. METHODS: A SARS-CoV-2 transmission model was calibrated to French epidemiological data. We defined several vaccine implementation scenarios starting in January 2021 based on timing of discontinuation of NPIs, supply and uptake constraints, and their relaxation. We assessed the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations averted, the need for and number of days with NPIs in place over the 2021C2022 period. RESULTS: An immunisation program under constraints could reduce the burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 9C40% if the vaccine prevents against infections. Relaxation of constraints not only reduces further COVID-19 hospitalizations (30C39% incremental reduction), it also allows for NPIs to be discontinued post-2021 (0 days with NPIs in 2022 versus 11 to 125 days for vaccination programs under constraints and 327 in the absence of vaccination). CONCLUSION: For 2021, COVID-19 control is expected to rely on a combination of NPIs and the outcome of early immunisation programs. The ability to overcome supply and uptake constraints will help prevent the need for further NPIs post-2021. As the programs expand, efficiency assessments will be needed to ensure optimisation of control policies post-emergency use.","output":"Potential impact of introducing vaccines against COVID-19 under supply and uptake constraints in France: A modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a novel virus that causes infection in both the upper respiratory tract and the lungs.

In this paper, deep-learning-based approaches, namely deep feature extraction, fine-tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN), and end-to-end training of a developed CNN model, have been used in order to classify COVID-19 and normal (healthy) chest X-ray images. For deep feature extraction, pretrained deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and VGG19) were used. For classification of the deep features, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier was used with various kernel functions, namely Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, and Gaussian. The aforementioned pretrained deep CNN models were also used for the fine-tuning procedure. A new CNN model is proposed in this study with end-to-end training. A dataset containing 180 COVID-19 and 200 normal (healthy) chest X-ray images was used in the studys experimentation. Classification accuracy was used as the performance measurement of the study. The experimental works reveal that deep learning shows potential in the detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images. The deep features extracted from the ResNet50 model and SVM classifier with the Linear kernel function produced a 94.7% accuracy score, which was the highest among all the obtained results. The achievement of the fine-tuned ResNet50 model was found to be 92.6%, whilst end-to-end training of the developed CNN model produced a 91.6% result. Various local texture descriptors and SVM classifications were also used for performance comparison with alternative deep approaches; the results of which showed the deep approaches to be quite efficient when compared to the local texture descriptors in the detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images.","output":"Deep Learning Approaches for COVID-19 Detection Based on Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the last week of December 2019, Wuhan (China) was confronted with the first case of respiratory tract disease 2019 (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the rapid outbreak of the transmission (~3.64 million positive cases and high mortality as of 5 May 2020), the world is looking for immediate and better therapeutic options. Still, much information is not known, including origin of the disease, complete genomic characterization, mechanism of transmission dynamics, extent of spread, possible genetic predisposition, clinical and biological diagnosis, complete details of disease-induced pathogenicity, and possible therapeutic options. Although several known drugs are already under clinical evaluation with many in repositioning strategies, much attention has been paid to the aminoquinoline derivates, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). These molecules are known regulators of endosomes/lysosomes, which are subcellular organelles central to autophagy processes. By elevating the pH of acidic endosomes/lysosomes, CQ/HCQ inhibit the autophagic process. In this short perspective, we discuss the roles of CQ/HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and propose new ways of possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the molecules that selectivity target autophagy.Abbreviation: ACE2: angiotensin I converting enzyme 2; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; HCQ: hydroxychloroquine; MERS-CoV: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","output":"Autophagy as an emerging target for COVID-19: lessons from an old friend, chloroquine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background A global increase of 16% in depression rates from 1990 to 2019 highlights the alarming situation in relation to increase in depression. Research has indicated that this rate is likely to increase as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In South Africa, the depression life-time prevalence rate is 9.47%. However, the lack of access to mental healthcare services leads to people not receiving much needed information and care. The growing accessibility to the Internet for South Africans offers a solution for the screening and access to self-help information for depression. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD)-R was adapted for online usage and a website, mddsa.co.za, was piloted in this regard. Aim This study reports on the efficacy of the online adapted CESD-R for use in South Africa by reporting on the reliability and criterion validity as well as the user friendliness of the website and the appropriateness of the instant feedback provided. Setting The study was conducted in South Africa during COVID lockdown level 1 and 2. Methods This study followed a quantitative, cross-sectional research design. A convenience sample of 21 individuals, above the age of 18, with a depression diagnosis and 86 individuals with no mental health diagnosis participated in the study. Participants accessed the screening instrument online at the website. Results Internal consistency reliability coefficients exceeded 0.80. T-test and sensitivity and specificity results attested to the accuracy of the tool. All items contributed well to the instrument, including the items that were culturally specific to South Africa. Feedback from participants indicated that the tool was easily comprehensible, the website was user friendly and the instant feedback provided was appropriate. Conclusion The online adapted CESD-R evidenced excellent reliability and criterion validity and was able to accurately screen for depression amongst South Africans. The website and the tool have the potential to be utilised to increase access to a screening instrument for individuals who display symptoms of depression and to enhance the opportunity for individuals to practise self-help.","output":"Evaluating the efficacy of an online depression screening tool in South Africa: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To optimize strategies for curbing the transmission of airborne pathogens, the efficacy of three key controls-face masks, ventilation, and physical distancing-must be well understood. In this study, we used the Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets to quantify the reduction in exposure to airborne pathogens from various combinations of controls. For each combination of controls, we simulated thousands of scenarios that represent the tremendous variability in factors governing airborne transmission and the efficacy of mitigation strategies. While the efficacy of any individual control was highly variable among scenarios, combining universal mask-wearing with distancing of 1 m or more reduced the median exposure by more than 99% relative to a close, unmasked conversation, with further reductions if ventilation is also enhanced. The large reductions in exposure to airborne pathogens translated to large reductions in the risk of initial infection in a new host. These findings suggest that layering controls is highly effective for reducing transmission of airborne pathogens and will be critical for curbing outbreaks of novel viruses in the future.","output":"High efficacy of layered controls for reducing exposure to airborne pathogens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the extracorporeal cytokine hemadsorption device CytoSorb was granted FDA emergency approval for critically ill COVID19 patients, to our knowledge no published studies are currently available to support its use.

Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) administration may attenuate oxidative damage and, in turn, reduce vascular endothelial injury in pulmonary and systemic vasculature. OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe a protocol for a living systematic review that will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of parenteral vitamin C administration in adults with severe infections, including those with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to March 30, 2021, for randomized controlled trials evaluating parenteral vitamin C versus no parenteral vitamin C in hospitalized adults with severe infection. Eligible studies will include at least 1 arm involving any dose of parenteral vitamin C alone or in combination with other cointerventions and at least 1 arm not involving parenteral vitamin C. The primary outcomes of interest will include in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality. Title and abstract screening, full-text screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation via a modified Risk of Bias 2.0 tool will be conducted independently and in pairs. We will perform random effects modeling for meta-analyses, in which study weights will be generated by using the inverse variance method. We will assess certainty in effect estimates by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. Meta-analyses will be updated iteratively as new trial evidence becomes available. RESULTS: Among the 1386 citations identified as of March 30, 2021, a total of 17 eligible randomized controlled trials have been identified as of September 2021. We are in the process of updating the search strategy and associated data analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The results will be of importance to critical care physicians and hospitalists who manage severe infection and COVID-19 in daily practice, and they may directly inform international clinical guidance. Although our systematic review will incorporate the most recent trial evidence, ongoing trials may change our confidence in the estimates of effects, thereby necessitating iterative updates in the form of a living review.

The aim of our study was to assess the effect of stay-at-home orders on glycemic control in children. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 238 children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were seen in the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic at the University of South Alabama. Average Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels in the year prior to stay-at home orders (May 2019-April 2020) were compared with A1c values during the quarantine period (May 2020-July 2020) using a paired t-test. We also analyzed the change of A1c level with respect to sex, race, type of diabetes, type of insurance, and mode of insulin administration, using a 2-sample t-test. RESULTS: The average A1c significantly increased from 9.2% during the previous year to 9.5% during the quarantine period (p = 0.0097). The increase of A1c was significantly higher in public insurance patients (0.49% increase) compared to private insurance patients (0.03% increase), (p = 0.0137). We also observed a significant association between the direction of change and type of insurance. Forty-eight percent of public insurance patients had an A1c increase of > 0.5% while 54% of private insurance patients had no change or decrease in A1c (p = 0.0079).

Lung ultrasonography has emerged as a promising imaging modality during the pandemic, but there is still a paucity of systematic analysis of lung ultrasound findings. In this retrospective observational study, 12 Zone ultrasound scans of COVID-19 positive patients were systematically analysed for pleural irregularities, subpleural consolidations, B lines, deep consolidations and effusions. Lung abnormalities were analysed according to overall frequency, frequency distribution in coronal and sagittal lung planes and were also correlated to clinical severity groups as determined by oxygenation deficit. Our results show that lung zones with abnormalities can occur juxtaposed to normal lung. Irregular pleural and small subpleural consolidations appear ubiquitously distributed throughout both lungs and occur early in the disease process. Wide B-lines are a predominant feature in COVID-19 infection. B-lines are found in a variety of patterns with number and width correlated to disease severity. In our analysis we also describe a previously unrecognised finding of small peri-pleural effusions in 8.7% of scans occurring in all areas of the lung.

Although many delirium screening tools exist, their utility, and validation within palliative care settings has not undergone systematic review. AIM To systematically review studies that validate delirium screening tools conducted in palliative care settings. DESIGN Systematic review with narrative synthesis (PROSPERO ID: CRD42019125481). A risk of bias assessment via Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 was performed. DATA SOURCES Five electronic databases were systematically searched (January 1, 1982-May 3, 2020). Quantitative studies validating a screening tool in adult palliative care patient populations were included. Studies involving alcohol withdrawal, critical or perioperative care were excluded. RESULTS Dual-reviewer screening of 3749 unique titles and abstracts identified 95 studies for full-text review and of these, 17 studies of 14 screening tools were included (n = 3496 patients). Data analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity in patient demographics and variability in screening and diagnostic practices that limited generalizability between study populations and care settings. A risk of bias assessment revealed methodological and reporting deficits, with only 3/17 studies at low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS The processes of selecting a delirium screening tool and determining optimal screening practices in palliative care are complex. One tool is unlikely to fit the needs of the entire palliative care population across all palliative care settings. Further research should be directed at evaluating and/or adapting screening tools and practices to fit the needs of specific palliative care settings and populations.","output":"Delirium screening tools validated in the context of palliative care: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunization program against COVID-19 in India started with two vaccines; AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-nCov-19 (termed Covishield in India) and inactivated whole virion BBV152 (Covaxin); homologous prime-boost approach was followed.

The purpose of this study was to assess FMT as a clinical treatment and modulator of fecal microbiota in hospitalized horses with colitis. METHODS: A total of 22 horses with moderate to severe diarrhea, consistent with a diagnosis of colitis, were enrolled at two referral hospitals (L1: n = 12; L2: n = 10). FMT was performed in all 12 patients on 3 consecutive days at L1, while treatment at L2 consisted of standard care without FMT. Manure was collected once daily for 4 days from the rectum in all colitis horses, prior to FMT for horses at L1, and from each manure sample used for FMT. Fecal samples from 10 clinically healthy control horses housed at L2, and 30 healthy horses located at 5 barns in regional proximity to L1 were also obtained to characterize the regional healthy equine microbiome. All fecal microbiota were analyzed using 16S amplicon sequencing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: As expected, healthy horses at both locations showed a greater -diversity and lower -diversity compared to horses with colitis. The fecal microbiome of healthy horses clustered by location, with L1 horses showing a higher prevalence of Kiritimatiellaeota. Improved manure consistency (lower diarrhea score) was associated with a greater -diversity in horses with colitis at both locations (L1: r = -0.385, P = 0.006; L2: r = -0.479, P = 0.002).

METHODS: Cough is a symptom of over thirty non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the diagnosis of a COVID-19 infection by cough alone an extremely challenging multidisciplinary problem. We address this problem by investigating the distinctness of pathomorphological alterations in the respiratory system induced by COVID-19 infection when compared to other respiratory infections. To overcome the COVID-19 cough training data shortage we exploit transfer learning. To reduce the misdiagnosis risk stemming from the complex dimensionality of the problem, we leverage a multi-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture.

Methods: In this multicenter study we enrolled 543 patients, 57.8% males, median age 63 years (range 18-99) from three selected hospitals: University Hospital Tor Vergata in Rome, Fondazione IRCCS Ca 'Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, in Milan, S Chiara Hospital in Trento. We measured hs-cTnT in all patients to assess myocardial injury and correlations with patient's age, symptoms and disease course. Results: The data showed that, among the 543 patients studied, 257 patients (47.3%) had hs-cTnT values higher than the upper reference limit (URL) of 14 ng/L. Patients with high hscTnT had more frequently fever (p < 0.01) and respiratory symptoms (p < 0.01), compared to the group with hscTnT values below URL. The results showed also that patients with hs-cTnT above URL had a higher frequency of previous cardiovascular disease (p < 0.01) as well as of hypertension (p < 0.01). Instead, among 231 patients with no previous cardiovascular disease, 81 (31.5%) had hs-cTnT values above the URL. Finally. the majority of the patients with high hs-cTnT were admitted to the intensive care unit (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Our data suggest the assessment of high sensitivity cardiac troponin in patients with COVID-19 for early diagnosis of cardiac involvement.","output":"The assessment of high sensitivity cardiac troponin in patients with COVID-19: A multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this thesis is to calculate the relativistic correction to the gravitational waves produced by compact binaries in the inspiral phase. The correction is up to the next to leading order, the so-called first post-Newtonian order (1PN), which are correctional terms proportional to $(v/c)^2$ compared to leading order, Newtonian, terms. These corrections are well known in the literature, even going beyond the first order corrections, so why is it computed again here? In later years, an alternative approach for computing these terms using effective field theory has emerged. This thesis investigates this approach by replicating it, and attempts to make this approach more accessible to those not familiar with effective field theories. It has been claimed that this approach greatly simplifies the complicated calculations of gravitational waveforms, and even provides the required intuition for 'physical understanding'. By this master student that was found not to be entirely correct. The calculations were made easier for those with a rich background in quantum field theory, but for those who are not well acquainted with quantum field theory this was not the case. It was, however, found to be a worthwhile method as a means for deepening one's understanding of gravity, and might provide a shorter route for some alternative theories of gravity to testable predictions.","output":"First post-Newtonian correction to gravitational waves produced by compact binaries: How to compute relativistic corrections to gravitational waves using Feynman diagrams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) results from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical features and subsequent medical treatment, combined with the impact of a global pandemic, require specific nutritional therapy in hospitalised adults. This document aims to provide Australian and New Zealand clinicians with guidance on managing critically and acutely unwell adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19. These recommendations were developed using expert consensus, incorporating the documented clinical signs and metabolic processes associated with COVID-19, the literature from other respiratory illnesses, in particular acute respiratory distress syndrome, and published guidelines for medical management of COVID-19 and general nutrition and intensive care. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are likely to have preexisting comorbidities, and the ensuing inflammatory response may result in increased metabolic demands, protein catabolism, and poor glycaemic control. Common medical interventions, including deep sedation, early mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction, and management in the prone position, may exacerbate gastrointestinal dysfunction and affect nutritional intake. Nutrition care should be tailored to pandemic capacity, with early gastric feeding commenced using an algorithm to provide nutrition for the first 5-7 days in lower-nutritional-risk patients and individualised care for high-nutritional-risk patients where capacity allows. Indirect calorimetry should be avoided owing to potential aerosol exposure and therefore infection risk to healthcare providers. Use of a volume-controlled, higher-protein enteral formula and gastric residual volume monitoring should be initiated. Careful monitoring, particularly after intensive care unit stay, is required to ensure appropriate nutrition delivery to prevent muscle deconditioning and aid recovery. The infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the expected high volume of patient admissions will require contingency planning to optimise staffing resources including upskilling, ensure adequate nutrition supplies, facilitate remote consultations, and optimise food service management. These guidelines provide recommendations on how to manage the aforementioned aspects when providing nutrition support to patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"Nutrition management for critically and acutely unwell hospitalised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Australia and New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To assess AIFA Technical Scientific Committee (CTS) approach and evaluation outcome of requests for inclusion in Law 648/96 reimbursement list Methods: Requests for inclusion of an active substance/therapeutic indication into 648/96 lists were extracted from CTS meetings' agendas as published on AIFA website from January 2017 to June 2020 This analysis is focused on new requests, and was performed on CTS outcome, by year and therapeutic area (rare diseases, rare tumors, other oncology indications) Results: From January 2017 to June 2020 AIFA evaluated overall 159 requests CTS approved 66 requests (41 5%), 79 requests (49 7%) were rejected and 14 (8 8%) are ongoing The results showed that 19% of requests concerned rare diseases (29% positive), 13% rare tumors (60% positive), 27% oncology (49% positive), and 41% involved other therapeutic areas (37% positive) The only 2 requests presented for ATMPs have both been refused Assessment procedures performed by CTS in 2017, 2018 and 2019 were 36, 35 and 30 respectively A reduction of requests on rare diseases was observed (12, 6, 5 respectively), while an increase in oncology occurred across this period (9, 12, 14 respectively) In the first half of 2020, CTS assessed a higher number of requests (58), of which only 16 (28%) obtained a positive opinion Only 5 requests referred to COVID-19 treatment Differences in duration of the evaluation process between groups were also observed Conclusions: Across the analyzed period, negative CTS opinions are prevalent The analysis shows a higher percentage of approvals for rare tumors (in 2019 CTS outcomes were all positive), and in general for oncology, although a progressive increase of negative opinions in other oncology indications was observed In the first half of 2020, an upward trend of inclusion requests was observed, which led to an increase in the percentage of negative opinions No ATMPs obtained reimbursement through this scheme","output":"PDG41 EARLY Access to Innovative Drugs in Italy: AIFA Assessment of Inclusion Request in the LAW 648/96 Reimbursement LIST"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) is a severe delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction seen in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, characterized by destruction of donor and recipient RBCs. It results in a drop in hemoglobin to below pretransfusion levels and frequently reticulocytopenia. CASE REPORT We report a case of a man in his 30s with SCD with a recent hospitalization two weeks prior for COVID-19. His red cell antibody history included anti-Fy(a) and warm autoantibody. At that time he was given two units of pRBC and discharged with a hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL. He returned to the hospital approximately 1.5 weeks later with hemoglobin 6.0 g/dL and symptoms concerning for acute chest syndrome (ACS). Pretransfusion testing now showed 4+ pan-agglutinin in both gel-based and tube-based testing. Alloadsorption identified an anti-N and a strong cold agglutinin. Three least incompatible units were transfused to this patient over several days, with evidence of hemolysis. Further reference lab work revealed anti-Fya , anti-Fyb , anti-Lea , anti-Leb , and an anti-KN system antibody. The patient's hemoglobin nadired at 4.4 g/dL. The patient was treated with a single dose of tocilizumab, his hemoglobin stabilized, and he was discharged. DISCUSSION We present a case of HHS proximate to recent SARS-CoV-2 infection with multiple allo and autoantibodies identified. Information on the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and HHS is limited, however, it is possible that inflammation related to COVID-19 could predispose to HHS. Tocilizumab is an approved treatment for COVID-19.

Antiphospholipidic antibodies were found in some studies. AIM: Assessment of protein S activity in patients with COVID-19 as a cause this prothrombotic state, and of the association of protein S activity with worse outcome. METHODS: All patients admitted for COVID-19 disease in a university hospital between 15th of May and 15th of July 2020 were prospectively enrolled into this cohort study. Patients treated with antivitamin K anticoagulants and with liver disease were excluded. All patients had protein S activity determined at admission. The main outcome was survival, secondary outcomes were clinical severity and lung damage. RESULTS: 91 patients were included, of which 21 (23.3%) died. Protein S activity was decreased in 65% of the patients. Death was associated with lower activity of protein S (median 42% vs. 58%, p<0.001), and the association remained after adjustment for age, inflammation markers and ALAT. There was a dose-response relationship between protein S activity and clinical severity (Kendall_tau coefficient = -0.320, p < 0.001; Jonckheere-Terpstra for trend: p<0.001) or pulmonary damage on CT scan (Kendall_tau coefficient = -0.290, p<0.001; Jonckheere-Terpstra for trend: p<0.001).

This study aimed to investigate the effect of hydrocolloid dressing combined with 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film on the prevention of facial pressure injury in medical staff tasked with preventing and controlling COVID-19. METHODS: This was a self-controlled study. Medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection in isolation wards from 6 January to 2 February, 2020, were selected to participate. Phase I was defined as the first 2 weeks of medical personnel entering the isolation ward, with phase II being the following 2 weeks. In phase I, medical workers only used hydrocolloid dressing on their faces, and in phase II, they used both hydrocolloid dressing and 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film. RESULTS: A total of 116 medical workers were selected as research subjects. The average facial local temperature in phase I was higher than that in phase II from the baseline (day 1) to the end of the study (day 14); however, there was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). The incidence of facial pressure injury in phase II was lower than that in phase I (P<0.05); the facial skin comfort level among medical staff in phase II was higher than that in phase I (P<0.05).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance indicators in STEMI during the early phase of the lockdown following the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The patient delay and the system delay were evaluated in 312 patients with suspected STEMI, in the period of the first State of Emergency in Portugal, through a survey called Moment COVID implemented within 18th March to 2 May 2020, in 18 national centers of Interventional Cardiology where PPCI is carried out 24/7. These patients were compared with a historical cohort of 267 patients from the 5th year after integration of SFL Initiative in Portugal (Moment 2015) in which the same survey was applied. Patients with late presentation of STEMI (>12 hours of symptoms onset) were excluded from this analysis. Results: In Moment COVID there was a trend towards a longer patient delay (incremental median 20 min;p=0.059) and a significant longer system-delay (incremental median 17 min;p=0.033) compared to the historical cohort of Moment 2015. Consequently, times to revascularization tended to be longer (incremental median 26 min;p=0.074). Indeed, in Moment COVID patients were less compliant with the times recommended by the European guidelines: door-to-balloon time <60 min was achieved in 47.6% of patients compared to 57.0% (p=0.052) in Moment 2015 and system-delay <90 min in 13.9% compared to 21.8% (p=0.033). Conclusion: These results from a multicentric national analysis demonstrated a trend to longer time from symptom onset to request healthcare system assistance and a significantly longer time from first medical contact to revascularization among patients with STEMI during COVID-19 pandemic. This delay for treatment could negatively impact the STEMI prognosis at the long-term.","output":"Indirect effects of COVID-19 Pandemic in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: insights from a multicentric national survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Some clinicians may be forced to temporarily extend treatment intervals in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) eyes with frequent retreatments to reduce the number of visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. To provide an indication of what these outcomes may be, we studied eyes with active lesions with unplanned treatment interval extensions before the pandemic occurred. METHODS: We compared eyes with active disease despite 6 weekly injections whose next injection was extended to 7 weeks and those whose intervals were not extended. We identified 1559 (16%) of 9602 eyes from the Fight Retinal Blindness! (FRB!) registry (2013 and 2018) that fit this criteria. Eyes were further stratified into four groups by the mean interval over the following 6 months: (1) 6 weeks (81%), (2) 7C9 weeks (9%), (3) 10C12 weeks (5%) and (4) >12 weeks (5%). RESULTS: There was a significant loss in VA in eyes extended to >12 weeks compared to the non-extended group (adjusted VA change, mean (95% CI): 6 weeks, 0.4 (?1.5 to 2.2), versus >12 weeks, ?4.7 (?7.4 to ?2.1), letters, p = 0.03 and a threefold increase in relative risk of losing 15 letters (absolute risk (14% versus 4%, p < 0.01)). CONCLUSION: Mean VA remained stable for 6 months in eyes requiring frequent treatment despite retreatment interval extension up to 10C12 weeks.

Summary Introduction In November 2002 an epidemic of atypical pneumonia appeared in the Chinese region of Guandong. It was subsequently given the name Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) following the occurrence of further outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong in February 2003. Five cases related to the same patient source have been reported in France. Case report We report the case of a patient of 52 years who had direct contact with a probable case of SARS. On admission the patient presented with pyrexia associated with lymphopenia and liver cell necrosis but no respiratory symptoms. The chest x-ray was normal. The thoracic CT scan showed a sub pleural ground glass appearance. Early (36 hours) PCR studies of naso-pharyngeal washings were negative for the coronavirus associated with SARS. The diagnosis was confirmed serologically. Conclusions This observation demonstrates the existence of incomplete clinical presentations of SARS. The infectivity of this asymptomatic form is unknown. Serological analyses will allow better identification. The continuing danger of seasonal recurrence, particularly in the winter, cannot be ignored. In this context the recognition of probably infectious asymptomatic forms is essential.","output":"Formes pauci-symptomatiques du syndrome respiratoire aigu svre (sras)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Young people may have elevated risk for poorer mental health during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, yet longitudinal studies documenting this impact are lacking. This study assessed changes in mental health and help-seeking since COVID-19 restrictions in young Australians, including gender differences. METHODS: Data were drawn from a recent subsample (n = 443; 60% female; M(age) = 22.0) of a prospective cohort originally recruited in secondary school to complete annual surveys. The subsample completed an additional COVID-19 survey during COVID-19 restrictions (MayCJune 2020), which was compared to responses from their latest annual survey (August 2019CMarch 2020). Mixed effect models with time and gender as the primary predictors were conducted for: (i) scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression 9-item (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) modules assessed before and during COVID-19 restrictions, and (ii) self-reported help-seeking from a health professional in February 2020, and the month preceding MayCJune 2020. RESULTS: Mean symptom scores increased from before to during COVID-19 restrictions on the PHQ-9 (coefficient: 1.29; 95% CI 0.72C1.86) and GAD-7 (0.78; 95% CI 0.26C1.31), but there was no increase in help-seeking over time (odds ratio 0.50; 95% CI 0.19C1.32). There was no evidence of differential changes by gender. CONCLUSIONS: This study found increases in depression and anxiety symptoms but not greater help-seeking among young Australian adults during the first wave of the pandemic.

Individually selecting vessels with a microcatheter can be time-consuming and difficult, especially when multiple branches are present in the treatment zone. This article describes a technique to perform an \\"inverse\\" embolization-protection of the selected vessel and embolization of the unselected vessels-a technique that has not yet been described. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two cases of hepatic chemoembolization that would require subselection of multiple branch vessels using conventional technique are reported. In both cases the proper hepatic artery was selected with a soft, nondissecting neurovascular guide catheter. The nontarget hepatic vessel was selected with a neurovascular microcatheter occlusion balloon, and the balloon was inflated to protect that vessel. Embolization to multiple target vessels was then achieved by way of a single injection through the guide catheter. RESULTS Both procedures were technically successful without complication.

DESIGN: Time series analyses using cross-sectional annual data from the Telephone Surveillance System (VIGITEL 2008-2019). Food consumption was evaluated through: (1) consumption of five or more portions of fruits and vegetables in &#8805;5 d/week; (2) consumption of beans in &#8805;5 d/week and (3) consumption of soft drinks or artificial juices in &#8805;5 d/week. Absolute inequality was assessed by the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative inequality by the concentration index (CIX). SII and CIX positive values indicate higher prevalence among more educated citizens and negative among less educated ones. Time trend was assessed by linear regression using weighted least squares. SETTING: 26 Brazilian state capitals and the Federal District. PARTICIPANTS: 621 689 individuals &#8805;18 years. RESULTS: Fruits and vegetable consumption was more prevalent among the more educated citizens, while beans were mostly consumed by the less educated, and soft drinks or artificial juices was more prevalent among individuals with intermediate education. The highest absolute inequality was found for beans (SII2019 -259). In 12 years, the absolute inequality increased for fruit and vegetable consumption (from SII2008 128 to SII2019 162), remained for beans (SII2008 -231 to SII2019 -259) and reduced for soft drinks or artificial juices (SII2008 87 to SII2019 04). Relative inequality was low and constant. CONCLUSION: Despite the advances reducing inequalities in soft drinks or artificial juice consumption, the increase in the social gap for adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables is troublesome.","output":"Social inequality in food consumption between 2008 and 2019 in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly impacted aspects of human life globally. Playing videogames has been encouraged by several organizations to help individuals cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictive measures. This longitudinal study was the first to examine gaming in the context of the pandemic and its association with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Methods: The sample comprised 1,778 children and adolescents (50.7% male) who were part of the Project of School Mental Health in Southwest China. Data were collected at two-time intervals: before the COVID-19 pandemic (October to November 2019 - [T1]) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (April to May 2020 - [T2]). Data were collected on perceived COVID-19 impacts, videogame use, Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD), and depressive and anxiety symptoms. Cross-lagged panel models were computed to examine longitudinal relationships. Results: The results indicated that both videogame use and IGD increased significantly for adolescents at T2. The cross-lagged panel model results suggested that depressive and anxiety symptoms at T1 positively predicted IGD and videogame use at T2 (especially for boys), but not inversely. Perceived COVID-19 impacts mediated the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms at T1 and IGD at T2. Conclusion: Children and adolescents both increased videogame use at T2, but only adolescents significantly increased IGD severity at T2. The findings supported the compensatory hypothesis, and are consistent with the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model as individual responses to COVID-19 may function as a mediator between personal predisposing variables and IGD.","output":"Depression and anxiety symptoms associated with internet gaming disorder before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gut microbiota are influenced by factors such as diet, habitat, and social contact, which directly affect the host's health. Studies related to gut microbiota in non-human primates are increasing worldwide. However, little remains known about the gut bacterial composition in wild Brazilian monkeys. Therefore, we studied the fecal microbiota composition of wild black capuchin monkey (Sapajus nigritus) (n=10) populations from two different Atlantic Forest biome fragments (five individuals per fragment) in south Brazil. The bacterial community was identified via the high-throughput sequencing and partial amplification of the 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) using an Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM(TM)) System. In contrast to other studies involving monkey microbiota, which have generally reported the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as predominant, black capuchin monkeys showed a high relative abundance of Proteobacteria ([Formula: see text] = 80.54%), followed by Firmicutes ([Formula: see text] = 12.14%), Actinobacteria ([Formula: see text] = 4.60%), and Bacteriodetes ([Formula: see text] = 1.31%). This observed particularity may have been influenced by anthropogenic actions related to the wild habitat and/or diet specific to the Brazilian biome's characteristics and/or monkey foraging behavior. Comparisons of species richness (Chao1) and diversity indices (Simpson and InvSimpson) showed no significant differences between the two groups of monkeys. Interestingly, PICRUSt2 analysis revealed that metabolic pathways present in the bacterial communities were associated with xenobiotic biodegradation and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, which may suggest positive effects on monkey health and conservation in this anthropogenic habitat. Infectious disease-associated microorganisms were also observed in the samples. The present study provides information about the bacterial population and metabolic functions present in fecal microbiota, which may contribute to a better understanding of the ecology and biology of black capuchin monkeys living in forest fragments within the Atlantic Forest biome in southern Brazil. Additionally, the present study demonstrates that the fecal bacterial communities of wild black capuchin monkeys in this area are divergent from those of other wild non-human primates.","output":"Fecal bacterial communities of wild black capuchin monkeys (Sapajus nigritus) from the Atlantic Forest biome in Southern Brazil are divergent from those of other non-human primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has challenged social workers to engage with health pandemics and provide essential services in conditions of uncertainty and high risk.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the association between COVID-19 surges and HAI or cluster rates METHODS: Design: Prospective cohort study SETTING: 148 HCA Healthcare-affiliated hospitals, 3/1/2020-9/30/2020, and a subset of hospitals with microbiology and cluster data through 12/31/2020 PATIENTS: All inpatients MEASUREMENTS: We evaluated the association between COVID-19 surges and HAIs, hospital-onset pathogens, and cluster rates using negative binomial mixed models. To account for local variation in COVID-19 pandemic surge timing, we included the number of discharges with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis per staffed bed per month at each hospital. RESULTS: Central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia increased as COVID-19 burden increased (P  0.001 for all), with 60% (95% CI, 23 to 108%) more CLABSI, 43% (95% CI, 8 to 90%) more CAUTI, and 44% (95% CI, 10 to 88%) more cases of MRSA bacteremia than expected over 7 months based on predicted HAIs had there not been COVID-19 cases. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) was not significantly associated with COVID-19 burden. Microbiology data from 81 of the hospitals corroborated the findings. Notably, rates of hospital-onset bloodstream infections and multidrug resistant organisms, including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and Gram-negative organisms were each significantly associated with COVID-19 surges (P < 0.05 for all). Finally, clusters of hospital-onset pathogens increased as the COVID-19 burden increased (P = 0.02). LIMITATIONS: Variations in surveillance and reporting may affect HAI data. Table 1.

One of the crucial issues with using credit cards is fraud, which is a serious challenge in the realm of online transactions. Consequently, there is a huge need to develop the best approach possible to using machine learning in order to prevent almost all fraudulent credit card transactions. This paper studies a total of 66 machine learning models based on two stages of evaluation. A real-world credit card fraud detection dataset of European cardholders is used in each model along with stratified K-fold cross-validation. In the first stage, nine machine learning algorithms are tested to detect fraudulent transactions. The best three algorithms are nominated to be used again in the second stage, with 19 resampling techniques used with each one of the best three algorithms. Out of 330 evaluation metric values that took nearly one month to obtain, the All K-Nearest Neighbors (AllKNN) undersampling technique along with CatBoost (AllKNN-CatBoost) is considered to be the best proposed model. Accordingly, the AllKNN-CatBoost model is compared with related works.

Here, the hematological characteristics of patients with severe and critical 2019-nCoV pneumonia in intensive care unit (ICU) were investigated, which may provide the necessary basis for its diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We collected data on patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV pneumonia in the ICU of Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan from February 25 to April 2, 2020. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the presence of 2019-nCoV, and various hematological characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: All patients tested positive for 2019-nCoV using nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum after admission, and interstitial pneumonia findings were noted on chest computed tomography. Sex, age and comorbidities were not significantly different between the severe and critical groups. In terms of prognosis, the survival rate of patients in the severe group reached 100%, whereas that of patients in the critical group was only 13.33% after positive treatment. Furthermore, lymphocyte percentage, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, D-dimer, myohemoglobin, procalcitonin, and IL-6 levels were high-risk factors for disease progression in critical patients. Finally, lymphocyte percentage and blood urea nitrogen, calcium, myohemoglobin, and IL-6 levels were closely associated with patient prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: 2019-nCoV pneumonia should be considered a systemic disease. Patients with more complications were more likely to develop critical disease.

Despite the widely hypothesized role of a cytokine storm in disease severity, no study thus far has explored the association between immunosuppression and disease severity in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE This study aims to examine the association between the use of immunosuppressant medication and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS Nine hundred and eighty-one consecutive patients hospitalized between March 12, 2020, and April 15, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were enrolled in this cohort study and subdivided by immunosuppression status. The patients were followed up for a minimum of 28 days (median 37 days) for the primary endpoint of mortality. Secondary endpoints included the composite of intubation or death, and the composite of mortality, intubation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) requirement. RESULTS During the follow-up period, 354 (36.1%) of study patients died. The immunosuppressed cohort (n=31) had significantly higher mortality rates (aHR 2.067, 95%CI 1.20-3.57, p=0.009). There was no association between immunosuppression and the composite endpoint of mortality or intubation (aHR 1.49 95%CI 0.88-2.51, p=0.14) and of the composite endpoint of mortality, intubation, or CPAP (aHR 1.36 95%CI 0.81-2.30 p=0.245).

Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies. METHODS: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the population infected) under one or more days of fever-based isolation. RESULTS: Using the model we find evidence that symptom-based isolation policies could reduce the attack rates of both influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks, and flatten the outbreak curves. Specifically, we found that across a range of influenza scenarios, a CDC-recommended policy of one day isolation following fever can reduce the attack rate from 27% of the population to 12%, and to 3% if the isolation is extended to two days. In COVID-19 transmission, we estimate that implementing one day post-fever isolation would reduce the attack rate from 79% to 71%, and there is possible benefit from isolation for six days. In both influenza and COVID-19, the policies are predicted to reduce the peak number of infected but not shorten the outbreak duration. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom-based isolation could be an important tool to control influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, and potentially other settings.

This study used environmental quality, namely ventilation, humidity, brightness, temperature, and personal space area as house environment parameters. The location of the study is Coblong District, Bandung City. The 2 test of independence was used to show the significance between environmental parameters required for the healthy house and disease transmission. The study found that one house environment parameter (ventilation) are significantly related to indoor transmission rate in recovered patients' houses (p = 0.021). Pearson correlation coefficient r was also investigated for each element of environment factor on the indoor transmission rate. Ventilation was found to be the most significant parameter correlated with indoor transmission (r = C0.522, p = 0.002).

Current qualitative research is mainly limited to the experiences, emotions and expectations of patients. Insight into the full process, including experiences from the perspective of informal caregivers and healthcare professionals, remains scarce. Materials and Methods: Data were gathered by means of semi-structured face-to-face interviews. In total, there were 27 participants, including 11 patients, 7 informal caregivers and 9 healthcare professionals. The interview process was audiotaped, and each interview was transcribed verbatim. To systematically analyse the gathered data, software for qualitative analysis (NVivo) was used. After immersion in the raw data of transcripts and field notes, a list of broad categories for organising the data into meaningful clusters for analysis was developed. All interviews were coded by the first author, and 25% was independently assessed by the second author. Results: The results of our study describe several promoting and limiting factors concerning the process of lumbar fusion surgery from the perspective of patients, informal caregivers and healthcare providers. The most frequently mentioned promoting factors were: information and opportunities to ask questions during consultations; multidisciplinary consultations; good communication and guidance during hospitalization; and follow-up appointments. The most frequently mentioned limiting factors were: lack of educational material; lack of guidance and communication prior to, during and after hospitalisation. Conclusion: Overall, participants were satisfied with the current healthcare-process in lumbar fusion surgery. However, we found that lack of educational material and guidance during the process led to insecurity about complaints, surgery and recovery. To improve the process of lumbar interbody fusion and to increase patient satisfaction, healthcare providers should focus on guiding and educating patients and informal caregivers about the pre-operative trajectory, the surgery and the recovery. From the healthcare providers perspective, the process could be improved by multidisciplinary consultations and a dedicated spine team in the operation room.

However, rigorous determination of SARS-COV-2 infectivity is essentially impossible owing to its continuous evolution with over 13752 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variants in six different subtypes. We develop an advanced machine learning algorithm based on the algebraic topology to quantitatively evaluate the binding affinity changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor following the mutations. Based on mutation-induced binding affinity changes, we reveal that five out of six SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have become either moderately or slightly more infectious, while one subtype has weakened its infectivity. We find that SARS-CoV-2 is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV according to computed S protein-ACE2 binding affinity changes. Based on a systematic evaluation of all possible 3686 future mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), we show that most likely future mutations will make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious. Combining sequence alignment, probability analysis, and binding affinity calculation, we predict that a few residues on the receptor-binding motif (RBM), i.e., 452, 489, 500, 501, and 505, have very high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains.","output":"Mutations strengthened SARS-CoV-2 infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efficient therapeutic options are needed to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 that has caused more than 922,000 fatalities as of September 13(th), 2020 We report the isolation and characterization of two ultrapotent SARS-CoV-2 human neutralizing antibodies (S2E12 and S2M11) that protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge Cryo-electron microscopy structures show that S2E12 and S2M11 competitively block ACE2 attachment and that S2M11 also locks the spike in a closed conformation by recognition of a quaternary epitope spanning two adjacent receptor-binding domains Cocktails including S2M11, S2E12 or the previously identified S309 antibody broadly neutralize a panel of circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates and activate effector functions Our results pave the way to implement antibody cocktails for prophylaxis or therapy, circumventing or limiting the emergence of viral escape mutants","output":"Ultrapotent human antibodies protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge via multiple mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of non-progressive disorders of motor function in children resulting from an injury to an immature brain.

Educators and staff went into rapid response mode to continue teaching and supporting students from a distance. Critical reflections were written by the authors to summarize their responses to teaching and learning during the early phases of the pandemic. These reflections were themed, considered individually and collectively, then analyzed and synthesized. In this paper, critical reflection is used as an educational process within the context of critical constructivism and transformative paradigms. We share how teaching during the pandemic solidified our commitment to students and cemented our critical pedagogy by thinking and acting critically to assist students with this disruption in their education. Equipped with these capabilities, educators are empowered to work with students to problem solve and transform our educative lives for a just society. An inter-professional opportunity across programs, spurred by the pandemic, meets organizational strategic directions and fosters a promising relationality. Increased territorial and local technological supports and internal professional development is needed to solidify the immense prospects for distance education as the College transitions to a polytechnic university.

It is a widespread disease that has a disabling impact on life and, in addition to physical changes, brings about a number of psychological and cognitive processes. GOAL: The goal of the study was to identify and describe the quality of life of post-stroke patients. METHODOLOGY: The study design was quantitative. A questionnaire of the authors own design and the SF-36 questionnaire were used to obtain the data. RESULTS: Significant differences in patient quality of life were identified in relation to patient gender. Moreover, the quality of life in all individual SF-36 dimensions, except for mental health, deteriorated with age. With regard to occupational placement, employed respondents gave the highest evaluation of quality of life according to SF-36 and old-age pensioners the lowest. The analysis shows that quality of life in individual dimensions is positively influenced by respondents higher education. The evaluation in individual dimensions improves with the time that has passed since the stroke. CONCLUSION: The quality of life of post-stroke patients deteriorates with age. The deteriorating level of patient quality of life in older age requires programmes that include assessments and interventions that lead to the treatment of these patients.","output":"Quality of Life of Post-stroke Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recently described DMA designed for high resolution viral particle analysis (Perez-DMA; Perez-Lorenzo et al, 2020) is modified to decrease the relative peak full width at half maximum (FWHM) below previously achieved 3.3%. The electrode radii at the outlet slit (R(1) = 1.01 cm; R(2) = 2 cm) and the working length are almost unchanged (L = 114.9 vs. 116 mm). The laminarization trumpet and the radius of the curve merging the trumpet to the working section are both considerably widened to improve gas flow laminarization. DMA evaluation with salt clusters is improved by reducing the flow resistance at the gas outlet, to reach substantially larger sheath gas flow rates Q ? 1700 L/min. Tests with tetraheptylammonium bromide clusters with a center rod diverging at 3(o) demonstrate FWHM<2.7%, without indications of performance loss due to turbulence even at 1700 L/min. Correcting these high flow rate data for diffusive broadening reveals a maximal DMA FWHM in the limit of non-diffusing particles and zero sample flow, FWHM() = 1.8%. An uncorrected peak width approaching 2% is independently demonstrated at much lower flow rates of sheath gas with two recently described bee virus particle standards having singularly narrow size distributions at mean diameters of 38 and 17 nm. Correcting raw 38 nm particle peak widths for broadening due to diffusion and aerosol to sheath gas flow rate ratio q/Q shows an even more ideal response with FWHM()<1%, where this value includes nonidealities in the DMA as well as possible lack of monodispersity in the viral particles.","output":"Exceeding a resolving power of 50 for virus size determination by differential mobility analysis()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 has spread rapidly since emerging in late 2019, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that was first described in 2019, unrelated to the commonly occurring feline coronavirus (FCoV) that is an alphacoronavirus associated with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has spread globally within a few months, resulting in the current pandemic. Felids have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly in the Western world, many people live in very close contact with their pet cats, and natural infections of cats in COVID-19-positive households have been described in several countries. In this review, the European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD), a scientifically independent board of experts in feline medicine from 11 European Countries, discusses the current status of SARS-CoV infections in cats. The review examines the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and human-to-animal transmissions, including infections in domestic and non-domestic felids, as well as mink-to-human/-cat transmission.

The first principal component (GIP1) is more heritable than the original studies and shows strong genetic correlations with length of life as well as multiple indices of mental and physical wellbeing. We identify 27 genomic regions associated with GIP1, and provide additional, independent evidence for an effect on human ageing for loci near HTT and MAML3 using a study of Finnish and Japanese subject survival. Across the genome, GIP1 associations are enriched in genes involved in haem metabolism and pathways related to transcription, neurogenesis, homeostasis, proteolysis, intracellular signalling, immunity, and the muscle system. Finally, using proteome-wide two-sample Mendelian randomisation and colocalisation, we provide robust evidence for a detrimental effect of blood levels of apolipoprotein(a) (LPA) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) on GIP1.

To better understand the long-term course and etiology of symptoms we analysed data of COVID-19 patients post discharge prospectively. Methods: A home care cell monitored COVID-19 patients post discharge. A paramedical staff interviewed the patient using the pretested questionnaire and refer the patient to doctor if required. The doctor spoke with these select cases and offered them treatment, counselling, referral to consultant/ hospital as per the need. Results: We followed up with 4354 (2724 employees and 1630 dependents) patients for 3 months. 592 (13%) patients were hospitalized for COVID and others were under home isolation. 4108 (94%) patients did not have any symptoms post COVID and 239 (6%) were known to have either one or more post COVID symptoms. For 153 (64%) patients symptoms lasted for more than a month post discharge and 86 (36%) patients were symptomatic for more than 2 months post discharge. The most common symptoms identified were fatigue and weakness (69%), dry cough (39%) body ache (31%), fever (23%) shortness of breath (15%) etc. Interpretation: Long COVID symptoms can persist for 1- 3months after recovery, this may lead to long absenteeism and may reduce productivity and quality of life significantly.

Here we estimate the burden of serious fungal infections in this sub-Saharan country with a health profiling description. National demographics were used and PubMed searches to retrieve all published articles on fungal infections in C?te d'Ivoire and other bordering countries in West Africa. When no data existed, risk populations were used to estimate frequencies of fungal infections, using previously described methodology by LIFE (www.LIFE-Worldwide.org). The population of C?te d'Ivoire is around 25 million; 37% are children (14 years), and 9% are>65 years. Tinea capitis in children is common, measured at 13.9% in 2013. Considering the prevalence of HIV infection (2.6% of the population, a total of 500,000) and a hospital incidence of 12.7% of cryptococcosis, it is estimated that 4590 patients per year develop cryptococcosis. For pneumocystosis, it is suggested that 2640 new cases occur each year with the prevalence of 11% of newly diagnosed HIV adults, and 33% of children with HIV/AIDS. Disseminated histoplasmosis is estimated a 1.4% of advanced HIV disease - 513 cases.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (SAFS) were estimated in 104/100,000 and 151/100,000 respectively, in 1,152,178 adult asthmatics. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is common and recurrent VVC affects 6% of women in their fertile years - 421,936 women. An unknown number develop candidaemia and invasive aspergillosis. The annual incidence of fungal keratitis is estimated at 3350. No cases of sporotrichosis, mucormycosis and chromoblastomycosis are described, although some cases of mycetoma and Conidiobolus infection have been reported.

To address this translational gap, we developed a high-fidelity swine model of ARDS utilizing clinically-relevant lung injury exposures. Fourteen male swine were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and surgically instrumented for hemodynamic monitoring, blood, and tissue sampling. Animals were allocated to one of three groups: 1) Indirect lung injury only: animals were inoculated by direct injection of E. coli into the kidney parenchyma, provoking systemic inflammation and distributive shock physiology; 2) Direct lung injury only: animals received volutrauma, hyperoxia, and bronchoscope-delivered gastric particles; 3) Combined indirect and direct lung injury: animals were administered both above-described indirect and direct lung injury exposures. Animals were monitored for up to 12 hours, with serial collection of physiologic data, blood samples, and radiographic imaging. Lung tissue was acquired post-mortem for pathological examination. In contrast to indirect lung injury only and direct lung injury only groups, animals in the combined indirect and direct lung injury group exhibited all of the physiological, radiographic, and histopathologic hallmarks of human ARDS: impaired gas exchange (mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio 124.8  63.8), diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiographs, and extensive pathologic evidence of diffuse alveolar damage.

METHODS: Data collected routinely from people referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) following hospitalization for Covid-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Persistent dyspnea was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea (mMRC) scale. RESULTS: Twenty-three people with persistent symptoms were referred for CPET. Mean mMRC dyspnea score was 1 (SD = 1) and was significantly associated with VO2peak (%) (rho = -0.49). At 6 months, those hospitalized in the general ward had a slightly reduced VO2peak (87% [SD = 20]), whereas those who had been in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a moderately reduced VO2peak (77% [SD = 15]). Of note, the results of the CPET revealed that, in all patients, respiratory equivalents were high, power-to-weight ratios were low, and those who had been in the ICU had a relatively low ventilatory efficiency (mean VE/VCO2 slope = 34 [SD = 5]). Analysis of each individual showed that none had a breathing reserve <15% or 11 L/min, all had a normal exercise electrocardiogram, and 4 had a heart rate above 90%. CONCLUSION: At 6 months, persistent dyspnea was associated with reduced physical fitness. This study offers initial insights into the mid-term physical fitness of people who required hospitalization for Covid-19. It also provides novel pathophysiological clues about the underlaying mechanism of the physical limitations associated with persistent dyspnea. Those with persistent dyspnea should be offered a tailored rehabilitation intervention, which should probably include muscle reconditioning, breathing retraining, and perhaps respiratory muscle training. IMPACT: This study is the first to show that a persistent breathing disorder (in addition to muscle deconditioning) can explain persistent symptoms 6 months after hospitalization for Covid-19 infection and suggests that a specific rehabilitation intervention is warranted.","output":"Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing to Assess Persistent Symptoms at 6 Months in People With COVID-19 Who Survived Hospitalization - A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has not been included as a possible cause of thrombocytopenia in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

In particular, urbanisation trends and the increasing demands of urban mobility place additional pressure on existing transportation infrastructure, and this creates new challenges for urban planners in terms of developing integrated and sustainable urban mobility policies. Here, we take a novel and holistic approach to analysing transformative pathways towards sustainable urban mobility, considering the complex dynamics in metropolitan regions. To achieve this, we develop a toolset to assess the impact of potential measures to be taken by decision makers. Our innovative approach is based on the introduction of a new system framework to link the interrelated sector parameters of mobility systems by considering the effects of innovative mixed methods (both qualitative and quantitative) on scenario development and evaluation on the basis of global trends at the macro scale and their specific influences on the mobility sector at the local scale. To this end, we used a participatory modelling approach to develop scenarios and evaluate them as integrated simulation runs via a comprehensive and holistic system dynamics (SD) model. Thus, we estimated dynamic interdependencies between all of the factors relating to the mobility sector and then assigned business decision-making criteria to the urban systems. Furthermore, we introduced a sustainable net present value framework to estimate the sustainability outcomes of government investment in urban mobility infrastructure. A case study relating to the Rhine-Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region in Germany was applied in order to simulate four scenarios co-created with stakeholders involved in our study, namely, Smart City, Sustainable/Healthy City, Deurbanisation and Business-as-Usual (BaU), which served as a solid basis from which to quantify path dependencies in terms of policy implementation.

Infectious diseases caused by contagious respiratory pathogens also pose a great risk to hospitals as has been seen in the current epidemic by a novel coronavirus infection. Such risk occurs in high density patient settings with few or no partitions, since the pathogens are transmitted by aerosols discharged from the patients. Possible interventions against the transmission are needed. Methods: We developed a compact, lightweight, and portable hood designed to cover just the top half of a patient sitting or lying in bed, to limit the dissemination of infectious aerosols, constructed out of lightweight pipes, transparent plastic curtains, and a fan-filter-unit (FFU). The containment efficacy of the product was tested using an aerosolized cultured influenza virus tracer and an optimal airflow rate was determined according to the test results. It was tested for use in hospital wards during the 2016-2018 influenza seasons. Results: The hood, named as Barrihood?, had dimensions height 172 cm, width 97 cm, length 38 cm, weighed 26 kg, and easily strolled and unfolded from its stored to its fully operational state of length 125 cm within a few minutes by a single operator. Optimal operational airflow-rate of the FFU was 420 L/min for containment of the aerosol particles. Eighty-one uninfected patients remained for 176 cumulative person-days within 1-4 m of influenza-infected patients isolated within the hood, without acquiring influenza infection. Conclusions: With the use of the hood, secondary influenza infection cases significantly decreased, compared to previous influenza seasons. It may be suited to hospitals with not enough/no negative pressure facilities, or without enough number of individual patient isolation rooms, and could contribute to decrease the risk of nosocomial infections.","output":"Development of a lightweight, 'on-bed', portable isolation hood to limit the spread of aerosolized influenza and other pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of heart failure (HF) and major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE).

We aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of three types of vaccines (AZD1222, mRNA-1273, and BNT162b2) in 253 patients with IMID and 30 healthcare workers (HCWs). Plasma levels of IgG-antibody against SARS-CoV-2 targeting the receptor-binding domain of spike protein (anti-S/RBD-IgG) were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay 3C4 weeks after the first-dose and second-dose vaccination. The positive rate and titers of anti-S/RBD-IgG were significantly higher in mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 than in the AZD1222 vaccine. Immunogenicity was augmented after the second dose of any vaccine type in all IMID patients, suggesting that these patients should complete the vaccination series. Anti-S/RBD-IgG titers after first-dose vaccination were significantly lower in RA patients than pSS patients, but there was no significant difference after second-dose vaccination among five groups of IMID patients. The positive rate and titers of anti-S/RBD-IgG were significantly lower in patients receiving abatacept/rituximab therapy than in those receiving other DMARDs. All three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines showed acceptable safety profiles, and the common AEs were injection site reactions.

The single submodels provide a rather accurate description of the COVID-19 evolution in each subpopulation by an extended SEIR model including the class of asymptomatic infectives, which is recognized as a determinant for disease diffusion. The multi-group structure is specifically designed to investigate the effects of the interregional mobility restored at the end of the first strong lock-down in Italy (June 3, 2020). In its time-invariant version, the model is shown to enjoy some analytical stability properties which provide significant insights on the efficacy of the implemented control measurements. In order to highlight the impact of human mobility on the disease evolution in Italy between the first and second wave onset, the model is applied to fit real epidemiological data of three geographical macro-areas in the period March-October 2020, including the mass departure for summer holidays. The simulation results are in good agreement with the data, so that the model can represent a useful tool for predicting the effects of the combination of containment measures in triggering future pandemic scenarios. Particularly, the simulation shows that, although the unrestricted mobility alone appears to be insufficient to trigger the second wave, the human transfers were crucial to make uniform the spatial distribution of the infection throughout the country and, combined with the restart of (production, trade and education) activities, determined a time advance of the contagion increase (autumn 2020).","output":"A Data-driven Model of the COVID-19 Spread among Interconnected Populations: Epidemiological and Mobility Aspects Following the Lock-down in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown aiming at slowing COVID-19 transmission has altered nature accessibility patterns, creating quasi-experimental conditions to assess if retracted nature contact and perceived nature deprivation influence physical and emotional wellbeing.

Conversely, government interventions to reduce the spread of the disease and the number of fatalities may induce a bifurcation that stabilizes a desirable state with low numbers of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The key characteristic feature of an infection dynamical system in this context is the eigenvalue that determines the stability of the states under consideration and is known in synergetics as the order parameter eigenvalue. Using a SEIR-like infection disease model, the relevant order parameter and its eigenvalue are determined. A three stage methodology is proposed to track and estimate the eigenvalue through time. The method is applied to COVID-19 infection data reported from 20 European countries during the period of January 1, 2020 to June 15. It is shown that in 15 out of the 20 countries the eigenvalue switched its sign suggesting that during the reporting period an intervention bifurcation took place that stabilized the desirable low death state. It is shown that the eigenvalue analysis also allows for a ranking of countries by the degree of the stability of the infection-free state. For the investigated countries, Ireland was found to exhibit the most stable infection-free state. Finally, a six point classification scheme is suggested with groups 5 and 6 including countries that failed to stabilize the desirable infection-free low death state. In doing so, tools for assessing the effectiveness of government interventions are provided that are at the heart of bifurcation theory, in general, and synergetics, in particular.","output":"COVID-19 interventions in some European countries induced bifurcations stabilizing low death states against high death states: An eigenvalue analysis based on the order parameter concept of synergetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we sought and presented an 8-Dimensional deterministic mathematical COVID-19 dynamic model that accounted for the global stability analysis of the role of dual-bilinear treatment protocols of COVID-19 infection. The model, which is characterized by human-to-human transmission mode was investigated using dual non-pharmaceutical (face-masking and social distancing) and dual pharmaceutical (hydroxylchloroquine and azithromycin) as control functions following the interplay of susceptible population and varying infectious population. First, we investigated the model state-space and then established and computed the system reproduction number for both off-treatment [Formula: see text] and for onset-treatment [Formula: see text]. We considered the model for off-treatment and thereafter by incorporating the theory of LaSalle's invariant principle into the classical method of Lyapunov functions, we presented an approach for global stability analysis of COVID-19 dynamics. Numerical verification of system theoretical predictions was computed using in-built Runge-Kutta of order of precision 4 in a Mathcad surface. The set approach produces highly significant results in the main text. For example, while rapid population extinction was observed by the susceptible under off-treatment scenario in the first [Formula: see text] days, the application of non-pharmaceuticals at early stage of infection proved very effective strategy in curtailing the spread of the virus. Moreso, the implementation of dual pharmacotherapies in conjunction with non-pharmaceuticals yields tremendous rejuvenation of susceptible population ([Formula: see text]) with maximal reduction in the rates of isolation, super spreaders and hospitalization of the infectives. Thus, experimental results of investigation affirm the suitability of proposed model for the control and treatment of the deadly disease provided individuals adheres to treatment protocols.","output":"Global stability analysis of the role of multi-therapies and non-pharmaceutical treatment protocols for COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social pressure may have relevant consequences in many contexts but it is hard to evaluate it empirically In this paper we exploit a natural experiment in soccer to provide clear evidence of its effects We aim to study how social pressure from the crowd in a stadium affects both players and referees While in normal matches crowd support may be correlated to a host of variables affecting the outcome of interest, we exploit the fact that after the health emergency for the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, soccer matches in top European Leagues have been allowed only behind closed doors, that is, without spectators in the stadiums We use data of first and second division of five major European Leagues (Germany, Spain, England, Italy and Portugal) for the last 10 seasons and compare C using a differences-in-differences analysis C several outcomes (determined by players performance and referees decisions) of matches played with crowd support to the same outcomes when matches were played without crowd We find considerable effects of the pressure from the crowd: while with the support of the crowd a considerable home advantage emerges in various measures of performance (points, goals, shots, etc ), this advantage is almost halved when matches are played behind closed doors Similar effects are found for the behavior of referees: decisions of fouls, yellow cards, red cards and penalties that tend to favor home teams in normal matches, are much more balanced without the crowd pressing on referees The evidence we provide strongly supports the idea that social pressure has intense effects on agents behavior","output":"Social Pressure in the Stadiums: Do Agents Change Behavior without Crowd Support?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The University of Colorado family medicine residency watched along with the rest of the nation as the first cases of COVID-19 were being reported in the United States in March 2020.

The review included manuscripts which have not undergone rigorous peer-review process in view of the magnitude of the topic discussed. RESULTS: The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was significantly higher during the first week and peaked at 4-6 days after onset of symptoms, during which it can be potentially sampled. Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness. Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients. Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab. RECOMMENDATIONS: Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield.

METHODS: We reviewed the case records of patients admitted to the Persahabatan Hospital (RSP), Jakarta, Indonesia, with influenza A(H5N1) confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Twenty-two previously well patients, aged 3 to 47 years (median 24.5 years), were identified. All attended a clinic or hospital after a median of 2 days of illness (range 0C7). Times to first dose of oseltamivir (three died before receiving oseltamivir) were 2 to 12 days (median 7 days), administered mostly (n = 15) at RSP. Nineteen patients required mechanical ventilation. Deaths numbered 18 (case fatality = 82%) occurring within hours to 6 days of RSP admission, corresponding to 6 to 16 days of illness. Admission hyperglycemia ( 140 mg/dL), unrelated to steroids or known underlying diabetes mellitus, and elevated D-dimer levels (0.81C5.2 mg/L, upper limit of normal < 0.5 mg/L) were present in 14/21 (67%) and 20/21 (95%) patients, respectively. Fibrinogen concentrations were mostly low/normal at 129.9 to 517.9 mg/dL (median 241.1, normal 200C400 mg/dL), whereas C-reactive protein (9/11) and ferritin (6/8) levels were increased. Risk factors for death (univariate analysis) included: (1) increased D-dimers, (2) hyperglycema, (3) increased urea, (4) more extensive chest radiograph shadowing, and (5) lower admission oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and effective treatment of human influenza A(H5N1) infection remains challenging. Most patients were referred late with advanced disease. Oseltamivir had limited clinical impact. Elevated D-dimer levels, consistent with fibrinolysis, and hyperglycemia warrant more research to determine their underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment.","output":"Clinical Course of Avian Influenza A(H5N1) in Patients at the Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia, 2005C2008"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims: Even after two years of pandemic, there are still uncertainties on how to proceed when we schedule endoscopic procedures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some scientific societies recommended universal preprocedural testing for all patients. However, other societies recommended against and considered enough to maintain strict infection control strategies. Our aim was to evaluate this approach in order to see if it was safe for both patients and healthcare workers to proceed with the endoscopies without performing a systematic PCR on all patients. Methods: Retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing endoscopy without preprocedural COVID testing at our center from March 2020 to May 2021. PCR tests performed in the patients receiving an endoscopic procedure were analyzed, and patients who tested positive between 14 days before and after the endoscopic procedure were selected. The registry of the endoscopy unit members participating in these procedures was also analyzed. Results: A total of 10,132 procedures were performed in the unit with 26 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Nineteen of these procedures were performed in patients with unknown SARS-CoV-2 carrier status. In 23 (88.5%) cases, transmission occurred through social or familial contact, and in 3 (11.5%), transmission occurred in the hospital. Four health care workers became infected during this period and none of them were related to the endoscopic procedures performed in patients with COVID-19.

However, its anticancer mechanisms have not been clearly defined. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of 10-HDA in A549 human lung cancer cells. We used Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, scratch wound healing assay, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis to investigate its apoptotic effects and underlying mechanism. Our results showed that 10-HDA inhibited the proliferation of three types of human lung cancer cells and had no significant toxic effects on normal cells. Accompanying reactive oxygen species (ROS), 10-HDA induced A549 cell apoptosis by regulating mitochondrial-associated apoptosis, and caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in a time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, 10-HDA also regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) signaling pathways by increasing the expression levels of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p-p38, and I-B, and additionally, by decreasing the expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p-STAT3, and NF-B. These effects were blocked by MAPK inhibitors and N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Furthermore, 10-HDA inhibited cell migration by regulating transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-1), SNAI1, GSK-3, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin. Taken together, the results of this study showed that 10-HDA induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in A549 human lung cancer cells through ROS-mediated MAPK, STAT3, NF-B, and TGF-1 signaling pathways. Therefore, 10-HDA may be a potential therapy for human lung cancer.","output":"10-HDA Induces ROS-Mediated Apoptosis in A549 Human Lung Cancer Cells by Regulating the MAPK, STAT3, NF-B, and TGF-1 Signaling Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To identify and document the treatment experiences among patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in the context of the rapid move from in-person to telephone counseling due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Main outcome measure - Severe COVID-19, defined as cases with entry to critical care or fatal outcome. Results - Efficacy against severe COVID-19 of two doses of vaccine was 93% (95 percent CI 90% to 95%) in those without designated risk conditions, 89% (95 percent CI 85% to 92%) in those with moderate risk conditions, but only 66% (95 percent CI 52% to 76%) in those designated as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) and eligible for shielding.

We investigated the effects of ivabradine on post-resuscitation myocardial function in a porcine model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS AND RESULTS Ventricular fibrillation was induced and untreated for 8 minutes while defibrillation was attempted after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in anesthetized domestic swine. Then the animals were randomized into ivabradine and placebo groups (n = 5 each). Ivabradine and saline were administered at the same volume 5 minutes after ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation), followed by continuous intravenous infusion at 0.5 mg/kg for 480 minutes. Hemodynamic parameters were continuously recorded. Myocardial function was assessed by echocardiography at baseline and at 60, 120, 240, 480 minutes and 24 hours after resuscitation. The serum levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were measured by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Animals were killed 24 hours after resuscitation, and all myocardial tissue was removed for histopathological analysis. The heart rate was significantly reduced from 1 hour after resuscitation in the ivabradine group (all p < 0.05). The post-resuscitation mitral E/A and E/e' velocity ratios and left ventricular ejection fraction were significantly better in the ivabradine than placebo group (p < 0.05). The serum levels of myocardial injury biomarkers (NT-proBNP, cTnI) and the myocardial biopsy scores were significantly lower in the ivabradine than placebo group (p < 0.05). Neurological deficit scores were lower in the IVA group at PR 24 hours (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Ivabradine improved post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction, myocardial injury and post-resuscitation cerebral function, and also slowed the heart rate in this porcine model.","output":"Beneficial Effects of Ivabradine on Post-Resuscitation Myocardial Dysfunction In A Porcine Model of Cardiac Arrest."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"En este monogrfico se presentan 10 propuestas tericas sobre la forma en que la Psicologa Social puede potencialmente ayudar a afrontar la pandemia del COVID-19.

Furthermore, the gut microbiota plays a role in the maintenance of intestinal inflammation. Fortunately, several new drugs, in particular biologicals, have been approved for the treatment of CIBDs. The treatment of UC is mainly based on 5?aminosalicylic acid formulations, preferably as a topical form for distal colitis and proctitis as well as local budesonide formulations. In the case of extensive spread, high disease activity and refractory disease antibodies (biologicals) are successfully used, similar to CD. In addition to anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab), vedolizumab, an anti-integrin antibody and the interleukin 12/23 antibody ustekinumab can be successfully used. The intravenous and also subcutaneous administration of antibodies are increasing in importance and are now available for all forms. Furthermore, the Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib is an orally administered option for UC.

Healthcare systems which are unprepared to properly deal with crises are much more likely to expose their public health workers and health personnel to harm and will not be able to deliver healthcare provisions in critical situations. This can lead to a drammatic toll of deaths, even in developed countries. The possible occurrence of global crises has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to devise instruments, guidelines and tools to assess the capacity of countries to deal with disasters. Iran's health system has been hit hardly by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to assess its preparedness and response to the outbreak. Methods: The present investigation was designed as a qualitative study. We utilized the \\"COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan\\" devised by WHO as a conceptual framework. Results: The dimension/pillar which scored the highest was national laboratories, followed by surveillance, rapid response teams and case investigations. Risk communication and community engagement was another pillar receiving a high score, followed by infection prevention and control and by country-level coordination, planning and monitoring. The pillars/dimensions receiving the lowest scores were operational support and logistics; case management; and points of entry. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has represented an unprecedent event that has challenged healthcare systems and facilities worldwide, highlighting their weaknesses and the need for inter-sectoral cooperation and collaboration during the crisis.

In vitro and in vivo studies of GTV demonstrated that it was able to infect animal and human cell lines and could cause pathological lesions in mice. Glycoproteins (GP, including Gn and Gc) on the surface of Guertu virus (GTV) could bind to receptors on host cells and induce protective immunity in the host, but knowledge is now lacking on the information of B cell epitopes (BCEs) present on GTV-GP protein. The aim of this study was to identify all BCEs on Gn of the GTV DXM strain using rabbit pAbs against GTV-Gn. Seven fine BCEs and two antigenic peptides (APs) from nine reactive 16mer-peptides were identified, which are E(Gn)1 ((2)PIICEGLTHS(11)), E(Gn)2 ((135)CSQDSGT(141)), E(Gn)3 ((165)IP EDVF(170)), E(Gn)4 ((169)VFQEL K(174)), E(Gn)5 ((187)IDGILFN(193)), E(Gn)6 ((223)QTKWIQ(228)), E(Gn)7 ((237)CHKDGIGPC(245)), AP-8 ((299)GVRVRPKCYGFSRMMA(314)) and AP-9 ((355)CASH FCSSAESGKKNT(370)), of which six of mapped BCEs were recognized by the IgG-positive sheep serum obtained from sheep GTV-infected naturally.

Although a number of common genetic and epigenetic factors have been identified, the reviewed studies, which link these factors to various adverse health outcomes following Pb exposure, have provided somewhat inconsistent evidence of main health effects. Acknowledging the compelling need for new approaches could guide us to better characterize individual responses, predict potential adverse outcomes, and identify accurate and usable biomarkers for Pb exposure to improve mitigation therapies to reduce future adverse health outcomes of Pb exposure.","output":"Systemic review of genetic and epigenetic factors underlying differential toxicity to environmental lead (Pb) exposure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Pelargonium sidoides extracts and lactoferrin are two important natural, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral agents, which can interfere with the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Objective: To systematically evaluate the usage and accuracy of location-specific ICD10-CM codes for aSAH. Methods: We extracted all uses of ICD10-CM codes for non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (I60.x) during the first 3 years following the implementation of ICD10-CM from the billing module of the electronic health record (EHR) for UCHealth.

Utilizing a large set of local and international CXR images, we developed an AI model with high performance on temporal and external validation. Objective: Investigate real-time performance of an AI-enabled COVID-19 diagnostic support system across a 12-hospital system. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Labeled frontal CXR images (samples of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) from the M Health Fairview (Minnesota, USA), Valencian Region Medical ImageBank (Spain), MIMIC-CXR, Open-I 2013 Chest X-ray Collection, GitHub COVID-19 Image Data Collection (International), Indiana University (Indiana, USA), and Emory University (Georgia, USA) Participants: Internal (training, temporal, and real-time validation): 51,592 CXRs; Public: 27,424 CXRs; External (Indiana University): 10,002 CXRs; External (Emory University): 2002 CXRs Main Outcome and Measure: Model performance assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Precision-Recall curves, and F1 score. Results: Patients that were COVID-19 positive had significantly higher COVID-19 Diagnostic Scores (median .1 [IQR: 0.0-0.8] vs median 0.0 [IQR: 0.0-0.1], p < 0.001) than patients that were COVID-19 negative. Pre-implementation the AI-model performed well on temporal validation (AUROC 0.8) and external validation (AUROC 0.76 at Indiana U, AUROC 0.72 at Emory U). The model was noted to have unrealistic performance (AUROC > 0.95) using publicly available databases. Real-time model performance was unchanged over 19 weeks of implementation (AUROC 0.70). On subgroup analysis, the model had improved discrimination for patients with severe as compared to mild or moderate disease, p < 0.001. Model performance was highest in Asians and lowest in whites and similar between males and females.

Clinicopathological factors(patient-related 13 factors, treatment-related 6 factors, and tumor-related 4 factors)were compared, and the long-term results were also investigated. RESULTS: Between 42 cases in the normal group and 47 cases in the abnormal group, there were significant differences(p<0.05)in 6 factors: BMI, total protein, cholinesterase, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, and Onodera prognostic nutritional index. The long-term results(5-year survival rate)were also significantly different in the normal group(76.8%)and the abnormal group(51.6%)(p=0.007). CONCLUSION: Even in elderly patients with colorectal cancer, preoperative suppression of inflammatory conditions and improvement of nutritional status may contribute to the improvement of long-term prognosis, so mGPS evaluation is useful.","output":"[The Usefulness of Preoperative Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score Evaluation in Elderly Colorectal Cancer Cases]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, COVID-19 caused an overwhelming pandemic. To relieve overloaded Intensive Care Units in the most affected regions, French Ministry of Defence triggered collective Air Medical Evacuations (MEDEVAC) on-board of an Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport of the French Air Force. Such collective air MEDEVAC is a big challenge regarding biosafety, as until now, only evacuations of a single symptomatic patient with an emergent communicable disease, like Ebola virus disease, have been conducted. However, the COVID-19 pandemic required collective MEDEVAC for critically ill patients and involved a virus still little known. Thus, we performed a complete risk analysis using a process map and an FMECA (Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis) to assess the risk and implement mitigation measures for health workers, flight crew as well as for the environment. We reported the biosafety management experienced during six flights with a total of 36 critically ill COVID-19 positive patients transferred with no casualties whilst preserving both staffs and aircraft.","output":"Risk analysis by Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and biosafety management during collective medical air medical evacuation of critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of ivermectin (IVM) against SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in vitro, while several clinical studies suggest that it is efficacious and safe in reducing morbidity and mortality. Hydroxychloroquine H CQ, I VM and azithromycin AZM (HIA therapy) are being used in several low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where more expensive medications such as remdesivir are out of reach. In this study, we set out to compare the efficacy of IVM monotherapy with HIA combination therapy. Methods: This was a single-blind, randomized control trial of 2 parallel groups of COVID-19-positive Nigerians. Thirty patients received ivermectin 200 mcg/kg daily for five days, while 31 patients received HIA triple therapy. The viral cycle threshold (Ct) at pretreatment baseline and days 2, 5 14 and 21 were measured for the E- and N-genes.

Despite all the available resources, there have been several challenges in keeping up with the practices in Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) risk management. The aim of this study is to explore Primary Care Physicians (PCP) perceptions on barriers to CVD risk management and strategies to overcome these barriers in Suva, Fiji. METHODS: This is a qualitative study conducted in the Suva Medical area among 7 health centers from August 1st to September 30th, 2021. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants who provided in-depth and detailed information. From those physicians who worked in the Suva medical area as Primary Health Care (PHC) physicians, those who had at least 6 months experience and those who had some Special Outpatients Department (SOPD) exposure, in-depth interview was conducted using semi-structured questionnaire over the telephone and recorded in a mobile app. The interview content was then transcribed and thematic analysis was done. RESULTS: This study included 25 PHC physicians. From the thematic analysis, 2 major themes were developed including perceived barriers to CVD risk management and some of the strategies to overcome these barriers. Some of the barriers identified include patient factors such as non-compliance, physician factors such as time-constraints and lack of training, and health system factors such as poor medical records system and lack of basic resource. The strategic support systems include patient expectations, physicians encouragement, utilization of resources, laws and legislations and continuing evidence-based medicine. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians perceptions on the barriers and the strategies to overcome those barriers in CVD risk management plays an important role. The barriers include those of physician factors, patient factors and the health system as a whole. It is suggested to encourage shared-decision making in CVD management, enhance physician support and reinforce policies and research to bring about positive change and improvements in the quality of care.","output":"Patients would probably be more compliant to therapy if encouraged by those around them: a qualitative study exploring primary care physicians perceptions on barriers to CVD risk management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that in April 2020, screening tests for breast cancer decreased by 87% and 84% for cervical cancer, compared to the averages of the previous 5-year for the same month. In response to this finding, the Puerto Rico Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Program (PR-BCCPEDP), in collaboration with the Cooperative Extension Program (CEP), implemented an educational intervention of breast and cervical cancer in the northeast region of the island. The intervention aimed to reinforce knowledge in the early detection of breast and cervical cancer, increase screening tests, and reach out to women without health insurance who may qualify for the Program. Methodology: Since 2017, the PR-BCCPEDP agreed with the CEP to implement educational interventions for breast and cervical cancer in 4 of CEP's regions throughout the island. From February to May 2021, seven CEP Family and Consumer Educators (EFC) carried out 8 educational activities with 182 participants in the island's northeast region. We collected age, town of residence, level of education, health insurance, breast and cervical cancer screening history, and the reasons for not having performed screening tests according to the recommended guidelines. The educational activities were performed virtually through an educational PowerPoint and face-to-face using flip charts. The topics included breast and cervical cancer statistics, risk factors, symptoms, early detection guidelines, myths and facts, and barriers to not having screening tests. Participants that didn't have the screening tests according to the recommended guidelines had follow-up calls. Results: A total of 182 women participated in the intervention, with an average age of 47 years;most participants had a high school degree (42%), and 59% had the government's health plan. Regarding screening tests, 35.1% reported that they had not had a mammogram in the last two years, 73.4% authorized to be contacted after the intervention. Similarly, Pap tests, 30.7% reported that they had not had a Pap test in the last three years, of which 87.5% authorized to be contacted. Of the participants who had not had a mammogram (35.1%) or Pap test (30.7%), the main reason was the COVID-19 Pandemic (22.9% and 21.8%, respectively). Regarding the participants referred to the PR-BCCPEDP, 3.6% of the women without health insurance were referred to the Program and of these, 50% were recruited. Conclusion: Despite security, restrictions from the Pandemic, collaborations with community-based programs helped to reach a greater number of women to provide education and awareness about breast and cervical cancer. In terms of breast and cervical cancer screening, more than a third of the participants had not had their mammogram or Pap done due to the Pandemic.

We examined perception of and motivation to conduct research in physicians (residents) specializing in care of older adults. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Residents of an academic medical centre in the Netherlands enrolled in a 3-year training programme. The programme includes a mandatory evidence-based medicine (EBM) training study on pain and discomfort in cognitively impaired nursing home patients, in which residents perform their research over the 3-year duration of the programme. We employed a mixed-methods design with survey and qualitative interviews (December 2019CApril 2020). The survey included validated scales with agreement response options rated 1C7. Qualitative interviews were underpinned by interpretative phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: Of 38 invited residents, 23 (15 females) participated. The mean score on perceptions of research was 4.1 (SD 0.8); on intrinsic motivation 4.8 (SD 1.0); on extrinsic motivation 4.3, with a higher SD of 1.4. Eight interviews also showed diversity in the extent to which residents felt equipped to conduct the mandatory EBM training study, and research more generally, which was related to previous experiences performing research. The residents generally did not anticipate conducting research themselves despite recognizing the benefits of training in research. CONCLUSION: Perceptions and motivation of the residents specializing in care of older people to conduct research, although considered relevant to their practice, were not very positive. The study results in recommendations to motivate physicians in geriatrics training to conduct research, eg through personalized boosting of self-efficacy. This is crucial to motivate future physicians to contribute to research relevant to older people in more ways than just delivering data for research conceived by (non-clinical) researchers.","output":"Perceptions and Motivation Regarding Performing Research in Physicians Specializing in Care for Older Adults Involved in a Mandatory Evidence-Based Medicine Training Study: A Mixed-Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has wrecked havoc on the mankind and caused dramatic disruptions in personal and professional lives of the people. With economies at the verge of collapse, businesses pushed to a standstill, forced alterations in work environment, and uncertainty about the future, this global health crisis has severely impacted employees and organizations. The virus has not only impacted employees physically but also psychologically as they experienced plethora of intense emotional fluctuations. In this regard, the present study aims to synthesize and analyze the existing literature on the subject and present a conceptual framework to aid understanding of the emotional repercussions of pandemic for employees and organizations at large. The extensive review of literature suggests that the perilous crisis resulted in numerous negative emotional outcomes which majorly converge into three i.e. stress, burnout, and depression. This emotional turmoil gets further reflected in employees' performance at work and thus a conceptual model is developed to holistically capture and present such varied impacts of pandemic on employees. The study also posits that the deleterious emotional impacts can have grave ramifications for the organizations and thus, seek immediate attention of the organizational leaders, managers, and policy makers. Against this backdrop, the practical implications of the study are mentioned and recommendations are made, that may help employees and organizations to survive and sustain any such future crisis situations. ? 2021 International Journal of Occupational Safety and Health.

Here, we describe the development and assessment of 100-nm liposomes that are tailored for pulmonary delivery for treating ARDS, as a model for lung diseases. The liposomal lipid composition (primarily DPPC) was optimized to mimic the lung surfactant composition, and the drug loading process of both methylprednisolone (MPS), a steroid, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a mucolytic agent, reached an encapsulation efficiency of 98% and 92%, respectively. In vitro, treating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages with the liposomes decreased TNF and nitric oxide (NO) secretion, while NAC increased the penetration of nanoparticles through the mucus. In vivo, we used LPS-induced lung inflammation model to assess the accumulation and therapeutic efficacy of the liposomes in C57BL/6 mice, either by intravenous (IV), endotracheal (ET) or IV plus ET nanoparticles administrations. Using both administration methods, liposomes exhibited an increased accumulation profile in the inflamed lungs over 48 h. Interestingly, while IV-administrated liposomes distributed widely throughout the lung, ET liposomes were present in lungs parenchyma but were not detected at some distal regions of the lungs, possibly due to imperfect airflow regimes. Twenty hours after the different treatments, lungs were assessed for markers of inflammation. We found that the nanoparticle treatment had a superior therapeutic effect compared to free drugs in treating ARDS, reducing inflammation and TNF, IL-6 and IL-1 cytokine secretion in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and that the combined treatment, delivering nanoparticles IV and ET simultaneously, had the best outcome of all treatments. Interestingly, also the DPPC lipid component alone played a therapeutic role in reducing inflammatory markers in the lungs. Collectively, we show that therapeutic nanoparticles accumulate in inflamed lungs holding potential for treating lung disorders. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study we compare intravenous versus intratracheal delivery of nanoparticles for treating lung disorders, specifically, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). By co-loading two medications into lipid nanoparticles, we were able to reduce both inflammation and mucus secretion in the inflamed lungs. Both modes of delivery resulted in high nanoparticle accumulation in the lungs, intravenously administered nanoparticles reached lung endothelial while endotracheal delivery reached lung epithelial. Combining both delivery approaches simultaneously provided the best ARDS treatment outcome.","output":"Lung targeted liposomes for treating ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Currently, there are neither systematic data nor clinical guidelines for checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in cancer patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic In this respect classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) is no exception The article deals with the experience of Pirogov Medical Center (NI Pirogov Russian National Medical Center of Surgery) in PD-1-inhibitor immunotherapy in relapsed/refractory cHL in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic The authors endeavour to cover matters of current interest concerning immunotherapy and differential diagnosis of pulmonary adverse events emerging in the context of new realities in providing medical care to cancer patients Aim To assess feasibility and safety of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in relapsed/refractory cHL in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic Materials & Methods This is a retrospective analysis of adverse events, mortality and COVID-19 incidence in 50 cHL patients who received immunotherapy at the Pirogov Medical Center in the period of spring COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 Results During the reported period (from March 11, 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, to May 25, 2020) the group of 50 cHL patients showed relatively low overall incidence rate of newly diagnosed immune-mediated adverse events (14 %;n = 7) Severe adverse events were identified in 2 (4 %) patients Bacterial infection incidence was 6 % (n = 3) Clinical signs of corona virus confirmed by subsequent laboratory COVID-19 tests were observed in 2 (4 %) patients One patient died due to the non-COVID-19-associated reason The main issue the center's staff was faced with was the need for differential diagnosis between drug-induced (as well as immune-mediated) pulmonitis and COVID-19-associated pneumonia Conclusion The retrospective analysis reveals that PD-1inhibitor immunotherapy in cHL patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is a feasible method of therapy, but it requires high awareness Special focus should be given to clinical and radiological similarities of COVID-19-associated pneumonia and pulmonitis as a complication of immunotherapy ? 2020 Practical Medicine Publishing House All rights reserved","output":"The use of checkpoint inhibitors in classical hodgkin's lymphoma during the covid-19 pandemic (Pirogov medical center's experience)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION The PFDB (Protein Family Database) is a new database designed to integrate protein family-related data with relevant functional and genomic data. It currently manages biological data for three projects-the CATH protein domain database (Orengo et al., 1997; Pearl et al., 2001), the VIDA virus domains database (Alb et al., 2001) and the Gene3D database (Buchan et al., 2001). The PFDB has been designed to accommodate protein families identified by a variety of sequence based or structure based protocols and provides a generic resource for biological research by enabling mapping between different protein families and diverse biochemical and genetic data, including complete genomes. RESULTS A characteristic feature of the PFDB is that it has a number of meta-level entities (for example aggregation, collection and inclusion) represented as base tables in the final design. The explicit representation of relationships at the meta-level has a number of advantages, including flexibility-both in terms of the range of queries that can be formulated and the ability to integrate new biological entities within the existing design. A potential drawback with this approach-poor performance caused by the number of joins across meta-level tables-is avoided by implementing the PFDB with materialized views using the mature relational database technology of Oracle 8i. The resultant database is both fast and flexible.

Reported superspreading events analyzed within this framework point towards aerosol mediated transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Virion exposure calculated for these events is found to trace out a single value, suggesting a universal minimum infective dose (MID) via aerosol that is comparable to the MIDs measured for other respiratory viruses; thus, the consistent infectious exposure levels and their commensurability to known aerosol-MIDs establishes the plausibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we found that TGEV infection severely disrupted intestinal homeostasis via inhibition of self-renewal and differentiation in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Profoundly, TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex-mediated the inactivation of Notch signaling provided a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Initial invasions by TGEV-targeted Paneth cells through aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor, then inducing mitochondrial damage and ROS generation in them, ultimately causing Paneth cell decrease and loss of Notch factors (DII4 and Hes5), which are essential for Lgr5 ISCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interestingly, loss of Notch signaling induced goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive enterocytes and promoted mucins secretion, which accelerated TGEV replication. Therefore, the more differentiation of goblet cells, the greater TGEV infection in jejunum. These results provide a detailed mechanistic pathway by which villous atrophy sharply occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum within 48 h. Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a bottom up scenario, which is contrary to the traditional top down hypothesis.

Autonomic neurons link the brain with the gastrointestinal tract and constitute a likely pathway for peripheral metabolic challenges to affect behaviors controlled by the brain. The activities of neurons along these pathways are regulated by glia, which exhibit phenotypic shifts in response to changes in their microenvironment. How glial changes might contribute to the behavioral effects of consuming a high-fat diet (HFD) is uncertain. Here, we tested the hypothesis that anxiogenic and depressive-like behaviors driven by consuming a HFD involve compromised duodenal barrier integrity and subsequent phenotypic changes to glia and neurons along the gut-brain axis. METHODS C57Bl/6 male mice were exposed to a standard diet or HFD for 20 weeks. Bodyweight was monitored weekly and correlated with mucosa histological damage and duodenal expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin at 0, 6, and 20 weeks. The expression of GFAP, TLR-4, BDNF, and DCX were investigated in duodenal myenteric plexus, nodose ganglia, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus at the same time points. Dendritic spine number was measured in cultured neurons isolated from duodenal myenteric plexuses and hippocampi at weeks 0, 6, and 20. Depressive and anxiety behaviors were also assessed by tail suspension, forced swimming, and open field tests. RESULTS HFD mice exhibited duodenal mucosa damage with marked infiltration of immune cells and decreased expression of ZO-1 and occludin that coincided with increasing body weight. Glial expression of GFAP and TLR4 increased in parallel in the duodenal myenteric plexuses, nodose ganglia, and hippocampus in a time-dependent manner. Glial changes were associated with a progressive decrease in BDNF, and DCX expression, fewer neuronal dendritic spines, and anxiogenic/depressive symptoms in HFD-treated mice. Fluorocitrate (FC), a glial metabolic poison, abolished these effects both in the enteric and central nervous systems and prevented behavioral alterations at week 20. CONCLUSIONS HFD impairs duodenal barrier integrity and produces behavioral changes consistent with depressive and anxiety phenotypes. HFD-driven changes in both peripheral and central nervous systems are glial-dependent, suggesting a potential glial role in the alteration of the gut-brain signaling that occurs during metabolic disorders and psychiatric co-morbidity.","output":"High-fat diet impairs duodenal barrier function and elicits glia-dependent changes along the gut-brain axis that are required for anxiogenic and depressive-like behaviors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Limited experimental and clinical evidence suggests a potential role for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir in treating COVID19. we aim to evaluate the efficacy of generic sofosbuvir/daclatasvir in treating COVID-19 patients with pneumonia.

Equal channel angular extrusion/pressing (ECAE/ECAP) is an effective technique to severely deform material and refine grains, however, the drawback is that a continuous process on sheet metal is confined due to the process mechanism. Equal channel angular drawing (ECAD), a continuous strip drawing process, has limitations in achieving grain refinement because drawing is a stretching phenomenon contrary to an extrusion or pressing process. In the present work, experiments were conducted on interstitial-free (IF) steel to demonstrate that grain refinement of thin sheets can be achieved through pack extrusion; and while there was shear deformation, ECAD failed to produce UFG microstructure.

Unfortunately, there is no acceptable medical treatment for spinal cord injury (SCI) yet. In our study, we investigated the neuropeotective effects of AM leaf extract on SCI in an experimental rat model. METHODS A total of 40 Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into five equal groups (n=8). Group 1 was the control group in which only laminectomy was performed. Trauma was induced in four groups after laminectomy. Group 2 (untreated trauma group) was given no medication. In Group 3, a single intraperitoneal dose of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) was administered after trauma. The rats in Groups 4 received a low dose (100 mg/kg) of AM leaf extracts by oral gavage one week before trauma while the rats in Group 5 received a high-dose (300 mg/kg) of these extracts by oral gavage one week before trauma. All rats, including the control group, were sacrificed 24 h after the trauma was created. RESULTS Tissue samples taken to evaluate the neuroprotective effect were examined biochemically and histopathologically. Inflam-matory findings in the trauma group were significantly better in both groups treated with AM. There was no difference between the groups in terms of clinical motor examination and inclined plane test results. CONCLUSION Our histopathological and biochemical results showed that AM is an agent with neuroprotective effects in trau-matic SCI.","output":"Efficacy of Annona muricata (graviola) in experimental spinal cord injury: biochemical and histopathological analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) calls for and welcomes possible treatment strategies using drugs on the market. It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D structures of key viral proteins are resolved. The virus causing COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2. Taking advantage of a recently released crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with a covalently bonded inhibitor, N3 (Liu et al., 10.2210/pdb6LU7/pdb), I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials. For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an end point method called MM-PBSA-WSAS (molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area/weighted solvent-accessible surface area; Wang, Chem. Rev. 2019, 119, 9478; Wang, Curr. Comput.-Aided Drug Des. 2006, 2, 287; Wang; ; Hou J. Chem. Inf. Model., 2012, 52, 1199). Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including carfilzomib, eravacycline, valrubicin, lopinavir, and elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anticancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, -13.8 kcal/mol. The second-best repurposing drug candidate, eravacycline, is synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic. Streptomycin, another antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (-3.8 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (-7.9 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of -12.9 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor-ligand binding were identified. I found that one hot spot residue, His41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The findings of this study can facilitate rational drug design targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.","output":"Fast Identification of Possible Drug Treatment of Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) through Computational Drug Repurposing Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To explore the role of calpain and its signaling pathway in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), animal models of endotoxemia were established by administration of LPS to mice with endothelial-specific Capn4 knockout (TEK/Capn4-/-), mice with calpastatin (an endogenous calpain inhibitor) overexpression (Tg-CAST) and mice with myeloid-specific Capn4 knockout (LYZ/Capn4-/-). Mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs) were used as a model of the microvascular endothelium and were stimulated with LPS. Renal function, renal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) expression, cellular apoptosis, plasma and renal levels of NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members (p38, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2) were examined. Moreover, a calpain inhibitor, calpastatin overexpression adenoviruses and MAPK inhibitors were used. Significant renal dysfunction was induced by LPS stimulation, and recovery was observed in TEK/Capn4-/- and Tg-CAST mice but not in LYZ/Capn4-/- mice. Endothelial Capn4 knockout also abrogated the LPS-induced increases in renal iNOS expression, caspase-3 activity and apoptosis and plasma and renal NO and ROS levels but did not obviously affect renal eNOS expression. Moreover, LPS increased both calpain and caspase-3 activity, and only the expression of iNOS in PMECs was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. Inhibiting calpain activity or p38 phosphorylation alleviated the increased iNOS expression, NO/ROS production, and cellular apoptosis induced by LPS. These results suggest that endothelial calpain plays a protective role in LPS-induced AKI by inhibiting p38 phosphorylation, thus attenuating iNOS expression and further decreasing NO and ROS overproduction-induced endothelial apoptosis.","output":"Protective role of endothelial calpain knockout in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute kidney injury via attenuation of the p38-iNOS pathway and NO/ROS production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: Antiviral antibodies in dogs in the Netherlands A collection of more than 700 canine sera, coming from open and closed populations and from kennels with frequent neonatal mortality, were screened for the prevalence of antibodies to canine adenoviruses, canine herpesvirus, polyoma virus, REOviruses, parainfluenza viruses, equine influenza viruses and vomiting and wasting disease virus of pigs.

Default occurs either the first time a signaling process breaches a threshold barrier or unexpectedly at the first jump of a Cox process. The intensity of default depends on the risk-free interest rate, which follows a Vasicek process, instead of a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process as in the original model. This offers two advantages. On the one hand, it allows us to account for negative interest rates which are recently observed, on the other hand, it simplifies the formula for pricing CDSs. The goodness of fit of the model is tested using a dataset of CDS credit spreads related to European companies. The results obtained show a rather satisfactory agreement between theoretical predictions and market data, which is identical to the one obtained with the original model. In addition, the values of the calibrated parameters result to be stable over time and the semi-closed form solution ensures a very fast implementation.","output":"A revised version of the Cathcart & El-Jahel model and its application to CDS market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Major depressive episodes in bipolar disorder are common and debilitating. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is well established in the treatment of major depressive disorder, and the intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) protocol is replacing conventional protocols because of noninferiority and reduced delivery time. However, iTBS has not been adequately studied in bipolar disorder and, therefore, its efficacy is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether iTBS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) is safe and efficacious in the treatment of acute bipolar depression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a double-blind, 4-week, randomized clinical trial of iTBS targeting the LDLPFC. Two Canadian academic centers recruited patients between 2016 and 2020. Adults with bipolar disorder type I or type II experiencing an acute major depressive episode were eligible if they had not benefited from a first-line treatment for acute bipolar depression recommended by the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments and were currently treated with a mood stabilizer, an atypical antipsychotic, or their combination. Seventy-one participants were assessed for eligibility, and 37 were randomized to daily sham iTBS or active iTBS using a random number sequence, stratified according to current pharmacotherapy. Data analysis was performed from April to September 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Four weeks of daily active iTBS (120% resting motor threshold) or sham iTBS to the LDLPFC. Nonresponders were eligible for 4 weeks of open-label iTBS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale from baseline to study end. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, remission, and treatment-emergent mania or hypomania. RESULTS: The trial was terminated for futility after 37 participants (23 women [62%]; mean [SD] age, 43.86 [13.87] years; age range, 20-68 years) were randomized, 19 to sham iTBS and 18 to active iTBS. There were no significant differences in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score changes (least squares mean difference between groups, ?1.36 [95% CI, ?8.92 to 6.19; P = .91] in favor of sham iTBS), and rates of clinical response were low in both the double-blind phase (3 of 19 participants [15.8%] in the sham iTBS group and 3 of 18 participants [16.7%] in the active iTBS group) and open-label phase (5 of 21 participants [23.8%]). One active iTBS participant had a treatment emergent hypomania, and a second episode occurred during open-label treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: iTBS targeting the LDLPFC is not efficacious in the treatment of acute bipolar depression in patients receiving antimanic or mood stabilizing agents. Additional research is required to understand how transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment protocols differ in efficacy between unipolar and bipolar depression.

We propose a novel model that expands on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation by modeling strong dependence among the words in the same document, with user-level topic distributions. We also simultaneously cluster users, removing the need for post-hoc cluster estimation and improving topic estimation by shrinking noisy user-level topic distributions towards typical values.

METHODS: Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for all peer-reviewed articles with relevant keywords including \\"Zoster,\\" \\"Herpes,\\" and \\"COVID-19\\" from their inception to November 20, 2021. RESULTS: A total of 19 articles with three observational studies and 16 case reports or series were included. Primary VZV infections or reactivation were observed in 25 patients. Forty-eight percent of the patients had disseminated VZV infection. The median time of VZV-related rash after the onset of respiratory symptoms was 7.0 days (interquartile range: 0-18.8). Those with COVID-19 and primary VZV infection or reactivation had low lymphocyte counts with a median of 0.67  103 /l. CONCLUSION: This scoping review identified uncertainty and a lack of strong evidence to see the association between primary VZV infection or reactivation and COVID-19. However, those with COVID-19 may be more likely to have disseminated VZV, which poses an additional challenge from an infection prevention standpoint.

As a consequence, many people relocated from these regions' worst-affected neighborhoods to Khulna city, and began to live as slum dwellers. They faced a variety of issues in these informal settlements, particularly regarding water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities and livelihood options, but no research has been conducted in Bangladesh. With an emphasis on WASH services and livelihood prospects, this study therefore aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges/hardships and needs of climate migrants living in urban slums in both general and COVID-19 contexts. Qualitative methods were applied to collect data from the climate migrants of slums in five wards (3, 12, 17, 21, and 30) of the Khulna City Corporation. Nine focus group discussions and four key informant interviews were conducted to collect the data from primary (community people) and secondary (local government and non-government and community-based organizations officials) stakeholders. The thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that climate migrants experienced significant water scarcity, insufficient drainage systems, a lack of toilets, tube wells, and bathing facilities, inadequate hygiene management, a lack of core skills required for urban jobs, low payment, and an income shortage. Similarly, sustainable drinking water sources, sanitary toilets with WASH blocks, personal hygiene materials and awareness building, skill development for diverse livelihood opportunities, and income-generating capacity development were their top priorities. Overall, the findings of this study provided a holistic overview of the challenges/hardships and needs of climate migrants in urban slums regarding WASH services and livelihood opportunities.

Persons with dementia and their family caregivers are particularly vulnerable due to the deleterious impact of social isolation on both dementia symptoms and caregiver burden. One of the greatest challenges for dementia patients has been accessing dementia care services during COVID\\\\19 lockdowns. In the Pacific island of Guam, the pandemic quickly led to the closure of senior centers, adult day care centers, family caregiver support programs, and other social services for older adults and their families in March 2020. As a result, persons with dementia suddenly found themselves isolated at home and dependent upon family members to provide round\\\\the\\\\clock care. This presentation will describe the development of an innovative telehealth outreach program that was launched in Guam in the summer of 2020, three months after the first COVID\\\\19 case had appeared on the island. The program was designed to provide improved access to social support and specialized community services for persons with dementia and their family caregivers. There are four components: (1) virtual family caregiver support groups where participants can share the stresses and challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia with others who are going through similar experiences; (2) virtual presentation and consultation sessions led by dementia care specialists from the community providing easy access to dementia care information and services; (3) 24/7 family caregiver support networks through mobile messaging apps to mitigate social isolation and ensure the availability of support in times of crisis; and (4) telehealth family counseling for persons with dementia and their family members employing narrative approaches that embrace the oral storytelling traditions of Pacific island cultures. The community response has been strong with approximately 50\\\\60 family caregivers and persons with dementia participating in the program monthly. Project outcomes suggest that telehealth outreach services represent an effective and sustainable approach to connecting persons living with dementia and their family caregivers to community resources during times of isolation.","output":"Telehealth outreach programming in the Pacific island of Guam: Providing access to dementia care support services during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance in the Netherlands is comparatively low, inappropriate prescription of antibiotics is substantial, mainly for respiratory tract infections (RTIs). General practitioners (GPs) experience pressure from patients with an immigration background to prescribe antibiotics and have difficulty communicating in a culturally sensitive way. Multifaceted interventions including communication skills training for GPs are shown to be most effective in reducing antibiotic prescription. The PARCA study aims to reduce the number of antibiotic prescriptions for RTIs through implementing a culturally sensitive communication intervention for GPs and evaluate it in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A non-blinded RCT including 58 GPs (29 for each arm). The intervention consists of: (1) An E-learning with 4 modules of 10C15 min each; (2) A face-to-face training session in (intercultural) communication skills including role plays with a training actor and (3) Availability of informative patient-facing materials that use simple words (A2/B1 level) in multiple languages. The primary outcome measure is the number of dispensed antibiotic courses qualifying for RTIs in primary care, per 1000 registered patients. The secondary outcome measure is the number of all dispensed antibiotic courses, per 1000 registered patients. The intervention arm will receive the training in Autumn 2021, followed by an observation period of 6 winter months for which numbers of antibiotics will be collected for both trial arms.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the influence of time pressure on the emotional exhaustion of front-line healthcare workers, and explore the effects of social sharing and cognitive reappraisal on this. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2020. A total of 232 questionnaires were completed by front-line healthcare workers in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Hierarchical linear regression and conditional process analysis were performed to explore the relationships among time pressure, social sharing, cognitive reappraisal, and emotional exhaustion. RESULTS: Time pressure was positively associated with social sharing and emotional exhaustion. Social sharing presented the dark side, a negative effect that was always kept concealed, in terms of the impact on emotional exhaustion. Cognitive reappraisal negatively moderated the relationship between time pressure and social sharing, and it further indirectly influenced the relationship between time pressure and emotional exhaustion through social sharing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on how time pressure influences the emotional exhaustion of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 period. Although social sharing is commonly regarded as a positive behavior, we identified a dark side in terms of its impact. We also identified that improving cognitive reappraisal may present a positive strategy toward alleviating emotional exhaustion.","output":"Emotional exhaustion in front-line healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China: the effects of time pressure, social sharing and cognitive appraisal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health care workers are at the frontline in the fight against infectious disease, and as a result are at a high risk of infection. During the 2014C2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many health care workers contracted Ebola, some fatally. However, no members of the Chinese Anti-Ebola medical team, deployed to provide vital medical care in Liberia were infected. This study aims to understand how this zero infection rate was achieved. METHODS: Data was collected through 15 in-depth interviews with participants from the Peoples Liberation Army of China medical team which operated the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center from October 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia. Data were analysed using systematic framework analysis. RESULTS: This study found numerous bio-psycho-socio-behavioural risk factors that directly or indirectly threatened the health of the medical team working in the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center. These factors included social and emotional stress caused by: (1) the disruption of family and social networks; (2) adapting to a different culture; (3) and anxiety over social and political unrest in Liberia. Exposure to Ebola from patients and local co-workers, and the incorrect use of personal protective equipment due to fatigue was another major risk factor. Other risk factors identified were: (1) shortage of supplies; (2) lack of trained health personnel; (3) exposure to contaminated food and water; (4) and long working hours. Comprehensive efforts were taken throughout the mission to mitigate these factors. Every measure was taken to prevent the medical teams exposure to the Ebola virus, and to provide the medical team with safe, comfortable working and living environments. There were many challenges in maintaining the health safety of the team, such as the limited capability of the emergency command system (the standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of an emergency response), and the lack of comprehensive international protocols for dealing with emerging infectious disease pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive and multidisciplinary measures employed to protect the health of the medical team proved successful even in Liberias resource-limited setting. The global health community can learn valuable lessons from this experience which could improve the safety of health care workers in future emergencies. These lessons include: establishing capable command systems; implementing effective coordination mechanisms; providing adequate equipment; providing training for medical teams; investing in the development of global health professionals; and improving research on ways to protect health care workers.

The antioxidants cysteine and mannitol were included to prevent accumulation of NAPQI. In addition, animals were exposed to a cassette of common stress factors: an inflammatory diet, psychological stress, antibiotics, and mock infections using killed bacteria. At age 37C49 days, observation during introduction to a novel conspecific revealed increased rearing behavior, an asocial activity, in animals treated with acetaminophen plus antioxidants, regardless of their exposure to oxidative stress factors (2-way ANOVA; P < 0.0001). This observation would suggest that the initial hypothesis is incorrect, and that oxidative stress mediators do not entirely eliminate the effects of acetaminophen on neurodevelopment. This study provides additional cause for caution when considering the use of acetaminophen in the pediatric population, and provides evidence that the effects of acetaminophen on neurodevelopment need to be considered both in the presence and in the absence of oxidative stress.","output":"Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen with co-administration of cysteine and mannitol during early development result in long term behavioral changes in laboratory rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several vaccines against COVID-19 have now been developed and are already being rolled out around the world. The decision whether or not to get vaccinated has so far been left to the individual citizens. However, there are good reasons, both in theory as well as in practice, to believe that the willingness to get vaccinated might not be sufficiently high to achieve herd immunity. A policy of mandatory vaccination could ensure high levels of vaccination coverage, but its legitimacy is doubtful. We investigate the willingness to get vaccinated and the reasons for an acceptance (or rejection) of a policy of mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 in June and July 2020 in Germany based on a representative real time survey, a random sub-sample (SOEP-CoV) of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our results show that about 70 percent of adults in Germany would voluntarily get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine without side effects was available. About half of residents of Germany are in favor, and half against, a policy of mandatory vaccination. The approval rate for mandatory vaccination is significantly higher among those who would get vaccinated voluntarily (around 60 percent) than among those who would not get vaccinated voluntarily (27 percent). The individual willingness to get vaccinated and acceptance of a policy of mandatory vaccination correlates systematically with socio-demographic and psychological characteristics of the respondents. We conclude that as far as people's declared intentions are concerned, herd immunity could be reached without a policy of mandatory vaccination, but that such a policy might be found acceptable too, were it to become necessary.","output":"Attitudes on voluntary and mandatory vaccination against COVID-19: Evidence from Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited data are available on the clinical presentation and outcomes of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients in the United States hospitalized under normal-caseload or nonsurge conditions.

However, the use of antibiotics can only resolve the urinary symptoms but not reduce the frequency of urinary symptoms recurrence, and meanwhile increasing rates of adverse effect of repetitive antimicrobial therapy and bacterial antimicrobial resistance became clinical concerns. This case report aims to present a case of recurrent cystitis treated by electroacupuncture (EA) in reducing recurrent frequency, amount of antibiotics used and urinary symptoms. Case presentation: A 42-year-old woman diagnosed with recurrent cystitis for five years presented mainly with recurrent dysuria, urine frequency and urgency. She received EA treatment 3 to 5 sessions a week and 30 min per session from August 2019 to August 2020 with 3-month suspension due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the treatment, both the frequency of recurrent urinary episode and symptoms were reduced. Although there was some fluctuation, the mean frequencies of daytime voiding reduced dramatically from 17.7 to 8.3, and night-time voiding from 4 to 1, and the number of voiding with moderate urgency was reduced from 17.7 to 2.3, and severe urgency dropped from 2.7 to 0. The patient's scores of overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) and overactive bladder questionnaire short form (OAB-q SF) were also improved. The postvoid residual urine volume (PVR) reduced from 42 mL to less than 10 mL.

This study assessed resilience and its associations with HRQoL, life satisfaction, anxiety and depression in patients with pulmonary diseases receiving ambulatory oxygen therapy. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 42 patients with pulmonary diseases receiving ambulatory oxygen therapy. The patients completed the following questionnaires at baseline and after one and three months; the Resilience Scale-25, the Life Satisfaction Scale-4, the 15D instrument of HRQoL, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST 2.0). To compare HRQoL, we recruited age- and gender-matched controls from the general population (n = 3574). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with low resilience. RESULTS: Half (42C48%) of the patients had low resilience, which was correlated with low HRQoL, low levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety and depression. Patients had very low HRQoL compared to controls. Dissatisfaction with life increased during the 3-months follow-up, but only a few patients had anxiety or depression. Patient satisfaction with assistive technology was high; the median QUEST 2.0 score (scale 1C5) was 4.00 at baseline, 3.92 at one month and 3.88 at three months.

Several hypotheses try to explain age-related differences in disease presentation and severity. Possible reasons for milder presentations in children as compared to adults include frequent contact to seasonal coronaviruses, presence of cross-reactive antibodies, and/or co-clearance with other viruses.

METHODS: A scoping review using the design by Arksey and O'Malley. EMBASE, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PSYCHinfo searched using terms relating to palliative care, qualitative research, and supplementary support interventions. Articles were imported into Endnote?, and Covidence? was used by two reviewers to assess against inclusion criteria.

RESULTS: Sixty included articles focused on advance care planning, guided conversations, and volunteer befriending services. Four concepts were identified: enriching relationships; greater autonomy and perceived control; knowing more; and improved mental health. Mapping concepts to contender tool items revealed issues of relevance and redundancy. Some tools had no redundant items but mapped only to two of four outcome themes; others mapped to all concepts, but with many redundant questions. Tools such as ICECAP-Supportive Care Measure and McGill Quality of Life had high relevance and low redundancy.

It emerged as a global pandemic early in 2020, affecting more than 2000 countries and territories. The infection is highly contagious with disease transmission reported from asymptomatic carriers, including children. It spreads through person-to-person contact, via aerosol and droplets. The practice of social distancing C maintaining a distance of 1 C 2 meters or 6 feet -- between people has been widely recommended to slow or halt the spread. This places orthodontists at high risk of acquiring and transmitting the infection. The objective of this review is to report to orthodontists on the emergence, epidemiology, risks, and precautions during disease crisis. This should help increase awareness, reinforce infection control and prevent cross-transmission within the orthodontic facility. Methods A comprehensive literature review of English and non-English articles was performed in March, 2020 using (CORD-19 2020) dataset, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar to search for infection control and disease transmission in orthodontics. Results This review emphasizes minimizing aerosol production and reinforcing strict infection control measures. Compliance with highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak. Surface disinfection, adequate ventilation, and decontamination of instruments and supplies following the guidelines is required. Conclusion Reinforcing strict infection control measures and minimizing personal contact and aerosol production are keys to prevent contamination within the orthodontic settings. Although no cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within a dental facility have been reported, the risk exists and the disease is still emerging.

In India, a large country of about 1.3 billion people, the disease was first detected on January 30, 2020, in a student returning from Wuhan. The total number of confirmed infections in India as of May 3, 2020, is more than 37,000 and is currently growing fast. OBJECTIVE: Most of the prior research and media coverage focused on the number of infections in the entire country. However, given the size and diversity of India, it is important to look at the spread of the disease in each state separately, wherein the situations are quite different. In this paper, we aim to analyze data on the number of infected people in each Indian state (restricted to only those states with enough data for prediction) and predict the number of infections for that state in the next 30 days. We hope that such statewise predictions would help the state governments better channelize their limited health care resources. METHODS: Since predictions from any one model can potentially be misleading, we considered three growth models, namely, the logistic, the exponential, and the susceptible-infectious-susceptible models, and finally developed a data-driven ensemble of predictions from the logistic and the exponential models using functions of the model-free maximum daily infection rate (DIR) over the last 2 weeks (a measure of recent trend) as weights. The DIR is used to measure the success of the nationwide lockdown. We jointly interpreted the results from all models along with the recent DIR values for each state and categorized the states as severe, moderate, or controlled. RESULTS: We found that 7 states, namely, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are in the severe category. Among the remaining states, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Bihar are in the moderate category, whereas Kerala, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, and Telangana are in the controlled category. We also tabulated actual predicted numbers from various models for each state. All the R(2) values corresponding to the logistic and the exponential models are above 0.90, indicating a reasonable goodness of fit. We also provide a web application to see the forecast based on recent data that is updated regularly. CONCLUSIONS: States with nondecreasing DIR values need to immediately ramp up the preventive measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the states with decreasing DIR can maintain the same status to see the DIR slowly become zero or negative for a consecutive 14 days to be able to declare the end of the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 in India: Statewise Analysis and Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As a global pandemic, COVID-19 has profoundly disrupted the lives of individuals, families, communities, and nations. This report summarizes the expected impact of COVID-19 on behavioral health, as well as strategies to address mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. The state of Michigan in the USA is used to illustrate the complexity of the mental health issues and the critical gaps in the behavioral health infrastructure as they pertain to COVID-19. Scoping review was conducted to identify potential mental health needs and issues during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. RECENT FINDINGS: The ramifications of COVID-19 on mental health are extensive, with the potential to negatively impact diverse populations including healthcare providers, children and adolescents, older adults, the LGBTQ community, and individuals with pre-existing mental illness. Suicide rates, alone, are expected to rise for Michiganders due to the economic downturn, isolation and quarantine, increased substance use, insomnia, and increased access to guns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. SUMMARY: This report promotes awareness of a behavioral health crisis due to COVID-19. Increasing access to behavioral health care should minimize COVID-19s negative influence on mental health in Michigan.

Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.","output":"ESPEN expert statements and practical guidance for nutritional management of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Lifestyle modifications are part of comprehensive treatment plans to help manage the symptoms of pre-existing chronic conditions. However, behavior change is notoriously difficult as patients often lack the necessary support. The present manuscript outlines the development of a Green Health Prescription pathway that was designed to link patients with appropriate lifestyle interventions (i.e., nature-based interventions) and to support attendance. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis was undertaken in three focus groups (i.e., National Health Service healthcare professionals, service-users, and nature-based intervention delivery partners) to highlight areas of strength and weakness within the proposed pathway prior to delivery. The SWOT analyses revealed that the pathway was supported by all three focus groups. Weaknesses and threats were identified including sustainability of nature-based interventions in terms of funding, the need to connect patients with appropriate interventions based on their physical and mental health needs, and the requirement to have a one-stop shop for information to ensure that the pathway was accessible for all service-users and healthcare professionals. Results were addressed and considered throughout the development of the pathway. DISCUSSION: The Green Health Prescription pathway was launched in 2019 and gave patients the ability to receive a prescription from a healthcare professional, community service, or to self-refer. The pathway allows patients to contact a consultant, via a telephone service, who is trained to match them with a programme that the patient believes will be enjoyable and that fits their treatment needs. Data collection to assess the efficacy of the pathway is ongoing.","output":"Developing Scotlands First Green Health Prescription Pathway: A One-Stop Shop for Nature-Based Intervention Referrals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The literature review presented here details recent research involving members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of proteins. Among the 17 recognized members of the family, the human enzyme PARP1 is the most extensively studied, resulting in a number of known biological and metabolic roles. This review is focused on the roles played by PARP enzymes in host-pathogen interactions and in diseases with an associated inflammatory response. In mammalian cells, several PARPs have specific roles in the antiviral response; this is perhaps best illustrated by PARP13, also termed the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Plant stress responses and immunity are also regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. PARPs promote inflammatory responses by stimulating proinflammatory signal transduction pathways that lead to the expression of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. Hence, PARP inhibitors show promise in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and conditions with an inflammatory component, such as diabetes, arthritis, and stroke. These functions are correlated with the biophysical characteristics of PARP family enzymes. This work is important in providing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenesis and host responses, as well as in the identification of inhibitors. This is important because the identification of inhibitors has been shown to be effective in arresting the progression of disease.","output":"Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerases in Host-Pathogen Interactions, Inflammation, and Immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we introduce a space-dependent multiscale model to describe the spatial spread of an infectious disease under uncertain data with particular interest in simulating the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. While virus transmission is ruled by a SEIAR type compartmental model, within our approach the population is given by a sum of commuters moving on a extra-urban scale and non commuters interacting only on the smaller urban scale. A transport dynamic of the commuter population at large spatial scales, based on kinetic equations, is coupled with a diffusion model for non commuters at the urban scale. Thanks to a suitable scaling limit, the kinetic transport model used to describe the dynamics of commuters, within a given urban area coincides with the diffusion equations that characterize the movement of non-commuting individuals. Because of the high uncertainty in the data reported in the early phase of the epidemic, the presence of random inputs in both the initial data and the epidemic parameters is included in the model. A robust numerical method is designed to deal with the presence of multiple scales and the uncertainty quantification process. In our simulations, we considered a realistic geographical domain, describing the Lombardy region, in which the size of the cities, the number of infected individuals, the average number of daily commuters moving from one city to another, and the epidemic aspects are taken into account through a calibration of the model parameters based on the actual available data. The results show that the model is able to describe correctly the main features of the spatial expansion of the first wave of COVID-19 in northern Italy.","output":"Spatial spread of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy using multiscale kinetic transport equations with uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly generated a pandemic.

Ample literature is now available describing the imaging features of COVID19 infection; however, there is still a paucity of knowledge on the various causes of pulmonary cavitation and cystic lesions which can be associated with the virus albeit uncommonly. Cavitation in a COVID19 positive patient could be a consequence of the infection itself or a manifestation of sinister etiologies like coinfection with bacterial, fungal or mycobacterial pathogens, or incidental malignancy/metastasis. It could also be a result of multiple cavitating pulmonary nodules as a manifestation of septic emboli and infarct, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or rheumatoid arthritis creating a diagnostic dilemma. Similarly, the causes of cystic air spaces on chest CT in COVID19 patient can be varied, either primarily due to the infection itself or secondary to coexistent cystic bronchiectasis, emphysema, interstitial lung disease or mechanical ventilation-associated barotrauma as well as complicated pulmonary cysts.

To achieve this goal, we combine the bifurcation theory of the nonlinear differential model with the mean-squared error loss and design a novel loss function to ensure model trainability. Furthermore, we find the unique existence conditions supporting ordinary differential equations to estimate the correct infection function.

METHODS: We examined 265 vertigo/dizziness outpatients at the ear, nose, and throat department of the Nara Medical University between March 01, 2020, and May 31, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. We also focused on 478 vertigo/dizziness outpatients between March 01, 2019, and May 31, 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, to compare the number of cancellations between these 2 periods. The reasons for cancellation and noncancellation were investigated using telephone multiple-choice questionnaires (telMCQs), particularly for patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Meniere's disease (MD). RESULTS: There were many cancellations for medical examinations during the 2020 study period. The total number of vertigo/dizziness outpatients decreased by 44.6% in the 2020 period compared to the same period in 2019. The percent reduction in clinic attendance from 2019 to 2020 (ie, [2019-2020]/2019) for patients with BPPV was higher than that for patients with MD. Compared to the other vertigo-associated conditions, patients with MD exhibited a lower percent reduction in clinic attendance. According to the results of the telMCQs, 75.0% of BPPV cases and 88.2% of MD cases cancelled their appointment and gave up visiting hospitals due to fear of COVID-19 infection, even if they had moderate to severe symptoms. On the contrary, 25.0% and 80.0% patients with BPPV and MD, respectively, did not cancel their appointment; they should not have visited the hospital but stayed at home because they had slight symptoms.

The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW). Over a mean follow-up of 9.2 days (SD=12.5), the primary endpoint occurred in 104 patients (37.5%) who were taking a FIASMA medication, and 1,060 patients (41.4%) who were not.

The overall incidence of SSNHL and combined acute cochlear-vestibular involvement was significantly higher during the PYP compared to the previous periods (p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in the absolute number of acute audio-vestibular disorders during the pandemic compared to previous periods. Although not significant, the SSNHL during the pandemic appeared worse in terms of pure-tone average with a higher incidence of associated vestibular involvement. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of SARS-CoV-2 on audio-vestibular disorders incidence and pathophysiology.","output":"Sudden hearing loss and vestibular disorders during and before COVID-19 pandemic: An audiology tertiary referral centre experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Use of phyto-medicine and digitalization of phyto-compounds has been fallen enthralling field of science in recent years.

Given that frailty may impact recovery from influenza, we examined frailty as a predictor of recovery in older adults hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. METHODS: Data came from the Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN) Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) Network during the 2011/12, 2012/13, and 2013/14 influenza seasons; all patients were aged 65+. Frailty was measured using a previously validated Frailty Index (FI) of health and functional deficits; baseline frailty was categorized using published cutoffs (0-.1 non-frail, >.1-.21 pre-frail, >.21-.45 frail, >.45 most frail). Recovery was operationalized as being alive 30 days post-discharge with less than two additional health/functional deficits (<=0.06 FI increase). Logistic regression was used to examine the change in odds of recovery for every 0.1 increase in baseline FI, controlling for age, sex, season, lab-confirmed influenza status, and seasonal influenza vaccination status. RESULTS: Of 5125 hospitalized older adults, 15% were non-frail, 39% pre-frail, 40% frail, and 6% most frail. 11% died, and poor recovery was experienced by 520/4544=11% of survivors. Poor recovery was inversely associated with baseline frailty (11% non-frail, 17% pre-frail, 28% frail, 38% most frail; P < .001). Frailty was associated with lower odds of recovery in all three seasons [2011/12 (OR=0.71; 95% CI 0.60C0.85), 2012/13 (OR=0.72; 0.66C0.78), 2013/14 (OR=0.76; 0.70C0.82)] though results varied by season, influenza status, and vaccination status. In 2011/12, frailty was associated with poor recovery in unvaccinated (OR=0.46. 95% CI=0.32C0.67) but not vaccinated older patients (OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.68C1.02). CONCLUSION: Increasing frailty was consistently associated with lower odds of recovery in older adults admitted with influenza and other acute respiratory illnesses; depending on seasonal factors, vaccination may offer some buffering of this impact. Understanding frailty and functional status is important, both because frailty is predictive of poor recovery and because persistence of new health/functional deficits is an adverse outcome with important implications for patients, families and health systems.

This paper aimed to examine the effect of n3-PUFA supplementation on inflammatory and biochemical markers in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial study was conducted on 128 critically ill patients infected with COVID-19 who were randomly assigned to the intervention (fortified formula with n3-PUFA) (n = 42) and control (n = 86) groups. Data on 1 month survival rate, blood glucose, sodium (Na), potassium (K), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), albumin, hematocrit (HCT), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), mean arterial pressure (MAP), O2 saturation (O2sat), arterial pH, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), bicarbonate (HCO3), base excess (Be), white blood cells (WBCs), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (Plt), and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were collected at baseline and after 14 days of the intervention. RESULTS: The intervention group had significantly higher 1-month survival rate and higher levels of arterial pH, HCO3, and Be and lower levels of BUN, Cr, and K compared with the control group after intervention (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between blood glucose, Na, HCT, Ca, P, MAP, O2sat, PO2, PCO2, WBCs, GCS, Hb, Plt, PTT, and albumin between two groups.

The spread of the disease has been on the increase across the globe for some time with no end in sight. The research used the data of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria for the numerical simulation which has been fitted to the model. We brought in the consideration of both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals with the fact that an exposed individual is either sent to quarantine first or move to one of the infected classes with the possibility that susceptible individual can also move to quarantined class directly. It was found that the proposed model has two equilibrium points; the disease-free equilibrium point ( DFE ) and the endemic equilibrium point ( E 1 ) . Stability analysis of the equilibrium points shows ( E 0 ) is locally asymptotically stable whenever the basic reproduction number, R 0 < 1 and ( E 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable whenever R 0 > 1 . Sensitivity analysis of the parameters in the R 0 was conducted and the profile of each state variable was also depicted using the fitted values of the parameters showing the spread of the disease. The most sensitive parameters in the R 0 are the contact rate between susceptible individuals and the rate of transfer of individuals from exposed class to symptomatically infected class.

However, frequent lapses from the recommended diet stymie weight loss and prevent individuals from actualizing the health benefits of BOT. There is a need for innovative treatment solutions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in BOT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to optimize a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that uses daily surveys to assess triggers for dietary lapses and deliver interventions when the risk of lapse is high. A microrandomized trial design will evaluate the efficacy of any interventions (ie, theory-driven or a generic alert to risk) on the proximal outcome of lapses during BOT, compare the effects of theory-driven interventions with generic risk alerts on the proximal outcome of lapse, and examine contextual moderators of interventions. METHODS: Adults with overweight or obesity and cardiovascular disease risk (n=159) will participate in a 6-month web-based BOT while using the JITAI to prevent dietary lapses. Each time the JITAI detects elevated lapse risk, the participant will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or 1 of 4 theory-driven interventions (ie, enhanced education, building self-efficacy, fostering motivation, and improving self-regulation). The primary outcome will be the occurrence of lapse in the 2.5 hours following randomization. Contextual moderators of intervention efficacy will also be explored (eg, location and time of day). The data will inform an optimized JITAI that selects the theory-driven approach most likely to prevent lapses in a given moment. RESULTS: The recruitment for the microrandomized trial began on April 19, 2021, and is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This study will optimize a JITAI for dietary lapses so that it empirically tailors the provision of evidence-based intervention to the individual and context. The finalized JITAI will be evaluated for efficacy in a future randomized controlled trial of distal health outcomes (eg, weight loss).

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents to an online survey, who self-reported an autism-spectrum disorder diagnosis (autistic participants) or no issues relating to autism (controls). Exclusion criteria were: related/subclinical issues relating to autism, non-UK residence, under 16 years old. Propensity score matching was used to match autistic participants and controls on age, gender and ethnicity. The full-sample analysis included 269 participants and the propensity-matched sample analysis included 166 participants. Propensity-matched analysis was used for primary analysis and was considered robust if supported by triangulation with full-sample analysis. RESULTS: Autistic participants were more likely to have used CBD in the past 12 months compared with controls (OR=3.52, 95% CI 1.57 to 7.87, p=0.002). They used CBD on more days in the past 12 months (M=34, SD=93) compared with controls (M=17, SD=69, p=0.002). Autistic participants reported trusting the news and doctors less as sources of cannabinoid-related information than controls (p=0.024 and p=0.003, respectively). Autistic participants endorsed the following barriers to cannabinoid-related support seeking more than controls: worrying they wont understand me (OR=3.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 6.33, p<0.001), going somewhere unfamiliar (OR=5.29, 95% CI 2.62 to 10.67, p<0.001) and being in a crowded or chaotic place (OR=9.79, 95% CI 4.18 to 22.89, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Results indicate a higher prevalence and frequency of CBD use, but not cannabis use, among autistic individuals compared with controls.

In Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, a total of 222 medical staff went to Wuhan city for support. In this study, we aimed to determine any nosocomial infection among our cohort of HCWs who worked in Wuhan. METHODS: Throat swab samples were obtained for RNA testing on day 1 and 14 of their quarantine upon their return to Nanjing.

This derivative markedly inhibited BTK activation in TMD8 B cell lymphoma cells and thus inhibited the in vitro growth of the cells. Further studies revealed that compound 2 dose dependently arrested TMD8 cells at G(1) phase, accompanied by decreased levels of Rb, phosphorylated Rb, and cyclin D1. Moreover, following treatment with compound 2, TMD8 cells underwent apoptosis associated with PARP and caspase 3 cleavage. Interestingly, the results of the kinase activity assay on a small panel of 35 kinases showed that the kinase selectivity of compound 2 was superior to that of the first-generation inhibitor ibrutinib, suggesting that compound 2 could be a second-generation inhibitor of BTK.

METHOD We identified and screened 7788 abstracts using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) statement and checklist. RESULTS We synthesized 44 articles published between 1994 and 2020, including 10 qualitative and 34 quantitative or mixed-methods studies. Qualitative studies more frequently placed intergenerational trauma within frameworks of structural vulnerability and historical and political violence, whereas quantitative studies tended to conceptualize trauma as discrete events or individual-level distress.

We reviewed systematically data on smoking cessation rates from controlled trials that used biomedical risk assessment and feedback. OBJECTIVES To determine the efficacy of biomedical risk assessment provided in addition to various levels of counselling, as a contributing aid to smoking cessation. SEARCH STRATEGY We systematically searched he Cochrane Collaboration Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to 2004), and EMBASE (1980 to 2004). We combined methodological terms with terms related to smoking cessation counselling and biomedical measurements. SELECTION CRITERIA Inclusion criteria were: a randomized controlled trial design; subjects participating in smoking cessation interventions; interventions based on a biomedical test to increase motivation to quit; control groups receiving all other components of intervention; an outcome of smoking cessation rate at least six months after the start of the intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two assessors independently conducted data extraction on each paper, with disagreements resolved by consensus. MAIN RESULTS From 4049 retrieved references, we selected 170 for full text assessment. We retained eight trials for data extraction and analysis. One of the eight used CO alone and CO + Genetic Susceptibility as two different intervention groups, giving rise to three possible comparisons. Three of the trials isolated the effect of exhaled CO on smoking cessation rates resulting in the following odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 0.73 (0.38 to 1.39), 0.93 (0.62 to 1.41), and 1.18 (0.84 to 1.64). Combining CO measurement with genetic susceptibility gave an OR of 0.58 (0.29 to 1.19). Exhaled CO measurement and spirometry were used together in three trials, resulting in the following ORs (95% CI): 0.6 (0.25 to 1.46), 2.45 (0.73 to 8.25), and 3.50 (0.88 to 13.92). Spirometry results alone were used in one other trial with an OR of 1.21 (0.60 to 2.42). Two trials used other motivational feedback measures, with an OR of 0.80 (0.39 to 1.65) for genetic susceptibility to lung cancer alone, and 3.15 (1.06 to 9.31) for ultrasonography of carotid and femoral arteries performed in light smokers (average 10 to 12 cigarettes a day). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Due to the scarcity of evidence of sufficient quality, we can make no definitive statements about the effectiveness of biomedical risk assessment as an aid for smoking cessation. Current evidence of lower quality does not however support the hypothesis that biomedical risk assessment increases smoking cessation in comparison with standard treatment. Only two studies were similar enough in term of recruitment, setting, and intervention to allow pooling of data and meta-analysis.","output":"Biomedical risk assessment as an aid for smoking cessation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The COVID-19 pandemic and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage has expanded global interest in wastewater surveillance.

METHODS: All consecutive patients with outpatient appointments amongst 5 providers in the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department between March 2, 2020, and April 10, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Appointment and patient characteristics collected include visit modality, reason for visit, new or established patient, history of recorded procedure, age, sex, race, insurance provider, urban/rural designation of residence, Social Vulnerability Index, and income. The primary outcome of interest was whether or not a patient missed their appointment (show versus no-show). RESULTS: During the study period, there were a total of 784 patient appointments. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with a higher Social Vulnerability Index were more likely to have a no-show appointment (0.49 versus 0.39, P = 0.007).

In this study, we developed the linear accelerator (LINAC) shortage index to assess the LINAC shortage and support the prioritisation of new LINAC distribution in Brazil. METHODS: This cross-sectional, population-based study used data from the National Cancer Institute 2020 Cancer estimates, the Ministry of Health 2019 radiotherapy census, the Minister of Health radiotherapy expansion programme progress reports, and the Fundao Oncocentro de S?o Paulo public database of the Cancer Hospital Registry of the State of S?o Paulo to calculate the LINAC shortage index. Data collected were number of new cancer cases in Brazil, number of LINACs per region and state, number of cancer cases treated with radiotherapy, patient state of residence, and radiotherapy treatment centre and location. National, regional, and state-level data were collected for analysis. LINAC numbers, cancer incidence, geographical distribution, and radiotherapy needs were estimated. A LINAC shortage index was calculated as a relative measure of LINAC demand compared with supply based on number of new cancer cases, number of patients requiring radiotherapy, and the number of LINCAS in the region or state. We then built a prioritisation framework using the LINAC shortage index, cancer incidence, and geographical factors. Finally, using patient-level public cancer registry data from the Fundao Oncocentro de S?o Paulo and Google maps, we estimated the geospatial distance travelled by patients with cancer from their state of residence to radiotherapy treatment in S?o Paulo from 2005-14. Non-parametric statistics were used for analysis. FINDINGS: Data were collected between Feb 2 and Dec 31, 2021. In 2020, there were 625 370 new cancer cases in Brazil and 252 LINAC machines. The number of LINACs was inadequate in all Brazilian regions, with a national LINAC shortage index of 221 (ie, 121% less than the required radiotherapy capacity). The LINAC shortage index was higher in the midwest (326), north (313), and northeast (237) regions, than the southeast (210) and south (192) regions. Four states (Tocantins, Acre, Amap, and Roraima) in the north region were ranked first on the prioritisation rank due to no availability of LINACs. There was an association between LINAC shortage index and the number of patients who travelled to receive radiotherapy (p<00001). Patients living in the midwest (793 km), north (2835 km), and northeast (2415 km) regions travelled significantly longer average distances to receive radiotherapy treatment in S?o Paulo than patients living in the southeast or south regions (p=0032). The reduced number of LINACs in these regions was associated with longer distance travelled (p=0032). INTERPRETATION: There is substantial discordance between distribution of cancer cases and LINAC availability in Brazil. We developed a tool using the LINACs shortage index to help prioritise the development of radiotherapy infrastructure across Brazil; this approach might also be useful in other health systems. FUNDING: None.","output":"Prioritising locations for radiotherapy equipment in Brazil: a cross-sectional, population-based study and development of a LINAC shortage index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical diagnostic image analysis (e.g., CT scan or X-Ray) using machine learning is an efficient and accurate way to detect COVID-19 infections. However, sharing diagnostic images across medical institutions is usually not allowed due to the concern of patients' privacy. This causes the issue of insufficient datasets for training the image classification model. Federated learning is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that produces an unbiased global model based on the received updates of local models trained by clients without exchanging clients' local data. Nevertheless, the default setting of federated learning introduces huge communication cost of transferring model updates and can hardly ensure model performance when data heterogeneity of clients heavily exists. To improve communication efficiency and model performance, in this paper, we propose a novel dynamic fusion-based federated learning approach for medical diagnostic image analysis to detect COVID-19 infections. First, we design an architecture for dynamic fusion-based federated learning systems to analyse medical diagnostic images. Further, we present a dynamic fusion method to dynamically decide the participating clients according to their local model performance and schedule the model fusion-based on participating clients' training time. In addition, we summarise a category of medical diagnostic image datasets for COVID-19 detection, which can be used by the machine learning community for image analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach is feasible and performs better than the default setting of federated learning in terms of model performance, communication efficiency and fault tolerance.","output":"Dynamic Fusion based Federated Learning for COVID-19 Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is significant public and clinical interest in the potential for Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination to protect against type 2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) induced COVID-19.

Here, we examined registered clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov on BCG against COVID-19 by October 9th 2020, and found that 94.7% of such trials were listed as placebo controlled (all with normal saline as placebo), and single to quadruple blinded. The mode of overcoming the natural unblinding by the BCG induced skin reaction was not clarified on the website in either of the trials.

We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. METHODS: Emerging adults (N = 450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess reliability of the PSQ and longitudinal associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. RESULTS: Results supported the validity/reliability of PSQ total scores and indicated that stressful events were highly prevalent in May, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were high overall, but decreased at the follow-up assessment. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with both depression and anxiety at each assessment, but baseline stress did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide empirical evidence that emerging adults are at high risk for depression and anxiety related to the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight specific types of experiences associated with greatest risk. Further, this study provides support for a questionnaire measure of experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied in future work to advance understanding of risk and resilience in response to stressful events.","output":"Exposure to COVID-19 pandemic stress: Associations with depression and anxiety in emerging adults in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A serosurvey of IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was performed during March and April 2020.

Few studies have assessed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile. METHODS We assessed 152 masters athletes 54.48.5 years of age (70% male) and 92 controls of similar age, sex, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery disease risk scores with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. Athletes had participated in endurance exercise for an average of 3112.6 years. The majority (77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per athlete. RESULTS Most athletes (60%) and controls (63%) had a normal CAC score. Male athletes had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of any luminal irregularity (44.3% versus 22.2%; P=0.009) compared with sedentary males, and only male athletes showed a CAC 300 Agatston units (11.3%) and a luminal stenosis 50% (7.5%). Male athletes demonstrated predominantly calcific plaques (72.7%), whereas sedentary males showed predominantly mixed morphology plaques (61.5%). The number of years of training was the only independent variable associated with increased risk of CAC >70th percentile for age or luminal stenosis 50% in male athletes (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.15; P=0.016); 15 (14%) male athletes but none of the controls revealed late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Of these athletes, 7 had a pattern consistent with previous myocardial infarction, including 3(42%) with a luminal stenosis 50% in the corresponding artery. CONCLUSIONS Most lifelong masters endurance athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile have normal CAC scores. Male athletes are more likely to have a CAC score >300 Agatston units or coronary plaques compared with sedentary males with a similar risk profile. The significance of these observations is uncertain, but the predominantly calcific morphology of the plaques in athletes indicates potentially different pathophysiological mechanisms for plaque formation in athletic versus sedentary men.

Few objective measures exist to assay wellbeing (as opposed to just pathology) in surgery, or to evaluate the efficacy of wellbeing interventions. Flourishing (as measured by the Mental Health Continuum, MHC) has been suggested as a concise measure of global wellbeing in surgeons. We aimed to establish validity evidence for flourishing in a large national sample of surgical trainees, explore differences by gender and race, and confirm support for the underlying constructs. METHODS: This cross-sectional study of all General Surgery residents at 16 ACGME-accredited academic programs included an online survey of published measures distributed in February 2021. The Mental Health Continuum (MHC), a three-factor model, assesses emotional, social, and psychological wellbeing and is an established metric of psychosocial thriving in non-physicians. A global score cut-off exists for flourishing which represents high wellbeing. Correlation between flourishing and established measures of risk and resilience in surgery were assessed for validity evidence. Differences by gender and race were explored. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to confirm the three-factor structure in surgical trainees. RESULTS: 300 residents (60% non-male, 41% non-white) responded to the survey. For the overall group, flourishing was significantly positively correlated with all wellbeing resilience factors and negatively correlated with all risk factors. This held true for race and gender subgroups based on interaction analyses. CFA and sensitivity analysis results supported the three-factor structure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer validity evidence for flourishing as a measure of global wellbeing and confirm the three-factor structure of emotional, social, and psychological wellbeing in surgical trainees. Thus, the MHC may be a concise tool for assaying wellbeing, within and across subgroups, and for assessing wellbeing intervention effectiveness within the surgery.","output":"Validity evidence for flourishing as a measure of global wellbeing: a national multicenter study of academic general surgery residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first case of COVID-19 detected in Mexico was on the 27th of February 2020. On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%).

The on admission troponin I level divided into two groups of 0.03ng/mL (normal) and >0.03ng/mL (abnormal). The adjusted COX-regression model was used to determine the relationship between the studied variables and patients in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In this study, the median age of subjects was 65 years (54.8% men) and 29.53% of them had abnormal troponin I levels. Besides, the in-hospital mortality rate among patients with abnormal troponin I levels was found to be 51.56%; whereas, patients with normal levels exhibited 18.82% mortality.

METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of COVID19 convalescents, using neutralizing antibody assays and SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay platforms employing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) antigens. RESULTS: Sensitivities of serologic assays to diagnose prior SARS-CoV-2 infection changed with time. One widely used commercial platform that had an initial sensitivity of >95% declined to 71% at 81-100 days post diagnosis. The trajectories of median binding antibody titers measured over ~3 to 4 months were not dependent on the use of SARS-CoV-2 N or S proteins as antigen. The median neutralization titer decreased by ~45% per month. Each serological assay gave quantitative antibody titers that correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers, but S-based serological assay measurements better predicted neutralization potency. Correlation between S-binding and neutralization titers deteriorated with time and decreases in neutralization titers were not predicted by changes in S-binding antibody titers.

For every average 1 billion (approximately &9,000,000/6,800,00) spent on hand hygiene products during the current month and 1 month before (lag 0-1 months) there was a 0.22% (P = 0.02) decrease in HRSV infections (Table 1). An increase of average 1,000 domestic and international airline passenger arrivals during the previous 1C2 months (lag 1C2 months) was associated with a 4.610(?4)% (P < 0.001) and 1.110(?3)% (P = 0.007) increase in the monthly number of HRSV infections, respectively.

The mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency exacerbates COVID-19 pneumonia remain poorly understood. In this review we describe the rationale of the putative role of endothelial dysfunction in this event. Herein, we will briefly review (1) anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects of vitamin D, (2) vitamin D receptor and vitamin D receptor ligand, (3) protective role of vitamin D against endothelial dysfunction, (4) risk of vitamin D deficiency, (5) vitamin D deficiency in association with endothelial dysfunction, (6) the characteristics of vitamin D relevant to COVID-19, (7) the role of vitamin D on innate and adaptive response, (8) biomarkers of endothelial cell activation contributing to cytokine storm, and (9) the bidirectional relationship between inflammation and homeostasis. Finally, we hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction relevant to vitamin D deficiency results from decreased binding of the vitamin D receptor with its ligand on the vascular endothelium and that it may be immune-mediated via increased interferon 1 . A possible sequence of events may be described as (1) angiotensin II converting enzyme-related initial endothelial injury followed by vitamin D receptor-related endothelial dysfunction, (2) endothelial lesions deteriorating to endothelialitis, coagulopathy and thrombosis, and (3) vascular damage exacerbating pulmonary pathology and making patients with vitamin D deficiency vulnerable to death.","output":"Vitamin D deficiency in association with endothelial dysfunction: Implications for patients with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAn immune correlate of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection is urgently needed. MethodsWe used an ongoing household cohort with an embedded transmission study that closely monitors participants regardless of symptom status. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to measure infections and seropositivity. Sequencing was performed to determine circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. We investigated the protection associated with seropositivity resulting from prior infection, the anti-spike antibody titers needed for protection, and we compared the severity of first and second infections. ResultsIn March 2021, 62.3% of the cohort was seropositive. After March 2021, gamma and delta variants predominated. Seropositivity was associated with 69.2% protection from any infection (95% CI: 60.7%-75.9%), with higher protection against moderate or severe infection (79.4%, 95% CI: 64.9%-87.9%). Anti-spike titers of 327 and 2,551 were associated with 50% and 80% protection from any infection; titers of 284 and 656 were sufficient for protection against moderate or severe disease. Second infections were less severe than first infections (Relative Risk (RR) of moderated or severe disease: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.38-0.98; RR of subclinical disease:1.9, 95% CI: 1.33-2.73). ConclusionsPrior infection-induced immunity is protective against infection when predominantly gamma and delta SARS-CoV-2 circulated. The protective antibody titers presented may be useful for vaccine policy and control measures. While second infections were somewhat less severe, they were not as mild as ideal. A strategy involving vaccination will be needed to ease the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"An immune correlate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of reinfections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Chest computed tomography (CT) has been used to complement coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis due to its high sensitivity However, owing to the low specificity of CT findings, differential diagnosis is essential The typical CT findings of COVID-19 include ground-glass opacifications and consolidations with predominant distribution in bilateral, peripheral, and subpleural parts of the lung These imaging findings are non-specific and may resemble other lung conditions, including ultrasonic humidifier lung, which is a condition that develops on inhaling aerosols generated by ultrasonic humidifiers We present two patients with initial symptoms similar to COVID-19 CT examination revealed centrilobular nodules and consolidations with upper lobe-predominant distribution, although atypical for COVID-19, but key findings for ultrasonic humidifier lung Therefore, ultrasonic humidifier lung could be a differential diagnosis for COVID-19 in dry environments Characteristic CT findings and a history of ultrasonic humidifier use are critical to the final diagnosis","output":"Ultrasonic humidifier lung as a mimic of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The stilbenoid pathway is responsible for the production of resveratrol and its derivatives in grapevine. A few transcription factors (TFs) have been previously identified as regulators of this pathway but the extent of this control is yet to be fully understood. Here we demonstrate how DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-Seq) allows for genome-wide TF binding site interrogation in a non-model species. We obtained 5,190 and 4,443 binding events assigned to 4,041 and 3,626 genes for MYB14 and MYB15, respectively (around 40% of peaks being located within -10kb of transcription start sites). DAP-Seq of MYB14 and MYB15 was combined with aggregate gene centred co-expression networks built from more than 1,400 transcriptomic datasets from leaves, fruits and flowers to narrow down bound genes to a set of high confidence targets. The analysis of MYB14, MYB15 and MYB13, a third uncharacterised member of Subgroup 2 (S2), showed that in addition to the few previously known stilbene synthase (STS ) targets, these three regulators bind to 30 out of 47 STS family genes. Moreover all three MYBs bind to several PAL, C4H and 4CL genes, in addition to shikimate pathway genes, the WRKY03 stilbenoid co-regulator and novel resveratrol-modifying gene candidates amongst which ROMT2 -3 were validated enzymatically. A high proportion of DAP-Seq bound genes was induced in the activated transcriptomes of transient MYB15 -overexpressing stilbenoid-producing grapevine leaves, validating our methodological approach for identifying gene regulatory networks of specialised metabolism. Overall, MYB genes from Subgroup 2 appear to play a key role in binding and directly regulating several primary and secondary metabolic steps leading to an increased flux towards stilbenoid production.","output":"Major orchestration of shikimate, early phenylpropanoid and stilbenoid pathways by Subgroup 2 R2R3-MYBs in grapevine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The absence of reliable registration of Covid-19 deaths in India has prevented proper assessment and monitoring of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, Indias relatively young age structure tends to conceal the severity of Covid-19 mortality, which is concentrated in older age groups. In this paper, we present four different demographic samples of Indian populations for which we have information on both their demographic structures and death outcomes. We show that we can model the age distribution of Covid-19 mortality in India and use this modeling to estimate Covid-19 mortality in the country. Our findings point to a death toll of approximately 3.2C3.7 million persons by early November 2021. Once Indias age structure is factored in, these figures correspond to one of the most severe cases of Covid-19 mortality in the world. India has recorded after February 2021 the second outbreak of coronavirus that has affected the entire country. The accuracy of official statistics of Covid-19 mortality has been questioned, and the real number of Covid-19 deaths is thought to be several times higher than reported. In this paper, we assembled four independent population samples to model and estimate the level of Covid-19 mortality in India. We first used a population sample with the age and sex of Covid-19 victims to develop a Gompertz model of Covid-19 mortality in India. We applied and adjusted this mortality model on two other national population samples after factoring in the demographic characteristics of these samples. We finally derive from these samples the most reasonable estimate of Covid-19 mortality level in India and confirm this result using a fourth population sample. Our findings point to a death toll of about 3.2C3.7 million persons by late May 2021. This is by far the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in the world. Once standardized for age and sex structure, Indias Covid-19 mortality rate is above Brazil and the USA. Our analysis shows that existing population samples allow an alternative estimation of deaths due to Covid-19 in India. The results imply that only one out of 7C8 deaths appear to have been recorded as a Covid-19 death in India. The estimates also point to a very high Covid-19 mortality rate, which is even higher after age and sex standardization. The magnitude of the pandemic in India requires immediate attention. In the absence of effective remedies, this calls for a strong response based on a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions and the scale-up of vaccination to make them accessible to all, with an improved surveillance system to monitor the progression of the pandemic and its spread across Indias regions and social groups.","output":"An alternative estimation of the death toll of the Covid-19 pandemic in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]the phones were so busy, the member support centre opened through weekends and public holidays to be as responsive as possible to members NZNO organisers had many robust discussions with employers across the country, using the MoH guidelines as the basis for advice to support members who were vulnerable or had vulnerable people at home Just before writing this industrial focus, I was on a Zoom meeting with representatives from the three Auckland region DHBs and they reported that every submission for vulnerable worker assessment by Occupational Health had been completed","output":"Supporting members through COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research that explores the role of substance use treatment among older individuals is scarce.

Methods We employ a Black/White dissimilarity index as our independent variable and county-level mobility ratios as our dependent variable. Using generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data, we analyzed the effects of Black/White segregation on population mobility by counties across the United States from March 8 to August 7, 2020 under two different COVID-19 related policy conditions: lockdown and reopening. Findings While higher county-wide levels of segregation were significantly associated with decreased mobility under lockdown and stay-at-home orders, we found that this relationship between segregation and mobility dissipated under reopening orders. Interpretations Investigating the effects of health policy without considering differing effects due to structural racism will likely ignore complexities that may create unintended consequences of health policy. Our conclusions suggest African Americans may face structural limitations to effective social distancing as evidenced by higher rates of mobility after reopening policies go into effect.","output":"Residential racial segregation and social distancing in the United States during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Patients who do not attend outpatient palliative care clinic appointments ('no-shows') may have unmet needs and can impact wait times.

METHODS: We used data from a nationwide, cross-sectional, Internet-based, self-administered survey. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis on data from 14 545 participants to investigate the associations among variables related to disrupted care, health status and the Work Functioning Impairment Scale, with a cut-off of 21 points. RESULTS: Participants who experienced exacerbation of underlying disease (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.84; 95% CI 2.28 to 3.53) or any type of disrupted care were more likely to show low productivity at work. Experiencing disruptions in routine and non-routine clinical settings (aOR 4.64; 95% CI 3.64 to 5.92 and aOR 6.29; 95% CI 4.74 to 8.34, respectively), and running out of drugs (aOR 6.13; 95% CI 4.60 to 8.18) were strongly associated with exacerbation of underlying disease.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the social isolation of residents living in LTC facilities in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included 730 524 LTC residents from 14 224 LTC facilities in 8652 zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in the US in 2011. A nationwide LTC database with ZCTA data was linked to population-level geographic data from the US Census Bureau. Statistical analysis was performed from January 2019 to December 2020. EXPOSURES: The primary variable of interest was the social isolation of LTC neighborhoods defined as the percentage of households in the ZCTA with individuals aged 65 years or older who lived alone and categorized into quartiles of social isolation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Maps were generated to illustrate geographic variation of LTC facilities at the ZCTA level by the quartile of socially isolated neighborhoods. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the adjusted likelihood that LTC facilities were located in areas of highest social isolation. We also used multilevel logistic regression models to assess the association between the social isolation of neighborhoods of LTC facilities and 30-day all-cause mortality after LTC admission. Subgroup analyses were conducted by race and ethnicity. RESULTS: Among 33 120 ZCTAs in the US, 8652 (26.1%) had at least 1 LTC facility. Among the 730 524 LTC residents included in the studys 14 224 LTC facilities, 458 136 (62.71%) were female, 610 802 (83.61%) were non-Hispanic White, and 419 654 (57.45%) were aged 80 years or older.

One patient was diagnosed with a coronavirus disease 2019 infection after being transferred to the nearest local emergency hospital for management of postoperative pain secondary to common bile duct stone and was successfully treated conservatively on the ward. No patient developed pulmonary complications. Three patients were admitted for greater than 23 hours. Twenty-seven patients (8.7%) developed complications. Complications graded as 2 and 3 according to the Clavien-Dindo classification occurred in 14 and 2 patients, respectively.

METHODS: This is a prospective, international, multi-institutional, randomized controlled trial. Patients undergoing synthetic midurethral sling placement were randomized to 3-week postoperative telemedicine versus office-based follow-up. The primary outcome was the rate of unplanned events. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction, crossover from telemedicine to office-based follow-up, and compliance with 3- to 5-month office follow-up. RESULTS: We included 238 patients (telemedicine: 121 vs office: 117). No differences in demographics or medical comorbidities were noted between the study groups (p = 0.09C1.0). No differences were noted in unplanned events: hospital admission, emergency department visit, or unplanned office visit or call (14% vs 12.9%, p = 0.85) or complications (9.9% vs 8.6%, p = 0.82). Both groups were equally very satisfied with their surgical outcomes (71.1% vs 69%, p = 0.2). Telemedicine patients were more compliant with 3- to 5-month office follow-up (90.1% vs 79.3%, p = 0.04).

Affected patients can observe a wide variety of neurological symptoms, such as myoclonus, dementia, cerebellar signs, and others. We present a case of laboratory-confirmed SE in an otherwise healthy 57-year-old medical professional who initially presented with nonspecific and unique \\"head in a fish-bowl\\" dissociation and cognitive decline. No social risk factors were ever identified other than his healthcare career, but subsequent neuroimaging, serology, and lumbar puncture confirmed a diagnosis of sporadic SE due to unknown etiology. He was then treated symptomatically and referred ultimately to palliative care. The patient passed while in hospice care with time from the initial diagnosis to mortality being only 42 days. Given his vague but uniquely rapid deterioration and subsequent mortality, we highlight an opportunity to discuss diagnosis, management, quality improvement, and ethical concerns associated with SE prognosis. We aim to help primary care physicians and neurologists better elucidate the risk factors, signs and symptoms, and pathophysiology of SE to make an early diagnosis. Symptoms can then be managed effectively and palliative services coordinated via a legal and compassionate shared decision-making approach. We recommend that once a diagnosis is made, a discussion with the patient and their family about advance directives and end-of-life care be coordinated as soon as reasonably possible. This should be carried out by a multidisciplinary team consisting of the patient's primary care physician and neurologist, as well as a social worker, palliative care physician, and counselor (spiritual or otherwise). It is our hope that through a better understanding of these factors in SE care, quality of life improvement protocols in similarly-debilitating neurocognitive diseases can be developed.","output":"Rapid Neurocognitive Deterioration and Mortality in a Healthcare Professional With Spongiform Encephalopathy: Implications for Neurologic and End-of-Life Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) refers to extreme, uncontrollable, and persistent worry and anxiety. The disorder is known to affect the social functioning and well-being of millions of people, but despite its prevalence and burden to society, it has proven difficult to identify unique behavioral markers. Interestingly, the worrying behavior observed in GAD is argued to stem from a verbal linguistic process. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate if GAD can be predicted from the language people use to put their anxious worries into words. Given the importance of avoidance sensitivity (a higher likelihood to respond anxiously to novel or unexpected triggers) in GAD, this study also explored if prediction accuracy increases when individual differences in behavioral avoidance and approach sensitivity are taken into account. METHOD: An expressive writing exercise was used to explore whether GAD can be predicted from linguistic characteristics of written narratives. Specifically, 144 undergraduate student participants were asked to recall an anxious experience during their university life, and describe this experience in written form. Clinically validated behavioral measures for GAD and self-reported sensitivity in behavioral avoidance/inhibition (BIS) and behavioral approach (BAS), were collected. A set of classification experiments was performed to evaluate GAD predictability based on linguistic features, BIS/BAS scores, and a concatenation of the two. RESULTS: The classification results show that GAD can, indeed, be successfully predicted from anxiety-focused written narratives. Prediction accuracy increased when differences in BIS and BAS were included, which suggests that, under those conditions, negatively valenced emotion words and words relating to social processes could be sufficient for recognition of GAD. CONCLUSIONS: Undergraduate students with a high GAD score can be identified based on their written recollection of an anxious experience during university life. This insight is an important first step toward development of text-based digital health applications and technologies aimed at remote screening for GAD. Future work should investigate the extent to which these results uniquely apply to university campus populations or generalize to other demographics.","output":"Toward Linguistic Recognition of Generalized Anxiety Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since understanding molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection is extremely important for developing effective therapies against COVID-19, we focused on the internalization mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 via ACE2. Although cigarette smoke is generally believed to be harmful to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatments were surprisingly found to suppress the expression of ACE2 in HepG2 cells. We thus tried to clarify the mechanism of CSE effects on expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells. Because RNA-seq analysis suggested that suppressive effects on ACE2 might be inversely correlated with induction of the genes regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the AHR agonists 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) and omeprazole (OMP) were tested to assess whether those treatments affected ACE2 expression. Both FICZ and OMP clearly suppressed ACE2 expression in a dose-dependent manner along with inducing CYP1A1. Knock-down experiments indicated a reduction of ACE2 by FICZ treatment in an AHR-dependent manner. Finally, treatments of AHR agonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero E6 cells as determined with immunoblotting analyses detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid protein. We here demonstrate that treatment with AHR agonists, including FICZ, and OMP, decreases expression of ACE2 via AHR activation, resulting in suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells.","output":"Inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro by suppressing its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, via aryl-hydrocarbon receptor signal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Parasites that infect cats include protozoa, helminths and arthropods, many of which are transmissible to humans. Effective control relies on a good knowledge of parasite distribution and the risk factors for infection. The present study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence of major feline parasites in Italy and the risk factors associated with their occurrence. METHODS: Over a 12-month study period, feces, hair and ectoparasites from naturally infected cats from feral colonies, shelters and private households were analyzed at 13 study centers across Italy. Samples from these cats (n = 987) were analyzed at all centers using the same diagnostic methods. Prevalence values and risk factors were evaluated statistically for the identification of predictors of risk. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of gastro-intestinal and broncho-pulmonary (BP) nematodes was 35.9% (354/987). Toxocara cati was the most prevalent species (253/987; 25.6%), followed by Ancylostomatidae (98/987; 9.9%). Among BP nematodes, Aelurostrongylus abstrusus was the most common (76/987; 7.7%). Approximately 35.7% (352/987) of the study population was infested by ectoparasites, of which the most common were fleas (29.4%, 290/987), followed by ear mites Otodectes cynotis (9.8%, 97/987). Predictors of risk for parasite infection included age, a predominantly or exclusively outdoor lifestyle, geographic area and lack of antiparasitic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both ecto- and endoparasites are still common in cats throughout Italy, many of them being of zoonotic concern and vectors of pathogens to humans. Given the presence of parasites throughout the entire study period, year-round treatment should be considered. Furthermore, data confirm the need to protect the humanCanimal bond using proper endo- and ectoparasiticides to reduce the risk of human infection, in application of the One-Health concept.

Yet, far less is known about the CDS that teachers use in classrooms with toddlers and childrens responses, an important question because many toddlers, particularly in high-need communities, attend group-care settings. This exploratory study examines the linguistic environment during teacher-led book readings in American Early Head Start classrooms serving 2-year-olds from households in poverty. Seven teachers in four classrooms were trained to emphasize target words while reading story and informational books. We first analyzed the nature and quality of their book readings from a macro-level, exploring global instructional quality [Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS)] and linguistic complexity [i.e., diversity of vocabulary (D) and sophistication of syntax (MLU-w)], and we also examined micro-level teacher-child talk strategies and use of target words. Compared to prior research, these classrooms had similar global quality and syntactic complexity, although less lexical diversity. Exploratory results also revealed three distinct teacher talk patternsteachers who emphasized (1) comments, (2) questions, and (3) a balance of the two. Question-focused teachers had more adult and child talk during reading, as well as more repetitions of target words, and stronger CLASS Engaged Support for Learning. However, comment-focused teachers used more diverse vocabulary and had stronger CLASS Emotional and Behavioral Support. Results illuminate the nature and quality of CDS in toddler classrooms, particularly in the context of an intervention emphasizing target vocabulary words, and highlight applications for professional development and questions for further research.","output":"Understanding Child-Directed Speech Around Book Reading in Toddler Classrooms: Evidence From Early Head Start Programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Much has changed in healthcare during the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic. Medicine, a profession of traditional principles and virtues, has faced unprecedented challenges in the light of scarce and unequal distribution of ventilators, testing, and personal protective equipment. Healthcare workers have been- and are increasingly likely to be- forced into situations that require difficult decision making under life-and-death conditions. Concepts of medical necessity and maximum benefit challenge healthcare systems that already struggle to manage unequal treatment and access to services, giving rise to moral distress and moral injury on the front lines. Method: This article focuses on moral injury in the context of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic. I review recent literature to highlight the psychological impact of many morally-injurious events that have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the help of a clinical vignette, I point out how healthcare systems adopt many utilitarian policies in times of excessive healthcare burden and offer a viewpoint that many morally injurious events happen when physicians, traditionally practicing Kantian and virtue ethics, are forced to follow utilitarian policies of healthcare system. Conclusion: One form of moral injury may arise from inherent conflicts between individual deontological moral judgments and organizational utilitarian moral judgments. More research is needed to validate the philosophical viewpoint as well as to explore whether increased awareness and education of key principles within moral philosophy can better equip healthcare workers in situations when public health takes precedence over individual health.","output":"Moral Injury and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Philosophical Viewpoint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnostic tests have been considered as the main alternative for the control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a correct diagnosis allows for decision making when facing the disease, particularly as there is a lack of effective therapeutic protocols and vaccines. Thus, in this review, we summarized the main diagnostic approaches currently available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans based on studies available in article databases. The tests can be organized into two main categories: nucleic acid-based tests, recommended for the initial detection of the virus, and serological tests, recommended for assessing the disease progression. The studies have shown that the performance of diagnostic methods depends on different factors, such as the type of samples and the characteristics of each assay. It was identified that the positivity of the tests is mainly related to the onset of symptoms. We also observed that point-of-care diagnoses are considered as one of the main trends in this area, due to the low-cost and simplicity of the assay; however, the analytical performance must be critically analyzed.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in a single screening center to assess the diagnostic performance of the Panbio(?)

RESULTS: 402 outpatients were enrolled in a COVID-19 screening center, of whom 168 (41.8%) had a positive RT-qPCR test. The oropharyngeal Ag-RDT clinical sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal RT-qPCR was 81% (95%CI: 74.2C86.6). Two false positives were noted out of the 234 RT-qPCR negative individuals, which resulted in a clinical specificity of 99.1% (95%CI: 96.9C99.9) for the Ag-RDT.

We show that changes in the protein energetics favor a higher population of infection-capable states in the G-form through release of asymmetry present in the D-form inter-protomer interactions. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor.

Studies accounting for individual-level health characteristics are lacking. METHODS: We leveraged the breadth and depth of the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases and built a national cohort of 169,102 COVID-19 positive United States Veterans, enrolled between March 2, 2020 and January 31, 2021, and followed them through February 15, 2021. Annual average 2018 PM(2.5) exposure, at an approximately 1 km(2) resolution, was linked with residential street address at the year prior to COVID-19 positive test. COVID-19 hospitalization was defined as first hospital admission between 7 days prior to, and 15 days after, the first COVID-19 positive date. Adjusted Poisson regression assessed the association of PM(2.5) with risk of hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 25,422 (15.0%) hospitalizations; 5,448 (11.9%), 5,056 (13.0%), 7,159 (16.1%), and 7,759 (19.4%) were in the lowest to highest PM(2.5) quartile, respectively. In models adjusted for State, demographic and behavioral factors, contextual characteristics, and characteristics of the pandemic a one interquartile range increase in PM(2.5) (1.9 g/m(3)) was associated with a 10% (95% CI: 8%-12%) increase in risk of hospitalization. The association of PM(2.5) and risk of hospitalization among COVID-19 individuals was present in each wave of the pandemic. Models of non-linear exposure-response suggested increased risk at PM(2.5) concentrations below the national standard 12 g/m(3). Formal effect modification analyses suggested higher risk of hospitalization associated with PM(2.5) in Black people compared to White people (p=0.045), and in those living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to higher levels of PM(2.5) was associated with increased risk of hospitalization among COVID-19 infected individuals. The risk was evident at PM(2.5) levels below the regulatory standards. The analysis identified those of Black race and those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods as population groups that may be more susceptible to the untoward effect of PM(2.5) on risk of hospitalization in the setting of COVID-19.","output":"Ambient Fine Particulate Matter Air Pollution and the Risk of Hospitalization among COVID-19 Positive Individuals: Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GOALS The goal of this study was to describe the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on ability to engage in activities and the influence on psychological distress and gastrointestinal symptoms among individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and comorbid anxiety and/or depression.

METHODOLOGY The present study employs Monte Carlo based transmission growth simulations for Italy, Germany and Turkey. The probabilities of transmission at home, work and social networks and the number of initial cases have been calibrated to match the basic reproduction number and the reported fatality curves. Parametric studies were conducted to observe the effect of social distancing, work closure, testing and quarantine of the family and colleagues of positively tested individuals. RESULTS It is observed that estimates of the number of initial cases in Italy compared to Turkey and Germany are higher. Turkey will probably experience about 30% less number of fatalities than Germany due its smaller elderly population. If social distancing and work contacts are limited to 25% of daily routines, Germany and Turkey may limit the number of fatalities to a few thousands as the reproduction number decreases to about 1.3 from 2.8. Random testing may reduce the number of fatalities by 10% upon testing least 5/1000 of the population. Quarantining of family and workmates of positively tested individuals may reduce the total number of fatalities by about 50%. CONCLUSIONS The fatality rate of Covid-19 is estimated to be about 1.5% based on the simulation results.

There is urgent need to characterize the coping styles associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes in perinatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic to help mitigate the potential for lasting sequelae on both mothers and infants. This study uses a data-driven approach to identify the patterns of behavioral coping strategies that associate with maternal psychosocial distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large multicenter sample of pregnant women (N = 2876) and postpartum women (N = 1536). Data was collected from 9 states across the United States from March to October 2020. Women reported behaviors they were engaging in to manage pandemic-related stress, symptoms of depression, anxiety and global psychological distress, as well as changes in energy levels, sleep quality and stress levels. Using latent profile analysis, we identified four behavioral phenotypes of coping strategies. Critically, phenotypes with high levels of passive coping strategies (increased screen time, social media, and intake of comfort foods) were associated with elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and global psychological distress, as well as worsening stress and energy levels, relative to other coping phenotypes. In contrast, phenotypes with high levels of active coping strategies (social support, and self-care) were associated with greater resiliency relative to other phenotypes. The identification of these widespread coping phenotypes reveals novel behavioral patterns associated with risk and resiliency to pandemic-related stress in perinatal women. These findings may contribute to early identification of women at risk for poor long-term outcomes and indicate malleable targets for interventions aimed at mitigating lasting sequelae on women and children during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Behavioral coping phenotypes and associated psychosocial outcomes of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is expected to become a powerful tool to monitor the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level, which has attracted the attention of scholars all over the world.

Special attention should be given to polymyxins (polymyxin B and colistin) which, since their reintroduction into clinical practice, are considered last resort drugs. The objective of this study is to perform a bibliometric analysis of scientific research on polymyxin resistance. Methods: Scopus was used to retrieve documents relevant to polymyxin resistance from 2010 to 2019. Data was exported to Microsoft Excel for table presentation. SciVal was used for volume and citation analysis as well as collaboration patterns. Also, we extracted data regarding the top documents, authors, countries, institutions, and the metrics of journals. VantagePoint and VOSviewer were used for geographical distribution of worldwide research and keyword co-occurrence analysis, respectively. Results: A total of 1,409 documents were retrieved. The retrieved documents received 25.0 citations per document. Articles (73.88%) and letters (18.09%) were the most frequent types of documents. During 2010C2019, there was a significant growth in publications (p-value < 0.001). The received citations were 35,209 with a peak in 2016 (11,250 citations). China and the United States led the scientific production with 299 (21.2%) and 238 (16.9%) publications, respectively. Little or no contribution came from central Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. Chinese institutions have caused the greatest impact, with University of Zhejiang (China) being the most prolific institution on the subject (88 documents). In terms of the most productive journals, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy ranked first with 196 (13.9%) documents. Most of the documents were published in quartile one journals and only had national collaboration (43.2%). Analysis of keyword co-occurrence revealed that research on polymyxin resistance during the last decade has focused on its relationship with public health, pharmacology, and genetics. Conclusion: The number of documents on polymyxin resistance has increased significantly in the recent years, with a steep growth from 2016 onwards. China and the United States led the scientific production. Most of the documents were published in high-quality journals. Greater joint efforts and more contribution from central Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America are still needed to tackle this global problem.","output":"Research Trends and Collaboration Patterns on Polymyxin Resistance: A Bibliometric Analysis (2010C2019)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traffic accidents represent one of the most serious problems around the world. Many efforts have been concentrated on implementing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to increase safety by reducing critical tasks faced by the driver. In this paper, a Blind Spot Warning (BSW) system capable of virtualizing cars around the drivers vehicle is presented. The system is based on deep neural models for car detection and depth estimation using images captured with a camera located on top of the main vehicle, then transformations are applied to the image and to generate the appropriate information format. Finally the cars in the environment are represented in a 3D graphical interface. We present a comparison between car detectors and another one between depth estimators from which we choose the best performance ones to be implemented in the BSW system. In particular, our system offers a more intuitive assistance interface for the driver allowing a better and quicker understanding of the environment from monocular cameras.","output":"Vision-Based Blind Spot Warning System by Deep Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Supreme Court upheld broad exemptions to the Affordable Care Act contraceptive mandate; new ACA rules were finalized.","output":"Contraceptive Mandate, ACA Final Rules, And COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of a recent politically-biased Lancet editorial, the worlds opinion has been directed against the Brazilian government over the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in the country.

The trauma and orthopaedic service has been compelled to alter working practices to respond proactively and definitively to the crisis. The aim of this study is to summarise the impact of this outbreak on the trauma and orthopaedic workload and outline the response of the department. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data comparing patient numbers pre-COVID-19, and prospectively during the early COVID-19 pandemic. We have collected the numbers and nature of outpatient orthopaedic attendances to fracture clinics and elective services, inpatient admissions and the number of fracture neck of femur operations performed. RESULTS: The number of outpatient attendances for a musculoskeletal complaint to Accident and Emergency and the number of virtual fracture clinic reviews reduced by almost 50% during COVID-19. The number of face-to-face fracture clinic follow-ups decreased by around 67%, with a five-fold increase in telephone consultations. Inpatient admissions decreased by 33%, but the average number of fracture neck of femur operations performed has increased by 20% during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. CONCLUSION: We have noted a decrease in some aspects of the trauma and orthopaedic outpatient workload, such as leisure and occupational-related injuries but an increase in others, such as fracture neck of femurs. Many injuries have significantly reduced in numbers and we consider that a model could be developed for treating these injuries away from the acute hospital site entirely, thereby allowing the acute team to focus more appropriate major trauma injuries.","output":"COVID-19 C Changes in Workload and Clinical Practice in Trauma and Orthopaedics in a District General Hospital in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"California consistently leads the U.S. in the value of agricultural commodities produced, specializing in the production of high-value fruit, vegetable, and nut crops. In this article, we outline the short-term, medium-term, and evolving long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on California's produce and tree nut industries. Many of California's top commodities are labor intensive and highly perishable, e.g., strawberries and lettuce, and consequently these types of commodities experienced some of the worst economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These initial impacts included higher production costs due to social distancing and other worker protection measures, and the discarding of millions of dollars' worth of produce which was intended for the food service sector. Other top commodities, such as almonds and processing tomatoes, have highly mechanized operations with relatively non-perishable products. These have been more resilient to the short-run effects of the pandemic on supply chains but have experienced disruptions in international trade. In this article, we highlight the differential effects of the pandemic on California's high-value crops across the food service and retail supply chains, discuss the mitigating effects of federal, state and industry support, and highlight emerging consumer trends.","output":"Differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on California's produce and nut industries.

Patients were divided into LV remodeling group (LV mass/volume  1.15, n = 21) and non-remodeling group (LV mass/volume < 1.15, n = 22). Clinical characteristics, biochemical data including cardiac troponin T(cTNT), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) were noted. Distensibility of middle ascending aorta (mid-AA) and proximal descending aorta, LV structural and functional parameters, global and regional myocardial strain were measured. Compared to non-remodeling group, LV remodeling group had significantly decreased LV global strain (radial: 26.04  8.70% vs. 32.92  7.81%, P = 0.009; circumferential: - 17.20  3.38% vs. - 19.65  2.34%, P = 0.008; longitudinal: - 9.13  2.34% vs. - 11.63  1.99%, P < 0.001) and decreased mid-AA distensibility (1.22  0.24 10-3 mm/Hg vs 1.60  0.41 10-3 mm/Hg, P = 0.001).

As we are aware that pilot training is often gold standard for human factors training, we utilised this rare opportunity and formulated a project working alongside them looking at the impact debriefs by pilots could have on simulation training, focusing on human factors. In simulation, we often focus on clinical learning, whereas research shows that the majority of near miss and never events, which should guide our learning, are caused by errors in human factors.ObjectivesOur objective is to research the impact simulation debriefs led by experts in human factors has on learning and understanding compared to debriefs led by clinicians with little or no human factors training. This is a rare opportunity to undertake a study working alongside pilots and we hope to use the results to facilitate ongoing human factors training for simulation facilitators.MethodsWe ran a series of Multi-disciplinary simulations throughout the paediatric department, using various settings to avoid bias. We introduced the simulation, including the role of the pilots, to ensure all participants were aware of learning outcomes and expectations. We ran the simulation, allowing all participants to work in their current role. Following this, there was a clinical debrief before the participants were split into two groups for human factors debriefs, One group led by pilots and one group by a clinician with little human factors training. We then asked both groups to fill in a questionnaire, focusing on their understanding of human factors and the impact they feel the simulation will have on their future training.ResultsOur project involved 6 simulations with 62 multidisciplinary participants. Our project showed that both groups had an increased understanding of the importance and impact of Human Factors. Both groups showed an increase in participants strongly agreeing that they have a good understanding of human factors, although a larger increase was seen amongst the pilot group - 48%. All participants rated feedback in Human Factors as Good or Very Good. 97% of the pilot group felt debriefs by pilots had improved their knowledge and impacted their training. 1 participant felt that having debriefs by pilots had not impacted their learning greater than debriefs by clinicians, but he went on to state he had a poor understanding of human factors. 98% of participants who answered felt pilots debriefs had a greater impact in learning compared to previous clinician led debriefs. Free comments were positive, including greater impact on patient safety, would encourage more sessions with pilots and increased confidence and understanding.ConclusionsIn conclusion, this project showed that having debriefs lead by human factor experts had a great impacter impact on understanding of human factors compared to standard clinician debrief. It also suggested that pilot debriefs has an impact on knowledge and patient safety. This data has been used to formulate a pilot lead human factors training course and will will contact participants in 6 months to see if this simulation impact future resuscitations.","output":"Does having simulation debriefs run by human factor experts impact learners understanding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute invasive fungal sinusitis is an aggressive infection affecting immunocomprosmised patients and carries a high mortality.

High-intensity-focused ultrasound nor interstitial lasers are discussed, as there have been no recently published updates. SUMMARY Needle and probe-based ablative treatments will continue to play an important role. As three-dimensional imaging workstations move from the advanced radiologic interventional suite to the operating room, surgeons will likely still play a pivotal role in the +-application of these probe ablative devices.

The enhancement is likely attributed to increased expression of IL-6 and TNF- and reduction in ROS expression. Similar beneficial effects of GMI on the suppression of MDSC expansion and IL-6 expression are also observed in the whole blood and reduces the accumulation of MDSCs in the infected bone region in a mouse PJI infection model.

Background: Little is known about the place based impacts of the pandemic on families with young children. We describe the living circumstances of families with children under five or expecting a baby living in Tower Hamlets during the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, and then examine the relative importance of household characteristics such as ethnicity and household income for adverse impacts on survey respondents, as seen in mental health outcomes. Method: a community survey sample recruited with support from the local council comprised 75% mothers/pregnant women, 25% fathers/partners of pregnant women. Reflecting the borough population, 35 percent were White British or Irish and 36 percent were Bangladeshi, and the remainder were from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Adopting an assets based approach, we describe material, familial and community assets using three household income bands and seven ethnic groups. We then use regressions to identify which assets were most important in mitigating adversity. Results: We find that material assets (income, employment, food insecurity, housing quality) were often insecure and in decline but familial assets (home caring practices, couple relationships) were largely sustained. Community assets (informal support, service provision) were less available or means of access had changed. Our analyses find that while descriptively ethnicity structured adverse impacts of the pandemic related changes to family life, income and couple relationships were the most important assets for mitigating adversity as seen in mental health status.

Exoskeleton-assisted walking (EAW) may be one way to improve physical activity for adults with SCI and potentially alleviate secondary health complications. The effects of EAW may be limited, however, since exoskeletons induce passive movement for users who cannot volitionally contribute to walking. Trans-spinal stimulation (TSS) has shown the potential to enable those with even the most severe SCI to actively contribute to movements during EAW. To explore the effects of EAW training on improving secondary health complications in persons with SCI, participants with chronic (n = 8) were enrolled in an EAW program 2C3 times per week for 12 weeks. Anthropometrics (seated and supine waist and abdominal circumferences (WC and AC), body composition assessment (dual exposure x-ray absorptiometry-derived body fat percent, lean mass and total mass for the total body, legs, and trunk), and peak oxygen consumption (VO(2) during a 6-minute walk test [6MWT]) were assessed before and after 12 weeks of EAW training. A subset of participants (n = 3) completed EAW training with concurrent TSS, and neuromuscular activity of locomotor muscles was assessed during a 10-m walk test (10MWT) with and without TSS following 12 weeks of EAW training. Upon completion of 12 weeks of training, reductions from baseline (BL) were found in seated WC (?2.2%, P = 0.036), seated AC (?2.9%, P = 0.05), and supine AC (?3.9%, P = 0.017).

The addition of TSS for three individuals yielded individualized responses but generally increased knee extensor activity during EAW. Two of three participants who received TSS were also able to initiate more steps without additional assistance from the exoskeleton during a 10MWT. In summary, 12 weeks of EAW training significantly attenuated markers of obesity relevant to cardiometabolic health in eight men with chronic SCI.

In many settings, TB resources, facilities and equipment are being redirected towards COVID-19 response. AIM: We sought to assess the COVID-19 pandemics impact on TB services in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. METHODS: The fifty-three European Region Member States were asked to report qualitative and quantitative data in quarter one and two (Q1 and Q2) 2020. TB notifications were triangulated with the severity score on domestic movement restrictions to assess how they may have influenced TB detection. RESULTS: Twenty-nine countries reported monthly TB notifications for the first half of 2019 and 2020. TB notifications decreased by 35.5% during Q2 2020 compared with Q2 2019, which is six-fold more than the average annual decrease of 5.1% documented during 2015C2019. The number of patients enrolled in rifampicin-resistant/multidrug-resistant TB treatment also decreased dramatically in Q2 2020, by 33.5%. The highest movement restriction severity score was observed between April and May 2020, which coincided with the highest observed decrease in TB notifications. CONCLUSION: A decrease in TB detection and enrolment to treatment may cause increases in TB burden and threatens the Regions ability to reach the TB targets of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, still this might be mitigated with rapid restoration of TB services and the implementation of targeted interventions during periods with severe PHSM in place, such as those introduced in response to

is a disease with high morbidity and mortality among elderly residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF). During an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the LTCF an effective screening tool is essential to identify the patients at risk for severe disease. We explored the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a predictor for severe disease during the outbreak of Covid-19 in one LTCF in Slovakia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of cases of COVID-19, diagnosed during the outbreak in one LTCF in Slovakia between April 11, 2020, and May 5, 2020. Within 24 h after the diagnosis of Covid-19, clinical and laboratory screening was performed in the LTCF to identify patients in need of hospitalization. Patients with oxygen saturation below 90% were immediately referred to the hospital. Patients staying in the LFTC were monitored daily and those that developed hypoxemia were transferred to the hospital. We analyzed the association between the IL-6 at the initial assessment and development of hypoxemia during follow up and determined the cut-off of the IL-6 able to predict the development of hypoxemia requiring oxygen therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (11 men, 42 women) with diagnosed Covid-19 were included in the analysis. 19 (53%) patients developed hypoxemia during the disease. Patients with hypoxemia had significantly higher concentrations of IL-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase at initial screening. ROC analyses identified IL-6 as the most robust predictor of hypoxemia. The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL predicted the development of hypoxemia with the sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88.9%. The positive and negative predictive values were 76.9, and 100% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL at initial assessment predicted the development of hypoxemia requiring hospitalization with excellent sensitivity and good specificity. IL-6 appears as a potential predictor for the development of the severe Covid-19 and might serve for early identification of patients in need of hospitalization. Further studies are needed to evaluate the robustness of the use of IL-6 as an effective screening tool for the severe course of Covid-19.","output":"Role of interleukin 6 as a predictive factor for a severe course of Covid-19: retrospective data analysis of patients from a long-term care facility during Covid-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, I use a simple SIR Macro model to examine Japans soft lockdown policies in 2021 under the COVID-19 crisis.

The first part, which was originally reported in February 2021, studies the Japans second soft lockdown policy (state of emergency declaration) from January to March 2021. After the model is calibrated using 2020 data, the results show that a long enough lockdown can avoid future lockdowns, improving both the infection and the economy. In addition, I propose the ICU targeting policy, which keeps the number of severe patients at a constant level, mimicking the monetary policys inflation targeting. The models prediction is evaluated from an ex-post perspective in the second part, written in July 2021. I find that the model broadly captures the realized consequences of the second soft lockdown and the subsequent paths. Furthermore, the simulation is projected to the end of the pandemic under a revised scenario, incorporating the proliferation of COVID-19 variants.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the status of OE to infectious risks and use of PPE. METHODS: A convenience sample of 907 questionnaires (response rate, 88.5%) was collected from September 1, 2014, to January 31, 2015, in 5 metropolitan Korean cities. RESULTS: Respiratory diseases were significantly prevalent (44.5%) and influenza (29.5%) was the most frequently reported illness. An exposure report was only made in 19.5% of cases. The primary reason for OE report noncompletion was the complexity of the reporting process (23.9%). A total of 365 participants reported OE to body fluids and blood (40.2%) with needlestick injury being the most frequent OE type (17.6%). More than 5 years of job experience (47.8%) (P < .001) and region (city) (P = .003) significantly increased OE to body fluids and blood.

This study examines the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on childrens oral health and access to dental care in the United States. Methods Using nationally representative data from the National Survey of Childrens Health, we compare several measures of childrens oral health and dental care use early during the pandemic in 2020, and one year earlier. Logistic (multinomial or binary) regression models are estimated adjusting for several child/household covariates and state fixed effects. Similar comparisons are estimated for 2019 relative to 2018 to evaluate pre-pandemic trends. Results Children in 2020 were 16% (relative risk ratio or RRR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.75,0.93) less likely to have excellent dental health as perceived by parents and 75% (RRR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.14,2.67) more likely to have poor dental health than 2019. Also, children in 2020 had higher risk for bleeding gums (odds ratio or OR=1.46, 95% CI:1.16,1.85). The likelihood of having a dental visit in the past 12 months was 27% (OR=0.73, 95% CI:0.65,0.82) lower in 2020 including lower likelihood for preventive visits. The 2020-2019 differences were observed across demographic and socioeconomic subgroups. There were no such differences between 2019 and 2018.

Our study aimed to describe how IM rounding practices changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and to understand the impacts of these changes on medical education. METHODS: We conducted a two-phase, mixed-methods study of inpatient IM rounding team practices at a large academic hospital in Houston, TX. In the first phase (January-February 2021), we organized and audio-recorded 4 virtual (Zoom) focus groups. Each included 5-6 rounding team members, divided by: attendings; senior residents; interns; and medical and physician assistant students. In the second phase (March-May 2021), we performed 6 direct observations of IM teams during rounds. Two observers systematically recorded variables such as time spent on non-bedside versus bedside rounds, number of each team member type entering patient rooms for bedside teaching, and types of personal protective equipment (PPE) worn. RESULTS: Topics discussed during focus groups included comparisons of rounding team size, rounding duration, physical distancing and PPE use, bedside education, communication methods, and patient safety before and after March 2020. Perceptions of changes in each topic were generally consistent across groups (Table 1). Direct observation data showed that team rounding styles remained diverse in the proportion of rounding time spent in an office versus on the wards, and in the number and types of team members entering patient rooms. IM team members uniformly wore respiratory PPE when entering all patient rooms; use of eye protection varied. Teams spent more total time discussing patients with or suspected to have COVID-19 compared to patients without COVID-19 (median 24 min versus 13 min, p< 0.0001). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted bedside medical education, even into Spring of 2021. Conclusions from this study can be used to 1) address educational gaps related to COVID-19 pandemic-associated rounding changes and 2) create innovative methods of providing high-quality clinical education that will be minimally impacted by future respiratory virus pandemics.

Air medical movement of individuals with potential infectious disease poses unique challenges and threats to crews and receiving personnel. The US Department of Health and Human Services air medical evacuation teams of the National Disaster Medical System directly supported 39 flights, moving over 2,000 individuals. Infection control precautions focused on source and engineering controls, personal protective equipment, safe work practices to limit contamination, and containment of the area of potential contamination. Source control to limit transmission distance was used by requiring all passengers to wear masks (surgical masks for persons under investigation and N95 for known positives). Engineering controls used plastic sheeting to segregate and treat patients who developed symptoms while airborne. Crews used Tyvek (Dupont Richmond, VA) suits with booties and a hood, a double layer of gloves, and either a powered air-purifying respirator or an N95 mask with a face shield. For those outside the 6-ft range, an N95 mask and gloves were worn. Safe work practices were used, which included mandatory aircraft surface decontamination, airflow exchanges, and designated lavatories.

When mapped for the entire economy and geographic locations of a country, supply chains form a spatial web of interactions among suppliers and buyers. One way to characterize supply chains is through multiregional input-output linkages. Using a multiregional input-output dataset, we build the multilayer network of supply chains in the United States. Together with a network cascade model, the multilayer network is used to explore the propagation of economic shocks along intranational supply chains. We find that the effect of economic shocks, measured using the avalanche size or total number of collapsed nodes, varies widely depending on the geographic location and economic sector of origin of a shock. The response of the supply chains to shocks reveals a threshold-like behavior. Below a certain failure or fragility level, the avalanche size increases relatively quickly for any node in the network. Based on this result, we find that the most fragile regions tend to be located in the central United States, which are regions that tend to specialize in food production and manufacturing. The most fragile layers are chemical and pharmaceutical products, services and food-related products, which are all sectors that have been disrupted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. The fragility risk, measured by the intersection of the fragility level of a node and its exposure to shocks, varies across regions and sectors. This suggests that interventions aiming to make the supply-chain network more robust to shocks are likely needed at multiple levels of network aggregation.","output":"Fragility of a multilayer network of intranational supply chains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By the end of year 2019, the new virus SARS-CoV-2 appeared, causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and spread very fast globally.

This study is aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of the LS by determining the cutoff value of the LS that could predict CD-related emergency hospitalization. Methods This retrospective single-center study included 125 patients who underwent CE for small bowel CD. Eighty-six patients whose treatment was not changed after CE were analyzed. Inflammatory activity was assessed with the LS. We examined the clinical course of the patients who could be observed for 1 year after CE and investigated the LS cutoff value that could predict CD-related emergency hospitalization within 1 year. We also examined the hospitalization-free and clinical relapse-free rates using the LS cutoff value and evaluated the factors related to emergency hospitalization. Results The LS cutoff value that could predict CD-related emergency hospitalization within 1 year was 264 (area under the curve, 0.92 (P < 0.001); sensitivity, 0.80; and specificity, 0.94). The cumulative hospitalization-free rate and cumulative clinical relapse-free rate were significantly higher in patients with a LS < 264 (P < 0.001).

METHODS: Surrogate specimens were prepared by combining multiple, residual SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical specimens and diluting to near-LOD levels in either porcine or human mucus (matrix), inoculating foam or polyester nasal swabs, and sealing in dry tubes. Swabs were then subjected to one of three temperature excursions: (1) 4C for up to 72 hours; (2) 40C for 12 hours, followed by 32C for up to 60 hours; or (3) multiple freeze-thaw cycles (-20C). The stability of extracted SARS-CoV-2 RNA for each condition was evaluated by qPCR. Separate usability studies for the dry polyester swab-based HealthPulse@home COVID-19 Specimen Collection Kit were later conducted in both adult and pediatric populations. RESULTS: Polyester swabs stored dry demonstrated equivalent performance to foam swabs for detection of low and moderate SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Mimicking warm- and cold- climate shipment, surrogate specimens were stable following either 72 hours of a high-temperature excursion or two freeze-thaw cycles. In addition, usability studies comprised of self-collected patient specimens yielded sufficient material for molecular testing, as demonstrated by RNase P detection.

The empirical results show that the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity present antipersistence in the long run and that they tend to be positively persistent in the short run. The negative cross-correlations between the interest rate and stock market liquidity are more significant than the positive cross-correlations. Furthermore, the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity display multifractal characteristics, explaining the variations in the relationship between the interest rate and stock market liquidity at different time scales. In addition, the lower degree of multifractality in the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity confirms that it is effective for the interest rate to control stock market liquidity. The Chinese stock market liquidity is more sensitive to fluctuations in the money market rate in the short term and is inelastic in response to the money market rate in the long term. In particular, the positive cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity in the short run become strong in periods of crises and emergencies. All the evidence proves that the interest rate policy is an emergency response rather than an effective response to mounting concerns regarding the economic impact of unexpected exogenous emergencies and that the interest rate cut policy will not be as effective as expected.","output":"Nonlinear relationship between money market rate and stock market liquidity in China: A multifractal analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Food supply concerns have featured prominently in the UK response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In logistic regression models, those moving from employment to unemployment had higher odds of reporting food insecurity relative to furloughed individuals (OR=2.23; 95% CI: 1.20 to 4.13) and to the persistently employed (OR=2.38; 95% CI: 1.33 to 4.27), adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Furloughed individuals did not differ significantly in their probability of experiencing food insecurity compared to the persistently employed (OR=1.07; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.37). Interpretation: Food insecurity has increased substantially in the UK.

Ideally, the E-field induced during TMS is concentrated on a targeted cortical region of interest (ROI). Objective To improve the accuracy of TMS we have developed a fast computational auxiliary dipole method (ADM) for determining the optimum coil position and orientation. The optimum coil placement maximizes the E-field along a predetermined direction or the overall E-field magnitude in the targeted ROI. Furthermore, ADM can assess E-field uncertainty resulting from precision limitations of TMS coil placement protocols, enabling minimization and statistical analysis of E-field dose variability. Method ADM leverages the reciprocity principle to rapidly compute the TMS induced E-field in the ROI by using the E-field generated by a virtual constant current source residing in the ROI. The framework starts by solving for the conduction currents resulting from this ROI current source. Then, it rapidly determines the average E-field induced in the ROI for each coil position by using the conduction currents and a fast-multipole method. To further speed-up the computations, the coil is approximated using auxiliary dipoles enabling it to represent all coil orientations for a given coil position with less than 600 dipoles. Results Using ADM, the E-fields generated in an MRI-derived head model when the coil is placed at 5,900 different scalp positions and 360 coil orientations per position can be determined in under 15 minutes on a standard laptop computer. This enables rapid extraction of the optimum coil position and orientation as well as the E-field uncertainty resulting from coil positioning uncertainty. Conclusion ADM enables the rapid determination of coil placement that maximizes E-field delivery to a specific brain target. This method can find the optimum coil placement in under 15 minutes enabling its routine use for TMS. Furthermore, it enables the fast quantification of uncertainty in the induced E-field due to limited precision of TMS coil placement protocols. Highlights Auxiliary dipole method (ADM) optimizes TMS coil placement in under 8 minutes Optimum orientations are near normal to the sulcal wall TMS induced E-field is less sensitive to orientation than position errors","output":"Fast computational optimization of TMS coil placement for individualized electric field targeting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 affects many societies by measures as social distancing, forcing mental health care professionals to deliver treatments online or via telephone.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbance mediates the relationship between attachment insecurity and three measures of health (perceived general health, physical symptoms and sick days) in a group that is at high risk of sleep disturbance: hospital based health-care workers. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one nondepressed female hospital workers completed self-report measures of adult attachment, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms (excluding sleep-related items) and health outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation was tested with sequential regression analyses. RESULTS: Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were significantly associated with impairment in global sleep quality (=.20 and .19, respectively, P<.05) and physical symptoms (=.21 and .19, P<.05). Attachment anxiety was also associated with depressive symptoms (=.33, P<.001) and sick days (=.21, P<.05). For both physical symptoms and sick days, mediation analyses were consistent with global sleep quality acting as a partial mediator of the relationship between attachment anxiety and physical health. Non-sleep-related depressive symptoms were a stronger mediator.

This study examines the course of MHC from childhood to adolescence and patterning by gender and disadvantage, in Australian and UK contexts. METHODS: Data: Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n=4983) and the Millennium Cohort Study (n=18 296). Measures: A measure capturing key aspects of MHC was derived summing items from the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, assessed at 4-5 years, 6-7 years, 10-11 years and 14-15 years. Analysis: Proportions of children with high MHC (scores &#8805;23 of range 8-24) were estimated by age and country. Random-effects models were used to define MHC trajectories according to baseline MHC and change over time. Sociodemographic patterns were described. RESULTS: The prevalence of high MHC steadily increased from 4 years to 15 years (from 13.6% to 15.8% and 20.6% to 26.2% in Australia and the UK, respectively). Examination of trajectories revealed that pathways of some children diverge from this normative MHC progression. For example, 7% and 9% of children in Australia and the UK, respectively, had a low starting point and decreased further in MHC by mid-adolescence.

While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost. The simplified setup combines existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts. We built the system around an inexpensive camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and use an inexpensive tablet computer for presenting view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. The improved system is thoroughly documented.

However, these reforms were embarked on in the absence of timely and accurate information about the capacity of non-acute care to take on a more central role in the system. To help address this gap, this paper outlines the most comprehensive analysis to date of geographic inequalities in non-acute care supply in Ireland. Methods: Data on the supply of 10 non-acute services including primary care, allied health, and care for older people, were collated. Per capita supply for each service is described for 28 counties in Ireland (Tipperary and Dublin divided into North and South), using 2014 supply and population data. To examine inequity in the geographic distribution of services, raw population in each county was adjusted for a range of needs indicators. Results: The findings show considerable geographic inequalities across counties in the supply of non-acute care. Some counties had low levels of supply of several types of non-acute care. The findings remain largely unchanged after adjusting for need, suggesting that the unequal patterns of supply are also inequitable. Conclusions: In the context of population changes and the influence of non-need factors, the persistence of historical budgeting in Ireland has led to considerable geographic inequities in non-acute supply, with important lessons for Ireland and for other countries. Such inequities come into sharp relief in the context of COVID-19, where non-acute supply plays a crucial role in ensuring that acute services are preserved for treating acutely ill patients.","output":"Geographic inequalities in non-acute healthcare supply: evidence from Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need for personal protective equipment increased exponentially in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. To cope with the mask shortage during springtime 2020, a French consortium was created to find ways to reuse medical and respiratory masks in healthcare departments. The consortium addressed the complex context of the balance between cleaning medical masks in a way that maintains their safety and functionality for reuse, with the environmental advantage to manage medical disposable waste despite the current mask designation as single-use by the regulatory frameworks. We report a Workflow that provides a quantitative basis to determine the safety and efficacy of a medical mask that is decontaminated for reuse. The type IIR polypropylene medical masks can be washed up to 10 times, washed 5 times and autoclaved 5 times, or washed then sterilized with radiations or ethylene oxide, without any degradation of their filtration or breathability properties. There is loss of the anti-projection properties. The Workflow rendered the medical masks to comply to the AFNOR S76-001 standard as type 1 non-sanitory usage masks. This qualification gives a legal status to the Workflow-treated masks and allows recommendation for the reuse of washed medical masks by the general population, with the significant public health advantage of providing better protection than cloth-tissue masks. Additionally, such a legal status provides a basis to perform a clinical trial to test the masks in real conditions, with full compliance with EN 14683 norm, for collective reuse. The rational reuse of medical mask and their end-of-life management is critical, particularly in pandemic periods when decisive turns can be taken. The reuse of masks in the general population, in industries, or in hospitals (but not for surgery) has significant advantages for the management of waste without degrading the safety of individuals wearing reused masks.","output":"Reuse of medical face masks in domestic and community settings without sacrificing safety: Ecological and economical lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I study the economic effects of testing during the outbreak of a novel disease.

The proposed end-to-end CVR-Net is a multi-scale-multi-encoder ensemble model, where we have aggregated the outputs from two different encoders and their different scales to obtain the final prediction probability. We train and test the proposed CVR-Net on three different datasets, where the images have collected from different open-source repositories. We compare our proposed CVR-Net with state-of-the-art methods, which are trained and tested on the same datasets. We split three datasets into five different tasks, where each task has a different number of classes, to evaluate the multi-tasking CVR-Net. Our model achieves an overall F1-score & accuracy of 0.997 & 0.998;0.963 & 0.964;0.816 & 0.820;0.961 & 0.961;and 0.780 & 0.780, respectively, for task-1 to task-5. As the CVR-Net provides promising results on the small datasets, it can be an auspicious computer-aided diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of coronavirus to assist the clinical practitioners and radiologists.

However, a common side effect of sevelamer HCl, metabolic acidosis, is particularly concerning in children, as it can contribute to poor growth. Sevelamer carbonate is now available and has been shown to increase serum bicarbonate in adult patients. We conducted a prospective single-center study of pediatric dialysis patients comparing serum bicarbonate before and 3 months after a switch from sevelamer HCl to sevelamer carbonate. Inclusion criteria were a minimum of 3 months of dialysis therapy and either a serum bicarbonate <20 mmol/L or the need for sodium bicarbonate supplementation. Ten hemodialysis and 14 peritoneal dialysis patients, aged 16  3 years, were enrolled. Whereas serum calcium and phosphorus remained unchanged, serum bicarbonate increased from 20 (17.2C22.0) to 24.5 (20.75C26) mmol/L (p < 0.001) after 3 months of sevelamer carbonate therapy. Sodium bicarbonate supplementation was stopped in all patients (n = 10), reducing the mean daily sodium intake by an average of 2.3 g per patient. These results demonstrate that sevelamer carbonate is an effective phosphate binder that improves acid-base status in pediatric dialysis patients.","output":"Sevelamer carbonate increases serum bicarbonate in pediatric dialysis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential protective or pathogenic role of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been vigorously debated. While COVID-19 patients consistently generate a T lymphocyte response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, evidence of significant immune dysregulation in these patients continues to accumulate. In this study, next generation sequencing of the T cell receptor beta chain (TRB) repertoire was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients to determine if immunogenetic differences of the TRB repertoire contribute to disease course severity. Clustering of highly similar TRB CDR3 amino acid sequences across COVID-19 patients yielded 781 shared TRB sequences. The TRB sequences were then filtered for known associations with common diseases such as EBV and CMV. The remaining sequences were cross-referenced to a publicly accessible dataset that mapped COVID-19 specific TCRs to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We identified 158 SARS-CoV-2 specific TRB sequences belonging to 134 clusters in our COVID-19 patients. Next, we investigated 113 SARS-CoV-2 specific clusters binding only one peptide target in relation to disease course. Distinct skewing of SARS-CoV-2 specific TRB sequences toward the nonstructural proteins (NSPs) encoded within ORF1a/b of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was observed in clusters associated with critical disease course when compared to COVID-19 clusters associated with a severe disease course. These data imply that T-lymphocyte reactivity towards peptides from NSPs of SARS-CoV-2 may not constitute an effective adaptive immune response and thus may negatively affect disease severity.","output":"TRB sequences targeting ORF1a/b are associated with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 6,287 Australian health care workers (HCWs) were fit tested to N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). This study determined how readily HCWs were fitted to 8 FFRs and how age and sex influenced testing. METHODS: HCWs were fit tested following the quantitative OSHA protocol. After bivariate analysis, a logistic regression model assessed the effect of FFR model, HCW age and sex on fit test results. RESULTS: Of 4,198 female and 2,089 male HCWs tested, 93.3% were successfully fitted. Fifty-five percent passed the first FFR, 21% required 2 and 23% required testing on 3 or more models. Males were 15% less likely to pass compared to females (P < .001). Individuals aged 18-29 were significantly more likely to pass compared to colleagues aged 30-59.

CONCLUSIONS: Current N95 FFRs exhibit suboptimal fit such that a large proportion (45%) of HCWs require testing on multiple models.

Resilience is an important protective mechanism for coping with adversity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents faced hardships including being pulled from their schools and being unable to socialize with friends during mandated lockdowns. We had three aims in this study. First, we sought to test whether Chinese adolescents' resilience was strengthened, maintained, or weakened during the COVID-19 lockdown. Second, we sought to test whether adolescents' resilience predicted depressive symptoms and in turn, sleep problems. Third, we sought to examine the role social support may play. In a partially-longitudinal survey study, we demonstrated via a within-subject t-test and its Bayesian equivalent that Chinese adolescents' resilience weakened during the lockdown compared with before the pandemic. However, resilience remained an important predictor: A mediation model demonstrated that higher resilience was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, which in turn predicted fewer sleep problems. Moreover, we found that social support moderated this mediation: Strong social support reduced the negative effects of low resilience levels. These results help shed light on the fragility of resilience, its importance for adolescents' mental health when facing adversity, and how we might support adolescents experiencing social distancing mandates or who are otherwise isolated from their peers.","output":"Resilience of adolescents, though weakened during pandemic-related lockdown, serves as a protection against depression and sleep problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleic acids represent a promising lead for engineering the immune system.

The outrage of the virus has rampaged through the healthcare sector tremendously. This pandemic created a huge demand for necessary healthcare equipment, medicines along with the requirement for advanced robotics and artificial intelligence-based applications. The intelligent robot systems have great potential to render service in diagnosis, risk assessment, monitoring, telehealthcare, disinfection, and several other operations during this pandemic which has helped reduce the workload of the frontline workers remarkably. The long-awaited vaccine discovery of this deadly virus has also been greatly accelerated with AI-empowered tools. In addition to that, many robotics and Robotics Process Automation platforms have substantially facilitated the distribution of the vaccine in many arrangements pertaining to it.

As populations transitioned toward industrialized diets and lifestyles, NCDs developed. Objective We performed a systematic literature review to examine the effects of diet and lifestyle transitions on NCDs. Evidence Review We identified 22 populations that underwent a nutrition transition, eleven of which had sufficient data. Of these, we chose four populations with diverse geographies, diets and lifestyles who underwent a dietary and lifestyle transition and explored the relationship between dietary changes and health outcomes. We excluded populations with features overlapping with selected populations or with complicating factors such as inadequate data, subgroups, and different study methodologies over different periods. The selected populations were Yemenite Jews, Tokelauans, Tanushimaru Japanese, and Maasai. We also review transition data from seven excluded populations (Pima, Navajo, Aboriginal Australians, South African Natal Indians and Zulu speakers, Inuit, and Hadza) to assess for bias. Findings The three groups that replaced saturated fats (SFA) from animal (Yemenite Jews, Maasai) or plants (Tokelau) with refined carbohydrates had negative health outcomes (e.g., increased obesity, diabetes, heart disease). Yemenites reduced SFA consumption by >40% post-transition but men's BMI increased 19% and diabetes increased ~40-fold. Tokelauans reduced fat, dramatically reduced SFA, and increased sugar intake: obesity and diabetes rose. The Tanushimaruans transitioned to more fats and less carbohydrates and used more anti-hypertensive medications; stroke and breast cancer declined while heart disease was stable. The Maasai transitioned to lower fat, SFA and higher carbohydrates and had increased BMI and diabetes. Similar patterns were observed in the seven other populations. Conclusion The nutrient category most strongly associated with negative health outcomes - especially obesity and diabetes - was sugar (increased 600-650% in Yemenite Jews and Tokelauans) and refined carbohydrates (among Maasai, total carbohydrates increased 39% in men and 362% in women), while increased calories was less strongly associated with these disorders. Across 11 populations, NCDs were associated with increased refined carbohydrates more than increased calories, reduced activity or other factors, but cannot be attributed to SFA or total fat consumption.","output":"Dietary Transitions and Health Outcomes in Four Populations - Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantum has not slowed downthere were a lot of research initiatives announced this summer and [our project] is a program to support quantum education, says Emily Edwards of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, co-principal investigator of Q2Work, a program funded by the US National Science Foundation The US Department of Energy announced this summer that they will provide USD$625 million over five years to fund five National Quantum Information Science Research Centers, including SQMS and Q-NEXT Quantum has been funded before for computing, Internet, sensors, but has never been pushed to this level of bringing together academia and all the stakeholders, Grassellino tells MRS Bulletin, referring to the US initiative Since the US government signed the US National Quantum Initiative Act into law at the end of 2018, it has authorized just over USD$1 2 billion for the first five years (starting in fiscal year 2019), spread across the National Institute of Standards and Technology (USD$80 million), the National Science Foundation (NSF) (USD$10 million), and the US Department of Energy (DOE) (USD$25 million) In order to create standardized, characterized high-quality materials for quantum science and technology, Q-NEXT will focus on scaling synthesis and integration of qubits for both semiconducting- and superconducting-based materials for quantum devices and systems","output":"Quantum materials R&D forges ahead"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached the Brazilian Amazon and spread among indigenous populations.

Methods Individualized search strategies were developed through November 2018 using PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. A cumulative meta-analysis was performed by calculating pooled proportions. Subgroup analysis was performed for studies comparing EUS-BD versus ERCP. Heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran Q test or I 2 statistics, and publication bias by funnel plot and Egger's tests. Results Seven studies (n = 193 patients; 57.5 % males) evaluating primary EUS-BD for malignant biliary obstruction were included. Mean age was 67.4 years (2.3) followed an average of 5.4 months (1.0). For primary EUS-BD, pooled technical success, clinical success, and adverse event (AE) rates were 95 % (95 % CI 91 - 98), 97 % (95 % CI 93 - 100), and 19 % (95 % CI 11 - 29), respectively. Among EUS-BD and ERCP comparator studies, technical and clinical success, and total AEs were not different with lower rates of post-ERCP pancreatitis and reintervention among the EUS-BD group. Conclusion Primary EUS-BD is an effective treatment with few AE.

Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the genomic variation and genetic evolution characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. The main purpose of this study was to detect the entry of different SARS-CoV-2 variants into Jiangsu Province, China. Methods: First, oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 165 patients (55 locally confirmed cases and 110 imported cases with confirmed and asymptomatic infection) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Jiangsu Province, China between January 2020 and June 2021. Then, whole genome sequencing was used to explore the phylogeny and find potential mutations in genes of the SARS-CoV-2. Last, association analysis among clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern, pedigree surveillance analysis of SARS-COV-2, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detection in SARS-COV-2 samples was performed. Results: More men were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 when compared with women. The onset of the SARS-CoV-2 showed a trend of younger age. Moreover, the number of asymptomatic infected patients was large, similar to the number of common patients. Patients infected with Alpha (50%) and Beta (90%) variants were predominantly asymptomatic, while patients infected with Delta (17%) variant presented severe clinical features. A total of 935 SNPs were detected in 165 SARS-COV-2 samples. Among which, missense mutation (58%) was the dominant mutation type. About 56% of SNPs changes occurred in the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) gene. Approximately, 20% of SNP changes occurred in spike glycoprotein (S) gene, such as p.Asp501Tyr, p.Pro681His, and p.Pro681Arg. In total, nine SNPs loci in S gene were significantly correlated with the severity of patients. It is worth mentioning that amino acid substitution of p.Asp614Gly was significantly positively correlated with the clinical severity of patients. The amino acid replacements of p.Ser316Thr and p.Lu484Lys were significantly negatively correlated with the course of disease. Conclusion: Sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may further undergo a variety of mutations in different hosts, countries, and weather conditions.

Detection and quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 antispike antibodies were performed by the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant; Abbott). Results greater than or equal to the cutoff value 50.0 AU/ml were reported as positive. After the first dose, antispike antibodies were detected in 834 of 1072 (77.8%) HCWs. Seropositivity was higher among females (84.6%) than males (70.6%) (p < 0.001) and was found to be highest in both women and men between the ages of 18-34.

The focus of this study is on additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), which was the dominant manufacturing method employed in these production efforts. Production details from a variety of informal production efforts were systematically analyzed to quantify the scale and efficiency of different efforts. Data for this analysis was primarily drawn from detailed survey data from 74 individuals who participated in these different production efforts, as well as from a systematic review of 145 publicly available news stories. This rich dataset enables a comprehensive summary of the community-driven production efforts, with detailed and quantitative comparisons of different efforts. In this study, factors that influenced production efficiency and success were investigated, including choice of PPE designs, production logistics, and additive manufacturing processes employed by makerspaces and universities. From this investigation, several themes emerged including challenges associated with matching production rates to demand, production methods with vastly different production rates, inefficient production due to slow build times and high scrap rates, and difficulty obtaining necessary feedstocks. Despite these challenges, nearly every maker involved in these production efforts categorized their response as successful. Lessons learned and themes derived from this systematic study of these results are compiled and presented to help inform better practices for future community-driven use of additive manufacturing, especially in response to emergencies.","output":"Community-driven PPE production using additive manufacturing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Survey and lessons learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The impact of COVID-19 vaccination on breastfeeding is unknown. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether vaccine-related side effects following COVID-19 vaccination were associated with an adverse impact on breastfeeding. Secondarily, we sought to determine perceived symptoms in breastfed children and maternal opinion about COVID-19 vaccination. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of breastfeeding mothers who underwent COVID-19 vaccination >2 days before the survey. Subjects were recruited through social media and websites. Data included sociodemographic information, vaccine history, maternal and child symptoms, and impact on lactation/breastfeeding. Bivariate statistics (chi-square, Wilcoxon rank sum, and t tests) and multivariable logistic regression models examined the association of vaccine side effects with lactation, symptoms in breastfed children, and maternal opinion on vaccination. Results: Analysis included 4,455 breastfeeding mothers. Maternal postvaccination symptoms were more common after the second dose (p < 0.001). Overall, 77 (1.7%) respondents reported a negative impact on breastfeeding postvaccination, and these mothers were more likely to have experienced fatigue, headache, muscle pain, injection site pain, chills, fever, or allergic reactions. After adjusting for confounding variables, higher odds of an adverse impact on lactation were associated with lower breastfeeding intensity, dose of vaccine, and child symptoms. Even among mothers who reported an adverse impact on breastfeeding, maternal opinion about vaccination and confidence in their decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine were high. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination among breastfeeding mothers resulted in minimal disruption of lactation or adverse impact on the breastfed child. These findings may be considered in vaccination decision-making.","output":"Maternal and Child Symptoms Following COVID-19 Vaccination Among Breastfeeding Mothers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Little is known about allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) patients medication adherence strategies. Acceptability and preferences regarding electronic monitoring (EM) systems to assess all three phases of medication adherence (ie, initiation, implementation, persistence) are crucial to allow their successful implementation in clinical or research settings but have not yet been evaluated. We therefore aimed to explore: 1) alloSCT patients medication adherence and self-management strategies; and 2) their acceptability and preferences of three different EM systems (MEMS Cap, Helping Hand, Button) as part of the Swiss SMILe study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Respecting anti-pandemic measures, we used a purposive sample of six adult alloSCT patients from the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland (USB)6 weeks to 2 years post-alloSCTto conduct three focus group sessions with two patients each. Using a semi-structured outline, we explored 1) patients medication adherence strategies and medication self-management; and 2) their acceptance and preferences regarding EM use. The three tested EM systems were available for testing during each session. Discussions were audio-recorded, visualized using mind-mapping and analyzed using Mayrings qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Patients (33% females; mean age 54.616.3 years; 10.48.4 months post-alloSCT) used medication adherence enhancing strategies (eg, preparing pillbox, linking intake to a habit). Still, they indicated that post-alloSCT medication management was challenging (eg, frequent schedule changes). All participants preferred the MEMS Button. Participants said its small size and the possibility to combine it with existing pillboxes (eg, putting it into/next to them) made them more confident about implementing it in their daily lives. CONCLUSION: Regarding EM systems for medication adherence, end-user preferences and acceptability influence adoption and fidelity. Of the three systems tested, our sample found the MEMS Button most acceptable and most preferable. Therefore, we will use it for our USB SMILe study.","output":"Exploring Stem Cell Transplanted Patients Perspectives on Medication Self-Management and Electronic Monitoring Devices Measuring Medication Adherence: A Qualitative Sub-Study of the Swiss SMILe Implementation Science Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At first glance, the COVID-19 pandemic and the field of orthopaedics and traumatology do not appear to be related.

COVID-19 vaccines may substantially reduce these risks, but evidence is needed of their effectiveness for incarcerated people, who are confined in large, risky congregate settings. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people in California prisons from December 22, 2020 through March 1, 2021. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provided daily data for all prison residents including demographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics, as well as COVID-19 testing, vaccination status, and outcomes. We estimated vaccine effectiveness using multivariable Cox models with time-varying covariates that adjusted for resident characteristics and infection rates across prisons. FindingsAmong 60,707 residents in the cohort, 49% received at least one BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 dose during the study period. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-82%) from day 14 after first dose until receipt of second dose and 97% (95% CI, 88-99%) from day 14 after second dose. Effectiveness was similar among the subset of residents who were medically vulnerable (74% [95% CI, 62-82%] and 92% [95% CI, 74-98%] from 14 days after first and second doses, respectively), as well as among the subset of residents who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (71% [95% CI, 58-80%] and 96% [95% CI, 67-99%]). ConclusionsConsistent with results from randomized trials and observational studies in other populations, mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people. Prioritizing incarcerated people for vaccination, redoubling efforts to boost vaccination and continuing other ongoing mitigation practices are essential in preventing COVID-19 in this disproportionately affected population.

MBL can bind to sugar determinants of a wide variety of microorganisms, neutralize them and inhibit infection by complement activation through the lectin pathway and opsonization by collectin receptors. Given that small intestine is a predominant site of extrahepatic expression of MBL, here we addressed the question whether MBL is involved in mucosal innate immunity. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) genes of mouse MBL-C (mMBL-C) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant mMBL-C-CRD binds to Shigella flexneri 2a in a calcium-dependent manner and that interaction could be blocked by the anti-mMBL-C-CRD antibody. mMBL-C-CRD protein could inhibit the adhesion of S. flexneri 2a to intestinal mucosa, while administration of anti-mMBL-C-CRD antibody caused an increased level of bacteria adhesion in vitro. Administration of recombinant mMBL-C-CRD protein reduced the secretion of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 from primary intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with S. flexneri 2a. Furthermore, neutralization of MBL activity by anti-MBL-C-CRD resulted in a significant increase in the number of S. flexneri 2a that colonized the intestines of BALB/c mice and attenuated the severity of inflammation seen in the areas of bacterial invasion. These findings suggest that mMBL-C may protect host intestinal mucosa by directly binding to the bacteria.","output":"Protective role of mouse MBL-C on intestinal mucosa during Shigella flexneri invasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study intends to identify the best model for predicting the incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Ningbo by comparing Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) models combined and uncombined with exogenous meteorological variables. Methods: The data of daily HFMD incidence in Ningbo from January 2014 to November 2017 were set as the training set, and the data of December 2017 were set as the test set. ARIMA and LSTM models combined and uncombined with exogenous meteorological variables were adopted to fit the daily incidence of HFMD by using the data of the training set. The forecasting performances of the four fitted models were verified by using the data of the test set. Root mean square error (RMSE) was selected as the main measure to evaluate the performance of the models. Results: The RMSE for multivariate LSTM, univariate LSTM, ARIMA and ARIMAX (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model with Exogenous Input Variables) was 10.78, 11.20, 12.43 and 14.73, respectively. The LSTM model with exogenous meteorological variables has the best performance among the four models and meteorological variables can increase the prediction accuracy of LSTM model. For the ARIMA model, exogenous meteorological variables did not increase the prediction accuracy but became the interference factor of the model. Conclusions: Multivariate LSTM is the best among the four models to fit the daily incidence of HFMD in Ningbo.

METHODS: We sought to understand the patient experience by developing and distributing an anonymous online survey to those who underwent non-emergency surgery at a large academic tertiary medical center between March and October 2020. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 184 patients; the majority were white (84%), female (74.6%), and ranged from 18 to 88 years old. Patients were likely unaware of case delay as only 23.6% reported a delay, 82% of which agreed with that decision. Conversely, 44% felt that the delay negatively impacted their quality of life. Overall, 82.7% of patients indicated high satisfaction with their care. African American patients more often indicated a neutral vs satisfactory hospital experience (P < .05) and considered postponing their surgery (P < .01). Interestingly, younger patients (<60) were more likely than older (60) patients to note anxiety associated with having surgery during the pandemic (P < .01), feeling unprepared for discharge (P < .02), not being allowed visitors (P < .02), and learning about the spread of COVID-19 from health care providers (P < .02). DISCUSSION: These results suggest that patients are resilient and accepting of changes to health care delivery during the current pandemic; however, certain patient populations may have higher levels of anxiety which could be addressed by their care provider.

A comparison of CFR between countries with total cases  1,000 was observed for 12(th) and 23(rd) March. RESULTS: Italys CFR was the highest of all countries studied for both time points (12(th) March, 6.22% versus 23(rd) March, 9.26%).

In this context, a number of questions arose, from the increased stroke risk due to COVID-19 infection to the quality of stroke patient care. The overwhelming need of COVID-19 patient management made mandatory a complete re-organization of the stroke pathways: many health professionals were reallocated and a number of stroke units was turned into COVID-19 wards. As a result, acute stroke care suffered from a shortage of services and delays in time-dependent treatments and diagnostic work-up. In-patient and out-patient care and rehabilitation facilities for stroke survivors were also reduced or slowed down, to direct resources to COVID-19 patients care and to reduce contagion risks. Overall, this is likely to result in a significant future increased burden of complications and disabilities that will impact the health care systems in the coming months. Thus, while still fighting against COVID-19 disease, authorities need to promptly implement robust action plans, including an increase of workforce, without forgetting the assurance of a high level of stroke care.

This study reports provider perspectives on the impact that COVID-19 and the transition to telehealth had on their work and their ability to deliver evidence-based practices (EBPs). METHODS: Providers (n = 93) completed online surveys with quantitative measures and open-ended items exploring their reactions to COVID-19 and to the transition to providing services via telehealth. RESULTS: Perceptions of personal risk and rumination around COVID-19 were low, while telehealth was viewed positively by providers. Three major themes emerged regarding the major impacts of COVID-19 on work: (1) the altered nature of interactions between patient/client and provider due to telehealth implementation, (2) changes in provider expectations regarding productivity, and (3) challenges maintaining work-life balance. In regard to the major impacts of COVID-19 on EBP delivery, three themes emerged: (1) increased difficulty delivering certain therapies via telehealth, (2) potential limitations to session confidentiality, and (3) challenge of engaging children in telehealth.

In total, 1,966 articles were assessed for eligibility, yielding 246 articles describing 663 neonates. Neonates who tested negative had median Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 mins, respectively, while test-positive neonates had median Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at the same time points.

COVID-19 patients showed severe abnormalities of 27 cell populations relative to healthy donors (HDs). Forty-two cytokines, neutrophil chemo-attractants, and inflammatory components were elevated in COVID-19 patients. Supervised gene expression analyses showed differential expression of genes for neutrophil activation, interferon signaling, T- and B-cell receptors, EIF2 signaling, and ICOS-ICOSL pathways in COVID-19 patients. Unsupervised analysis confirmed the prominent role of neutrophil activation, with a high abundance of CD177, a specific neutrophil activation marker. CD177 was the most highly differentially-expressed gene contributing to the clustering of severe patients and its abundance correlated with CD177 protein serum levels. CD177 levels were higher in COVID-19 patients from both the French and confirmatory Swiss cohort (n = 203) than in HDs (P< 0.01) and in ICU than non-ICU patients (P< 0.001), correlating with the time to symptoms onset (P = 0.002). Longitudinal measurements showed sustained levels of serum CD177 to discriminate between patients with the worst prognosis, leading to death, and those who recovered (P = 0.01).

The study employs discourse methodology and metaphor mapping analysis to capture the personal, organizational, and social dimensions of effective and ineffective processes of coping with an extreme health crisis. Analysis revealed that the metaphors that clinical directors used reflect a dual process of mediating and generating the social construction of meaning and facilitating effective and ineffective coping. Effective coping was facilitated by war metaphors that created a sense of mission and meaningfulness at both the organizational and the individual levels. War metaphors that generated a sense of isolation and sacrifice intensified helplessness and fear, which undermined coping.

However, the emergent self-image, as illustrated here, is characterised by commitment, altruistic motivation and personal and professional growth. The study also demonstrated a reconstruction of teachers identities, in line with reconfigured relationships with parents, a renewed commitment to space and time in teaching and learning and an attendance to pupil voice. Originality/value: There is little specific research on how teachers identities have been redefined over the course of the pandemic. This admittedly small-scale study offers insights on how teachers viewed themselves during the pandemic, what it means to be a teacher at this tumultuous time and gives voice to the hard-learned lessons they take with them into a post-Covid era. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Lost and found: an exploration of the professional identity of primary teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individual patients with life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases can petition the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through their physicians to have expanded access (EA) to drugs that are in clinical trials but have not reached full FDA approval (the single-patient investigational new drug [IND] application).

Accordingly, it was necessary to implement new online instructional approaches at the Faculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University in Egypt. Objective: To assess online learning advantages and disadvantages as perceived by medical students in addition to their preference regarding online vs face-to-face learning, Subjects and methods: This study was conducted as a cross-sectional study that included 340 students who filled an online survey consisting of 16 questions and was conducted on the Google Forms platform. Target population: years 1, 2 and 3 undergraduate medical students at Faculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University who experienced online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The mean age of students was 19.571.02, ranged from 17 to 23 years, 61% of them were females. About 63.8% of students had no previous experience with online learning. The main perceived advantages were the ability to stay home (63.8%), comfortable surrounding (52.1%) and access to online materials (47.1%), while the main perceived disadvantages were technical problems (67.6%), lack of interaction with patients (58.8%), and reduced interaction with teachers (48.5%). Most of the students found face-to-face learning is superior to online learning in improving the knowledge (p=0.005), clinical skills (p<0.001) and social competence (p<0.001). Though 77% of them rated online learning as enjoyable. Conclusion: Most of our participants preferred traditional face-to-face learning over the online learning. Stakeholders should take the required steps to improve learning by reducing the disadvantages and increasing advantages of online learning as perceived by students during this study.

However, the causality and especially the role of body fat distribution in this context is still unclear. Thus, using a univariable as well as multivariable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we investigated for the first time the causal impact of body composition on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. METHODS: As indicators of overall and abdominal obesity we considered the measures body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and trunk fat ratio (TFR). Summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for these body composition measures were drawn from the GIANT consortium and UK Biobank, while for susceptibility and severity due to COVID-19 disease data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative was used. For the COVID-19 cohort neither age nor gender was available. Total and direct causal effect estimates were calculated using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), sensitivity analyses were done applying several robust MR techniques and mediation effects of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were investigated within multivariable MR analyses. RESULTS: Genetically predicted BMI was strongly associated with both, susceptibility (ORa?=a?1.31 per 1 SD increase; 95% CI: 1.15-1.50; P-valuea?=a?7.310-5) and hospitalization (ORa?=a?1.62 per 1 SD increase; 95% CI: 1.33-1.99; P-valuea?=a?2.810-6) even after adjustment for genetically predicted visceral obesity traits. These associations were neither mediated substantially by T2D nor by CVD. Finally, total but not direct effects of visceral body fat on outcomes could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong evidence for a causal impact of overall obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 disease. The impact of abdominal obesity was weaker and disappeared after adjustment for BMI. Therefore, obese people should be regarded as a high-risk group. Future research is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking obesity with COVID-19.","output":"Impact of body composition on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity: A two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019 COVID-19 rules our daily life Due to its international nature the maritime sector is striven hardly by the pandemic Travel-restrictions limit the supply with spare parts and crew change Regular and irregular contact to the land based population facilitates the import of the virus on the ship Living in confined spaces with limited air exchange promotes the spread of the disease We report on the course of 2 outbreaks of COVID-19 on board cargo-ships in the port of Hamburg The complexity of their course illuminates the epidemiological challenges port health authorities are facing in the current situation","output":"When the ship comes in - COVID-19-Ausbruche an Bord von Frachtschiffen im Hamburger Hafen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many Australian workers were mandated to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and impact of AKI in subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 in two third- level hospitals in Cordoba, Argentina. A retrospective cohort study was conducted. 448 adults who were consecutively hospitalized for COVID-19 between March and the end of October 2020 at Hospital Privado Universitario de Cordoba and Hospital Raul Angel Ferreyra were included. The incidence of AKI was 19% (n=85). 50.6% presented AKI stage 1 (n=43), 20% stage 2 (n=17) and 29.4% stage 3 (n=25, of which 18 required renal replacement therapy). In the multivariate analysis, the variables that were independently associated with AKI were: age (adjusted Odd ratio -aOR- =1.30, 95%CI=1.04-1.63, p=0.022), history of chronic kidney disease (aOR=9.92, 95%CI=4.52-21.77, p<0.001), blood neutrophil count at admission (aOR=1.09, 95%CI=1.01-1.18, p=0.037) and requirement for mechanical ventilation (MV) (aOR=6.69, 95%CI=2.24-19.9, p=0.001).

METHODS Seven anesthetized adult swine underwent endoscopic placement of magnets into the small bowel and stomach. Using external magnets, the endoscopically placed internal magnets were brought into opposition under endoscopic view. After 1-2 weeks, the pigs were killed and analyzed. At laparotomy and under sterile conditions, peritoneal cultures were obtained. The anastomoses were evaluated endoscopically and tested using an air insufflation test. Finally, the anastomoses were resected and evaluated microscopically. RESULTS The average operative time for endoscopic placement of the magnets was 34.3 +/- 14.8 min. Successful placement and creation of anastomoses occurred in six of the pigs. One pig did not form an anastomosis because the magnets were too large to pass through the pylorus at the time of attempted magnet placement. Six swine experienced uncomplicated postoperative courses. One pig's postoperative course involved constipation for several days, requiring additional fluids and fiber supplementation. The findings at endoscopy showed that the magnets were adhered to the anastomosis, which were easily freed, or within the stomach. The air insufflation test results were negative for all the pigs. At laparotomy, there was no evidence of infection, abscess, or leak, but two peritoneal culture results were positive with scant growth of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, presumably contaminants. Microscopically, the anastomoses illustrated granulation and fibrous connective tissue without evidence of infection or leak.

Digital solutions facilitate PRO collection, but without robust electronic health record (EHR) integration, effective deployment can be hampered by low patient and clinician engagement and high development and deployment costs. The important components of digital PRO platforms have been defined, but procedures for implementing integrated solutions are not readily available. METHODS As part of the NCI's IMPACT consortium, six health care systems partnered with Epic to develop an EHR-integrated, PRO-based electronic symptom management program (eSyM) to optimize postoperative recovery and well-being during chemotherapy. The agile development process incorporated user-centered design principles that required engagement from patients, clinicians, and health care systems. Whenever possible, the system used validated content from the public domain and took advantage of existing EHR capabilities to automate processes. RESULTS eSyM includes symptom surveys on the basis of the PRO-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) plus two global wellness questions; reminders and symptom self-management tip sheets for patients; alerts and symptom reports for clinicians; and population management dashboards. EHR dependencies include a secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant patient portal; diagnosis, procedure and chemotherapy treatment plan data; registries that identify and track target populations; and the ability to create reminders, alerts, reports, dashboards, and charting shortcuts. CONCLUSION eSyM incorporates validated content and leverages existing EHR capabilities. Build challenges include the innate technical limitations of the EHR, the constrained availability of site technical resources, and sites' heterogenous EHR configurations and policies. Integration of PRO-based symptom management programs into the EHR could help overcome adoption barriers, consolidate clinical workflows, and foster scalability and sustainability. We intend to make eSyM available to all Epic users.","output":"eSyM: An Electronic Health Record-Integrated Patient-Reported Outcomes-Based Cancer Symptom Management Program Used by Six Diverse Health Systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States demand a comprehensive approach to assessing pregnancy-related risks.

This research explores the trend of vaccinations coverage from 1993 to 2014 and determines the significant factors for vaccinations coverage in Bangladesh, considering geospatial, socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics. METHODS: This study uses a secondary dataset extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) from 1992 to 93 to 2014. The association between selected independent variables and vaccination coverage of children was examined through the Chi-square test. In addition, unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression approaches were applied to determine the effects of covariates on vaccination status by using the BDHS-2014 dataset. RESULTS: The results reveal that the trend of the vaccination coverage rate has gradually been increased over the study period. The coverage rate of BCG is observed maximum while the lowest for Measles vaccination among all types of vaccinations. The findings revealed that the significantly lower coverage of all vaccination had been observed in the Sylhet region. Children of higher educated mothers (OR 10.21; CI: 4.10C25.37) and father (OR 8.71; CI: 4.03C18.80), born at health facilities (OR 4.53; CI: 2.4C8.55) and whose mother has media exposure (OR 3.20; CI: 2.22C4.60) have more chance of receiving BCG vaccine. For DPT vaccination coverage, there is a significant difference from children whose mothers have primary (OR 1.7; CI: 1.35C2.15), secondary (OR 3.5; CI: 2.75C4.45), and higher (OR 9.6; CI: 5.28C17.42) educational qualification compared to children of illiterate mothers. Findings demonstrated that children born in wealthier households have a higher likelihood of being immunized against DPT, Polio, and Measles vaccination than children born in the poorest households.

Repurposing it against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a relatively newer concept and has been sparsely tested in vivo. The most common route of entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) is the nasopharynx. Averting colonization of the virus could be one of the best options to reduce the incidence of infection. PVP-I gargle and mouthwash were found to be effective in vitro rapid inactivation against SARS-CoV-2 on a smaller scale (Hassandarvish et al. in BDJ 1-4, 2020, Pelletier et al. in ENTJ 1-5, 2020). However, efficacy in humans is lacking. To assess the virucidal effect of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 located in the nasopharynx was the objective of this parallel armed randomized clinical trial. We screened all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 18 years and above with symptoms. Written informed consent was obtained before randomization. Nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was tested after single time application of PVP-I nasal irrigation (NI) at diluted concentrations of .4%, .5% and .6% and PVP-I nasal spray (NS) at diluted concentrations of .5% and .6%. All groups were compared to the corresponding controls (distilled water). The primary outcome was viral clearance in a repeat RT-PCR (qualitative), and the secondary outcome was the number of adverse events. Final data analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS (Version 20). A total of 189 confirmed COVID-19 cases were randomized into seven groups: 27 patients in each group. Of all, 159 (84.1%) were male, and 30 (15.9%) were female. We observed a statistically significant proportion of nasopharyngeal clearance with all strengths of PVP-I NI and PVP-I NS compared to the corresponding controls. Additionally, 0.5% NI was significantly better than 0.5% NS for viral clearance (p = 0.018) and had the highest nasopharyngeal clearance among all strengths (n = 25, 92.6%). 0.6% NS is better than CNS and 0.5%NS in viral clearance. The only adverse event was nasal irritation recorded in two patients each in the 0.4% and 0.6% PVP-I NI groups (Tables 1 and 2). PVP-I NI and NS are proved as effective virucidal agent against SARS-CoV-2 in human body.

Particularly the COVID-19 induced lockdown of exercise training facilities with individual outdoor activities still being allowed might be a blueprint for this potentially harmful scenario. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of 6 months of detraining after 18 months of high-intensity resistance exercise (HIT-RT) on body composition and cardiometabolic outcomes in predominately obese older men with osteosarcopenia. Materials and Methods: Community-dwelling predominately obese men 72-91 years old with low muscle and bone mass (n=43) were randomly assigned to an 18-month HIT-RT (EG: n=21) or a non-training control group (CG, n=22). After the intervention, participants of the EG discontinued HIT-RT for 6 months, but increased their habitual physical activity. Study outcomes were group differences in detraining changes (\\"effects\\") for lean body mass (LBM), total and abdominal body fat rate (determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) and the Metabolic Syndrome Z-Score (MetSZ). We applied an intention-to-treat analysis with multiple imputation to analyze the data. Results: After the 18-month HIT-RT, we observed significant positive training effects for LBM, total and abdominal body fat rate and the MetSZ (all p<0.001). Abrupt cessation of HIT-RT for 6 months resulted in significantly higher unfavorable changes in the HIT-RT compared with the CG for LBM (p=0.001), total body fat (p=0.003) and the MetSZ (p=0.003), apart from abdominal body fat (p=0.059). However, significant overall effects were still present after 24 months for LBM and body fat indices but not for the MetSZ. Conclusion: The present study clearly indicates the unfavorable effects of 6 months of detraining after HIT-RT. Correspondingly, exercise protocols particularly for older people should focus on continuous exercise with short regeneration periods rather than on intermitted protocols with pronounced training breaks.","output":"Changes in Body Composition and Cardiometabolic Health After Detraining in Older Men with Osteosarcopenia: 6-Month Follow-Up of the Randomized Controlled Franconian Osteopenia and Sarcopenia Trial (FrOST) Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe lower respiratory tract infection in people. Previous studies suggested dromedary camels were a reservoir for this virus. We tested for the presence of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from a farm in Qatar linked to two human cases of the infection in October, 2013. METHODS: We took nose swabs, rectal swabs, and blood samples from all camels on the Qatari farm. We tested swabs with RT-PCR, with amplification targeting the E gene (upE), nucleocapsid (N) gene, and open reading frame (ORF) 1a. PCR positive samples were tested by different MERS-CoV specific PCRs and obtained sequences were used for phylogentic analysis together with sequences from the linked human cases and other human cases. We tested serum samples from the camels for IgG immunofluorescence assay, protein microarray, and virus neutralisation assay. FINDINGS: We obtained samples from 14 camels on Oct 17, 2013. We detected MERS-CoV in nose swabs from three camels by three independent RT-PCRs and sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of an ORF1a fragment (940 nucleotides) and a 42 kb concatenated fragment were very similar to the MERS-CoV from two human cases on the same farm and a MERS-CoV isolate from Hafr-Al-Batin. Eight additional camel nose swabs were positive on one or more RT-PCRs, but could not be confirmed by sequencing. All camels had MERS-CoV spike-binding antibodies that correlated well with the presence of neutralising antibodies to MERS-CoV. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides virological confirmation of MERS-CoV in camels and suggests a recent outbreak affecting both human beings and camels. We cannot conclude whether the people on the farm were infected by the camels or vice versa, or if a third source was responsible.

The simulation showed that decreasing the success rate of BT automatic scanning produces increasing the need of manual scanning.

Within cities the incidence of infection withSARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneously distributed across districts. Passing a certain level of incidence leads to lockdownrestrictions for cities and some specific to city districts. The restrictions have resulted in an increased importance of theneighbourhood. The structure of urban neighbourhoods as well as their environmental quality varies;some neighbourhoodsmay be in a better position to weather a pandemic. Urban planning instruments and strategies can improve neighbourhoodspatial structure and environmental quality, and so increase resilience. Methods The aims of this project are to identify neighbourhoods that are vulnerable because of conditions that promotevirus spread as well as those that amplify the impact of lockdown restrictions and to examine the suitability of urbanplanning instruments and strategies to increase neighbourhood resilience. For a selection of German cities different types ofneighbourhoods were examined to assess likely risks as well as the potential adaptability of urban structures. Results Built environment and socio-economic as well as other health-related characteristics were selected based on ascientific literature review and the state of the art in planning practice. A set of criteria for these characteristics wasdeveloped which forms the basis of a stress test. Five case study neighbourhoods were assessed using the stress test toidentify areas where urban development instruments and strategies should be implemented. Conclusions: The next steps will be to assess the suitability of these instruments and strategies and a set of guidelines forurban planning and public health departments will be developed to support municipalities with increasing the resilience oftheir neighbourhoods.","output":"The resilience of neighbourhoods in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Urban planning and public health approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The present review provides an original examination of published literature on the use of Dance Movement Psychotherapy (DMP) as an intervention for children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Method: The review was systematically conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A protocol consisting of four phases: identification; screening and selection; data extraction and synthesis; quality assurance was developed and registered with the PROSPERO. A search strategy was developed using population and intervention as the key concepts and ten databases were searched between 6.1.2018 to 4.4.2018 and 10.07.2021 to 20.07.2021. The intervention characteristics were extracted based on the TIDieR template for intervention description and replication checklist. Quality assessment and level of evidence of all the included studies were evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) and the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) for treatment criteria. Results: Nine research studies with a total of 133 participants were identified through a systematic search process. There was only one mixed-methods study with the component of randomisation found during the literature search. Collected information was synthesised in relation to (a) ways in which dance movement psychotherapists work with children; (b) data collection methods and findings. Results from the reviewed literature suggest that DMP can potentially promote various aspects of well-being in children with ASD. Eight out of nine studies mentioned the effects of DMP on improving different social and communication skills. However, results from quality assessments and synthesised outcomes indicate that research in DMP is still in its infancy. Conclusions: We conclude that further large-scale, high-quality studies are required to generate further evidence that explains the processes involved in DMP, the effectiveness of DMP, the relationship between therapeutic factors of DMP, and research findings for children on the autism spectrum.

Early data suggest elevated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, but relationships to disease phenotype and downstream regulators of inflammation in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) are unknown. We aimed to determine the relationship between RAS gene expression relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung with disease characteristics in COPD, and the regulation of newly identified SARS-CoV-2 receptors and spike-cleaving proteases, important for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We quantified gene expression using RNA sequencing of epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies from 31 COPD and 37 control subjects. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression (log2-fold change (FC)) was increased in COPD compared to ex-smoking (HV-ES) controls in epithelial brushings (0.25, p = 0.042) and bronchial biopsies (0.23, p = 0.050), and correlated with worse lung function (r = ? 0.28, p = 0.0090). ACE2 was further increased in frequent exacerbators compared to infrequent exacerbators (0.51, p = 0.00045) and associated with use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) (0.50, p = 0.0034), having cardiovascular disease (0.23, p = 0.048) or hypertension (0.34, p = 0.0089), and inhaled corticosteroid use in COPD subjects in bronchial biopsies (0.33, p = 0.049). Angiotensin II receptor type (AGTR)1 and 2 expression was decreased in COPD bronchial biopsies compared to HV-ES controls with log2FC of C0.26 (p = 0.033) and ? 0.40, (p = 0.0010), respectively. However, the AGTR1:2 ratio was increased in COPD subjects compared with HV-ES controls, log2FC of 0.57 (p = 0.0051). Basigin, a newly identified potential SARS-CoV-2 receptor was also upregulated in both brushes, log2FC of 0.17 (p = 0.0040), and bronchial biopsies, (log2FC of 0.18 (p = 0.017), in COPD vs HV-ES. Transmembrane protease, serine (TMPRSS)2 was not differentially regulated between control and COPD. However, various other spike-cleaving proteases were, including TMPRSS4 and Cathepsin B, in both epithelial brushes (log2FC of 0.25 (p = 0.0012) and log2FC of 0.56 (p = 5.49E?06), respectively) and bronchial biopsies (log2FC of 0.49 (p = 0.00021) and log2FC of 0.246 (p = 0.028), respectively).

However, this is a non-trivial endeavor due to the complexity of real world conditions and limits to the availability of diagnostic tests, which necessitate a bias in testing favoring symptomatic individuals. A thorough understanding of sampling confidence and bias is necessary in order make accurate conclusions. In this manuscript, we provide a stochastic model of sampling for assessing confidence in disease metrics such as trend detection, peak detection, and disease spread estimation. Our model simulates testing for a disease in an epidemic with known dynamics, allowing us to use Monte-Carlo sampling to assess metric confidence. We use this method to show that trends in the disease may be identified using under $10000$ biased samples each day, and an estimate of disease spread can be made with additional $1000-2000$ unbiased samples each day. We also demonstrate that the model can be used to assess more advanced metrics by finding the precision and recall of a strategy for finding peaks in the dynamics.","output":"Confidence in the dynamic spread of epidemics under biased sampling conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory disease syndrome (SARS) is not fully understood. One case-control study has reported an association between susceptibility to SARS and mannan-binding lectin (MBL) in China. As the downstream protein of MBL, variants of the MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP2) gene may be associated with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in the same population. METHODS: Thirty individuals with SARS were chosen for analysis of MASP2 polymorphisms by means of PCR direct sequencing. Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) were chosen using pairwise tagging algorithms. The frequencies of four tag SNPs (rs12711521, rs2261695, rs2273346 and rs7548659) were ascertained in 376 SARS patients and 523 control subjects, using the Beckman SNPstream Ultra High Throughput genotyping platform. RESULTS: There is no significant association between alleles or genotypes of the MASP2 tagSNP and susceptibility to SARS-CoV in both Beijing and Guangzhou populations. Diplotype (rs2273346 and rs12711521)were analyzed for association with susceptibility to SARS, no statistically significant evidence of association was observed. The Beijing and Guangzhou sample groups were homogeneous regarding demographic and genetic parameters, a joined analysis also showed no statistically significant evidence of association.

However, when patients have a treatment preference, randomisation may influence participation and outcomes (eg, external and internal validity). The aim of this study was to assess the influence of patients' preference in RCTs by analysing partially randomised patient preference trials (RPPT); an RCT and preference cohort combined. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES RPPTs published between January 2005 and October 2018 reporting on allocation of patients to randomised and preference cohorts were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers extracted data. The main outcomes were the difference in external validity (participation and baseline characteristics) and internal validity (lost to follow-up, crossover and the primary outcome) between the randomised and the preference cohort within each RPPT, compared in a meta-regression using a Wald test. Risk of bias was not assessed, as no quality assessment for RPPTs has yet been developed. RESULTS In total, 117 of 3734 identified articles met screening criteria and 44 were eligible (24 873 patients). The participation rate in RPPTs was >95% in 14 trials (range: 48%-100%) and the randomisation refusal rate was >50% in 26 trials (range: 19%-99%). Higher education, female, older age, race and prior experience with one treatment arm were characteristics of patients declining randomisation. The lost to follow-up and cross-over rate were significantly higher in the randomised cohort compared with the preference cohort. Following the meta-analysis, the reported primary outcomes were comparable between both cohorts of the RPPTs, mean difference 0.093 (95% CI -0.178 to 0.364, p=0.502). CONCLUSIONS Patients' preference led to a substantial proportion of a specific patient group refusing randomisation, while it did not influence the primary outcome within an RPPT. Therefore, RPPTs could increase external validity without compromising the internal validity compared with RCTs.

The respiration during anesthesia is a lack of initiative, and the energy efficiency of the diaphragm in the lungs is very important to the safety of anesthesia. In this paper, the application of the ultrasound evaluation of the diaphragm in clinical anesthesia was studied. In this paper, 24 patients who underwent lung examination under medical anesthesia at our hospital were evaluated by the ultrasound vertical mixed echo method. Through patient voluntary selection and consent, 16 patients were examined with B-mode ultrasound and the other 8 patients with M-mode ultrasound to compare the effects of different ultrasounds on diaphragm image quality. In addition, this paper also analyzes the differences between different ultrasounds and the strengths and weaknesses of diaphragmatic ultrasound evaluation in clinical anesthesia. The suggestions of using different ultrasounds in ultrasonic evaluation are given. The study showed that 16 cases of B-mode ultrasound evaluation of the diaphragm obtained ultrasound images which showed a large field of vision, acoustic frequency between 7 and 18 MHz, and thickness difference between 0.35 and 0.52 cm. In 8 patients with the diaphragm evaluated by M-mode ultrasound, the local features of M-mode ultrasound images were clearer than those of B-mode ultrasound images, but the visual field area was smaller, the acoustic frequency was between 10 and 15 MHz, and the thickness difference was between 0.12 and 0.18 cm. Based on the above data, this paper suggests that, in the ultrasonic evaluation of the diaphragm, B-mode ultrasound should be used to check the patients first, and then M-mode ultrasound should be used to check the parts with poor quality so that the accurate diaphragm quality of patients can be obtained in the vast majority of patients.","output":"Ultrasound Evaluation of the Diaphragm in Clinical Anesthesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on keratoplasty and Eye Banking in India.

Many available techniques are invasive and involve extensive surgery. A local procedure with good closure rates would be preferable as a first step in the treatment of RVF. The aim of this study was the development of a local technique for the closure of RVF with good closure rates to prevent the use of more invasive procedures. METHODS This was a pilot study. Patients with RVF who had undergone multiple operations in the pelvic area, local radiotherapy, chemotherapy or had been diagnosed with Crohn's disease were included in the study. All had a history of surgery for RVF. A cross-linked collagen matrix biomesh was placed in the rectovaginal septum using a transperineal or a transvaginal approach. The main outcome measure in this study was the closure rate reported as absence of the fistula at 1 year. RESULTS Twelve patients were included in the study. Absence of fistula at 1 year was 0.64 (95 % confidence interval 0.30-0.85). Three patients (25.0 %) developed a recurrence, two were reoperated on with a gracilis flap transposition, and one was treated with laparoscopic ligation. In one patient (8.3 %), the fistula failed to close within 3 months after the mesh placement. CONCLUSIONS Our technique shows promising results.

In test accuracy (n=320), we found that spike IgG performed best (ROC AUC: 95.0%, 92.8-97.3%), followed by spike IgA (ROC AUC: 89.9%, 86.5-93.2%) for discriminating between pre-pandemic and post COVID-19 saliva samples. Using machine learning, diagnostic performance was improved when a combination of tests was used. As expected, salivary IgA was poorly correlated with serum, indicating an oral mucosal response whereas salivary IgG responses were predictive of those in serum.

After reviewing the systematically identified literature, we found that questions remain on the appropriateness of GT evidence generation, considering that additional, broader values brought by GTs seem insufficiently incorporated within proposed analytic methods. In cases where innovative methods are proposed, HTA organizations remain highly conservative and resistant to change their reference case and decision analysis framework.

Previously published studies paid little attention to HCWs in Arab countries, which has a population of over 440 million. Objectives: to assess the rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside the Arab countries, and their perceived barriers towards vaccination. Methods: a cross-sectional study based on an online survey was conducted from 14-Jan 2021 to 29-Jan 2021, targeting Arabic-speaking HCWs from all around the world. Results: the survey recruited 5,708 eligible participants (55.6% males, 44.4% females, age 30.610 years) from 21 Arab countries (87.5%) and 54 other countries (12.5%). Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside Arab countries (25.8% and 32.8%, respectively). The highest rates of hesitancy were among participants from the west region of the Arab world (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria). The most cited reasons for hesitancy were concerns about side effects and distrust in vaccine expedited production and healthcare policies. Factors associated with higher hesitancy included age of 30-59, previous or current suspected or confirmed COVID-19, female gender, not knowing the vaccine type authorized in the participants country, and not regularly receiving the influenza vaccine. Conclusion: this is the first large-scale, multinational, post-vaccine-availability study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among HCWs. It reveals high rates of hesitancy among Arab-speaking HCWs.

According to D'Amico classification, the percentage of patients with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease cases were 116 (22.4%), 275 (52.8%), and 129 (24.8%) respectively. Mean operative time was 156  43 min. Mean estimated blood loss was 214  93 ml. Positive surgical margins (PSMs) were detected in 110 (21.2%) patients. PSM rates in pT2 and pT3 stages were 20.1% and 22.9%, respectively. The overall complication rate was 9.2%, based on the modified Clavien classification. The 12 months continence and potency rates were 90.9% and 49.1%, respectively. The biochemical recurrence rate was 6.8%, at the median follow-up time of 26.7 months (IQR 12-32). CONCLUSIONS Our analyses show that LESS-RP is a safe procedure, if performed by surgeons with adequate experience and skills. Unlike the classic laparoscopic prostatectomy, this technique allows better aesthetic and psychological results, reduced postoperative pain, and a faster return to normal daily activity with the same functional and oncological results.","output":"Laparoscopic single port radical prostatectomy in the 2020: Why not?

Several uncertainty-aware models, such as Bayesian Neural Network (BNNs) and Deep Ensembles have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty. However, research in this area has been largely confined to the big data regime. In this work, we show that the uncertainty estimation capability of state-of-the-art BNNs and Deep Ensemble models degrades significantly when the amount of training data is small. To address the issue of accurate uncertainty estimation in the small-data regime, we propose a probabilistic generalization of the popular sample-efficient non-parametric kNN approach. Our approach enables deep kNN classifier to accurately quantify underlying uncertainties in its prediction. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach by achieving superior uncertainty quantification as compared to state-of-the-art on a real-world application of COVID-19 diagnosis from chest X-Rays.

Recently, the coronavirus has brought some problems for supply chain networks. Remarkably, perishable product supply chain networks, such as pharmaceutical, dairy, blood, and food supply chains deal with more sophisticated situations. Generally, during pandemic outbreaks, the activities of these industries can play an influential role in society. On the one hand, products of these industries are considered to be daily necessities for living. However, on the other hand, there are many new restrictions to control the coronavirus prevalence, such as closing down all official gatherings and lessening the work hours, which subsequently affect the economic growth and gross domestic product. Therefore, risk assessment can be a useful tool to forestall side-effects of the coronavirus outbreaks on supply chain networks. To that aim, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach is used to evaluate the risks to perishable product supply chain networks during the coronavirus outbreak era. Feedback from academics was received to identify the most important risks. Then, experts in pharmaceutical, food, and dairy industries were inquired to specify the interrelations among risks. Then, Pythagorean fuzzy sets are employed in order to take the uncertainty of the experts judgments into account. Finally, analyses demonstrated that the perishability of products, unhealthy working conditions, supply-side risks, and work-hours are highly influential risks that can easily affect other risk factors. Plus, it turned out that competitive risks are the most susceptive risk in the effect category. In other words, competition among perishable product supply chain networks has become even more fierce during the coronavirus outbreak era. The practical outcomes of this study provide a wide range of insights for managers and decision-makers in order to prevent risks to perishable product supply chain networks during the coronavirus outbreak era.","output":"A causality analysis of risks to perishable product supply chain networks during the COVID-19 outbreak era: An extended DEMATEL method under Pythagorean fuzzy environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Stunted growth of poults afflicted by enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) may be associated with depressed digestive capabilities. We conducted two experiments to test this hypothesis. Survivors of PEMS were obtained from a research flock that had been purposefully infected at 5 d of age with PEMS inoculum that included turkey corona virus. The PEMS survivors were assigned to Experiments 1 and 2, beginning at 40 and 35 d of age, respectively. Three groups (large, L; medium, M; and small, S) and two groups (L and S) of 20 poults each were selected to represent different degrees of stunting in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. When the body weights of each group in both experiments were plotted using initial body weight as the starting point, all of the weights fell on the normal growth curve except Group S in Experiment 1. Therefore, there was no evidence of compensatory growth over the period studied. In Experiment 1, apparent fat absorption (AFA) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for control (85.9%) than for M (78.5%) and S (78.3%) groups, and AME, for the control group was significantly higher than all the PEMS-survivor groups. In Experiment 2, Group L had a higher AFA and AMEn than Group S. AFA and AMEn improved in both groups over time. The digestive capabilities of PEMS survivors were depressed proportionally to the degree of stunting.

Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the Msi1+ cells are heterogeneous with the majority being intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The DNA damage-resistant subpopulation of Msi1+ cells is characterized by low-to-negative Lgr5 expression and is more rapidly cycling than Lgr5high radiosensitive crypt base columnar stem cells (CBCs). This enables an efficient repopulation of the intestinal epithelium at early stage when Lgr5high cells are not emerging. Furthermore, relative to CBCs, Msi1+ cells preferentially produce Paneth cells during homeostasis and upon radiation repair.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with confirmed history of COVID-19 infection referred for autonomic testing for symptoms concerning for para-/postinfectious autonomic dysfunction at Mayo Clinic Rochester or Jacksonville between March 2020 and January 2021. RESULTS: We identified 27 patients fulfilling the search criteria. Symptoms developed between 0 and 122 days following the acute infection and included lightheadedness (93%), orthostatic headache (22%), syncope (11%), hyperhidrosis (11%), and burning pain (11%). Sudomotor function was abnormal in 36%, cardiovagal function in 27%, and cardiovascular adrenergic function in 7%. The most common clinical scenario was orthostatic symptoms without tachycardia or hypotension (41%); 22% of patients fulfilled the criteria for postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and 11% had borderline findings to support orthostatic intolerance. One patient each was diagnosed with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, vasodepressor syncope, cough/vasovagal syncope, exacerbation of preexisting orthostatic hypotension, exacerbation of sensory and autonomic neuropathy, and exacerbation of small fiber neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Abnormalities on autonomic testing were seen in the majority of patients but were mild in most cases. The most common finding was orthostatic intolerance, often without objective hemodynamic abnormalities on testing. Unmasking/exacerbation of preexisting conditions was seen.

Methods: COVID-19-free participants (n=82 at baseline) were followed at day 21 after Sputnik-V dose 1 (rAd5) and dose 2 (rAd26). Self-reported local and systemic adverse events were captured using questionnaires. Blood and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to perform SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and immunologic assays. Findings: Of the 73 and 70 participants retained post-dose 1 and 2, respectively, most (>50%) reported mild-to-moderate injection site or systemic reactions to vaccination; no severe or potentially life-threatening conditions were reported. dose 1 appeared to be more reactogenic than dose 2, with fatigue and headache more frequent in participants with prior COVID-19 exposure. After dose 2 nausea was more common in subjects without prior COVID-19. The combined S-IgG and S-IgA seroconversion rate was 97% post-dose 1, remaining the same post-dose 2. The proportion of participants with detectable virus neutralization titers was 83% post-dose 1', and increased to 98% post-dose 2', with the largest relative increase observed in participants without prior COVID-19 exposure. Nasal S-IgG and S-IgA increased post-dose 1, while the boosting effect of dose 2 on mucosal S-IgG, but not S-IgA, was only observed in subjects without prior COVID-19. Systemically, vaccination reduced serum levels of growth regulated oncogene (GRO), which correlated with an elevation in blood platelet count. Interpretation: Sputnik-V dose 1 elicited both blood and mucosal SARS-CoV-2 immunity, while the immune boosting effect of dose 2 was minimal, suggesting that adjustments to the current vaccine dosing regimen may be necessary to optimize immunization efficacy and cost-effectiveness.

One of the most important inflammatory pathways is represented by the activation of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) protein family. Some NLRs induce the assembly of large caspase-1-activating complexes called inflammasomes. Different types of inflammasomes have been identified that can respond to distinct bacterial, viral or fungal infections; sterile cell damage or other stressors, such as metabolic imbalances. Epigenetic regulation has been recently suggested to provide a complementary mechanism to control inflammasome activity. This regulation can be exerted through at least three main mechanisms, including CpG DNA methylation, histones post-translational modifications and noncoding RNA expression. The repression or promotion of expression of different inflammasomes (NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP4, NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP12 and AIM2) through epigenetic mechanisms determines the development of pathologies with variable severity. For example, our team recently explored the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting and modulating the components of the inflammasome as potential biomarkers in bladder cancer and during therapy.

Using a wood mouse population in the UK as a model we identified significant temporal clusters of individuals with extreme expression of immunological mediators across multiple loci, typical of an acute microbial infection. These clusters were circumstantially associated with demographic perturbation in the summertime wood mouse population. Animals in one cluster also had significantly higher individual macroparasite burdens than contemporaries with normal expression patterns. If the extreme transcriptional profiles observed are induced by an infectious agent then this implicates macroparasites as a possible player in mediating individual susceptibility or resilience to infection. The form of survey described here, combined with next generation nucleic acids sequencing methods for the broad detection of microbial infectious agents in individuals with anomalous immunological transcriptional profiles, could be a powerful tool for revealing unrecognized, ecologically important infectious agents circulating in wildlife populations.","output":"Temporal Anomalies in Immunological Gene Expression in a Time Series of Wild Mice: Signature of an Epidemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) developed an online self-management program (SPIN-SELF) designed to improve disease-management self-efficacy in people with systemic sclerosis (SSc, or scleroderma). The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility aspects for conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the SPIN-SELF Program. METHODS: This feasibility trial was embedded in the SPIN Cohort and utilized the cohort multiple RCT design. In this design, at the time of cohort enrollment, cohort participants consent to be assessed for trial eligibility and randomized prior to being informed about the trial. Participants in the intervention arm are informed and provide consent, but not the control group. Forty English-speaking SPIN Cohort participants from Canada, the USA, or the UK with low disease-management self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease Scale [SEMCD] score  7) who were interested in using an online self-management program were randomized (3:2 ratio) to be offered the SPIN-SELF Program or usual care for 3 months. Program usage was examined via automated usage logs. User satisfaction was assessed with semi-structured interviews. Trial personnel time requirements and implementation challenges were logged. RESULTS: Of 40 SPIN Cohort participants randomized, 26 were allocated to SPIN-SELF and 14 to usual care. Automated eligibility and randomization procedures via the SPIN Cohort platform functioned properly, except that two participants with SEMCD scores > 7 (scores of 7.2 and 7.3, respectively) were included, which was caused by a system programming error that rounded SEMCD scores. Of 26 SPIN Cohort participants offered the SPIN-SELF Program, only 9 (35%) consented to use the program. Usage logs showed that use of the SPIN-SELF Program was low: 2 of 9 users (22%) logged into the program only once (median = 3), and 4 of 9 (44%) accessed none or only 1 of the 9 programs modules (median = 2). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will lead to substantial changes for the planned full-scale RCT of the SPIN-SELF Program that we will incorporate into a planned additional feasibility trial with progression to a full-scale trial. These changes include transitioning to a conventional RCT design with pre-randomization consent and supplementing the online self-help with peer-facilitated videoconference-based groups to enhance engagement.

In this study, a database containing structural information of more than 8,000 existing drugs was virtually screened by a docking approach to identify potential binding molecules of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. As a target for screening, both a homology model and the crystallographic structure of the binding pocket of the enzyme were used. Cinanserin (SQ 10,643), a well-characterized serotonin antagonist that has undergone preliminary clinical testing in humans in the 1960s, showed a high score in the screening and was chosen for further experimental evaluation. Binding of both cinanserin and its hydrochloride to bacterially expressed 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and the related human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance technology. The catalytic activity of both enzymes was inhibited with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 5 microM, as tested with a fluorogenic substrate. The antiviral activity of cinanserin was further evaluated in tissue culture assays, namely, a replicon system based on HCoV-229E and quantitative test assays with infectious SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E. All assays revealed a strong inhibition of coronavirus replication at nontoxic drug concentrations. The level of virus RNA and infectious particles was reduced by up to 4 log units, with IC50 values ranging from 19 to 34 microM.

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) provides a descriptive framework of competencies and milestones but does not provide standardized instruments to assess and track trainee competency over time. Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) represent a workplace-based method to assess the achievement of competency milestones at the point-of-care that can be applied to anesthesiology training in the United States. METHODS Experts in education and competency assessment were recruited to participate in a 6-step process using a modified Delphi method with iterative rounds to reach consensus on an entrustment scale, a list of EPAs and procedural skills, detailed definitions for each EPA, a mapping of the EPAs to the ACGME milestones, and a target level of entrustment for graduating US anesthesiology residents for each EPA and procedural skill. The defined EPAs and procedural skills were implemented using a website and mobile app. The assessment system was piloted at 7 anesthesiology residency programs. After 2 months, faculty were surveyed on their attitudes on usability and utility of the assessment system. The number of evaluations submitted per month was collected for 1 year. RESULTS Participants in EPA development included 18 education experts from 11 different programs. The Delphi rounds produced a final list of 20 EPAs, each differentiated as simple or complex, a defined entrustment scale, mapping of the EPAs to milestones, and graduation entrustment targets. A list of 159 procedural skills was similarly developed. Results of the faculty survey demonstrated favorable ratings on all questions regarding app usability as well as the utility of the app and EPA assessments. Over the 2-month pilot period, 1636 EPA and 1427 procedure assessments were submitted. All programs continued to use the app for the remainder of the academic year resulting in 12,641 submitted assessments. CONCLUSIONS A list of 20 anesthesiology EPAs and 159 procedural skills assessments were developed using a rigorous methodology to reach consensus among education experts.

Regulatory T-cells (T-regs) are associated with a tolerant immune state and may contribute to CMV-replication. However, T-cell subsets such as T-regs and IL-17 producing T-cells (Th-17) are not well studied in this context. We explored T-regs and Th-17 frequencies during CMV-replication after transplantation. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 30 transplant patients with CMV-viremia. We quantified CMV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells, T-regs (CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+)) and Th-17 frequencies using flow-cytometry and followed patients requiring anti-viral treatment. Two subsets were compared: anti-viral treatment requirement (n = 20) vs. spontaneous clearance of viremia (n = 10). RESULTS: Higher initial CMV-specific CD4(+) T-cells and lower T-regs were observed in patients with spontaneous clearance (p = 0.043; p = 0.021 respectively). Using a ratio of CMV-specific CD4(+) T-cells to T-regs allowed prediction of viral clearance with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity (p = 0.001). One month after stop of treatment, the same correlation was observed in patients protected from CMV-relapse. The ratio of CMV-specific CD4(+) T-cells to T-regs allowed prediction of relapse with 85% sensitivity and 86% specificity (p = 0.004). Th-17 responses were not correlated with virologic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights into T-regs and Th-17 subpopulations during CMV-replication after transplantation.

Demographic, clinical and laboratory data at admission were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable analysis, Cox proportional hazard model analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to explore the early warning factors associated with in-hospital death. A total of 159 patients were included in this study, of whom 86 were discharged and 73 died in hospital. Hypertension (52.1% vs. 29.1%, P=0.003) and coronary heart disease (28.8% vs. 12.8%, P=0.012) were more frequent among non-survived patients than among survived patients. The proportions of patients with dyspnoea (67.1% vs. 25.6%, P<0.001), chest distress (58.9% vs. 26.7%, P<0.001) and fatigue (64.4% vs. 25.6%, P<0.001) were significantly higher in the non-survived group than in the survived group. Regression analysis with the Cox proportional hazards mode revealed that increasing odds of in-hospital death were associated with higher IL-6 (odds ratio 10.87, 95% CI 1.41-83.59; P=0.022), lactate (3.59, 1.71-7.54; P=0.001), older age (1.86, 1.03-3.38; P=0.041) and lower lymphopenia (5.44, 2.71-10.93; P<0.001) at admission. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of IL-6, lymphocyte, age and lactate were 0.933, 0.928, 0.786 and 0.753 respectively. The AUC of IL-6 was significantly higher than that of age (z=3.332, P=0.0009) and lactate (z=4.441, P<0.0001) for outcome prediction. There was no significant difference between the AUCs of IL-6 and lymphocyte for outcome prediction (z=0.372, P=0.7101).

It was in all forms, including curfew, social distancing, self-quarantine, area quarantine, self-monitoring, and isolation. Due to their concerns about their safety and families, friends, colleagues, and society, everybody was feeling upset, fearful, and anxious. Several studies have reported an association between prolonged sitting time and weight gain. As a way to relieve the tension during that period, people started stocking up on unhealthy foods like over-salted snacks and over-sweetened sugars. People stayed at home, feeling bored, anxious, and stressed and sought relief by eating. Also, there was a rise in emotional eating when the stress of isolation increased by the closure of gyms, casinos, and movie theaters. Moreover, restaurants were allowed to serve the only takeout. Besides, unemployment was skyrocketing, hospitals were overflowing (or were preparing for the possibility), many people were struggling to meet their basic needs, and no one knows when or how it would end. Objective: The study aimed to figure out whether social isolation during the COVID-19 quarantine is consistent and associated with emotional eating and gaining weight or not. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional case series study was conducted on 765 patients who have visited the bariatric clinic in Sulaimani city, Kurdistan-Iraq, from April 23 to June 23, 2020. An individual face-to-face interview was conducted with each participant to obtain signed informed consent, provide them with information about the type and the subject of the work, and ask them the study's questions. Each interview lasted between 30 and 45a?min and was conducted in a closed session by two Kurdistan Board trainees. Results: No patient who was quarantined for the COVID-19 was included in the work, but all other patients were included.

Body of literature suggested that the prevalence of this deficiency can have geographical variation. Although vitamin D deficiency is frequently reported in the South Asian population, the scarcity of systematic reviews and meta-analysis means the true extent of the disease and the underlying factors causing it are poorly characterized. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using two databases (PubMed and Scopus) and one search engine (Google Scholar) for original studies on the South Asian population (published from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2019). Following the search, a random effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate population-level weighted average, the pooled prevalence of deficiency, and heterogeneity of vitamin D among different countries and genders; in addition to South Asia as a whole. RESULTS: Our study, based on our selection criteria was narrowed down to a total of 44,717 participants; which spanned over 65 studies from five South Asian countries.

The average level of vitamin D ranged from 4.7 to 32 ng/mL, with a weighted mean of 19.15 ng/mL (weighted standard deviation 11.59 ng/mL). The highest prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was found in Pakistan (73%;95% CI: 63 to 83%) followed by Bangladesh (67%; 95% CI: 50 to 83%), India (67%; 95% CI: 61 to 73%), Nepal (57%; 95% CI: 53 to 60%) and Sri Lanka (48%; 95% CI: 41 to 55%), respectively. This finding indicated a high degree of heterogeneity among the population. (I(2) = 98.76%), Furthermore, a gender-wise analysis suggested that in South Asia, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was higher in females than males. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal highly prevalent and variable vitamin D deficiency among the adults of different South Asian countries. Findings from this review would be helpful to generate hypotheses and explore the factors affecting the inter-country variability, alongside strengthening evidence for governments to prioritize mitigation strategies in this region.

To determine the role of interferons (IFNs) in the ability of bats to coexist with viruses, we sequenced the type I IFN locus of the Australian black flying fox, Pteropus alecto, providing what is, to our knowledge, the first gene map of the IFN region of any bat species. Our results reveal a highly contracted type I IFN family consisting of only 10 IFNs, including three functional IFN- loci. Furthermore, the three IFN- genes are constitutively expressed in unstimulated bat tissues and cells and their expression is unaffected by viral infection. Constitutively expressed IFN- results in the induction of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes associated with antiviral activity and resistance to DNA damage, providing evidence for a unique IFN system that may be linked to the ability of bats to coexist with viruses.","output":"Contraction of the type I IFN locus and unusual constitutive expression of IFN- in bats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic that has been affecting Portugal since 2 March 2020 The Portuguese government has been making efforts to contradict the exponential growth through lockdown, social distancing and the usage of masks However, these measures have been implemented without controlling the compliance degree and how much is necessary to achieve an effective control To address this issue, we developed a mathematical model to estimate the strength of Government-Imposed Measures (GIM) and predict the impact of the degree of compliance on the number of infected cases and peak of infection We estimate the peak to be around 650 thousand infected cases with 53 thousand requiring hospital care by the beginning of May if no measures were taken The model shows that the population compliance of the GIM was gradual between 30% to 75%, contributing to a significant reduction on the infection peak and mortality Importantly, our simulations show that the infection burden could have been further reduced if the population followed the GIM immediately after their release on 18 March","output":"Predicting the evolution and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lack of reliable, personalized information often complicates sexual violence survivors' support-seeking.

However, a single best solution might not exist as sexual violence survivors have different needs and purposes in seeking support channels. To better envision conversational support-seeking systems for sexual violence survivors, we explore personalization trade-offs in designing such information systems. We implement a high-fidelity prototype dialogue-based information system through four design workshop sessions with three professional caregivers and interviewed with four self-identified survivors using our prototype. We then identify two forms of personalization trade-offs for conversational support-seeking systems: (1) specificity and sensitivity in understanding users and (2) relevancy and inclusiveness in providing information. To handle these trade-offs, we propose a reversed approach that starts from designing information and inclusive tailoring that considers unspecified needs, respectively.","output":"Personalization Trade-offs in Designing a Dialogue-based Information System for Support-Seeking of Sexual Violence Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The clinical use of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as a technique to assess corticospinal excitability is limited by the time for data acquisition and the measurement variability. This study aimed at evaluating the reliability of Stimulus-Response (SR) curves acquired with a recently proposed rapid protocol on tibialis anterior muscle of healthy older adults. METHODS Twenty-four neurologically-intact adults (age:55-75 years) were recruited for this test-retest study. During each session, six SR curves, 3 at rest and 3 during isometric muscle contractions at 5% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), were acquired. Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) were normalized to the maximum peripherally evoked response; the coil position and orientation were monitored with an optical tracking system. Intra- and inter-session reliability of motor threshold (MT), area under the curve (AURC), MEPmax, stimulation intensity at which the MEP is mid-way between MEPmax and MEPmin (I50), slope in I50, MEP latency, and silent period (SP) were assessed in terms of Standard Error of Measurement (SEM), relative SEM, Minimum Detectable Change (MDC), and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). RESULTS The relative SEM was 10% for MT, I50, latency and SP both at rest and 5%MVC, while it ranged between 11% and 37% for AURC, MEPmax, and slope. MDC values were overall quite large; e.g., MT required a change of 12%MSO at rest and 10%MSO at 5%MVC to be considered a real change. Inter-sessions ICC were >0.6 for all measures but slope at rest and MEPmax and latency at 5%MVC. CONCLUSIONS Measures derived from SR curves acquired in <4 minutes are affected by similar measurement errors to those found with long-lasting protocols, suggesting that the rapid method is at least as reliable as the traditional methods. As specifically designed to include older adults, this study provides normative data for future studies involving older neurological patients (e.g. stroke survivors).","output":"Intra and inter-session reliability of rapid Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation stimulus-response curves of tibialis anterior muscle in healthy older adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the sustainability of the banking sector and the fintech sector. In China, where banks revenue mainly comes from branches, we collect relevant data manually and use the OLS model for empirical analysis. The results show that as the COVID-19 infection rate increases, the number of bank branches decreases significantly, which threatens the banking sectors sustainability. The fintech sector acts as a competitor to the banking sector. With the increase of COVID-19 infection rate, the public pays more attention to fintech, promoting the development of the fintech sector. Moreover, the impact of COVID-19 on these two sectors will diminish over time. In addition, this paper finds that COVID-19 further weakens the number of bank branches during the epidemic through the mediating effect of fintech.

The plant cell wall is a particularly challenging barrier for the delivery of macromolecules because many of the transfection agents that are commonly used with animal cells produce nano-complexes that are significantly larger than the size exclusion limit of the cell wall. Here, we illustrate the use of a class of very small nanoparticles, called carbon dots, for delivering siRNA into the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Low-pressure spray application of these formulations with a spreading surfactant resulted in strong silencing of GFP transgenes in both species. The delivery efficacy of carbon dot formulations was also demonstrated by the silencing of endogenous genes that encode two subunits of magnesium chelatase, an enzyme necessary for chlorophyll synthesis. The strong visible phenotypes observed with the carbon dot-facilitated delivery were validated by measuring significant reductions in the target gene transcript and/or protein levels. Methods for the delivery of RNAi effectors into plants, such as the carbon dot formulations described here, could become valuable tools for gene silencing in plants with practical applications in plant functional genomics and agriculture.","output":"Carbon dots for efficient siRNA delivery and gene silencing in plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AbstractThe limitations that hypoxia imparts on mitochondrial oxygen supply are circumvented by the activation of anaerobic metabolism and prosurvival mechanisms in hypoxia-tolerant animals. To deal with the hypoxia that jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) experience in the ocean's depth, they depress their metabolic rate by up to 52% relative to normoxic conditions. This is coupled with molecular reorganization to facilitate their daily descents into the ocean's oxygen minimum zone, where they face not only low oxygen levels but also higher pressures and colder frigid waters. Our current study explores the tissue-specific hypoxia responses of three central processes: (1) antioxidant enzymes responsible for defending against oxidative stress, (2) early apoptotic machinery that signals the activation of cell death, and (3) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that act as central regulators of numerous cellular processes. Luminex xMAP technology was used to assess protein levels and phosphorylation states under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in brains, branchial hearts, and mantle muscles. Hypoxic brains were found to activate apoptosis via upregulation of phospho-p38, phospho-p53, activated caspase 8, and activated caspase 9, whereas branchial hearts were the only tissue to show an increase in antioxidant enzyme levels. Hypoxic muscles seemed the least affected by hypoxia. Our results suggest that hypoxic squid do not undergo large dynamic changes in the phosphorylation states of key apoptotic and central MAPK factors, except for brains, suggesting that these mechanisms are involved in squid hypometabolic responses.","output":"Hypoxic Jumbo Squid Activate Neuronal Apoptosis but Not MAPK or Antioxidant Enzymes during Oxidative Stress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Northern New Jersey was inside one of the worst initial coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic epicenters in the United States.

Here, we compared the clinical, histopathological, and immunological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and pandemic influenza A(H1N1). We observed a higher frequency of respiratory symptoms, increased tissue injury markers, and a histological pattern of alveolar pneumonia in pandemic influenza A(H1N1) patients. Conversely, dry cough, gastrointestinal symptoms and interstitial lung pathology were observed in COVID-19 cases. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) was characterized by higher levels of IL-1RA, TNF-&#945;, CCL3, G-CSF, APRIL, sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, sCD30, and sCD163.

This study aims to identify the most significant risk factors for spreading COVID-19 to help policymakers take early measures for the next waves. Methods We conducted the study on randomly selected 29 countries where the pandemic had a downward trend in the daily active cases curve as of June 10, 2020. We investigated the association with the standardized spreading index and demographical, environmental, socioeconomic, and government intervention. To standardize the spreading index, we accounted for the number of tests and the timeline bias. Furthermore, we performed multiple linear regression to identify the relative importance of the variables. Results In the correlation analysis, air pollution, PM2.5 (r = 0.37, p = 0.0466), number of days to impose lockdown from first case (r = 0.38, p = 0.0424) and total confirmed cases on the first lockdown (r = 0.61, p = 0.0004) were associated with outcome measures. In the adjusted model, air pollution (1 = 4.5, p = 0.0127, ;t; = 3.1) and overweight prevalence (1 = 4.7, p = 0.0187, ;t; = 2.9) were the most significant exposure variable for spreading of COVID-19.

This was an observational cross-sectional study in adult patients with pleural effusion who underwent thoracentesis with pleural manometry. The pleural pressure curves recorded prior to and during fluid withdrawal were analyzed. The presence of PPP was assessed in relation to the withdrawn pleural fluid volume, lung expandability, vital and echocardiographic parameters, and pulmonary function testing. A dedicated device was developed to compare the PPP to the pulse rate. Fifty-four patients (32 women) median age 66.5 (IQR 58.5-78.7) years were included. Well visible and poorly visible pressure waves were detected in 48% and 35% of the patients, respectively. The frequency of PPP was fully concordant with the pulse rate and the peaks of the oscillations reflected the period of heart diastole. PPP was more visible in patients with a slower respiratory rate (p = 0.008), a larger amount of pleural effusion, and was associated with a better heart systolic function assessed by echocardiography (p < 0.05).

METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed via Otomatch, Headmirror, and word of mouth to otolaryngology residency applicants in the 2021 Match. Survey items included demographics, social media usage, and impact of programs' social media on applicant perception and ranking. Descriptive statistics were performed, and responses based on demographic variables were compared using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Of 64 included respondents, nearly all (61/64, 95%) used Facebook, Instagram, and/or Twitter for personal and/or professional purposes. Applicants (59/64, 92%) most commonly researched otolaryngology residency programs on Instagram (55/59, 93%) and Twitter (36/59, 61%), with younger (P = .023) and female (P = .043) applicants being more likely to engage with programs on Instagram.

The five commercial kits were evaluated, using a panel of positive and negative respiratory samples, considering the kit provided by National Institute of Virology, Indian Council of Medical Research (2019-nCoV Kit) as the reference. The positive panel comprised of individuals who fulfilled the 3 criteria of being clinically symptomatic, having history of contact with diagnosed cases and testing positive in the reference kit. The negative panel included both healthy and disease controls, the latter being drawn from individuals diagnosed with other respiratory viral infections. The same protocol of sample collection, same RNA extraction kit and same RT-PCR instrument were used for all the kits. Clinical samples were collected from a panel of 92 cases and 60 control patients, who fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The control group included equal number of healthy individuals and patients infected with other respiratory viruses (n = 30, in each group).

The primary outcome measure was percentage (%) BG readings in the designated target range 3.9\\\\10mmmol/L as reported on the LibreView portal for 7 days prior to the vaccination (week \\\\1) and the 7 days after the vaccination (week +1). RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the %BG on target following the COVID\\\\vaccination for the 7 days following vaccination (mean 45.2% se 4.2%) vs pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 vaccination (mean 52.6% se 4.5%).

Most consumer engagement strategies adopted a consultative approach during the development phase of interventions, targeted to health services. Based on four large cluster-randomised controlled trials, there is evidence that consumer engagement in the development and delivery of health services to enhance the care of pregnant women results in a reduction in neonatal, but not maternal, mortality. From other trials, there is evidence that involving consumers in developing patient information material results in material that is more relevant, readable and understandable for patients, and can improve knowledge. Mixed effects are reported of consumer-engagement on the development and/or implementation of health professional training.

The incidence of IGDs was associated with emotional problems and low family affection. The persistence of IGDs was linked to higher motor impulsivity, agreeableness, and lower family resolve. Remission was related to a decrease in anxiety and hostility as well as an increase in the emotional stability of adolescents. These findings imply that emotional well-being and family adjustment could be relevant for the effective management of gaming behaviors.","output":"Individual and Interpersonal Factors Associated with the Incidence, Persistence, and Remission of Internet Gaming Disorders Symptoms in an Adolescents Sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multisystem inflammatory disorder and knowledge and experience with severe acute respiratory failure in infected patients has grown considerably since reports of the first few cases.

COVID-19 pandemic can exacerbate FCR symptoms, given the restricting access to follow-up investigations and treatment, the isolation restrictions imposed and the possibility of the medical system becoming overworked. This scoping review's objective was to synthesize the literature investigating the factors associated with higher levels of FCR in cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The focus was on FCR in breast cancer patients, including most of the studies (5 out of 9) on this topic. However, given the novelty of the subject, the increased interest in it, and the fact that there are few studies in this field, the review included 4 other studies with mixed samples of patients with breast cancer and other oncological pathologies. Following rigorous methodological criteria, 9 studies with quantitative or mixed methodology were included (N = 4831 patients). The results indicate that high levels of FCR are associated with distress and concerns regarding the pandemic impact, with most common concerns of patients being changes in treatment plan (delays and interruptions), dysfunctional communication with medical staff or difficult access to food or medicine. The most common correlates of FCR during the pandemic are marital status, childlessness, low financial status, level of education, type of cancer diagnosis, generalized anxiety and depression.","output":"On top of that all, now Covid-19, too.

Distinguishing between viral and bacterial infection is challenging when children suffered from LRTI in the absence of pathogen detection. The aim of our study is to analyze the difference of serum 2-microglobulin (2-MG) between viral LRTI and bacterial LRTI in children. METHODS: This retrospective study included children with LRTI caused by a single pathogen from Yancheng Third Peoples Hospital, Yancheng, China, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019. Participants were divided into the younger group (1 year old  age < 3 years old) and the older group (3 years old  age < 5 years old) for subgroup analysis. RESULTS: A total of 475 children with LRTI caused by common respiratory pathogens were identified. In the younger group as well as the older group, the serum level of 2-MG in respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and influenza B virus groups were significantly increased compared to that in the Mycoplasma pneumoniae group. Compared with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection group, the serum 2-MG level of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and influenza B virus groups were significantly higher in children between 1 and 3 years old.

The pandemic of NCOV-19 (novel coronavirus-19) has been engaged as a public health disaster of overall distress by the World Health Organization. Different pandemic models for NCOV-19 are being exploited by researchers all over the world to acquire experienced assessments and impose major control measures. Among the standard techniques for NCOV-19 global outbreak prediction, epidemiological and simple statistical techniques have attained more concern by researchers. Insufficiency and deficiency of health tests for identifying a solution became a major difficulty in controlling the spread of NCOV-19. To solve this problem, deep learning has emerged as a novel solution over a dozen of machine learning techniques. Deep learning has attained advanced performance in medical applications. Deep learning has the capacity of recognizing patterns in large complex datasets. They are identified as an appropriate method for analyzing affected patients of NCOV-19. Conversely, these techniques for disease recognition focus entirely on enhancing the accurateness of forecasts or classifications without the ambiguity measure in a decision. Knowing how much assurance present in a computer-based health analysis is necessary for gaining clinicians expectations in the technology and progress treatment consequently. Today, NCOV-19 diseases are the main healthcare confront throughout the world. Detecting NCOV-19 in X-ray images is vital for diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. Still, analytical ambiguity in a report is a difficult yet predictable task for radiologists. METHOD: In this paper, an in-depth analysis has been performed on the significance of deep learning for Covid-19 and as per the standard search database, this is the first review research work ever made concentrating particularly on Deep Learning for NCOV-19. CONCLUSION: The main aim behind this research work is to inspire the research community and to innovate novel research using deep learning. Moreover, the outcome of this detailed structured review on the impact of deep learning in covid-19 analysis will be helpful for further investigations on various modalities of diseases detection, prevention and finding novel solutions.","output":"Significance of deep learning for Covid-19: state-of-the-art review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: With the rapid spread of online coronavirus-related health information, it is important to ensure that this information is reliable and effectively communicated. This study observes the dissemination of COVID-19 health literacy information by Canadian postsecondary institutions aimed at university students as compared to provincial and federal government COVID-19 guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a systematic scan of web pages from Canadian provincial and federal governments and from selected Canadian universities to identify how health information is presented to university students. We used our previously implemented health literacy survey with Canadian postsecondary students as a sampling frame to determine which academic institutions to include. We then used specific search terms to identify relevant web pages using Google and integrated search functions on government websites, and compared the information available on pandemic measures categorized by university response strategies, sources of expertise and branding approaches. RESULTS: Our scan of Canadian government and university web pages found that universities similarly created one main page for COVID-19 updates and information and linked to public sector agencies as a main resource, and mainly differed in their provincial and local sources for obtaining information. They also differed in their strategies for communicating and displaying this information to their respective students. CONCLUSION: The universities in our sample outlined similar policies for their students, aligning with Canadian government public health recommendations and their respective provincial or regional health authorities.

To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions.

Even though many interventions implemented to tackle it, the problem is persisted. Objective: To identify determinants of premature rupture of membrane among pregnant women who have visited labor wards in four hospitals found in Gedeo zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods: Hospital-based unmatched case-control study was conducted from February to May 2020. Data were collected among 75 cases and 223 controls using face-to-face interviews. Cases and controls were recruited consecutively from pregnant women who have visited the labor ward. Data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. Bivariable and Multivariable logistic regression was used to check the association between dependent and independent variables, statistically significant association was declared at p-value < 0.05. Results: A total of 75 cases and 233 controls were enrolled in the study. Hypertension during index pregnancy [AOR = 2.81 (95% CI: 1.09 -7.23)], history of abortion [AOR = 3.7 (95% CI: 1.41-9.73)], history of caesarean section [AOR = 3.46 (95% CI: 1.34-8.9)] and history of PROM [AOR = 4.77 (95% CI: 2.31-9.89)] were associated with premature rupture of membranes. Conclusion: Hypertension during the index pregnancy, history of abortion, history of PROM, and history of cesarean section has an association with premature rupture of membrane.

medical care created unique challenges for these patients While many patients adapted well to telephone and video visits, the lack of face to face contact, fears of infection and coping with the loss of family and friends created more needs and often demands for increase in services Help seeking and help rejecting behaviors often increased over time The goal of treatment of personality disorders in late life is not to cure the disorder but to decrease the frequency and intensity of symptoms The COVID-19 global pandemic placed unique stressors on these vulnerable patients with limited coping skills Methods Cases studies were identified from the patient population at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, an urban medical center serving a multicultural and socioeconomically diverse population Mount

Scenario-based experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions including course modality shift (from face-to-face to online), social distancing, mask use and vaccination. A case study is performed for a typical US university. Findings With 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% course modality shift, the number of total cases can be reduced to 3.9%, 20.9%, 35.6%, 60.9% and 96.8%, respectively, comparing against the baseline scenario (no interventions). More than 99.9% of the total infections can be prevented when combined social distancing and mask use are implemented even without course modality shift. If vaccination is implemented without other interventions, the reductions are 57.1%, 90.6% and 99.6% with 80%, 85% and 90% vaccine efficacies, respectively.

In viral infections, viruses exploit receptor-ligand interactions to latch onto cellular exterior prior to subsequent entry and invasion. In light of the selective binding affinity between viral pathogens and cells, nanoparticles cloaked in cellular membranes are herein employed for virus targeting. Using the influenza virus as a model, erythrocyte membrane cloaked nanoparticles are prepared and modified with magnetic functionalities (RBC-mNP) for virus targeting and isolation. To maximize targeting and isolation efficiency, density gradient centrifugation and nanoparticle tracking analysis were applied to minimize the presence of uncoated particles and membrane vesicles. The resulting nanoparticles possess a distinctive membrane corona, a sialylated surface, and form colloidally stable clusters with influenza viruses. Magnetic functionality is bestowed to the nanoparticles through encapsulation of superparamagnetic iron-oxide particles, which enable influenza virus enrichment via magnetic extraction. Viral samples enriched by the RBC-mNPs result in significantly enhanced virus detection by multiple virus quantification methods, including qRT-PCR, immunnochromatographic strip test, and cell-based titering assays. The demonstration of pathogen targeting and isolation by RBC-mNPs highlights a biologically inspired approach toward improved treatment and diagnosis against infectious disease threats. The work also sheds light on the efficient membrane cloaking mechanism that bestows nanoparticles with cell mimicking functionalities.","output":"Targeting and Enrichment of Viral Pathogen by Cell Membrane Cloaked Magnetic Nanoparticles for Enhanced Detection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reporting of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) co-infections with other respiratory pathogens has varied.

Patients with metastatic advanced gastric cancer commonly develop a gastric outlet obstruction that considerably worsens their quality of life. Surgical interventions such as gastrojejunostomy and palliative gastrectomy are commonly administered to alleviate this obstruction. However, whether one intervention is better than another at improving morbidity- and mortality-related outcomes is unclear. Thus, in this meta-analysis, we compare outcomes of palliative gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy (overall hospital stay length, time to oral intake, survival, and complication rates) in patients with metastatic advanced gastric cancer to identify the best procedure. Objective: To compare morbidity and mortality outcomes of palliative gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy in patients with metastatic advanced gastric cancer. Methods: We followed the PRISMA guidelines to systematically search Web of Science, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, and MEDLINE for relevant studies. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to find differential outcomes between palliative gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy among variables such as time to oral intake, overall hospital stay length, complication rates, and survival in patients with metastatic advanced gastric cancer. Results: From 963 studies, we found 7 eligible studies with 642 patients (70.3  4.7 years) who had undergone palliative gastrectomy or gastrojejunostomy. Our meta-analysis revealed an insignificant (p > 0.05) differences in terms of overall survival duration (Hedge's g, 1.22), complication risks (odds ratio, 1.35), and time to oral intake (g, 0.62) and hospital stay length (g, 0.12) between patients undergoing gastrojejunostomy and palliative gastrectomy. Conclusion: In this present study we observed no statistically significant differences in terms of morbidity and mortality outcomes after palliative gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy in patients with metastatic advanced gastric cancer. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn for the variables evaluated.

The paper examines a) how often and of what type early childhood educators implemented digitally supported parental cooperation during the closure of day-care centres, b) which attitudes educators had towards general as well as digitally supported parental cooperation, and c) what role their qualifications, their attitudes and their perceived support through the centre played for their digital and non-digital parental cooperation during the closure of day-care centres. The study is based on a nationwide online survey of 3513 early childhood educators in day-care centres during corona closing time. The results show that educators' perceived importance of parental cooperation had a positive influence on whether or not educators had stayed in contact with the parents. Whether this contact occurs via digital media, in turn, depended on educators' attitudes towards digital media, the expected reaction of parents to this form of parental cooperation and the availability of technical support for implementing digital media in parental cooperation. The results are discussed with regard to the structural conditions of institutions and the professional skills of early childhood educators for a broad implementation of digital media in early childhood education practice.","output":"[(Digital) parent-educator cooperation in preschool during Corona pandemic.

Among the most important of these involve using social distancing to prevent contact. Restricted social contacts have important effects on activity participation and on travel demand. The current study examined an array of less-studied factors, such as attitudes and beliefs toward train use, including risk perception of flu-type infection, alongside more traditional factors, which together affect decisions whether to continue using the train. Data was collected using an internet survey application. The study was based on two surveys that were conducted approximately seven months apart, the first completed by 237 participants and the second by 149. We developed a structural equation model to better understand the influence of various factors on decisions whether to continue to use the train. We found a correlation between perception of the risk of infection and the decision to continue train travel. Study results also demonstrate the relation between trip purpose and the decision to use public transportation. The study results highlight the importance of many attributes favorably associated with train travel, including saving time, reliability, and comfort. Therefore, in contrast to the existing situation where the railway company makes its own decisions to decrease trip frequencies and to cancel some lines, government policy makers and the railway company should maintain a strong frequency schedule and increase the number of lines in order to accommodate social distancing. In addition, we found that the most effective measures for encouraging people to keep travelling by train required mask use, preventing people with flu-like symptoms from traveling by train, and fining those who do not comply. In order to sustain the train use as a viable alternative to using private vehicles it is important to decrease the risk perception of being infected by coronavirus and other kinds of infected diseases while traveling by train. This can be addressed by creating a clean and reasonably sterile environment. These results highlight the need for serious intervention by decision-makers in order to sustain the train use as a viable alternative to using private vehicles.","output":"Extent to which COVID-19 will affect future use of the train in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The more complex data are, the higher the number of possibilities to extract partial information from those data These possibilities arise by adopting different analytic approaches The heterogeneity among these approaches and in particular the heterogeneity in results they produce are challenging for follow-up studies, including replication, validation and translational studies Furthermore, they complicate the interpretation of findings with wide-spread relevance Here, we take the example of statistical epistasis networks derived from genome-wide association studies with single nucleotide polymorphisms as nodes Even though we are only dealing with a single data type, the epistasis detection problem suffers from many pitfalls, such as the wide variety of analytic tools to detect them, each highlighting different aspects of epistasis and exhibiting different properties in maintaining false positive control To reconcile different network views to the same problem, we considered 3 network aggregation methods and discussed their performance in the context of epistasis network aggregation We furthermore applied a latent class method as best performer to real-life data on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and highlighted its benefits to increase our understanding about IBD underlying genetic architectures","output":"Network aggregation to enhance results derived from multiple analytics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To summarize the experience of response to COVID-19 outbreak at a tertiary eye care institute and its network of health facilities in India.

There is paucity of available data on cancer management in lower-middle income countries during this pandemic, we sought to determine the institutional approach towards management of breast cancer patients and the outcomes during COVID-19 pandemic at our institution. Materials and methods: Clinicopathological and treatment record of cancer patients who presented to the Breast Clinic from 15th March to 31st December 2020 was retrieved from the institutional database for this retrospective clinical observational study. Results: A total of 292 patients were qualified for the analysis in which 206 patients (70.5%) underwent breast cancer surgeries. Only 10 of them (4.9%) were identified to be COVID-19 virus positive on routine pre-operative RT-PCR test before elective surgeries. All were asymptomatic, received home-based care via telecommunication and were operated at a later date when test turned out negative. None of them developed any complications post-operatively. Another group of 86 patients (29.5%) were referred for Neoadjuvant/Systemic chemotherapy in which COVID-19 infection was detected in only 4 patients (4.6%) while receiving cycles. Two patients shown symptoms of cough and fever hence hospitalised but were not candidates for Intensive Care Unit admission while other two patient were asymptomatic and isolated at home. All patients recovered well and chemotherapy was commenced again after negative RT-PCR test. No mortality was observed. Conclusion: Despite of being a global crisis particularly for cancer patients we observed infectivity, complications and fatality much lower among breast cancer cases.

METHODS: Using county-level data and multilevel negative binomial models, we evaluate associations between COVID-19 cases and percentages of residents that are foreign-born, Latinx, Black, or Asian, presenting estimates for all counties combined and stratifying across regions. Given varying risk factors among Latinx, we also evaluate associations for percentages of residents from specific Latin American-origin groups. RESULTS: Percentage of foreign-born residents is positively associated with COVID-19 case rate (IRR = 1.106; 95% CI: 1.074-1.139). Adjusted associations for percentage Latinx are nonsignificant for all counties combined, but this obscures heterogeneity. Counties with more Central Americans have higher case rates (IRR = 1.130; 95% CI: 1.067-1.197). And, in the Northeast and Midwest, counties with more Puerto Ricans have higher case rates. Associations with percentage Asians are nonsignificant after adjusting for percentage foreign-born. With the confirmation of prior evidence, the percentage of Black residents is positively and robustly associated with COVID-19 case rate (IRR = 1.031; 95% CI: 1.025-1.036).

Despite a land administration system based on cadaster and land registries in place, 25% of the arable land with an estimated 10 million spatial units on the ground are informally occupied and are off-register. Recently, a strong political will has emerged to ensure land rights for all. Providing tenure security to all these occupants using the conventional surveying and land administration approach demands a large amount of skilled human resources, a long timeframe and a huge budget. To assess the suitability of the fit-for-purpose land administration (FFPLA) approach for nationwide mapping and registration of informality in the Nepalese context, the identification, verification and recordation (IVR) of the people-to-land relationship was conducted through two pilot studies using a participatory approach covering around 1500 and 3400 parcels, respectively, in an urban and a rural setting. The pilot studies were based on the FFPLA National Strategy and utilized satellite imageries and smartphones for identification and verification of land boundaries. Data collection to verification tasks were completed within seven months in the urban settlements and for an average cost of 7.5 USD per parcel;within the rural setting, the pilot study was also completed within 7 months and for an average cost of just over 3 USD per parcel. The studies also informed the discussions on building the legislative and institutional frameworks, which are now in place. With locally trained grassroots surveyors, the studies have provided a promising alternative to the conventional surveying technologies by providing a fast, inexpensive and acceptable solution.

Specifically, the objectives were to determine what effective leadership practices Canadian health leaders have used through the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, to explore how these differ from pre-crisis practices; and to identify what leadership practices might be leveraged to create the desired health and care systems of the future. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH The authors used an action research methodology. In the first phase, reported here, the authors conducted one-on-one, virtual interviews with 18 health leaders from across Canada and across leadership roles. Data were analyzed using grounded theory methodology. FINDINGS Five key practices emerged from the data, within the core dimension of disrupting entrenched structures and leadership practices. These were, namely, responding to more complex emotions in self and others. Future practice identified to create more psychologically supportive workplaces. Agile and adaptive leadership. Future practice should allow leaders to move systemic change forward more quickly. Integrating diverse perspectives, within and across organizations, leveling hierarchies through bringing together a variety of perspectives in the decision-making process and engaging people more broadly in the co-creation of strategies. Applying existing leadership capabilities and experience. Future practice should develop and expand mentorship to support early career leadership. Communication was increased to build credibility and trust in response to changing and often contradictory emerging evidence and messaging. Future practice should increase communication. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS The project was limited to health leaders in Canada and did not represent all provinces/territories. Participants were recruited through the leadership networks, while diverse, were not demographically representative. All interviews were conducted in English; in the second phase of the study, the authors will recruit a larger and more diverse sample and conduct interviews in both English and French. As the interviews took place during the early stages of the pandemic, it may be that health leaders' views of what may be required to re-define future health systems may change as the crisis shifts over time. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The sponsoring organization of this research - the Canadian Health Leadership Network and each of its individual member partners - will mobilize knowledge from this research, and subsequent phases, to inform processes for leadership development and, succession planning across, the Canadian health system, particularly those attributes unique to a context of crisis management but also necessary in post-crisis recovery. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS This research has shown that there is an immediate need to develop innovative and influential leadership action - commensurate with its findings - to supporting the evolution of the Canadian health system, the emotional well-being of the health-care workforce, the mental health of the population and challenges inherent in structural inequities across health and health care that discriminate against certain populations.

However, the estimated prevalence essential to guide public health policy varies in published literature. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate prevalence of smell and taste loss among COVID-19 patients. DATA SOURCES: We conducted systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases for studies published on the prevalence of smell and taste loss in COVID-19 patients. REVIEW METHODS: Two authors extracted data on study characteristics and the prevalence of smell and taste loss. Random-effects modeling was used to estimate pooled prevalence. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were conducted to explore potential heterogeneity sources. This study used PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 32 studies reported a prevalence of loss of smell, taste, or both from a combined sample of 20,451 COVID-19 patients. The estimated global pooled prevalence of loss of smell among 19,424 COVID-19 patients from 27 studies was 48.47% (95% CI, 33.78%-63.29%). Loss of taste was reported in 20 studies and 8001 patients with an estimated pooled prevalence of 41.47% (95% CI, 3.13%-31.03%), while 13 studies that reported combined loss of smell and taste in 5977 COVID-19 patients indicated a pooled prevalence of 35.04% (95% CI, 22.03%-49.26%).

METHODOLOGY C: 100 participants aged 18-65 years, who visited Psychiatry OPD, were included. The psychological impact due to life stress was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale. Current Psycho-pathology was assessed by DASS-21 scale. The perceived loneliness and social isolation were assessed by De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. RESULTS-: Out of 100 participants, 55% reported to have faced difficulties during pandemic, 64% reported worsening of mental illness, 40% faced difficulty in accessing medications, resulting in non-compliance. 61% managed to visit hospital during pandemic, while 35% could not access consultation services. Only 4% sought teleconsultation. Psychological impact of COVID was found to be positively correlated with the perceived loneliness and social isolation during quarantine(r=11.619, p=0.01). DISCUSSION-: These results depict a significant impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health patients with psychiatric illness that is exacerbated by social isolation. Quarantine and social distancing lead to elevated levels of loneliness and social isolation, which in turn produce repercussions on mental health.

Bacterial MTs share sequence homology, antioxidant chemistry, and heavy metal-binding capacity with eukaryotic MTs, however, the impact of bacterial MTs on virulence and infection have not been well-studied. In the present study, we investigated the role of PmtA in P. aeruginosa PAO1 using a PmtA-deficient strain (pmtA). Here we demonstrated the virulence factor, pyocyanin, relies on the expression of PmtA. We showed that PmtA may be protective against oxidative stress, as an alternative antioxidant, glutathione, can rescue pyocyanin expression. Furthermore, the expression of phzM, which encodes a pyocyanin precursor enzyme, was decreased in the pmtA mutant during early stationary phase. Upregulated pmtA expression was previously detected in confluent biofilms, which are essential for chronic infection, and we observed that the pmtA mutant was disrupted for biofilm formation. As biofilms also modulate antibiotic susceptibility, we examined the pmtA mutant susceptibility to antibiotics and found that the pmtA mutant is more susceptible to cefepime and ciprofloxacin than the wild-type strain. Finally, we observed that the deletion of pmtA results in decreased virulence in a waxworm model. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that PmtA is necessary for the full virulence of P. aeruginosa and may represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","output":"PmtA Regulates Pyocyanin Expression and Biofilm Formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health costs of in-person schooling during the pandemic, if any, fall primarily on the families of students, largely due to the fact that students significantly outnumber teachers.

This study used the effortCreward imbalance model to investigate the association between work-stress characteristics (effort, over-commitment, reward) and mental health problems (anxiety and depression) among front-line public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: A total of 4850 valid online questionnaires were collected through a self- constructed sociodemographic questionnaire, the adapted ERI questionnaire, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between ERI factors and mental health problems (i.e., depression and anxiety), with reward treated as a potential moderator in such associations. RESULTS: The data showed that effort and over-commitment were positively associated with depression and anxiety, while reward was negatively associated with depression and anxiety. Development and job acceptance were the two dimensions of reward buffered the harmful effect of effort/over-commitment on depression and anxiety, whereas esteem was non-significant.

The present study aims to describe the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of 672 cities with cases of COVID-19, as well as to determine a predictive model for the number of cases. We analyzed data from cities with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 until June 26, 2020. It was observed that cities with confirmed cases of the disease are present in all Brazilian states, affecting 36.5% of the municipalities in Rio de Janeiro State. The inhabitants in cities with reported cases of COVID-19 represent more than 73.1% of the Brazilian population. Stratifying the age groups of the inhabitants and accounting for the percentage of women and men does not affect COVID-19 incidence (confirmed cases/100,000 inhabitants). The demographic density, the MHDI and the per capita income of the municipalities with cases of COVID-19 do not affect disease incidence. In addition, if conditions are maintained, our model predicts 2,358,703 (2,172,930 to 2,544,477) cumulative cases on July 25, 2020.","output":"Predictive model of COVID-19 incidence and socioeconomic description of municipalities in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decreased sound tolerance (DST) is a negative reaction to environmental sounds and is estimated to affect 3.5% of the population.

The aim of this study is to analyze the value co-created for users (guests and hosts) in the non-profit sharing accommodation platforms Couchsurfing and HomeExchange. This study also aims to analyze whether the co-created value of these platforms differs from that of for-profit platforms, along with how the outcomes, resources, and practices of the value co-creation process can help create wellbeing for individuals involved in the accommodation experience. Given that most of the existing literature on value co-creation in sharing accommodation platforms is based on Airbnb and guest perspectives, this study is a pioneer in analyzing how guests and hosts co-create value in the context of non-profit accommodation platforms using online travel reviews (OTRs) from non-profit platforms, and how the co-created value contributes to the wellbeing of the individuals involved. Results show that a set of tangible and intangible resources, such as the home and its amenities, helps users on non-profit platforms co-create value and that interaction and social practices between guests and hosts help co-create value for both groups. This implies that non-profit accommodation platforms may contribute more to the social dimensions of wellbeing of their users than for-profit platforms such as Airbnb where the host is typically absent from the experience. In addition, this study demonstrates that the co-created value in non-profit platforms depends on the modus operandi of each platform.

While our current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis is limited, a better understanding will help us develop efficacious treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19. One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 primarily catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Significant to COVID-19, ACE2 is postulated to serve as a major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, as it does for SARS-CoV. Many infected individuals develop COVID-19 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress to pneumonia. Disease progression promotes the activation of immune cells, platelets, and coagulation pathways that can lead to multiple organ failure and death. ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with COVID-19, which reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally. Comparatively, ACE2 is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression, which may also play a critical pathogenic role in COVID-19. Importantly, targeting ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking ACE2 interaction with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to curtail SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we will discuss the following subtopics: 1) ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2; 2) clinical and pathological features of COVID-19; 3) role of ACE2 in the infection and pathogenesis of SARS; 4) potential pathogenic role of ACE2 in COVID-19; 5) animal models for pathological studies and therapeutics; and 6) therapeutics development for COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and research gaps: Understanding SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the ACE2 receptor and implications for therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 is an acute and contagious disease characterized by pneumonia and ARDS.

The Semantic MEDLINE Database (SemMedDB), a high-quality public repository of SPO triples extracted from medical literature, provides a basic data infrastructure for measuring medical knowledge. In general, the study of extracting SPO triples as computable knowledge unit from unstructured scientific text has been overwhelmingly focusing on scientific knowledge per se. Since the SPO triples would be possibly extracted from hypothetical, speculative statements or even conflicting and contradictory assertions, the knowledge status (i.e., the uncertainty), which serves as an integral and critical part of scientific knowledge has been largely overlooked. This article aims to put forward a framework for Medical Knowmetrics using the SPO triples as the knowledge unit and the uncertainty as the knowledge context. The lung cancer publications dataset is used to validate the proposed framework. The uncertainty of medical knowledge and how its status evolves over time indirectly reflect the strength of competing knowledge claims, and the probability of certainty for a given SPO triple.

Recently, a model has been developed in Wenzhou, China, to predict the survival of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who underwent antiretroviral therapy (ART). We aimed to evaluate the methodological quality and validate the model in an external population-based cohort. METHODS: Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) was used to assess the risk of bias of the Wenzhou model. Data were from the National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Program database. We included PLWHA treated between February 2004 and December 2019 in a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou city, China. The endpoint was all-cause deaths and assessed until January 2020. We assessed the discrimination performance of the model by Harrells overall C-statistics and time-dependent C-statistics and calibration by comparing observed survival probabilities estimated with the KaplanCMeier method versus predicted survival probabilities. To assess the potential prediction value of age and gender which were precluded in developing the Wenzhou model, we compared the discriminative ability of the original model with an extended model added with age and gender. RESULTS: Based on PROBAST, the Wenzhou model was rated as high risk of bias in three out of the four domains (selection of participants, definition of outcome, and methods for statistical analysis) mainly because of the misuse of nested caseCcontrol design and propensity score matching. In the external validation analysis, 16758 patients were included, among whom 743 patients died (mortality rate 11.41 per 1000 person-years) during follow-up (median 3.41 years, interquartile range 1.64C5.62). The predictor of HIV viral load was missing in 14361 patients (85.7%). The discriminative ability of the Wenzhou model decreased in the external dataset, with the Harrells overall C-statistics being 0.76, and time-dependent C-statistics dropping from 0.81 at 6 months to 0.48 at 10 years after ART initiation. The model consistently underestimated the survival, and the level was 6.23%, 10.02%, and 14.82% at 1, 2, and 3 years after ART initiation, respectively. The overall and time-dependent discriminative ability of the model improved after adding age and gender to the original model. CONCLUSION: The Wenzhou prognostic model is at high risk of bias in model development, with inadequate model performance in external validation. Thereby, we could not confirm the validity and extended utility of the Wenzhou model.

Suspension of elective dental care across the United States during the initial phase of the pandemic was necessary to prevent viral transmission. The emergency dental care that was provided had to be tailored to minimize the generation of aerosols. With the suspension of elective care, over time, the proportion of dental emergencies was anticipated to rise. Dentists who care for children have continued to provide emergency dental treatment to this vulnerable population. Treatment decisions for pediatric dental emergencies had to be tailored to principles of public health that best mitigated risk of viral transmission. Decisions needed to balance the benefits of chosen treatment modality for the individual child with the risk of viral transmission to dental professionals and their staff, patients, and community. The paucity of reliable research for dentists to aid in clinical decision making may have left careproviders feeling ethically and morally insecure in shifting from a patient-centered to a community-centered paradigm. We present analysis of four pediatric emergency case scenarios that are representative of those likely to present to a private practice, academic setting, or emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE To retrospectively analyze the clinical results for emergent endovascular carotid recanalization in patients with acute proximal (cervical) ICA occlusion and to assess predictors of recanalization and clinical, neurological, and functional outcome. METHODS Emergent endovascular revascularization was attempted in 22 patients presenting with acute stroke secondary to complete cervical ICA occlusion. Patients with pseudo-occlusion were excluded. Recanalization was assessed with the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI) system: grade 0 (no flow) to grade 3 (normal flow). RESULTS The median age of the patients was 65 years; mean admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14. Recanalization (TIMI grade 2/3) occurred in 17 patients (77.3%). Ten patients (45.5%) demonstrated significant clinical improvement during hospitalization (NIHSS improved 4 points). Fifty percent of patients had good outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 2) after a median follow-up of 3 months. Patient age <70 years and successful recanalization (TIMI grade 2/3) predicted a good outcome (P  .01). Presence of atrial fibrillation, admission NIHSS score 20, and complete ICA occlusion at all levels (cervical, petrocavernous, and intracranial) were associated with poor outcomes (P  .05). Patients with complete cervical ICA occlusion but partial distal preservation of the vessel were most likely to benefit from the intervention (recanalization in 88.2%; good outcome in 64.7%).

A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) captures different geriatric domains. Yet, if and how components of the CGA are related to mortality in an outpatient geriatric setting is unknown. In the Amsterdam Ageing Cohort, we therefore studied distribution and accumulation of geriatric domain deficits in relation to mortality. METHODS All patients received a CGA as part of standard care, independent of referral reason. We summarized deficits on the CGA, using predefined cutoffs, in 5 geriatric domains: somatic, mental, nutritional, physical, and social domain. Information on mortality was obtained from the Dutch municipal register. We used age- and sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analyses to relate the separate domains and accumulation of impaired domains to overall mortality. RESULTS From the 1,055 geriatric outpatients (53% female; age 79  7 years), 172 patients (16%) had died after 1.7  1.1 years. In 626 patients (59%), 3 or more domains were impaired. All domains were independently associated with mortality, with the highest hazard for the somatic domain (HR 3.7 [1.7-8.0]) and the lowest hazard for the mental domain (HR 1.5 [1.1-12.0]). In addition, accumulation of impaired domains showed a gradually increased mortality risk, ranging from HR 2.2 (0.8-6.1) for 2 domains to HR 9.6 (3.7-24.7) for all 5 domains impaired.

Studies have shown that adolescents adopt an array of coping mechanisms and social supports when contending with stress. It is unclear, though, which strategies are most effective in mitigating daily pandemic-related stress, as few micro-longitudinal studies have explored adolescents daily affect during COVID-19. Parental support may also be a critical component of adolescents pandemic-related coping, as adolescents peer networks have been limited by public health measures. METHODS: This longitudinal study examined links between stress, coping, parental support, and affect across 14 consecutive days and 6216 assessments from a national sample of adolescents (N=444; M(age)=15.0; 60% female; 44% Black/African American, 39% White/Europen American, 9% Latinx, 6% Asian American, 2% Native American) during school closures and state-mandated stay-at-home orders between April 8 and April 21, 2021. RESULTS: Adolescents health and financial stress predicted increases in same-day (health stress effect size = .16; financial stress effect size = .11) and next-day negative affect (health stress effect size = .05; financial stress effect size = .08). Adolescents secondary control engagement coping predicted increases in same-day (effect size = .10) and next-day (effect size = .04) positive affect and moderated the link between health stress and negative affect.

Patients with PD also received detailed motor and non-motor evaluation by serial scales. Cognitive profiles were investigated in patients with PD-MCI, relative to patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and cognitively NCs. In addition, differences in demography, major motor and non-motor symptoms were compared between patients with PD-MCI and PD-NC. There were 70 patients with PD-MCI, occupying 33.8% of the total patients. Patients with PD-MCI had impairment in multiple cognitive domains, especially in executive function, memory and visuospatial function on MoCA-BC, relative to cognitively NCs or PD-NC. Compared with PD-NC patients, PD-MCI patients were older (p = 0.002) and had a later onset age (p = 0.007) and higher score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III (p = 0.001). The positive rate of clinical possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (cpRBD) in the PD-MCI group was significantly increased relative to the PD-NC group (p = 0.003).

Immunocytes in the red pulp were decreased by 68.0-90.7% except for CD68+ macrophages and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR positive antigen-presenting cells (APC), which were decreased to a lesser degree. On average, CD68+ macrophages were increased in size by 2.21-fold.

We performed a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis of the incidence of BNS after transurethral procedures for BPH. METHODS We performed a systemic literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Controlled Register of Trials. We accepted only randomized trials comparing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) vs. other transurethral surgery for BPH that were grouped in Ablation vs. Enucleation modalities. The incidences of BNS were pooled using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Method with the random effect model and expressed as Risk Ratios, 95% Confidence Intervals, and p values. Study heterogeneity was assessed utilizing the I2 value. RESULTS 72 studies were identified for meta-analysis, 46 comparing TURP vs. Ablation and 26 TURP vs. Enucleation. The pooled incidence of BNS was 1.3% after TURP, 0.66% after enucleation and 1.2% after Ablation. The incidence of BNS was higher after TURP than after Enucleation but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.75 95% CI 0.81-3.79, p = 0.16). There was no significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 0%, Chi2 4.11, p = 0.90). The incidence of BNS was higher after TURP than after Ablation, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.82-2.11, p = 0.26) with no significant heterogeneity (I2 0%, Chi2 21.1, p = 0.51). CONCLUSION Our study showed no difference in the rate of BNS incidence among randomized trials comparing TURP vs. Ablation vs. Enucleation and can be used as a reference to counsel patients undergoing BPH surgery.","output":"Bladder neck stenosis after transurethral prostate surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Lack of social support is considered a potential risk factor for postnatal depression but limited longitudinal evidence is available. Pregnancy, when women have increased contact with healthcare services, may be an opportune time to intervene and help strengthen women's social networks to prevent feelings of depression postnatally, particularly for those at greatest risk. Our study examined the longitudinal relationship between social support in pregnancy and postnatal depression, and whether this is moderated by age or relationship status. METHODS We analysed data collected from 525 women from a diverse inner-city maternity population in England who were interviewed in pregnancy and again three months postnatally. Women provided sociodemographic information and completed self-report measures of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and social support (Social Provisions Scale). RESULTS Less social support in pregnancy was associated with postnatal depression, after adjusting for sociodemographic confounders and antenatal depression (Coef. = - 0.05; 95% CI - 0.10 to - 0.01; p = 0.02). There was weak evidence of a moderating effect of relationship status. Subgroup analysis showed a stronger relationship between social support in pregnancy and postnatal depression for women who were not living with a partner (Coef. = - 0.11; 95% CI - 0.21 to - 0.01; p = 0.03) than for those who were (Coef. = - 0.03; 95% CI - 0.09 to 0.02; p = 0.28).

Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a routine measure in the treatment of active CD. We aimed at investigating the impact of EEN on patients with active CD from microbial metabolomics. METHODS: 16S-rDNA sequencing technology and gas chromatographyCmass spectrometer analysis were employed to investigate the modification of the intestinal flora and fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) during the EEN. RESULTS: Seven patients with CD, who conducted EEN, were followed up successfully in the present study. The 8-week EEN resulted in a remission of the condition of subjects with active CD, as revealed by a significant decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P = 0.018), C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.028), and Crohns disease activity index (CDAI) (P = 0.018). The nutrition of the subjects was improved after an 8-week treatment course with EEN, which was associated with an increase in body mess index (BMI) (P = 0.018) and serum albumin (ALB) (P = 0.018) levels. Furthermore, our investigations revealed a significantly increased abundance of Firmicutes paralleled by decreased levels of Proteobacteria. With respect to the genus, five species of bacteria including Ruminococcus (P = 0.01), Lachnospiraceae (P = 0.02), Anaerotruncus (P = 0.04), Flavonifractor (P = 0.04), and Novosphingobium (P = 0.05) showed significantly increased abundance. This was accompanied by relative changes in fecal short-chain fatty acids levels. Moreover, we successfully constructed a stable model by combining these five significantly different genera to predict the therapeutic effect of EEN on patients with CD (AUC = 0.9598). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that EEN can alleviate the condition and the nutrition of patients with active CD by regulating the intestinal flora and influencing the expression level of fecal short-chain fatty acids.

Review methods Systematic or scoping reviews examining patient experience in seeking care for musculoskeletal from healthcare providers and the healthcare system were included. Independent authors screened and selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of the reviews. Patient experience concepts were compiled into five themes from a perspective of a) relational and b) functional aspects. A list of mechanisms used to capture the patient experience was also collected. Results Thirty reviews were included (18 systematic and 12 scoping reviews). Relational aspects were reported in 29 reviews and functional aspects in 25 reviews. For relational aspects, the most prevalent themes were \\"information needs\\" (education and explanation on diseases, symptoms, and self-management strategies) and \\"understanding patient expectations\\" (respect and empathy). For functional aspects, the most prevalent themes were patient's \\"physical and environmental needs,\\" (cleanliness, safety, and accessibility of clinics), and \\"trusted expertise,\\" (healthcare providers' competence and clinical skills to provide holistic care). Interviews were the most frequent mechanism identified to collect patient experience. Conclusions Measuring patient experience provides direct insights about the patient's perspectives and may help to promote better patient-centered health services and increase the quality of care.

Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 27-year-old Caucasian man with PNH presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital with acute onset shortness of breath, cough and blood in urine. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with acute hemolytic exacerbation of PNH complicated with moderate COVID19 pneumonia. OUTCOMES: The patient was initiated with an anticoagulant unfractionated heparin, dexamethasone, and cefuroxime injection. His symptoms quickly resolved, and he was discharged after 5 days. CONCLUSION: The complement system activation is a critical component in the sequalae of COVID19 infection. Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. Notably, C5a concentration was noted to be higher in patients with COVID19 infection. The use of complement inhibitors to attenuate immune mediated damage in COVID19 nevertheless represents a very interesting theoretical approach.

We developed the Newcastle SarcScreen to enable assessment of these two ageing syndromes during clinical care. In the setting of our Older Peoples Medicine Day Unit, our aims were to describe the implementation of the SarcScreen and to examine the typical values obtained. METHODS: The SarcScreen comprised height, weight, questions (three on the Fried frailty phenotype and five on the SARC-F questionnaire), grip strength and gait speed. We analysed data from 552 patients completing the SarcScreen. We expressed grip strength as Z-scores (number of standard deviations above the mean expected for a patients age and sex). RESULTS: It was possible to implement the SarcScreen. In 552 patients (65.9% females) with mean age 80.1 (7.7) years, grip strength was feasible in 98.2% and gait speed in 82.1%. Gait speed was typically not assessed due to mobility impairment. Most patients had weak grip strength (present in 83.8%), slow gait speed (88.8%) and the frailty phenotype (66.2%). We found a high prevalence of probable sarcopenia and the frailty phenotype across all age groups studied. This was reflected by low grip strength Z-scores, especially at younger ages: those aged 60C69 had grip strength 2.7 standard deviations (95% CI 2.5C2.9) below that expected.

Due to the complex nature of the capacitated vehicle routing problem, metaheuristic optimization algorithms are widely used for tackling this type of challenge. Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimizer (CHIO) is a recent metaheuristic population-based algorithm that mimics the COVID-19 herd immunity treatment strategy. In this paper, CHIO is modified for capacitated vehicle routing problem. The modifications for CHIO are accomplished by modifying its operators to preserve the solution feasibility for this type of vehicle routing problems. To evaluate the modified CHIO, two sets of data sets are used: the first data set has ten Synthetic CVRP models while the second is an ABEFMP data set which has 27 instances with different models. Moreover, the results achieved by modified CHIO are compared against the results of other 13 well-regarded algorithms. For the first data set, the modified CHIO is able to gain the same results as the other comparative methods in two out of ten instances and acceptable results in the rest. For the second and the more complicated data sets, the modified CHIO is able to achieve very competitive results and ranked the first for 8 instances out of 27. In a nutshell, the modified CHIO is able to efficiently solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem and can be utilized for other routing problems in the future such as multiple travelling salesman problem.","output":"A modified coronavirus herd immunity optimizer for capacitated vehicle routing problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented health crisis around the world, not least because of its heterogeneous clinical presentation and course.

The WHO in 2002 and the Government of India in 2004 recommended low osmolarity rehydration solution (LORS) as the universal rehydration solution for all ages and all forms of dehydration. However, the use of LORS in India continues to be unacceptably low at 51%, although awareness about ORS has increased from a mere 14% in 2005 to 69% in 2015. Availability of different compositions of ORS and brands in market added to the confusion. PROCESS: The Indian Academy of Pediatrics constituted a panel of experts from the fields of pediatrics, pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition to update on management of dehydration in children with particular reference to LORS and issue a current practice guideline. The committee met twice at CIAP HQ to review all published literature on the aspect. Brief presentations were made, followed by discussions. The draft paper was circulated by email. All relevant inputs and suggestions were incorporated to arrive at a consensus on this practice guideline. OBJECTIVES: To summarize latest literature on ORT and empower pediatricians, particularly those practicing in rural areas, on management of dehydration by augmenting LORS use. RECOMMENDATIONS: It was stressed that advantages of LORS far out-weigh its limitations. Increased use of LORS can only be achieved by promoting better awareness among public and health-care providers across all systems of medicine.

Identifying risk factors is essential for the quickly detecting and controlling of epidemic outbreaks and reducing the incidence of cross-infections and non-communicable diseases. The objective of the present study is to analyze research on population surveillance, identifying the main topics of interest for investigators in the area. METHOD: ology. We included documents indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection in the period from 2000 to 2019 and assigned with the generic Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) population surveillance or its related terms (public health surveillance, sentinel surveillance or biosurveillance). A co-occurrence analysis was undertaken to identify the document clusters comprising the main research topics. Scientific production, collaboration, and citation patterns in each of the clusters were characterized bibliometrically. We also analyzed research on coronaviruses, relating the results obtained to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We included 39,184 documents, which reflected a steady growth in scientific output driven by papers on Public, Environmental & Occupational Health (21.62% of the documents) and Infectious Diseases (10.49%). Research activity was concentrated in North America (36.41%) and Europe (32.09%). The USA led research in the area (40.14% of documents). Ten topic clusters were identified, including Disease Outbreaks, which is closely related to two other clusters (Genetics and Influenza). Other clusters of note were Cross Infections as well as one that brought together general public health concepts and topics related to non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular and coronary diseases, mental diseases, diabetes, wound and injuries, stroke, and asthma). The rest of the clusters addressed Neoplasms, HIV, Pregnancy, Substance Abuse/Obesity, and Tuberculosis. Although research on coronavirus has focused on population surveillance only occasionally, some papers have analyzed and collated guidelines whose relevance to the dissemination and management of the COVID-19 pandemic has become obvious. Topics include tracing the spread of the virus, limiting mass gatherings that would facilitate its propagation, and the imposition of quarantines. There were important differences in the scientific production and citation of different clusters: the documents on mental illnesses, stroke, substance abuse/obesity, and cross-infections had much higher citations than the clusters on disease outbreaks, tuberculosis, and especially coronavirus, where these values are substantially lower. CONCLUSIONS: The role of population surveillance should be strengthened, promoting research and the development of public health surveillance systems in countries whose contribution to the area is limited.","output":"Systematic analysis of the scientific literature on population surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of ART restorations using High Viscosity Glass-ionomer cement (HVGIC) with conventional restorations using resin composite in Class II cavities of permanent teeth, in a 2-year follow-up.

The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered. METHODS: We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trialsone phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5  10(10) viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (22  10(10) viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever 378C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005). FINDINGS: Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24 422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17 178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 667% (95% CI 574C740), with 84 (10%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (29%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (09%) of 12 282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (11%) of 11 962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 760% (593C859). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 066 [95% CI 059C074]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 813% [95% CI 603C912] at 12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 551% [330C699] at <6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18C55 years (GMR 232 [201C268]). INTERPRETATION: The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.

The exact etiology of this increased risk is unknown, and thus, several animal models have been developed to investigate the neuroimmune interactions of PTSD. Repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) is an established preclinical model of psychological trauma that recapitulates certain behavioral and inflammatory aspects of human PTSD. Furthermore, RSDS has been utilized to subgroup animals into susceptible and resilient populations based on one specific behavioral phenotype (i.e., social interaction). Herein, we conducted an extensive investigation of circulating inflammatory proteins after RSDS and found significant elevations in various cytokines and chemokines after exposure to RSDS. When categorizing animals into either susceptible or resilient populations based on social interaction, we found no inflammatory or other behavioral differences between these subgroups. Furthermore, correlative analyses found no significant correlation between social interaction parameters and inflammation. In contrast, parameters from the elevated zero maze (EZM) demonstrated significant associations and clustering to 5 circulating cytokines. When animals were subdivided into susceptible and resilient populations solely based upon combined EZM performance, significant inflammatory differences were evident between these groups. Strikingly, these circulating inflammatory proteins displayed a stronger predictive ability of EZM performance compared to social interaction test performance. These findings provide new insights into inflammatory markers associated with RSDS, and the utility of EZM to effectively group RSDS-exposed mice into populations with differential levels of peripheral inflammation.","output":"Peripheral inflammation is strongly linked to elevated zero maze behavior in repeated social defeat stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have shown a rise in precocious puberty, especially in girls.

In Iraq, there are no registered known data on the psychological consequence of the public during the communicable disease outbreak. The ongoing study aims to address the paucity of these data as an appraisal of the mental health burden represented by anxiety disorder related to the global COVID-19 era. RESULTS: Among the 1591 Iraqi respondents, 788 (49.5%) accounted for having health anxiety over the current home restriction situation. Younger ages experienced more COVID-19-related health anxiety compared to older ages. Females reported higher health anxiety compared to males (57.7% vs 42.3%). The health care professionals reported 20.9% health anxiety. The Iraqi southern population displayed more health anxiety compared to the northern and middle portions.

To investigate the effect of FGFR1 overexpression on metformin-induced inhibition of breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that FGFR1 overexpression rendered MCF-7 and T47D cells resistant to metformin. In particular, we found that, in addition to AKT and ERK1/2 activation, FGFR1-induced activation of IRS1 and IGF1R, key regulators connecting metabolism and cancer, was associated with metformin resistance.

METHODS: Between July and September 2020, phone contact was made with every sixth unduplicated clinic in North Carolina listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration treatment locator (N = 490 clinics). The response rate was 53%. RESULTS: Of the 128 clinics responding, 62 clinics (48%) failed to treat pregnant patients both before and during the pandemic, whereas 66 clinics (52%) accepted pregnant patients before the COVID-19 pandemic, with only 44 (66%) of these clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic. Thus, 33% fewer clinics accepted pregnant women for OUD treatment. Of these 44 clinics, 52% provided same-day intake, 45% prescribed naltrexone, and 57% offered detoxification with opioid agonists. Self-pay (95%), private insurance (77%), and Medicaid (55%) were accepted as payment. Clinics commonly reported providing individual counseling (86%). No clinics provided childcare or transportation. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the buprenorphine clinics in North Carolina turned away pregnant patients before the pandemic. During the pandemic, only 34% accepted pregnant patients, with 33% clinics that had provided medication treatment before the pandemic declining to treat pregnant patients for OUD. Thus, it is critical that policymakers ensure OUD treatment clinics accept pregnant patients.","output":"Pregnant Patients Using Opioids: Treatment Access Barriers in the Age of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The practice and research on online chemistry education have received great attention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide This paper describes the teaching practice of online learning based on three online courses for pre-service chemistry teachers To adapt online teaching requirements, we reshaped the structure of the physical chemistry course, for example, adjusting the assessment approaches, and reinforcing long-distance instruction Besides, we also shared the course of training chemistry teaching skills online publicly, and provided multiple learning approaches after class Moreover, we introduced chemistry education research based on website data in an educational research methods course and shared ideas through the technology platform","output":"The Individual Experience of Online Chemistry Teacher Education in China: Coping with COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to examine the association between loneliness and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. We conducted a cross-sectional online study from 22 to 26 December 2020. A total of 27,036 participants, all employed at the time, were included in the analysis. Participants were asked if they felt loneliness in a single-item question. The Kessler 6 (K6) was used to assess psychological distress, defined as mild for K6 scores of 5 to 12 and severe for 13 or higher. The odds ratios (ORs) of psychological distress associated with loneliness were estimated using a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence, with adjustment for age, sex, marital status, equivalent income, educational level, smoking, alcohol consumption, job type, number of workplace employees, and cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 in the prefecture. Communication with friends, acquaintances, and family was strongly associated with psychological distress, so we adjusted for these factors and eating meals alone. Results showed a significant association between loneliness and psychological distress (OR = 36.62, 95% CI = 32.95-40.69). Lack of friends to talk to, lack of acquaintances to ask for help, and lack of people to communicate with through social networking sites were all strongly associated with psychological distress, as were family time and solitary eating. Even after adjusting for these factors, loneliness remained strongly associated with psychological distress (OR = 29.36, 95% CI = 26.44-32.98). The association between loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and psychological distress indicates the need for intervention.","output":"Association between loneliness and psychological distress: A cross-sectional study among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The threat of introduction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into the United States with the potential for community transmission prompted U.S. federal officials in February 2020 to screen travelers from China, and later Iran, and collect and transmit their demographic and contact information to states for follow-up. During February 5-March 17, 2020, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) received and transmitted contact information for 11,574 international travelers to 51 of 61 local health jurisdictions at a cost of 1,694 hours of CDPH personnel time. If resources permitted, local health jurisdictions contacted travelers, interviewed them, and oversaw 14 days of quarantine, self-monitoring, or both, based on CDC risk assessment criteria for COVID-19. Challenges encountered during follow-up included errors in the recording of contact information and variation in the availability of resources in local health jurisdictions to address the substantial workload. Among COVID-19 patients reported to CDPH, three matched persons previously reported as travelers to CDPH. Despite intensive effort, the traveler screening system did not effectively prevent introduction of COVID-19 into California. Effectiveness of COVID-19 screening and monitoring in travelers to California was limited by incomplete traveler information received by federal officials and transmitted to states, the number of travelers needing follow-up, and the potential for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. More efficient methods of collecting and transmitting passenger data, including electronic provision of flight manifests by airlines to federal officials and flexible text-messaging tools, would help local health jurisdictions reach out to all at-risk travelers quickly, thereby facilitating timely testing, case identification, and contact investigations. State and local health departments should weigh the resources needed to implement incoming traveler monitoring against community mitigation activities, understanding that the priorities of each might shift during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Identification and Monitoring of International Travelers During the Initial Phase of an Outbreak of COVID-19 - California, February 3-March 17, 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The majority of human antimicrobial utilization occurs in the outpatient setting. Despite being mainly viral in etiology, upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) were the most common indication for outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions at our institution. METHODS: Through our electronic health record (EHR), we were able to determine our rate of antibiotic prescriptions for inappropriate URI diagnosis at our primary care practice sites. We selected staff volunteers from each our primary care practice sites to serve as stewardship champions. They were given training in stewardship best practices, and an URI stewardship toolkit which included viral URI prescription pad, EHR order panel, and patient education signage. They were tasked with providing education and feedback to their practice sites. We meet with them on a monthly basis to disseminate prescribing data and education. They also provided feedback from practice sites to the stewardship committee. RESULTS: Our decentralized model was put in place in November 2020. In the 6 months prior to the intervention, the average prescribing rate was 29.1%. In the 6 months after the intervention, the average prescribing rate decreased by 15% to 24.8%. During the intervention phase, there was an increase in number of non-COVID URIs diagnosed at our primary care sites. Temporal Trend in Inappropriate Antibiotics Prescribing Rates for Viral URIs Pre- and Post- Intervention [Image: see text] Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing rate for viral upper respiratory tract infections from May 2020 until May 2021. Intervention started in December 2021 (arrow). Pre-intervention average was 29.1%. Post-intervention age was 24.8% which is a 15% decline in prescribing rate. Viral Upper Respiratory Infections Visits [Image: see text] The total number of visits for presumed viral upper respiratory infections to primary care sites from May 2020 until May 2021. The majority of COVID-19 precautions in the area expired at the end of March 2021. CONCLUSION: We have been able to lower our inappropriate prescriptions for URIs utilizing a decentralized model of stewardship champions. This result was especially notable as the intervention phase corresponded with the end of COVID-19 precautions and an increase in non-COVID URIs diagnosed. The advantage of this approach includes an advocate embedded at each practice site who is familiar with the opportunities and challenges of the site, and a two-way flow of information from practice sites to the stewardship committee. This model provided additional benefit during the COVID-19 pandemic as the ability of centralized staff to travel to off campus clinic sites was curtailed.

Randomized or non-randomized clinical trials in which NIBS plus psychosocial intervention was compared to control conditions in people with depressive symptoms were included. RESULTS: A total of 17 eligible studies with 660 participants were included. The meta-analysis results showed that NIBS combined with psychosocial therapy had a positive effect on moderate to severe depression ([SMD = ? 0.46, 95%CI (? 0.90, ? 0.02), I(2) = 73%, p < .01]), but did not significantly improve minimal to mild depression ([SMD = ? 0.12, 95%CI (? 0.42, 0.18), I(2) = 0%, p = .63]).

Impaired male reproductive function affects approximately half of infertile couples worldwide. Multiple factors related to the environment, genetics, age, and comorbidities have been associated with impaired sperm function. Present-day clinicians rely primarily on standard semen analysis to diagnose male reproductive potential and develop treatment strategies. To address sperm quality assessment bias and enhance analysis accuracy, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended standardized sperm testing; however, conventional diagnostic and therapeutic options for male infertility, including physical examination and semen standard analysis, remain ineffective in relieving the associated social burden. Instead, assisted reproductive techniques are becoming the primary therapeutic approach. In the post-genomic era, multiomics technologies that deeply interrogate the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and/or the epigenome, even at single-cell level, besides the breakthroughs in robotic surgery, stem cell therapy, and big data, offer promises towards solving semen quality deterioration and male factor infertility. This review highlights the complex etiology of male infertility, especially the roles of lifestyle and environmental factors, and discusses advanced technologies/methodologies used in characterizing its pathophysiology. A comprehensive combination of these innovative approaches in a global and multi-centric setting and fulfilling the suitable ethical consent could ensure optimal reproductive and developmental outcomes. These combinatorial approaches should allow for the development of diagnostic markers, molecular stratification classes, and personalized treatment strategies. Since lifestyle choices and environmental factors influence male fertility, their integration in any comprehensive approach is required for safe, proactive, cost-effective, and noninvasive precision male infertility theranostics that are affordable, accessible, and facilitate couples realizing their procreation dream.","output":"Infertility in Men: Advances towards a Comprehensive and Integrative Strategy for Precision Theranostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & Aims The study aimed to evaluate emotional eating tendency of Turkish individuals during COVID-19 pandemic.

However, there is compelling evidence for a fast-paced waning of immunity. The increasing number of new variants that could alter the severity, transmissibility, and potential to evade the immune response raised significant concern. Therefore, elucidating changes in the humoral immune response against viral variants induced by vaccines over time is crucial for improving immunization protocols. We carried out a 6-month longitudinal prospective study in which 60 individuals between 21 and 71 years of age who have received the complete scheme of the BNT162b2 vaccine were followed to determine titers of serum neutralizing activity. The neutralizing capacity was measured at one, three, and six-months post-vaccination by plaque reduction neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 B.1 (D614G) and the Gamma, Alpha, Delta, and Mu variants. Data were analyzed using GraphPad 5.0. Neutralizing activity against five different SARS-CoV-2 variants was detected in the serum samples of all vaccinated participants to a different extent after one month, with a progressive decrease according to age and gender. Overall, after one month of vaccination, the neutralizing titer was lower for all evaluated variants when compared to B.1, most remarkable against Delta and Mu, with a reduction of 83.1% and 92.3%, respectively. In addition, the Titer at 3- or 6-months follow-up decreased dramatically for all variants. Our results support the decaying of serum neutralizing activity, both over time and across SARS-CoV-2 variants, being more significant in older men. Since Delta and Mu appear to evade the neutralizing activity, these and further new variants of immune escape mutations should be considered for novel vaccine formulations.","output":"Humoral Response to BNT162b2 Vaccine Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants Decays After Six Months"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Null.","output":"Contributions and Challenges of Radiology in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the diagnosis of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis (CTL). METHODS: The cohort study included 203 consecutive patients diagnosed with cervical lymph node.

The diagnostic efficiency of the CEUS imaging findings of CTL was evaluated. RESULTS: Nighty-seven patients of the 203 (47.8%) were pathologically or laboratory confirmed with a CTL diagnosis while the remainder (52.2%) were diagnosed with non-tuberculous lymphadenitis. Regarding the imaging findings of CEUS, it was more common in CTL patients to find a pattern of heterogeneous enhancement inside the lymph nodes relative to non-tuberculous patients [81.44% (79/97) vs 15.09% (16/106), P < 0.01]. The sensitivity of the feature in diagnosis for CTL was 81.44% and the specificity was 84.91%, resepectively. Furthermore, a pattern of peripheral rim-like enhancement had been notable in CTL patients compared with non-tuberculous patients [86.60% (84/97) vs 12.26% (13/106), P < 0.01], associating with a diagnostic sensitivity of 86.60% and a specificity of 87.74%.

METHOD: This cross-sectional study was performed using a self-administered online survey, covering parents' and their children's characteristics, parents' willingness and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 1035 parents participated. RESULTS: Analysis showed that 36.3% of parents were willing to have their children receive the COVID-19 vaccine and that 59.9% were willing to receive it themselves. In addition, 83.9% were willing to have their children vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine if the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 in children increased following a mutation. After adjusting for significant variables, willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 24.91; 95% CI = 10.93-56.76), willingness for their children to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial (AOR = 11a.87; 95% CI = 2.41-58.40] and advising others to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [AOR = 7.82; 95% CI = 2.50-24.49] were associated with greater parents' willingness for their children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

METHODS: This pilot study included 2 treatment groups: a prospective study group of 9 subjects with significant EBMD who received debridement followed by self-retained CAM, and a retrospective, control group of 10 consecutive subjects who received debridement followed by a bandage contact lens (BCL). Slit-lamp photography after fluorescein staining were used to monitor healing. Corneal topography and IOL calculation were compared at baseline and 1 month after the procedure. Refraction and ocular surface stability were also compared after cataract surgery. RESULTS: Corneal reepithelialization after debridement occurred in 4.6  0.8 days in the study group and 6.8  0.6 days in the control (p < 0.05). Corneal topography showed changes in curvature from 43.5  1.2D at baseline to 44.6  1.2D at 1 month in the study group and from 45.0  0.6D to 45.7  0.8D in the control (p = 0.38).

RESULTS: Six themes were identified: 1) experiencing psychosomatic symptoms, 2) adoption of new healthy behaviors, 3) financial hardship, 4) family concerns, 5) reflections on discrimination and 6) reflections of existing support and expectations of support systems. The findings of our study illustrate the specific impact of COVID-19 among Nepalese migrants regarding their unstable employment conditions, perceived lack of social support, possible obligation to send money home, difficulty in accessing services due to the language barrier, and a lack of effective governmental support from Nepal. Pandemic-related adversity has negatively impacted migrants mental well-being, exacerbating their vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive and timely support should be provided to the vulnerable migrant population. Effective coordination among relevant parties in both countries, including the governments concerned, should be facilitated.

Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the magnitude of mental illnesses such as depression, not only in the general population, but also in health personnel. However, in Peru the prevalence is not known and the associated factors for developing depression in health personnel are not known. Objective: To determine the prevalence and identify the factors associated with depression in health personnel, in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Material and Method: An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out between the months of May-September in health establishments. A sample of 136 health workers were included and a survey was applied to collect the data. Depression as a dependent variable was measured using the Zung self-report scale. To identify the associated factors, the bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed by logistic regression with STATA v 14. Results: The prevalence of depression was 8.8% CI 95% (4.64-14.90), likewise, the antecedent of having a family member or friend died from COVID-19 with a p value of 0.017 and OR of 6.78 (CI: 1.39-32.90). On the other hand, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was found to be a protective factor against the development of depression with p value 0.003 and OR of 0.03 (CI: 0.004-0.32). Conclusions: Approximately 1 in 10 among health professionals and technicians developed depression during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in this study. In addition, the history of having relatives or friends killed by COVID-19 was negatively associated with depression and the use of PPE was identified as a protective factor for depression.","output":"Prevalencia y factores asociados a depression Prevalencia y factores asociados a depresin en personal de salud durante la pandemia de SARS-CoV-2 en el departamento de Piura, Per*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Several reports of obstetric anesthesia management have been published since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to collect high-quality broad and detailed data from different university medical centers in several European Society of Anesthesiologist countries. METHODS This prospective observational survey was performed in eight medical centers in Spain, Israel and Portugal from 1st April to 31st July 2020. Institutional review board approval was received at each participating center. Inclusion criteria: all women with a positive test for COVID-19. Retrieved data included maternal, delivery, anesthetic, postpartum details, and neonatal outcomes. Descriptive data are presented, and outcomes were compared for women with versus without respiratory signs and symptoms. RESULTS Women with respiratory symptoms (20/12.1%) had significantly higher mean (standard deviation) temperature (37.2 C (0.8) versus 36.8 C (0.6)), were older (34.1 (6.7) years versus 30.5 (6.6)) and had higher body mass index kg m-2 - (29.5 (7.5) versus 28.2 (5.1)). Women with respiratory symptoms delivered at a significantly earlier gestational age (50% < 37 weeks) with a 65% cesarean delivery rate (versus 22.1% in the group without respiratory symptoms) and 5-fold increased rate of emergency cesarean delivery, 30% performed under general anesthesia. A higher rate of intrauterine fetal death (3%) was observed than expected from the literature (0.2-0.3%) in developed countries. There was no evidence of viral vertical transmission. CONCLUSION Well-functioning neuraxial analgesia should be available to manage laboring women with respiratory symptoms, as there is a higher frequency of emergency cesarean delivery.

A recent review argued that vitamin D deficiency could have increased the COVID-19 outbreak and suggested vitamin D supplementation as a preventive action. In fact, many factors seem to be correlated both to low vitamin D levels and the importance of COVID-19 spreading and severity. It is also important to highlight that the lockdown, implemented in many countries, prevents people to go out and then increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency. COPD patients are particularly at risk to have low levels of vitamin D due to multiple risk factors. COPD may generate a systemic inflammatory process responsible of secondary extra-pulmonary impairments. Vitamin D deficiency could sustain and aggravate the systemic inflammation associated to COPD. Reports have also shown that vitamin D deficiency was associated to exacerbations and hospital admissions, as well as lung function. Recent research showed that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced COPD exacerbations. Although vitamin D deficiency was not proved to be neither a risk factor of COVID-19, nor a determinant of its severity, vitamin D supplementation represents a preventive perspective that needs to be further studied.","output":"Vitamin D supplementation to prevent COVID-19 in patients with COPD: a research perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) presents an unprecedented diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to clinicians. Despite recent progress in identifying and analyzing the coronavirus that is responsible for it, few reports have addressed the clinical complications of SARS. The present study was a two-center retrospective cohort study. All patients in the study had SARS, were managed in the two major Hong Kong hospitals (ie, Prince of Wales Hospital and United Christian Hospital), and had developed spontaneous pneumothorax during their hospitalization between March 10, 2003, and April 28, 2003. Spontaneous pneumothorax was reported in 6 of 356 SARS patients who were treated at the two hospitals during the period. This represents an incidence of 1.7%. None of the six patients had a history of smoking or pulmonary disease. The rate of admission to the ICU was 66.7% and the crude mortality rate was 33.3% in this group of patients. There was a trend for the mean neutrophil count in these patients to be higher than in previously reported cohorts of comparable SARS patients (14.5  10(9) vs 4.6  10(9) neutrophils per liter, respectively). Conservative measures like tube thoracostomy or observation alone offered satisfactory initial symptomatic management in five of six patients. Spontaneous pneumothorax is a specific and potentially life-threatening complication in SARS patients. Patients with extensive lung injury, as indicated by severe clinical courses, and in particular high neutrophil counts, appear to be most at risk.

Our aim was to track the current status of progress towards measles control and elimination milestones across 15 west African countries between 2001 and 2019. METHODS: We did a retrospective multicountry series analysis of national immunisation coverage and case surveillance data from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2019. Our analysis focused on the 15 west African countries that constitute the Economic Community of West African States. We tracked progress in the coverage of measles-containing vaccines (MCVs), measles supplementary immunisation activities, and measles incidence rates. We developed a country-level measles summary scorecard using eight indicators to track progress towards measles elimination as of the end of 2019. The summary indicators were tracked against measles control and elimination milestones. FINDINGS: The weighted average regional first-dose MCV coverage in 2019 was 66% compared with 45% in 2001. 73% (11 of 15) of the west African countries had introduced second-dose MCV as of December, 2019. An estimated 4 588 040 children (aged 12C23 months) did not receive first-dose MCV in 2019, the majority (71%) of whom lived in Nigeria. Based on the scorecard, 12 (80%) countries are off-track to achieving measles elimination milestones; however, Cape Verde, The Gambia, and Ghana have made substantial progress. INTERPRETATION: Measles will continue to be endemic in west Africa after 2020. The regional measles incidence rate in 2019 was 33 times the 2020 elimination target of less than 1 case per million population. However, some hope exists as countries can look at the efforts made by Cape Verde, The Gambia, and Ghana and learn from them.

Since the pandemic outbreak, the general public has been responsive to the national call to stay at home in quarantine. However, since doubts and anxiety related to the disease have been detected in the general public, in this study, we established the WeChat platform Coronavirus Disease 2019 Voluntary Assistance Group in Sichuan and Chongqing regions in January 2020, which was committed to providing professional consultation and psychological counseling services for residents in Sichuan and Chongqing during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak. Our aim was to analyze the consultation practices of residents in the WeChat assistance group and provide a reference for the similar non-contact voluntary service platforms aiming to implement consultations during the late pandemic period. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using the records containing the consultation content from the WeChat assistance groups in Sichuan and Chongqing between January 30 and March 1, 2020. Data on consultation content, changes in a number of consultation items, answers, knowledge on popular science, and expert advice were summarized, and the Pareto chart was used to analyze the primary and secondary factors of consultation content. RESULTS: The constituent ratio of respiratory symptoms, masks, and disinfection in consultation content ranked as the top three factors. Cumulatively, they occupied 49.77% of the content, thus resulting as the primary factors in the consultation content. The number of consultation items suddenly increased from 10 on the first day to 116 on the 7th day, resulting in a 1060% increased rate. There were 151 consultation factors, among which 130 (86.1%) were related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019, and 21 (13.9%) were unrelated to the Coronavirus Disease 2019.

We demonstrate that ORF3NP12, but not the truncated form, can inhibit recovery of reverse-genetics-derived PEDV when expressed in trans. When testing with other RNA viruses, ORF3 was found to inhibit rescue of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), but not of influenza virus. Interestingly, results from mutagenesis of ORF3NP12 suggest that F81 and M167 are responsible for impairing PEDV rescue in vitro. By changing specific residues of ORF3, the recombinant PEDV bearing the modified ORF3NP12 can be productively propagated in VeroE6-APN cells.

Since the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol is released during stress situations, the present study was conducted to investigate the influence of serum cortisol (SC) on cardiac and pulmonary parameters in patients after aSAH within the first 24 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 104 patients with aSAH admitted to our emergency department between January 2008 and April 2017. Blood samples were taken to determine SC and TNI. Demographics, initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) score, and Fisher grade were evaluated retrospectively. Mean norepinephrine application rate (NAR) in g/kg/min and mean inspiratory oxygen fraction (OF) within the first 24 hours were defined as cardiopulmonary parameters. RESULTS: An elevated SC value was found in 44 (42%) patients, and 27 (26%) patients showed an increased TNI value. In patients with initially increased SC value, a significant higher NAR ( P = .04) was needed. Furthermore, patients with initially elevated TNI value had a lower GCS score ( P = .0013) and a higher WFNS score ( P = .003) on admission and required a higher NAR ( P = .02) as well as OF ( P = .0008) within the first 24 hours of ICU treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, initially elevated SC values were associated with a higher need of NAR within the first 24 hours of ICU treatment after aSAH. Moreover, patients with initially elevated TNI values required an increased NAR and a higher OF so that these biomarkers could be useful to improve ICU treatment.","output":"Serum Cortisol as an Early Biomarker of Cardiopulmonary Parameters Within the First 24 Hours After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Intensive Care Unit Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Substance use treatment inequities among rural populations are well documented and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequalities, forcing healthcare providers to be creative in the delivery of treatment.

Experiments 2 and 3 used shorter study and test lists and obtained a significant DF effect along with significant CRE, but no interaction between face type and memory instruction. The results suggest that own-race and other-race faces are equally susceptible to DF.

We have reviewed original articles, case reports, and existing open-source data-sets to delineate the spectrum of neurological disorders potentially observed in SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. Neurological involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) corresponds to three situations: (a) neurological manifestations of viral infection, (b) post-infective neurological complications, and (c) infection in patients with neurological co-morbidity. Neurological manifestations can further be subdivided into the central nervous system (headache, dizziness, alteration of the sensorium, ataxia encephalitis, stroke, and seizures) and peripheral nervous system (skeletal muscle injury and peripheral nerve involvement including hyposmia and hypogeusia) symptomatology. Post-infective neurological complications include demyelinating conditions. Reduced mobility and dementia as co-morbidities may predispose a patient to have a viral infection. It is concluded that the pandemic of COVID-19 presents for a neurologist some unique challenges. We observe that SARS-CoV-2 may have various neurological manifestations and in many cases, neurological features may precede typical respiratory symptoms.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic: A Neurological Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the product attributes of cruise tours are distinguished into on-board activities, leisure space, cabin comfort, Michelin restaurant, and refund mechanism, and the multi-attribute utility model of cruise tours is constructed using the choice experiment (CE) method.

The control group was composed of healthy volunteers. Serum samples were evaluated for SARS-COV-2 antibodies prior vaccinations and 2-6 weeks after the administration of the second vaccine dose. Primary endpoint: seropositivity rate. Secondary endpoints: safety, factors influencing seroconversion, IgG titers of patients versus healthy volunteers, COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Between 20 March 2021 and 12 June 2021, 293 consecutive cancer patients with solid tumors underwent a program of COVID-19 vaccinations: of these, 2 patients refused vaccination, 13 did not receive the second dose of the vaccine due to cancer progression and 21 had COVID-19 antibodies at baseline and were excluded. The 257 evaluable patients had a median age of 65 years (range 28-86), 66.15% with metastatic disease. Primary endpoint: seropositivity rate in patients was 75.88%, versus 100% in the control group.

On the large scale, these empirical solutions, often associated with extended and complete lockdowns, attempt to minimize the costs associated with mortality, economic losses and social factors, while being subject to constraints such as finite hospital capacity. Here we pose the question of how to mitigate pandemic costs subject to constraints by adopting the language of optimal control theory. This allows us to determine top-down policies for the nature and dynamics of social contact rates given an age-structured model for the dynamics of the disease. Depending on the relative weights allocated to life and socioeconomic losses, we see that the optimal strategies range from long-term social-distancing only for the most vulnerable, to partial lockdown to ensure not over-running hospitals, to alternating-shifts with significant reduction in life and/or socioeconomic losses. Crucially, commonly used strategies that involve long periods of broad lockdown are almost never optimal, as they are highly unstable to reopening and entail high socioeconomic costs. Using parameter estimates from data available for Germany and the USA, we quantify these policies and use sensitivity analysis in the relevant model parameters and initial conditions to determine the range of robustness of our policies. Finally we also discuss how bottom-up behavioral changes can also change the dynamics of the pandemic and show how this in tandem with top-down control policies can mitigate pandemic costs even more effectively.","output":"Optimal policies for mitigating pandemic costs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clostridium difficile is a bacterial infection that usually presents with diarrhea and is mostly associated with previous antibiotics use Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) generally have respiratory symptoms but can also present with diarrhea Noncirrhotic hyperammonemia is an infrequent presentation and is treated with lactulose We report the case of a 40-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and confusion During hospitalization, the patient tested positive for COVID-19 and C difficile, and oral vancomycin was administered His kidney functions improved, but he remained confused His ammonia levels were elevated, and he was not treated with lactulose due to ongoing diarrhea secondary to C difficile infection","output":"Clostridium Difficile and Noncirrhotic Hyperammonnemia in a Patient With COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We describe the trajectory of clinical course, laboratory markers and outcomes in children with severe multi-inflammatory syndrome temporally related to COVID-19 (MIS-C) admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Methods: This was a prospective case series of children admitted to PICU between May 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021, fulfilling the case definition of MIS-C published by World Health Organization (WHO) or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We analyzed demographic, clinical, laboratory data and echocardiographic findings. We also plotted the variation in trends between survivors and nonsurvivors. Results: Of the 34 critically ill children referred to PICU with diagnosis of MIS-C only 17 fulfilled the WHO/CDC classification of MIS-C, rest were MISC mimickers albeit other tropical infections. Median age at admission was 4 years (range 1y 6 mo-8 years). Fever, rash and conjunctival redness were most prominent symptoms. Myocardial involvement was seen in 70.5% while 76.4% developed shock; Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 64.7% cases. Inflammatory markers showed a downward trend such as-median C- reactive protein (mg/L) had a serial reduction in levels-from (median/IQR) 210 (132.60, 246.90) at admission to 52.3 (42, 120) on Day 3.

Conclusions: Severe MIS-C has a heterogenous presentation, local or regional outbreaks of prevalent infectious diseases often lead to confusion and overdiagnosis. Higher proportion of mortality was seen in Under -5 children with MISC. Shock-like presentation, presence of myocardial dysfunction or nonsurvivor status is associated with higher trend of inflammatory markers and more profound multi-organ dysfunction.

METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study on children whose mothers participated in a randomized clinical trial to receive placebo, 150 g/day or 300 g/day of iodine until 12 months postpartum. Child neurocognitive development was assessed at 36 months of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition. Linear mixed-model analysis was preformed to assess iodine supplement dose effects on child cognitive, language, and motor functions. RESULTS: A total of 122 children provided neurodevelopmental data as follows: 300 g/d iodine group: 45; 150 g/d iodine group: 35; and placebo group: 42. Cognitive scores were higher in children whose mothers received 150 g iodine/d compared to children whose mothers received placebo [102.8 (SD 13.2) vs. 99.2 (SD 10.5); ? = 4.43, P = 0.032].

In mammalian cells, the ubiquitous palmitoyltransferases (PATs) and serine hydrolases, including acyl protein thioesterases (APTs), catalyze the addition and removal of palmitate, respectively. The attachment of palmitoyl groups alters the membrane affinity of the substrate protein changing its subcellular localization, stability, and protein-protein interactions. Forty years of research has led to the understanding of the role of protein palmitoylation in significantly regulating protein function in a variety of biological processes. Recent global profiling of immune cells has identified a large body of S-palmitoylated immunity-associated proteins. Localization of many immune molecules to the cellular membrane is required for the proper activation of innate and adaptive immune signaling. Emerging evidence has unveiled the crucial roles that palmitoylation plays to immune function, especially in partitioning immune signaling proteins to the membrane as well as to lipid rafts. More importantly, aberrant PAT activity and fluctuations in palmitoylation levels are strongly correlated with human immunologic diseases, such as sensory incompetence or over-response to pathogens. Therefore, targeting palmitoylation is a novel therapeutic approach for treating human immunologic diseases.

To better divide the blood vessel and background, the improved position attention module and channel attention module are introduced in the jumping connection part. Multiscale input and multiscale dense feature pyramid cascade modules are used to better obtain feature information.

METHODS: Between April 2013 and July 2019, 41 patients presenting with acute complicated (n = 29) or chronic (n = 12) descending thoracic aortic dissection were treated by the FET technique, which was the treatment of choice when supra-aortic vessel transposition would not suffice to create a satisfactory proximal landing zone for endovascular aortic repair, when a concomitant ascending or arch aneurysm was present, or in patients with connective tissue diseases. RESULTS: One patient (2%) died intra-operatively secondary to an aortic rupture in dwnstream aortic segments. No post-operative deaths occurred. Four patients (10%) suffered a non-disabling posto-operative stroke and were discharged with no clinical symptoms (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0, n = 1), no significant disability (mRS 1, n = 2), or with slight disability (mRS 2, n = 1). No spinal cord ischaemia was observed. The primary entry tear was either surgically resected or excluded from circulation in all patients. During follow up, one patient (2%) died after two years (not aorta related) and 16 patients (39%) underwent an aortic re-intervention after 7.7 [interquartile range 0.7, 15.8] months (endovascular aortic repair: n = 14; open thoraco-abdominal aortic replacement: n = 1, hybrid approach: n = 1). CONCLUSION: The FET technique is an effective treatment option for acute complicated and chronic Type B or non-A non-B aortic dissection in patients in whom primary endovascular aortic repair is non-feasible. While the post-operative outcome is acceptable with a relatively low incidence of non-disabling strokes, this study also underlines the considerable need for aortic re-interventions.

In some cases, seventeen (17) or more potentially toxic compounds are found in a single street purchased bag or block of cocaine or heroin. Pharmacologically active compounds, impurities, or breakdown products from drug manufacturing and industrial chemicals (collectively referred to as toxic adulterants) are now found in street drugs. They include, but are not limited to: Antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antihistamines, anthelmintics, anesthetics, anti-inflammatorys, antipyretics, analgesics, antispasmodics, antiarrhythmics, antimalarials, veterinary medications, bronchodilators, expectorants, sedatives, muscle relaxers, natural/synthetic hallucinogens, decongest- ants, new psychoactive substances (NPS), industrial compounds, fungicides, and impurities in the manufacturing process. All can be found within a single street purchase of heroin or cocaine. Routine clinical or workplace drug testing will not detect all these toxic adulterants. Only specialty forensic tests, specifically ordered, will detect them. The synergistic effect on the human body of such an unprecedented combination of pharmacologically active compounds is unknown and potentially deadly. This is especially seen in daily substance users who are exposed to these combinations multiple times a day over an extended period of time. Individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) have several co-occurring health problems that make them more susceptible to COVID-19, including compromised immune, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. These problems are high-risk factors for the acquisition of COVID-19 infection and more serious complications from the virus, including hospitalization and death. Objective: The study aims to bring to the attention of public health officials, addiction medicine specialists, treatment officials, therapists, and the general public the alarming increase of dangerous toxic adulterants being added to street drugs and their potentially lethal synergistic effects. Also, it aims to provide insights into how these new formulations can have serious pathophysiological effects on individuals with Substance Abuse Disorders (SUDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The literature on street drug cutting agents, toxic adulterants, NPS, manufacturing byproducts, and other industrial compounds will be reviewed. Also, a review of the literature of pathophysiological effects, especially on SUD patients, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic will be presented. This is combined with international and USA studies that were carried out by the Colombo Plan that identified these new combinations of toxic adulterants in street drugs, using state-of-the-art field and forensic laboratory detection technologies. Results: The majority of street drugs, in some cases more than ninety-five percent, now have multiple toxic adulterants. It is rare that a street purchase of cocaine or heroin does not contain multiple toxic adulterants, cutting agents, NPS, manufacturing byproducts, or industrial chemicals. Conclusion: This dangerous new composition in world street drug supply is unprecedented and may be the undetected cause of many psychostimulant and opioid overdose deaths, as many toxic adulter- ants are not routinely tested in post-mortem or street drug seizure cases. In addition, several of these toxic adulterants create a catastrophic drop in white blood cells, causing neutropenia and making the substance users susceptible to a wide range of opportunistic infections, including COVID-19. This profound change in the world street drug supply has catastrophic implications for individuals with SUDs and our health care system, especially in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The rapidly changing composition of the global street drug supply and its effects on high-risk groups for covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues its rapid global spread, quantification of local transmission patterns has been, and will continue to be, critical for guiding pandemic response. Understanding the accuracy and limitations of statistical methods to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0, in the context of emerging epidemics is therefore vital to ensure appropriate interpretation of results and the subsequent implications for control efforts. METHODS: Using simulated epidemic data we assess the performance of 7 commonly-used statistical methods to estimate R0 as they would be applied in a real-time outbreak analysis scenario - fitting to an increasing number of data points over time and with varying levels of random noise in the data. Method comparison was also conducted on empirical outbreak data, using Zika surveillance data from the 2015-2016 epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean. RESULTS: We find that most methods considered here frequently over-estimate R0 in the early stages of epidemic growth on simulated data, the magnitude of which decreases when fitted to an increasing number of time points. This trend of decreasing bias over time can easily lead to incorrect conclusions about the course of the epidemic or the need for control efforts. CONCLUSIONS: We show that true changes in pathogen transmissibility can be difficult to disentangle from changes in methodological accuracy and precision in the early stages of epidemic growth, particularly for data with significant over-dispersion. As localised epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 take hold around the globe, awareness of this trend will be important for appropriately cautious interpretation of results and subsequent guidance for control efforts.","output":"A comparative analysis of statistical methods to estimate the reproduction number in emerging epidemics with implications for the current COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The current scenario generated by the Covid-19 pandemic enhances the condition of food and nutrition insecurity due to the worsening of poverty, hunger and lack of access to food, as well as the excess consumption of foods considered unhealthy.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the COVID-19 infection. It is a single-stranded RNA virus in the coronavirus family (Coronaviridae) named from morphology. The SARS-CoV-2 infects human respiratory epithelial cells a thousand times more than the previous coronavirus strains and does so by interacting with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. The transmission modes include contact droplets from infected individuals, airborne transmission or indirect contacts on infected surfaces. The best way of prevention is hand and respiratory hygiene practice. As such, the transmission may be wholly or partially arrested by the universal adoption of personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE include N95 respirator masks or surgical masks, eye protectors or face shields, alcohol-based sanitizers, protective gowns, surgical caps and rubber boots. All the medical devices intended for specific PPE types must meet the standards of the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). The WHO has exceedingly recommended the use of face masks by the general populace living in the affected areas. Model simulations in the United States using COVID-19 relevant data have shown that even simple cloth masks can impede the spread of this virus and thus prevent community transmission. Various studies have attested to the fact that the use of face masks in conjunction with other practices like hand hygiene and social distancing can cause considerable benefits to the whole community. While wearing a proper elastomeric respirator, selecting the proper eye gear with the correct positioning of protection is also required along with face shields. Mass masking is only beneficial when the majority of the population-akin wears masks to herd immunity after vaccination. Amidst the spread of this pandemic, there has been increasing emphasis by medical specialists on the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and soaps for keeping the hands germ-free. Gloves as protective equipment are advised to be worn mostly by medical personnel for invasive procedures. They need to be changed after each episode of treatment or between caring for two different patients. Sustainability of PPE is also a budding trend. At present, PPE manufacturing resources are derived from polyester, polyamide, polyethylene and other polymers. In the near future, biopolymers like natural fibres for disposable PPE manufacture may overrule the market. In essence, masking and gloving can be considered to keep the harm at source, whereas sanitizing falls under mitigative strategies aimed at killing the virus. It may also be remembered that gloves are not substitutes for hand sanitizing, and sanitizers are still encouraged before and after wearing gloves. Patient care measures need to be optimized irrespective of conventional, contingency and crisis circumstances. These measures include personal protective equipment (PPE), administrative and engineering controls to be implemented in general spread of infection and regulation strategies in healthcare management. ? 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Personal Protective Equipment for COVID-19: A Comprehensive Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The preparation of a new soluble immune complex conjugate (anti-IgA-IgA-peroxidase), suitable for use in the ELISA technique is described.

The activation of NFB is strictly regulated by several posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, neddylation and ubiquitination. Several types of ubiquitination play important roles in multi-step regulations of the NFB pathway. Some of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins functioning as E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to regulate various biological processes such as inflammatory signaling pathways. One of the TRIM family proteins, TRIM39, for which the gene has single nucleotide polymorphisms, has been identified as one of the genetic factors in Behcet's disease. However, the role of TRIM39 in inflammatory signaling had not been fully elucidated. In this study, to elucidate the function of TRIM39 in inflammatory signaling, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using TRIM39 as a bait and identified Cactin, which has been reported to inhibit NFB- and TLR-mediated transcriptions. We show that TRIM39 stabilizes Cactin protein and that Cactin is upregulated after TNF stimulation. TRIM39 knockdown also causes activation of the NFB signal.

METHODS: Meta-research study. We screened the Cochrane living systematic review and network meta-analysis (COVID-NMA) database to identify all preprints and journal articles on all studies assessing interventions for COVID-19 published up to 15 August 2020. We compared all evidence sources (i.e., preprint and associated journal article) and the first and latest versions of preprints for each study to identify changes in two evidence components: study results (e.g., numeric change in hazard ratio, odds ratio, event rate, or change in p value > or < 0.05 in any outcome) and abstract conclusions (classified as positive, negative or neutral regarding the intervention effect, and as reporting uncertainty in the findings or not). Changes in study results were further classified as important changes if they (1) represented a change in any effect estimate by &#8805; 10% and/or (2) led to a change in the p value crossing the threshold of 0.05. RESULTS: We identified 556 studies. In total, 338 (61%) had been reported in a preprint: 66 (20%) of these had an associated journal article (median time to publication 76 days [interquartile range (IQR) 55-106]) and 91 (27%) had > 1 preprint version.

In aquatic mammals, anatomic and behavioral evidence of the use of taste varies by species and genomic analysis of taste receptors indicates an overall reduction and, in some cases, complete loss of intact bitter and sweet taste receptors. However, the receptors used by taste buds in the oral cavity are found on cells in other areas of the body and play an important role in immune responses. In the respiratory tract, an example of such cells is solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) which have bitter and sweet taste receptors. The bitter receptors detect chemicals given off by pathogens and initiate an innate immune response. Although many aquatic mammals may not have a role for taste in the assessment of food, they likely would benefit from the added protection that SCCs provide, especially considering respiratory diseases are a problem for many aquatic mammals. While evidence indicates that some species do not possess functional bitter receptors for taste, many do have intact bitter receptor genes and it is important for researchers to be aware of all roles for these receptors in homeostasis.

Amidst this global crisis, various controversies have been emerging about how to manage the virus, ranging from whether face masks should be required as a preventive measure to whether hydroxychloroquine is an appropriate treatment. There has been a barrage of contradictory claims related to these issues. However, in many cases, it is not possible for an individual to wait until consensus is reached before deciding on a course of action. Meanwhile, to avoid misplacing trust, trust must be well grounded. Conventional school science largely focuses on the trustworthiness of data and evidence, rather than that of the people making scientific claims. This failure to consider the human factor renders conventional school science inadequate for helping students make informed judgements about granting trust. Drawing on the literature in epistemic practice, this paper highlights four epistemic processes potentially useful for students to ground their trust, including (1) identifying whether recognition from peer reviewers has been obtained; (2) examining the credentials of those who claim expertise; (3) determining the level of expert consensus; and (4) identifying possible sources of bias. Through critical reflection on events related to the Covid-19 pandemic as examples, this paper examines how these epistemic processes inform judgement about the trustworthiness of people in terms of their competence and motives. The discussion highlights the need to develop students' capacity to identify expertise/ credentials, the nature of journals and of organisations when trust is assigned.

These models, particularly positive matrix factorization (PMF), have been extensively used for analyzing particle number concentrations (PNCs) datasets. However, the variation of observed PNCs and particle size distribution are driven by both the source emission rates and atmospheric dispersion as well as chemical and physical transformation processes. This variation in the observation data caused by meteorologically induced dilution reduces the ability to obtain accurate source apportionment results. To reduce the influence of dilution on quantitative source estimates, a methodology for improving the accuracy of source apportionment results by incorporating a measure of dispersion, the ventilation coefficient, into the PMF analysis (called dispersion normalized PMF, DN-PMF) was applied to a PNC dataset measured from a field campaign that includes the Spring Festival event and the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in Tianjin, China. The data also included pollutant gases and hourly PM2.5 compositional data. Eight factors were resolved and interpreted as municipal incinerator, traffic nucleation, secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA), traffic emission, photonucleation, coal combustion, residential heating and festival emission. The DN-PMF enhanced the diel patterns of photonucleation and the two traffic factors by enlarging the differences between daytime peak values and nighttime concentrations. The municipal incinerator plant, traffic emissions, and coal combustion have cleaner and more clearly defined directionalities after dispersion normalization. Thus, dispersion normalized PMF is capable of enhancing the source emission patterns. After the COVID-19 lockdown began, PNC of traffic nucleation and traffic emission decreased by 41% and 44%, respectively, while photonucleation produced more particles likely due to the reduction in the condensation sink. The significant changes in source emissions indicate a substantially reduced traffic volume after the implement of lockdown measures.","output":"Changes in source contributions to particle number concentrations after the COVID-19 outbreak: Insights from a dispersion normalized PMF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To summarize the clinical features and imaging findings of six coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, so as to provide evidences for early diagnosis and clinical intervention.

The frequency of abnormal pulmonary function test was 39.2% ([95% CI]: [19.8-58.6], I2=79.4%, 48/123 patients) and impaired diffusion capacity was most frequently observed in 32.8% ([95% CI]: [18.2-47.4], I2=86.2%, 93/272 patients) of patients. Restrictive pattern and obstructive pattern were observed in 10.5% ([95% CI]: [6.9-14.0], I2=0%, 31/290 patients) and 4.8% ([95% CI]: [0.9-8.6], I2=45.8%, 14/240 patients), respectively. Conclusion: This systematic review analyzed the frequency of chest CT and PFT abnormalities after hospital discharge. 61.5% and 39.2% of patients had abnormal chest CT and PFT results within a period of 3 months after hospital discharge. The most frequent PFT abnormality was impaired diffusion capacity which is potentially suggestive of residual impact of microthromboembolism in lung vasculature due to hypercoagulability.

During the second period (March 15 to December 31), both of the cities mainly disposed of imported cases (36 and 14 cases in Macau and Zhuhai) from abroad. In the third period (July 15 to December 31), the two cities gradually returned to normal work and life and economic recovery. Under dynamically adjusted prevention and control measures, the two cities have adopted a series of border control measures based on domestic and abroad changes in the COVID-19 epidemic situation. They had closely cooperated and shared information in terms of epidemic information docking, traffic control, patient care, and material guarantees. The prevention and control policies and measures are basically the same in the two cities and different in the 3 time periods. Health QR code exchange was the basis of mobility of residents between the two cities.ConclusionsBoth cities had zero tolerance for COVID-19 cases and adopted a suppression strategy to accurately grasp the changing epidemic situation at any time. There was no community transmission of local cases, and the control effect with resumption of work and personnel turnover was very obvious in the two cities.

Significant aspects of management in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the later course of aSAH such as ventilation and sedation (VST) remain unaddressed. aSAH patients present unique challenges not accounted for in general ICU recommendations and guidelines, which is why we attempted to further characterize ICU practices in aSAH patients in Germany. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey on ICU practices in aSAH in Germany. Secondarily, we assessed the existence of and compliance with current guidelines regarding ICU practices. The questionnaire was designed in interdisciplinary fashion and distributed online through the kwiksurvey(?) platform (Bristol, UK). RESULTS: A total of 50 responses were received, accounting for a response rate of 49%. Twenty-one were university hospitals (UH), 23 high-volume centers (HVC), 6 low-volume centers (LVC). Half of the participating centers do not take into consideration WFNS at presentation to indicate ventilation. While 42% of centers rely on the P/F ratio to indicate ventilation, 62% of them have a cutoff value of < 200, and 38% of < 100. While most UH and HVC used propofol for the first phase of sedation (95%), LVC employed benzodiazepines (100%). Sedation deepening was done with ketamine in UH (75%) and HVC (60%), whereas LVC used predominantly clonidine (100%).

METHODS: A retrospective review of the administrative theatre database was performed. Pre-Covid (1(st) AprilCJuly 31(st) 2019) and peri-Covid (1(st) April-31(st) July 2020) periods were examined and index cases identified. Practice and outcomes were examined. RESULTS: There was a 50% reduction in scheduled theatre sessions during the peri-Covid period. There were 100 procedures performed pre-Covid and 71 procedures performed during the peri-Covid period. The patient demographics were comparable C mean age 68-years with a male to female ratio of 1.6:1. Intervention for chronic limb threatening ischaemia was much more common in the peri-Covid period than in the pre-Covid period (94% versus 64% respectively). There was a clear change in anaesthetic practice with regional anaesthesia more commonly performed in the peri-Covid period (49% versus 12% respectively). There was no difference in the types of revascularisation performed. The 30-day mortality in the peri-Covid period was less than in the pre-Covid period (3% vs 1.4%).

An exploratory analysis in patients with CRP<150 mg/L and age<85 years was conducted to determine lenzilumab efficacy when administered prior to advanced inflammation.MethodsLIVE-AIR was a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with COVID-19 (n=520), >18 years, and 94% oxygen saturation on room air and/or requiring supplemental oxygen, but not invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), were randomized to receive lenzilumab (600 mg, n=261) or placebo (n=259) via three intravenous infusions administered 8 hours apart. Participants were followed through Day 28 following treatment.ResultsOverall, baseline demographics were comparable between treatment groups: male, 64.7%;mean age, 60.5 years;mean BMI, 32.5 kg/m2;median CRP, 79 mg/L;CRP was <150 mg/L in 78% of participants. Participants received steroids (93.7%), remdesivir (72.4%), or both (69.1%). Lenzilumab (n=159) improved the likelihood of SWOV by 3.04-fold in participants with CRP<150 mg/L and age<85 years (3.04;1.68C5.51, nominal p=0.0003) compared with placebo (n=178).

The geographic heterogeneity and associated intervention strategies highlight the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued. METHODS: Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts. RESULTS: The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020 while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020 was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4 days (95% CI: 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6 days, Wilcoxon test, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","output":"Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, March 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of covid-19 on the physical health of the worlds citizens is extraordinary by mid-May there were upward of four million cases spread across more than 180 countries The pandemics effect on mental health could be even more far-reaching At one point roughly one third of the planets population was under orders to stay home That means 2 6 billion peoplemore than were alive during World War IIwere experiencing the emotional and financial reverberations of this new coronavirus [The lockdown] is arguably the largest psychological experiment ever conducted, wrote health psychologist Elke Van Hoof of Free University of Brussels-VUB in Belgium The results of this unwitting experiment are only beginning to be calculated ? 2020, Scientific American Inc All rights reserved","output":"The biggest psychological experiment: What can the pandemic teach us about how people respond to adversity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019 the world has known about a viral pneumonia in a populous city in China, and by the first month of 2020 the outbreak of COVID-19 had been recognized, a viral disease produced by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, a month later it was declared a global pandemic On March 13, 2020, the presence of COVID-19 was officially declared in Venezuela This investigation includes the analysis of themainepidemiologicalcharacteristicsofthisdisease in Venezuela, breaking down the information from the variables of time, space, and person It concludes the study with comments on how an epidemiological outbreak control program should work ? 2020 Academia Nacional de Medicina All rights reserved","output":"Epidemiologa del COVID-19 en Venezuela, a seis meses de la denuncia de los primeros casos en China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent times, many infectious diseases have been spreading at an increasing scale and frequency There is a common agreement in the literature that our cities should be prepared in the future to react promptly to epidemics, but the way in which this preparedness should be shaped is still an open question This study aims to introduce a series of factors that should be taken into consideration in building a working framework to define and evaluate strategies for post-COVID cities Through the use of the mutual learning methodology, this contribution draws on the concept of the epidemic prevention area (EPA) defined by the International Council on Monuments and Sites-China, in collaboration with other institutions, as an urban responding system to the COVID-19 epidemic, extracting its main factors and comparing them with two European post-COVID urban strategies: The Paris en Commun and Milano 2020 Research findings highlight that three factorsdecentralization of facilities, hierarchization of the transport system and public services, and redundancy of public and semipublic functionsappeared to be particularly relevant in post-COVID cities, to promptly face future epidemic events, while improving their quality, equity, and resilience","output":"Strategies for Post-COVID Cities: An Insight to Paris En Commun and Milano 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wake-related ketamine-dependent high frequency oscillations (HFO) can be recorded in local field potentials (LFP) from cortical and subcortical regions in rodents.

Silicon probes spanning the dorsoventral aspect of the OB revealed this rhythm was strongest in ventral areas and associated with microcurrent sources about the mitral layer. Pharmacological microinfusion studies revealed dependency on excitatory-inhibitory synaptic activity, but not gap junctions.

Unfortunately, engineering proteins for improved functionality usually results in destabilization of the protein.

In fact, it was demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations are not more destabilizing than other random mutations. The stabilityCfunction trade-off is a universal phenomenon during protein evolution that has been observed with completely different types of proteins, including enzymes, antibodies, and engineered binding scaffolds. In this review, we discuss three types of strategies that have been successfully deployed to overcome this omnipresent obstacle in protein engineering approaches: (i) using highly stable parental proteins, (ii) minimizing the extent of destabilization during functional engineering (by library optimization and/or coselection for stability and function), and (iii) repairing damaged mutants through stability engineering.

METHODS: National surveillance data were used to describe PCR-confirmed cases as at 27 April 2020. We compared case characteristics by severity categories (hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death) and identified severity risk factors using multivariable regression. RESULTS: The epidemic peaked on 20 March. Of 218,652 COVID-19 cases, 45.4% were hospitalised, 4.6% were admitted to ICU and 11.9% died. Among those who died, 94.8% had at least one underlying disease. Healthcare workers (HCWs) represented 22.9% of cases. Males were more likely to have severe outcomes than females. Cardiovascular disease was a consistent risk factor. Patients with pneumonia had higher odds of hospitalisation (odds ratio (OR): 26.63; 95% confidence interval (CI): 25.03C28.33). The strongest predictor of death was age  80 years (OR: 28.4; 95% CI: 19.85C40.78). Among underlying diseases, chronic renal disease had highest odds of death (OR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.29C1.68). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 case numbers began declining 6 days after the national lockdown. The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain had a severe impact on elderly people. Patients with cardiovascular or renal conditions were at higher risk for severe outcomes. A high proportion of cases were HCWs. Enhanced surveillance and control measures in these subgroups are crucial during future COVID-19 waves.","output":"The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: characterisation of cases and risk factors for severe outcomes, as at 27 April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The risk factors for developing a severe form of COVID-19 in young children are poorly understood.

Here, the qPCR results indicated that S protein induced a significantly elevated expression of multiple inflammatory factor mRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), whereas RS-5645 ((4-(thiophen-3-yl)-1-(p-tolyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methanone) attenuated the expression of the most inflammatory factor mRNAs. RS-5645 also significantly reduced the cellular ratios of CD45+/IFN+, CD3+/IFN+, CD11b+/IFN+, and CD56+/IFN+ in human PBMCs. In addition, RS-5645 effectively inhibited the activation of inflammatory cells and reduced inflammatory damage to lung tissue in mice. Sequencing results of 16S rRNA v3+v4 in mouse alveolar lavage fluid showed that there were 494 OTUs overlapping between the alveolar lavage fluid of mice that underwent S protein+ LPS-combined intervention (M) and RS-5645-treated mice (R), while R manifested 64 unique OTUs and M exhibited 610 unique OTUs. In the alveoli of group R mice, the relative abundances of microorganisms belonging to Porphyromonas, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Neisseria increased significantly, while the relative abundances of microorganisms belonging to Psychrobacter, Shimia, and Sporosarcina were significantly diminished. The results of KEGG analysis indicated that the alveolar microbiota of mice in the R group can increase translation and reduce the activity of amino acid metabolism pathways. COG analysis results indicated that the abundance of proteins involved in ribosomal structure and biogenesis related to metabolism was augmented in the alveolar microbiota of the mice in the R group, while the abundance of proteins involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis was significantly reduced.

Alcohol consumption affects motor and proprioceptive functions, decreasing motor and cognitive functions and causing attention deficits. We aim to evaluate visual function and attention, and psychological profiles in consumer and abstainer ADS patients. METHODS This quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational study evaluates visual function in a sample of ADS patients. The Portuguese version of the Brief Symptom Inventory was used to assess patients' psychological status. The orthoptic examination protocol for visual function consisted of 11 standardized tests: VA for distance and near, ocular movements, near convergence and accommodation point, cover and prismatic cover tests, fusional vergence for distance and near, near stereoacuity, chromatic vision, contrast sensitivity and visual attention. RESULTS The sample included 176 patients. 121 were consumers and 55 were abstainers, aged between 31 and 72. The most affected parameters of visual function were visual acuity (80.39%), contrast sensitivity (67.50%), convergence at distance (66.44%) and near stereopsis (62.75%). Visual function was impacted in both groups. Regarding psychological status, consumers had higher averages for the Depression subscale, followed by Paranoid Ideation and Obsession. Abstainers had the highest averages in the Obsession subscale, followed by Paranoid Ideation and Depression. Statistically significant differences existed between the groups in the subscales for depression (p=.046) and paranoid ideation (p =.042).

As a result, we need effective vaccination that can tackle Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants that are bound to emerge. Therefore, the current study is an initiative to design a peptide-based chimeric vaccine that may potentially battle SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. As a result, the most relevant epitopes present in the mutagenic areas of Omicron spike protein were identified using a set of computational tools and immunoinformatic techniques to uncover common MHC-1, MHC-II, and B cell epitopes that may have the ability to influence the host immune mechanism. A final of three epitopes from CD8(+) T-cell, CD4(+) T-cell epitopes, and B-cell were shortlisted from spike protein, and that are highly antigenic, IFN- inducer, as well as overlapping for the construction of twelve vaccine models. As a result, the antigenic epitopes were coupled with a flexible and stable peptide linker, and the adjuvant was added at the N-terminal end to create a unique vaccine candidate. The structure of a 3D vaccine candidate was refined, and its quality was assessed by using web servers. However, the applied immunoinformatic study along with the molecular docking and simulation of 12 modeled vaccines constructs against six distinct HLAs, and TLRs (TLR2, and TLR4) complexes revealed that the V1 construct was non-allergenic, non-toxic, highly immunogenic, antigenic, and most stable. The vaccine candidate's stability was confirmed by molecular dynamics investigations. Finally, we studied the expression of the suggested vaccination using codon optimization and in-silico cloning.

In the context of COVID-19, several aspects of the relations between psychiatry and the pandemic due to the coronavirus have been described. Some drugs used as antiviral medication have neuropsychiatric side effects, and conversely some psychotropic drugs have antiviral properties. Chlorpromazine (CPZ, Largactil(?)) is a well-established antipsychotic medication that has recently been proposed to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to 1) inform health care professionals and scientists about the history of CPZ use in psychiatry and its potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 activities 2) inform psychiatrists about its potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, and 3) propose a research protocol for investigating the use of CPZ in the treatment of COVID-19 during the potential second wave. The history of CPZs discovery and development is described in addition to the review of literature from published studies within the discipline of virology related to CPZ. The early stages of infection with coronavirus are critical events in the course of the viral cycle. In particular, viral entry is the first step in the interaction between the virus and the cell that can initiate, maintain, and spread the infection. The possible mechanism of action of CPZ is related to virus cell entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, CPZ could be useful to treat COVID-19 patients provided that its efficacy is evaluated in adequate and well-conducted clinical trials. Interestingly, clinical trials of very good quality are in progress. However, more information is still needed about the appropriate dosage regimen.

We investigated the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 vaccine booster dose in patients with IBD on infliximab combination therapy. MethodsThis is prospective single center observational study conducted between January 1st, 2022 until February 28th, 2022. Patients were recruited at the time of attendance at the infusion center. Eligibility criteria included patients with confirmed diagnosis of IBD who are receiving infliximab with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and have received two or three-dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Patients were excluded if they were infected or had symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 previously since the start of the pandemic or received other vaccines than the BNT162b2. Our primary outcome was the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing antibodies 40-45 weeks from the first dose of BNT162b2 in patients with IBD receiving infliximab combination therapy. Medians with interquartile range (IQR) were calculated. Results162 patients with IBD and receiving infliximab combination therapy were recruited and the number of patients in each group was 81. Median (IQR) SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were significantly lower after the second dose [125 BAU/mL (43, 192)] compared to patients who received the third booster dose [207 BAU/mL (181, 234)] (p = 0.003). Neutralizing antibody levels were also lower after the second dose [80 BAU/mL (21, 95)] compared to patients who received the third booster dose [96 BAU/mL (93, 99)] (p = <0.001). The percentage of patients who achieved positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in the third (booster) dose group was higher (96.3%) than those in second dose group (90%)(p = 0.026).

In the current analysis, we examine the effect of PCDT in ATTRACT patients with iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis. METHODS Within a large multicenter randomized trial, 391 patients with acute deep vein thrombosis involving the iliac or common femoral veins were randomized to PCDT with anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone (No-PCDT) and were followed for 24 months to compare short-term and long-term outcomes. RESULTS Between 6 and 24 months, there was no difference in the occurrence of PTS (Villalta scale 5 or ulcer: 49% PCDT versus 51% No-PCDT; risk ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.15; P=0.59). PCDT led to reduced PTS severity as shown by lower mean Villalta and Venous Clinical Severity Scores ( P<0.01 for comparisons at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months), and fewer patients with moderate-or-severe PTS (Villalta scale 10 or ulcer: 18% versus 28%; risk ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.94; P=0.021) or severe PTS (Villalta scale 15 or ulcer: 8.7% versus 15%; risk ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.32-1.01; P=0.048; and Venous Clinical Severity Score 8: 6.6% versus 14%; risk ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.87; P=0.013). From baseline, PCDT led to greater reduction in leg pain and swelling ( P<0.01 for comparisons at 10 and 30 days) and greater improvement in venous disease-specific quality of life (Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study Quality of Life unit difference 5.6 through 24 months, P=0.029), but no difference in generic quality of life ( P>0.2 for comparisons of SF-36 mental and physical component summary scores through 24 months). In patients having PCDT versus No-PCDT, major bleeding within 10 days occurred in 1.5% versus 0.5% ( P=0.32), and recurrent venous thromboembolism over 24 months was observed in 13% versus 9.2% ( P=0.21). CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis, PCDT did not influence the occurrence of PTS or recurrent venous thromboembolism. However, PCDT significantly reduced early leg symptoms and, over 24 months, reduced PTS severity scores, reduced the proportion of patients who developed moderate-or-severe PTS, and resulted in greater improvement in venous disease-specific quality of life.

The thousands of patients who died showed pneumonia and alveolar damage, but actually, according to several authors in addition to the acute respiratory distress syndrome the virus can give rise to multiorgan failure. In fact, many people died equally despite being intubated and treated for respiratory failure. In this review, we especially wanted to describe the virus effects on the cardiovascular system, probably the leading cause of death of thousands of deceased patients. Therefore, mortality is indirectly induced by the virus through vascular inflammation and cardiovascular damage and patients with severe COVID-19 infection showed significantly increased levels of cardiac troponin I and inflammatory cytokines. The main activation of the signal pathways for the production of inflammatory cytokines are the toll-like receptors that recognize the presence of viral nucleic acids and the ACE-2 receptors, that the virus uses to infect the cells. The binding to ACE-2 also allows to promote high levels of angiotensin II by promoting high levels of blood pressure. High levels of IL-6, IL-1B and IL-8 have been associated with plaque instability and increased thrombotic risk. Furthermore IL-6 is involved in the stimulation of matrix-degrading enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases, and may contribute to the development of acute coronary syndrome.

However, there is still no conclusion about the coordination degree of healthcare resources and service utilization in China, especially in the context of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment. Based on the hierarchical analysis framework for healthcare institutions, this paper mainly analyzes the coordination level of healthcare resources of primary healthcare institutions and hospital in China's provincial scale from 2010 to 2018. Method: In this paper, the entropy-weighted TOPSIS evaluation method is used to calculate the healthcare resourcesallocation and service utilization index, the coupled coordination model is used to evaluate the coordination relationship between healthcare resource allocation and service utilization, and the exploratory spatial data analysis method is used to evaluate the spatial distribution characteristics of the coordination level and detect its impact on the surrounding spatial units and the geographic detector is used to analyze the driving factors that affect the spatial inequity of the coordination level. Results: : The coupling coordination degree of primary healthcare institutions and hospitals increased from 0.448 and 0.418 in 2010 to 0.519 and 0.534 in 2018, respectively, while the relative development degree increased from 0.469 and 0.466 in 2010 to 0.767 and 0.578 in 2018, respectively. The coupling coordination type has shifted from sligth imbalance to general coordination. The lagging situation of healthcare resources allocation has gradually improved. The coupling coordination degree basically shows the spatial distribution characteristics of higher in the eastern area, central in the central area, and lower in the border areas in the northwest, northeast, and southwest. At the same time, the spatial inequity is more obvious.The coupling coordination degree between China's healthcare resources allocation and service utilization has spatial autocorrelation, and formed hotspot and coldspot areas centered on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Tibetan Plateau respectively. The lag of healthcare resources allocation is the main reason for lowering the degree of coupling coordination between healthcare resources and service utilization in China. The spatial differentiation of coupling coordination degree is influenced by population distribution and structure, economic development level and topographical condition factors, and has obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity. These results have similarities and differences at the level of hospitals and primary medical institutions. Conclusions: : From 2010 to 2018, China's healthcare resources allocation and service utilization coupling coordination system changed from slight imbalance to general coordination. This kind of transformation is more obvious in hospitals than primary healthcare institutions. Whether it is hospitals or primary healthcare institutions, the coordination level has obvious spatial distribution characteristics and spatial inequity. The lag of healthcare resources allocation is the main reason for lowering the level of coupling coordination. This spatial inequity is affected by the distribution and structure of economic population, the level of economic development, and topographical conditions. These conclusions have similarities and differences at the level of hospitals and primary healthcare institutions.","output":"Spatial Equity and Influencing Factors of Coupling Coordination Degree of Healthcare Resources Allocation and Service Utilization in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading fast globally.

Traditional donor hierarchy favours a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (MSD) over an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD), followed by alternative donors such as haploidentical donors or unrelated cord blood. However, haploidentical HSCT (hHSCT) may be entailed with significant advantages: besides a potentially increased graft-vs.-leukaemia effect, the immediate availability of a relative as well as the possibility of a second donation for additional cellular therapies may impact on outcome. The key question in hHSCT is how, and how deeply, to deplete donor T-cells. More T cells in the graft confer faster immune reconstitution with consecutively lower infection rates, however, greater numbers of T-cells might be associated with higher rates of graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). Two different methods for reduction of alloreactivity have been established: in vivo T-cell suppression and ex vivo T-cell depletion (TCD). Ex vivo TCD of the graft uses either positive selection or negative depletion of graft cells before infusion. In contrast, T-cell-repleted grafts consisting of non-manipulated bone marrow or peripheral blood grafts require intense in vivo GvHD prophylaxis. There are two major T-cell replete protocols: one is based on post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), while the other is based on anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; Beijing protocol). Published data do not show an unequivocal benefit for one of these three platforms in terms of overall survival, non-relapse mortality or disease recurrence. In this review, we discuss the pros and cons of these three different approaches to hHSCT with an emphasis on the significance of the existing data for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","output":"T-Cell-Replete Versus ex vivo T-Cell-Depleted Haploidentical Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia and Other Haematological Malignancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telepresence robots are a real solution for remote interaction with the physical environment.

While ongoing research has illustrated the unequal impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on minority populations, research in this area has been unable to fully explain the mechanisms that produce these findings. To understand why some groups have been at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, we employ structural inequality theory to better understand how inequality may impact disease transmission in a pandemic. We used a novel approach that enabled us to focus on the microprocesses of structural inequality at the zip code level to study the impact of stay-at-home pandemic policies on COVID-19 positive case rates in an urban setting across three periods of policy implementation. We then analyzed data on traffic volume, income, race, occupation, and instances of COVID-19 positive cases for each zip code in Salt Lake County, Utah (USA) between 17 February 2020 and 12 June 2020. We found that higher income, percent white, and white-collar zip codes had a greater response to the local stay-at-home order and reduced vehicular traffic by nearly 50% during lockdown. The least affluent zip codes only showed a 15% traffic decrease and had COVID-19 rates nearly 10 times higher. At this level of granularity, income and occupation were both associated with COVID-19 outcomes across all three stages of policy implementation, while race was only predictive of outcomes after the lockdown period. Our findings illuminate underlying mechanisms of structural inequality that may have facilitated unequal COVID-19 incidence rates. This study illustrates the need for more granular analyses in policy research and adds to the literature on how structural factors such as income, race, and occupation contribute to disease transmission in a pandemic.","output":"The Role of Structural Inequality on COVID-19 Incidence Rates at the Neighborhood Scale in Urban Areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the logistic challenges faced by most countries for the production, distribution, and application of vaccines for the novel coronavirus disease~(COVID-19), social distancing~(SD) remains the most tangible approach to mitigate the spread of the virus.

In this work, we conduct a multi-objective mobility reduction rate comparison between the first and second COVID-19 waves in several localities from America and Europe using Google community mobility reports~(CMR) data.

The pathway generates multiple metabolites, with little available data on their relationships to early markers of increased metabolic disease risk in children. The aim of this study was to examine the association of multiple KYN pathway metabolites with metabolic risk markers in prepubertal Asian children. METHODS: Fasting plasma concentrations of KYN pathway metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 8-year-old children (n = 552) from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) prospective mother-offspring cohort study. The child's weight and height were used to ascertain overweight and obesity using local body mass index (BMI)-for-age percentile charts. Body fat percentage was measured by quantitative magnetic resonance. Abdominal circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol were used for the calculation of Metabolic syndrome scores (MetS). Serum triglyceride, BMI, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and abdominal circumference were used in the calculation of the Fatty liver index (FLI). Associations were examined using multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: In overweight or obese children (n = 93; 16.9% of the cohort), all KYN pathway metabolites were significantly increased, relative to normal weight children. KYN, kynurenic acid (KA), xanthurenic acid (XA), hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA) and quinolinic acid (QA) all showed significant positive associations with body fat percentage (B(95% CI) = 0.32 (0.22,0.42) for QA), HOMA-IR (B(95% CI) = 0.25 (0.16,0.34) for QA), and systolic blood pressure (B(95% CI) = 0.14(0.06,0.22) for QA). All KYN metabolites except 3-hydroxykynurenine (HK) significantly correlated with MetS (B (95% CI) = 0.29 (0.21,0.37) for QA), and FLI (B (95% CI) = 0.30 (0.21,0.39) for QA).

Notably, modern human genomes contain evolutionary information tracing back tens of thousands of years, which may help identify the viruses that have impacted our ancestorspointing to which viruses have future pandemic potential. Here, we apply evolutionary analyses to human genomic datasets to recover selection events involving tens of human genes that interact with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that likely started more than 20,000 years ago. These adaptive events were limited to the population ancestral to East Asian populations. Multiple lines of functional evidence support an ancient viral selective pressure, and East Asia is the geographical origin of several modern coronavirus epidemics. An arms race with an ancient coronavirus, or with a different virus that happened to use similar interactions as coronaviruses with human hosts, may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian populations. By learning more about our ancient viral foes, our study highlights the promise of evolutionary information to better predict the pandemics of the future. Importantly, adaptation to ancient viral epidemics in specific human populations does not necessarily imply any difference in genetic susceptibility between different human populations, and the current evidence points toward an overwhelming impact of socioeconomic factors in the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","output":"An ancient viral epidemic involving host coronavirus interacting genes more than 20,000 years ago in East Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID\\\\19 has affected more than 150 million people.

METHODS: Participants were interviewed in a semi-structured way regarding mobility, pain, recurrence of CRPS-I, quality of life, and prosthesis use. Those who reported recurrence of CRPS-I underwent physical examination. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (median age at time of amputation, 41.0 years; 40 women) participated. Longitudinal evaluation was possible in 17 participants. Thirty-seven participants (77%) reported an important improvement in mobility (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 63-87%). An important reduction in pain was reported by 35 participants (73%; 95% CI 59-83%). CRPS-I recurred in 4 of 47 participants (9%; 95% CI 3-20%), once in the residual limb and 3 times in another limb.

As oxidation of R-SH occurs rapidly by reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress is accompanied by reduced levels of free thiols. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD), in which redox imbalance may precede the onset of CKD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate associations between serum free thiols and the risk of incident CKD as defined by renal function decline and albuminuria in a population-based cohort study. METHODS: Subjects without CKD (n = 4,745) who participated in the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease (PREVEND) study, a prospective, population-based cohort study in the Netherlands, were included. Baseline protein-adjusted serum free thiols were studied for their associations with the development of CKD, defined as a composite outcome of an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73m(2), urinary 24-h albumin excretion (UAE) > 30 mg/24-h, or both. RESULTS: Median level of protein-adjusted serum free thiols at baseline was 5.14 mol/g of protein (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.50C5.75 mol/g) and median eGFR was 96 mL/min/1.73 m(2) [IQR: 85C106]. Protein-adjusted serum free thiols were significantly associated with incident CKD (hazard ratio [HR] per doubling 0.42 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36C0.52, P < 0.001), even after adjustment for traditional risk factors (HR 0.67 [95% CI: 0.47C0.94], P=0.022). In secondary analyses, the highest tertile of protein-adjusted serum free thiols was inversely associated with incident UAE >30 mg/24-h after full adjustment for confounding factors (HR per doubling 0.70 [95% CI: 0.51C0.96], P=0.028). CONCLUSION: Higher levels of serum R-SH, reflecting less oxidative stress, are associated with a decreased risk of developing CKD in subjects from the general population. This association is primarily driven by incident CKD as defined by UAE.","output":"Serum free sulfhydryl status associates with new-onset chronic kidney disease in the general population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic triggered catastrophic impacts on human life, but at the same time demonstrated positive impacts on air quality In this study, the impact of COVID-19 lockdown interventions on five major air pollutants during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods is analysed in three urban areas in Northern England: Leeds, Sheffield, and Manchester A Generalised Additive Model (GAM) was implemented to eliminate the effects of meteorological factors from air quality to understand the variations in air pollutant levels exclusively caused by reductions in emissions Comparison of lockdown with pre-lockdown period exhibited noticeable reductions in concentrations of NO (56 68C74 16%), NO2 (18 06C47 15%), and NOx (35 81C56 52%) for measured data However, PM10 and PM2 5 levels demonstrated positive gain during lockdown ranging from 21 96C62 00% and 36 24C80 31%, respectively Comparison of lockdown period with the equivalent period in 2019 also showed reductions in air pollutant concentrations, ranging 43 31C69 75% for NO, 41 52C62 99% for NOx, 37 13C55 54% for NO2, 2 36C19 02% for PM10, and 29 93C40 26% for PM2 5 Back trajectory analysis was performed to show the air mass origin during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods Further, the analysis showed a positive association of mobility data with gaseous pollutants and a negative correlation with particulate matter","output":"Changes in Air Quality Associated with Mobility Trends and Meteorological Conditions during COVID-19 Lockdown in Northern England, UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United States has recently become the country with the most reported cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).

Hypertonic citrate infusion to achieve circuit anticoagulation results in variable systemic citrate- and sodium load and increases the risk of citrate accumulation and hypernatremia. The practice of single starting calcium infusion rate for all patients puts patients at risk for clinically significant hypocalcemia if filter effluent calcium losses exceed replacement. A fixed citrate to blood flow ratio, personalized effluent and pre-calculated calcium infusion dosing based on tables derived through kinetic analysis enable providers to use continuous veno-venous hemo-diafiltration (CVVHDF)-RCA in patients with liver citrate clearance of at least 6 L/h. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective observational study conducted in intensive care unit patients triaged to be treated with the novel pre-calculated CVVHDF-RCA Non-shock protocol. RCA efficacy outcomes were time to first hemofilter loss and circuit ionized calcium (iCa) levels. Safety outcomes were surrogate of citrate accumulation (TCa/iCa ratio) and the incidence of acid-base and electrolyte complications. RESULTS: Of 53 patients included in the study, 31 (59%) had acute kidney injury and 12 (22.6%) had the diagnosis of cirrhosis at the start of CVVHDF-RCA. The median first hemofilter life censored for causes other than clotting exceeded 70 h. The cumulative incidence of hypernatremia (Na > 148 mM), metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- > 30 mM), hypocalcemia (iCa < 0.9 mM) and hypercalcemia (iCa > 1.5 mM) were 1/47 (1%), 0/50 (0%), 1/53 (2%), 1/53 (2%) respectively and were not clinically significant. The median (25thC75th percentile) of the highest TCa/iCa ratio for every 24-h interval on CKRT was 1.99 (1.91C2.13). CONCLUSIONS: The fixed citrate to blood flow ratio, as opposed to a titration approach, achieves adequate circuit iCa (< 0.4 mm/L) for any hematocrit level and plasma flow. The personalized dosing approach for calcium supplementation based on pre-calculated effluent calcium losses as opposed to the practice of one starting dose for all reduces the risk of clinically significant hypocalcemia.

Because myocardial injury is also common in other kinds of pneumonias, we investigated and compared such occurrence in severe pneumonias due to COVID\\\\19 and other causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data from 156 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation in four European tertiary hospitals, including all n = 76 COVID\\\\19 patients with severe disease course requiring at least ventilatory support, matched to n = 76 from a retrospective consecutive patient cohort of severe pneumonias of other origin (matched for age, gender, and type of ventilator therapy).

The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. RESULTS: A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean age 32.218.77 years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. SEM analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient ?=0.47, p=0.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated and ASD was associated with hostility. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the wellbeing of staff in healthcare systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care.

At present, the exact mechanisms of programmed cell death upon SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be elucidated, though there is increasing evidence suggesting that cell death pathways play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are several types of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. These distinct programs are largely controlled by the proteins of the death domain () superfamily, which play an important role in viral pathogenesis and host antiviral response. Many viruses have acquired the capability to subvert the program of cell death and evade the host immune response, mainly by virally encoded gene products that control cell signaling networks.

RESULTS: The mean TTI was not significantly different in Group 1 and Group 2 (71.02 (61.66) s vs. 101.35 (121.94) s respectively, P = 0.119). Desaturation during intubation was seen in 20 patients (15.1%). First pass success rate was achieved in 109 patients (82.6%). Twenty-one patients (15.9%) needed more than one attempt to intubate and the box had to be removed in 8 patients (6.1%) for facilitating intubation. The Mallampati score did not significantly influence either desaturation or first pass success rate. CONCLUSION: There was a non-significant increasing TTI trend in patients with a higher MP score with the use of an aerosol box. However, this did not translate to a clinically significant difference in the overall intubation outcomes.","output":"Intubation outcomes using the aerosol box during the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective, observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents of infants having medical problem face challenges of insufficient medical resources at home. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of WeChat-based telehealth services on the preoperative follow-up of infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 190 infants with CHD who underwent remote follow-up via WeChat from December 2019 to May 2020 in Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. In addition, the psychological benefits of WeChat on the parents of these infants were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 190 infants were involved in this study, including 72 cases of ventricular septal defects, 42 cases of patent ductus arteriosus, 55 cases of atrial septal defects, 3 cases of tetralogy of Fallot, 2 cases of endocardial cushion defects, 12 cases of pulmonary stenosis, 2 cases of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and 2 cases of aortic arch constriction. During the follow-up period, 48 infants who received surgical indications were hospitalized in time for surgical treatment. It was recommended that 10 infants with respiratory tract infections be treated in local hospitals through the WeChat platform. We provided feeding guidance to 28 infants with dysplasia through the WeChat platform. The psychological evaluation results of parents showed that the median score and range of Self-Rating Depression Scale scores were 42 and 32-58, respectively. Nine parents (4.7%) were clinically depressed, while the majority had mild depression. The median score and range of Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores were 44 and 31-59, respectively. Twenty parents (10.5%) had clinical anxiety, while the rest had mild anxiety. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, follow-up management and health services for infants with CHD prior to surgery through the WeChat platform were useful in identifying the state of an infant's condition as well as in identifying and relieving care pressure, anxiety and depression in the parents.","output":"Telemedicine usage via WeChat for children with congenital heart disease preoperatively during COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date very few promising leads from natural products (NP) secondary metabolites with antiviral and immunomodulatory properties have been identified for promising/potential intervention for COVID-19.

Therefore, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) aimed to analyze the situation in different countries and systematically collect all information available regarding tolerability and possible amendments in daily practice of sublingual AIT (SLIT), subcutaneous AIT (SCIT) for inhalant allergies and venom AIT. METHOD: Under the framework of the EAACI, a panel of experts in the field of AIT coordinated by the Immunotherapy Interest Group (IT IG) set-up a web-based retrospective survey (SurveyMonkey?) including 27 standardized questions on practical and safety aspects on AIT in worldwide clinical routine. RESULTS: 417 respondents providing AIT to their patients in daily routine answered the survey. For patients (without any current symptoms to suspect COVID-19), 60% of the respondents informed of not having initiated SCIT (40% venom AIT, 35% SLIT) whereas for the maintenance phase of AIT, SCIT was performed by 75% of the respondents (74% venom AIT, 89% SLIT). No tolerability concern arises from this preliminary analysis. 16 physicians reported having performed AIT despite (early) symptoms of COVID-19 and/or a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: This first international retrospective survey in atopic diseases investigated practical aspects and tolerability of AIT during the COVID-19 pandemic and gave no concerns regarding reduced tolerability under real-life circumstances.

From a biological perspective, several host proteins have received most attention as logical susceptibility targets. Specifically, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the epithelial cell receptor and acts in concert with transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Intriguingly, ACE2 can also suppress the inflammatory response and therefore may impact the severity of Covid-19 infections (from the exuberant immune response a.k.a. \\"cytokine storm\\"). We, therefore, assessed expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in Blacks versus Whites. METHODS: Archived mucosal biopsies from colonoscopic biopsies of visually normal rectal mucosa without concurrent neoplasia or inflammation were used for this study. Total mRNA was isolated and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction for ACE2, and TMPRSS2 was assessed from non-Hispanic Blacks (n = 45) and non-Hispanic Whites (n = 38). GAPDH and beta-actin were used for normalization. Multivariable analysis was performed using Analyse-IT software. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels were not altered by gender, BMI, or age. ACE2 levels were lower in Blacks than Whites achieving statistical significance in multivariable (0.51-fold, p = 0.03) but not quite in univariable (p = 0.07) analysis. This downregulation was mirrored in TMRPSS2 in both univariable (p = 0.03) and multivariable analyses (0.41-fold, p = 0.02). Moreover, there was a strong correlation between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels (r-squared = 0.78).

The aims of this trial are to evaluate the impact of the Sleeping for Two adaptation of CBT-I in pregnancy (in-person or telehealth) versus treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing symptoms of insomnia (primary outcome), as well as increasing gestational length and reducing symptoms of depression (secondary outcomes). METHODS: A two-arm, single-blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the impact of CBT-I compared to TAU among a sample of 62 pregnant women, enrolled between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation, who self-identify as experiencing insomnia. Five weekly individual sessions of CBT-I will be delivered in person or via telehealth depending on physical distancing guidelines. Assessment of insomnia diagnosis by structured interview, self-reported insomnia symptom severity and sleep problems, and sleep quantity and quality as measured by a daily diary and actigraphy will occur at 12C28 weeks of pregnancy (T1), 1 week post-treatment (T2), and 6 months postpartum (T3).

Statins are expected to attenuate inflammation in the lungs of patients with ARDS due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical investigations of the role of statin therapy have revealed contradictory results. This study aimed to investigate whether pretreatment and continuous therapy with statins in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS are associated with 28-day survival according to disease severity (mild, moderate, or severe). METHODS: Patients with sepsis-associated ARDS from the surgical intensive care were enrolled in this prospective observational investigation. ARDS was classified into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe); 28-day mortality was recorded as the primary outcome variable and organ failure was recorded as secondary outcome variable. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and the requirements for organ support were evaluated throughout the observational period to assess organ failure. RESULTS: 404 patients with sepsis-associated ARDS were enrolled in this investigation. The distribution of the ARDS subgroups was 13 %, 59 %, and 28 % for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Statin therapy improved 28-day survival exclusively in the patients with severe ARDS compared with patients without statin therapy (88.5 % and 62.5 %, respectively; P = 0.0193). To exclude the effects of several confounders, we performed multivariate Cox regression analysis, which showed that statin therapy remained a significant covariate for mortality (hazard ratio, 5.46; 95 % CI, 1.38C21.70; P = 0.0156). Moreover, after carrying a propensity score-matching in the severe ARDS cohort, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed the improved 28-day survival among patients with statin therapy (P = 0.0205). Patients with severe ARDS who received statin therapy had significantly more vasopressor-free days compared with those without statin therapy (13  7 and 9  7, respectively; P = 0.0034), and they also required less extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy and had more ECMO-free days (18  9 and 15  9, respectively; P = 0.0873).

Associations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality and 18 neighbourhood-level measures of immigration, race, housing and socio-economic characteristics were estimated with Poisson generalized linear mixed models. Housing characteristic variables were subsequently added to models to explore if housing may have a confounding influence on the relationships between immigration, race, and socio-economic status and COVID-19 incidence. Results There were large inequities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality across the socio-demographic variables examined. Neighbourhoods having a higher proportion immigrants, racialized populations, large households and low socio-economic status were associated with COVID-19 risk.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Crucial treatments were delayed for many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, over concerns for hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections. To protect cancer patients whose survival depended on timely surgery, a \\"COVID-minimal pathway\\" was created. METHODS: Patients who underwent a surgical procedure on the pathway between April and May 2020 were evaluated. The \\"COVID-minimal surgical pathway\\" consisted of: (A) evolving best-practices in COVID-19 transmission-reduction, (B) screening patients and staff, (C) preoperative COVID-19 patient testing, (D) isolating pathway patients from COVID-19 patients. Patient status through 2 weeks from discharge was determined as a reflection of hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: After implementation, pathway screening processes excluded 7 COVID-19-positive people from interacting with pathway (4 staff and 3 patients). Overall, 122 patients underwent 125 procedures on pathway, yielding 83 admissions (42 outpatient procedures). The median age was 64 (56-79) and 57% of patients were female. The most common surgical indications were cancer affecting the uterus, genitourinary tract, colon, lung or head and neck. The median length of admission was 3 days (1-6). Repeat COVID-19 testing performed on 27 patients (all negative), including 9 patients evaluated in an emergency room and 8 readmitted patients.

METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 30 patients from across the UK at baseline, prior to random allocation to either carvedilol or variceal band ligation. Twenty patients were interviewed a second time at 6-month follow-up. Five patients who declined the trial were also interviewed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There was no clear preference for either treatment pathway at baseline. Key factors reported by patients to influence their treatment preference included: negative experiences with key treatment processes; how long-term or short-term treatment was perceived to be; treatment misconceptions; concerns around polypharmacy and worries around treatment adherence. Patient treatment experience was influenced by their perceptions of treatment effectiveness; clinical surveillance; clinician interaction and communication, or lack thereof.

METHODS: We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n=354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool RESULTS: LDA topics generated in the early months of the data set corresponded to major COVID-19-specific events However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted toward US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates Finally, VADER sentiment analysis scores of user timelines were initially high and stable but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment Increased use rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media use on mental health, social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term for many individuals Thus, considering the overburdened US mental health care structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts","output":"Social Media Insights Into US Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Analysis of Twitter Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this study is to compare the financial performance of public hospitals according to ownership and size.

The study was based on an analysis of the hospitals financial situation (using debt and solvency ratios) and its relationship to the founding body and size. The verification of hypotheses was carried out using the MannCWhitney U test. The results led to the conclusion that the vast majority of public hospitals are indebted, and their ownership structure does not affect their financial condition. The study did not confirm a significant relationship between size or ownership and the financial status of the hospital.

Current techniques for RFA estimation (electrical impedance tomography, Nakagami ultrasound, etc.) require long compute times ( 2 s) and measurement devices other than the RFA device. This study aims to determine if a neural network (NN) can estimate ablation lesion depth for control of bipolar RFA using complex electrical impedance - since tissue electrical conductivity varies as a function of tissue temperature - in real time using only the RFA therapy device's electrodes. METHODS Three-dimensional, cubic models comprised of beef liver, pork loin or pork belly represented target tissue. Temperature and complex electrical impedance from 72 data generation ablations in pork loin and belly were used for training the NN (403 s on Xeon processor). NN inputs were inquiry depth, starting complex impedance and current complex impedance. Training-validation-test splits were 70%-0%-30% and 80%-10%-10% (overfit test). Once the NN-estimated lesion depth for a margin reached the target lesion depth, RFA was stopped for that margin of tissue. RESULTS The NN trained to 93% accuracy and an NN-integrated control ablated tissue to within 1.0 mm of the target lesion depth on average. Full 15-mm depth maps were calculated in 0.2 s on a single-core ARMv7 processor. CONCLUSIONS The results show that a NN could make lesion depth estimations in real-time using less in situ devices than current techniques. With the NN-based technique, physicians could deliver quicker and more precise ablation therapy.","output":"Real-time estimation of lesion depth and control of radiofrequency ablation within ex vivo animal tissues using a neural network."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-standing systemic social, economic, and environmental inequities in the United States have put many communities of color (racial and ethnic minority groups) at increased risk for exposure to and infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as well as more severe COVID-19-related outcomes (1-3). Because race and ethnicity are missing for a proportion of reported COVID-19 cases, counties with substantial missing information often are excluded from analyses of disparities (4). Thus, as a complement to these case-based analyses, population-based studies can help direct public health interventions. Using data from the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), CDC identified counties where five racial and ethnic minority groups (Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic], non-Hispanic Black or African American [Black], non-Hispanic Asian [Asian], non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native [AI/AN], and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander [NH/PI]) might have experienced high COVID-19 impact during April 1-December 22, 2020. These counties had high 2-week COVID-19 incidences (>100 new cases per 100,000 persons in the total population) and percentages of persons in five racial and ethnic groups that were larger than the national percentages (denoted as \\"large\\"). During April 1-14, a total of 359 (11.4%) of 3,142 U.S. counties reported high COVID-19 incidence, including 28.7% of counties with large percentages of Asian persons and 27.9% of counties with large percentages of Black persons. During August 5-18, high COVID-19 incidence was reported by 2,034 (64.7%) counties, including 92.4% of counties with large percentages of Black persons and 74.5% of counties with large percentages of Hispanic persons. During December 9-22, high COVID-19 incidence was reported by 3,114 (99.1%) counties, including >95% of those with large percentages of persons in each of the five racial and ethnic minority groups. The findings of this population-based analysis complement those of case-based analyses. In jurisdictions with substantial missing race and ethnicity information, this method could be applied to smaller geographic areas, to identify communities of color that might be experiencing high potential COVID-19 impact. As areas with high rates of new infection change over time, public health efforts can be tailored to the needs of communities of color as the pandemic evolves and integrated with longer-term plans to improve health equity.","output":"Counties with High COVID-19 Incidence and Relatively Large Racial and Ethnic Minority Populations - United States, April 1-December 22, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to react to COVID-19 and is intended to transcend the regular thoughts to deeper issues towards humanity and nature.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Clinic closure was appraised as stressful due to uncertainty and threat to the attainability of the parenthood goal but patients were able to cope using strategies that fit the uncertainty of the situation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Psychological research on COVID-19 suggests that people are more anxious than historical norms and moderately to extremely upset about fertility treatment cancellation owing to COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was of cross-sectional design, comprising a mixed-methods, English language, anonymous, online survey posted from April 09 to April 21 to social media. Eligibility criteria were being affected by COVID-19 fertility clinic closure, 18 years of age or older and able to complete the survey in English. In total, 946 people clicked on the survey link, 76 did not consent, 420 started but did not complete survey, and 450 completed (48% completion, 446 women, four men). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Overall 74.7% (n = 336) of respondents were residents in the UK with an average age of 33.6 years (SD = 4.4) and average years trying to conceive, 3.5 years (SD = 2.22). The survey comprised quantitative questions about the intensity of cognitive appraisals and emotions about clinic closure, and ability to cope with clinic closure. Open-text questions covered their understanding of COVID-19 and its effect on reproductive health and fertility plans, concerns and perceived benefits of clinic closure, and knowledge about closure. Sociodemographic information was collected. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used on quantitative data. Thematic qualitative analysis (inductive coding) was performed on the textual data from each question. Deductive coding grouped themes from each question into meta-themes related to cognitive stress and coping theory. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Most patients (81.6%, n = 367) had tests or treatments postponed, with these being self (41.3%, n = 186) or publicly (46.4%, n = 209) funded. Patients appraised fertility clinic closure as having potential for a more negative than positive impact on their lives, and to be very or extremely uncontrollable and stressful (p  .001). Most reported a slight to moderate ability to cope with closure. Data saturation was achieved with all open-text questions, with 33 broad themes identified and four meta-themes linked to components of the cognitive stress and coping theory. First, participants understood clinic closure was precautionary due to unknown effects of COVID-19 but some felt clinic closure was unfair relative to advice about getting pregnant given to the public. Second, closure was appraised as a threat to attainability of the parenthood goal largely due to uncertainty of the situation (e.g., re-opening, effect of delay) and intensification of pre-existing hardships of fertility problems (e.g., long time waiting for treatment, history of failed treatment). Third, closure taxed personal coping resources but most were able to cope using thought-management (e.g., distraction, focusing on positives), getting mentally and physically fit for next treatments, strengthening their social network, and keeping up-to-date. Finally, participants reported more negative than positive emotions (p  .001) and almost all participants reported stress, worry and frustration at the situation, while some expressed anger and resentment at the unfairness of the situation. Overall, 11.9% were not at all able to cope, with reports of intense feelings of hopelessness and deteriorating wellbeing and mental health. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The survey captures patient reactions at a specific point in time, during lockdown and before clinics announced re-opening. Participants were self-selected (e.g., UK residents, women, 48% starting but not completing the survey), which may affect generalisability. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Fertility stakeholders (e.g., clinics, patient support groups, regulators, professional societies) need to work together to address the great uncertainty from COVID-19. This goal can be met proactively by setting up transparent processes for COVID-19 eventualities and signposting to information and coping resources. Future psychological research priorities should be on identifying patients at risk of distress with standardised measures and developing digital technologies appropriate for the realities of fertility care under COVID-19.

Previous studies addressing this question have used standard methods that may lead to biased estimates when analysing hospital data because of the presence of competing events and event-related dependency. We investigated the association of ACEIs/ARBs use with COVID-19 disease outcomes using time-to-event data in a multistate setting to account for competing events and minimise bias. SETTING: Nationwide surveillance data from 119 Belgian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Medical records of 10 866 patients hospitalised from 14 March 2020to 14 June 2020 with a confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection and information about ACEIs/ARBs use. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Multistate, multivariate Cox-Markov models were used to estimate the hazards of patients transitioning through health states from admission to discharge or death, along with transition probabilities calculated by combining the baseline cumulative hazard and regression coefficients. RESULTS: After accounting for potential confounders, there was no discernable association between ACEIs/ARBs use and transfer to intensive care unit (ICU). Contrastingly, for patients without ICU transfer, ACEIs/ARBs use was associated with a modest increase in recovery (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13, p=0.027) and reduction in fatality (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.93, p=0.001) transitions. For patients transferred to ICU admission, no evidence of an association between ACEIs/ARBs use and recovery (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.38, p=0.098) or in-hospital death (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12, p=0.381) was observed. Male gender and older age were significantly associated with higher risk of ICU admission or death. Chronic cardiometabolic comorbidities were also associated with less recovery. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, a multistate model was used to address magnitude and direction of the association of ACEIs/ARBs use on COVID-19 progression. By minimising bias, this study provided a robust indication of a protective, although modest, association with recovery and survival.","output":"Insights into the association of ACEIs/ARBs use and COVID-19 prognosis: a multistate modelling study of nationwide hospital surveillance data from Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microbial infections have long been of concern to scientists using laboratory rodents because of their potential to confound and invalidate research. With the explosion of genetically engineered mice (GEM), new concerns over the impact of microbial agents have emerged because these rodents in many cases are more susceptible to disease than their inbred or outbred counterparts. Moreover, interaction between microbe and host and the resulting manifestation of disease conceivably differ between GEM and their inbred and outbred counterparts. As a result, infections may alter the GEM phenotype and confound interpretation of results and conclusions about mutated gene function. In addition, because GEM are expensive to produce and maintain, contamination by pathogens or opportunists has severe economic consequences. This review addresses how microbial infections may influence phenotype, how immunomodulation of the host as the result of induced mutations may modify host susceptibility to microbial infections, how novel host:microbe interactions have led to the development of new animal models for disease, how phenotype changes have led to the discovery of new pathogens, and new challenges associated with prevention and control of microbial infections in GEM. Although the focus is on naturally occurring infections, extensive literature on the use of GEM in studies of microbial pathogenesis also exists, and the reader is referred to this literature if microbial infection is a suspected culprit in phenotype alteration.","output":"Microbial Considerations in Genetically Engineered Mouse Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a novel viral pneumonia (COVID-19), which is rapidly spreading throughout the world. The positive result of nucleic acid test is a golden criterion to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the detection features remain unclear.METHODSWe performed a retrospective analysis in 5630 high-risk individuals receiving SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in Wuhan, China, and investigated their characteristics and diagnosis rates.RESULTSThe overall diagnosis rate was 34.7% (1952/5630). Male (P = 0.025) and older populations (P = 2.525  10-39) were at significantly higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. People were generally susceptible, and most cases concentrated in people of 30-79 years. Furthermore, we investigated the association between diagnosis rate and the amount of testing in 501 subjects. Results revealed a 1.27-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 35.5%) of diagnosis rate from testing once to twice (P = 5.847  10-9) and a 1.43-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 39.9%) from testing once to 3 times (P = 7.797  10-14). More than 3 testing administrations was not helpful for further improvement. However, this improvement was not observed in subjects with pneumonia (P = 0.097).CONCLUSIONAll populations are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and male and older-aged populations are at significantly higher risk. Increasing the amount of testing could significantly improve diagnosis rates, except for subjects with pneumonia. It is recommended to test twice in those high-risk individuals whose results are negative the first time, and performing 3 tests is better, if possible.FUNDINGThis work was supported by National Mega Project on Major Infectious Disease Prevention (no. 2017ZX10103005-007) and National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2018YFE0204500).","output":"Characteristics and diagnosis rate of 5630 subjects receiving SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests from Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence that intestinal microbiota play a role in diverse metabolic processes via intestinal butyrate production. Based on bariatric surgery data in humans it has been suggested that the gut-brain axis is also involved in this process, however the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. DESIGN: We therefore compared the effect of fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) donors versus oral butyrate supplementation on (123I-FP-CIT determined) brain dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) binding as well as stable isotope determined insulin sensitivity at baseline and after 4 weeks in 24 male and female treatment-na?ve metabolic syndrome subjects. Also, plasma metabolites and fecal microbiota were determined at these timepoints. RESULTS: We observed an increase in brain DAT upon donor FMT compared to oral butyrate that reduced this binding. However, no effect on body weight and insulin sensitivity was seen upon post-RYGB donor feces transfer in either humans with metabolic syndrome. In line, increases in fecal levels of Bacteroides uniformis were significantly associated with an increase in DAT whereas increases in Prevotella spp. showed an inverse association. Furthermore, changes in the plasma metabolites glycine, betaine, methionine and lysine (associated with the S-adenosylmethionine cycle) were also associated with altered striatal DAT expression. CONCLUSION: Although more and larger studies are needed, our data suggest a potential gut microbiota-driven modulation of brain dopamine and serotonin transporters in human obese metabolic syndrome subjects.

Key to this has been the use of cutting-edgetechnological advances in DNA and RNA sequencing, allowing identification of changes in theviral genome sequence as the infection spreads. This approach has allowed a widespread genomicepidemiology approach to infection control, whereby viral transmission (e.g. in healthcare settings)can be detected not only by epidemiological assessment, but also by identifying similarities betweenviral sub-typesamong individuals.

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are crucial intermediaries of the several cellular pathways and carcinogenesis that directly affect the prognosis and survival of higher tumor grade patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are efficacious drugs for targeted therapy of various cancers. Therefore, RTKs have become a promising therapeutic target to cure cancer. A recent report shows that TKIs are vital mediators of signal transduction and cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.

Investigating the potential association of climate and seasonality with the spread of this infection could aid in preventive and surveillance strategies. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of climate with the spread of COVID-19 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study examined climate data from 50 cities worldwide with and without substantial community spread of COVID-19. Eight cities with substantial spread of COVID-19 (Wuhan, China; Tokyo, Japan; Daegu, South Korea; Qom, Iran; Milan, Italy; Paris, France; Seattle, US; and Madrid, Spain) were compared with 42 cities that have not been affected or did not have substantial community spread. Data were collected from January to March 10, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Substantial community transmission was defined as at least 10 reported deaths in a country as of March 10, 2020. Climate data (latitude, mean 2-m temperature, mean specific humidity, and mean relative humidity) were obtained from ERA-5 reanalysis. RESULTS: The 8 cities with substantial community spread as of March 10, 2020, were located on a narrow band, roughly on the 30 N to 50 N corridor. They had consistently similar weather patterns, consisting of mean temperatures of between 5 and 11 C, combined with low specific humidity (3-6 g/kg) and low absolute humidity (4-7 g/m(3)). There was a lack of substantial community establishment in expected locations based on proximity. For example, while Wuhan, China (30.8 N) had 3136 deaths and 80 757 cases, Moscow, Russia (56.0 N), had 0 deaths and 10 cases and Hanoi, Vietnam (21.2 N), had 0 deaths and 31 cases. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the distribution of substantial community outbreaks of COVID-19 along restricted latitude, temperature, and humidity measurements was consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus. Using weather modeling, it may be possible to estimate the regions most likely to be at a higher risk of substantial community spread of COVID-19 in the upcoming weeks, allowing for concentration of public health efforts on surveillance and containment.","output":"Temperature, Humidity, and Latitude Analysis to Estimate Potential Spread and Seasonality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radical-mediated difunctionalization of alkenes provides a promising approach to introduce one alkenyl or alkynyl group to target compounds.

Effect size and standardized response mean values were 0.53 and 0.63, respectively, whereas the minimal clinically important difference ranged from 5.5 to 8.5 in patients with chronic low back pain. Internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) ranged from 0.79 to 0.95. The results also showed that the PSEQ has low to moderate correlations with measures of quality of life, disability, pain, pain interference, anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing. Finally, the PSEQ has been adapted and validated in 14 languages. Overall, the results demonstrate that the PSEQ has excellent validity, reliability, and responsiveness. Further high-quality studies are needed to determine responsiveness in populations other than chronic low back pain.","output":"Measurement properties of the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire in populations with musculoskeletal disorders: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Medical solider readiness processing (SRP) needed to continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a rapid practice improvement project to allow for a hybrid virtual medical SRP/in-person medical SRP to decrease exposure risk. A retrospective review comparing this virtual SRP to a historical in-person SRP cohort to the same combatant command was then performed. PROCEDURES: A virtual medical SRP was completed for 204 soldiers in preparation for deployment within 24 hours of receiving the deployment roster. Each soldier had their MEDPROS data sheet printed and reviewed for deficiencies. Soldiers were then divided into two groups. Group 1 required hybrid SRP with need for in-person labs or vaccinations. Group 2 had no deficiencies noted on MEDPROS review, and the entire medical SRP was done virtually. Pre-deployment health assessment (pre-DHA) was completed over the phone for both groups. The provider then determined whether the soldier was a GO or NO GO, and this information was passed to the units medical staff. Comparative data analysis was performed using t-tests assuming unequal variances and chi-square tests. INFORMATION FOUND: A total of 204 soldiers were expected to complete the virtual SRP process. Of those 204, 191 MEDPROS records were reviewed (93%). Seventy-seven of the 191 soldiers (40%) required level one labs and immunizations, had not completed their pre-DHA, or had a combination of these factors. One hundred and fourteen soldiers (60%) had these items completed and were given virtual appointments in GENESIS. One hundred and six of the 114 (95%) soldiers were able to complete their medical SRP virtually. Eighty-six soldiers (80%) of this cohort were a GO for deployment at the end of their virtual SRP visit. The novel virtual SRP process was comparable to the historic in-person SRP as evidenced by no statistically significant difference in terms of the number of providers required and the number of soldiers that was seen by any one provider. The groups did show statistically significant differences based on age, gender, and GOs/NO GOs. CONCLUSION: This is the first proof of concept of a virtual medical SRP on literature review. A virtual SRP process that combines a pre-visit record review with a virtual pre-DHA is a viable process for SRP. The ability to utilize providers outside of a confined location or post may allow for optimized utilization of this scarce resource and result in cost savings to the Army. The recreation of this virtual medical SRP within other Army installations may allow for the improvement and standardization of the medical SRP process as a whole.","output":"Retrospective Review of a Novel Virtual Medical Soldier Readiness Processing Process in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glucocorticoid (GC) usage is the most common non-traumatic cause of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ON). Despite the strong association of GC with ON, the underlying mechanisms have been unclear. Investigators have proposed both direct and indirect effects of GC on cells. Indirect and direct mechanisms remain intimately related and often result in positive feedback loops to potentiate the disease processes. However, the direct effects, in particular apoptosis, have recently been shown to be increasingly important. Suppression of osteoblast and osteoclast precursor production, increased apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes, prolongation of the lifespan of osteoclasts and apoptosis of endothelial cells (EC) are all direct effects of GC usage. Elevated blood pressure through several pathways may raise the risk of clot formation. High-dose GC also decreases tissue plasminogen activator activity (t-PA) and increases plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen levels increasing the procoagulant potential of GC. Inhibited angiogenesis, altered bone repair and nitric oxide metabolism can also result. Also, GC treatment modulates other vasoactive mediators such as endothelin-1, noradrenalin and bradykinin. Thus, GCs act as a regulator of local blood flow by modulating vascular responsiveness to vasoactive substances. Vasoconstriction induced in intraosseous femoral head arteries causes femoral head ischemia. GCs also cause ischemia through increased intraosseous pressure, which subsequently decreases the blood flow to the femoral head by apoptosis of ECs as well as elevating the level of adipogenesis and fat hypertrophy in the bone marrow. It is difficult to predict which patients receiving a specific dose of GC will develop ON, indicating individual differences in steroid sensitivity and the potential of additional mechanisms. The textbook model of ON is a multiple hit theory in which, with a greater number of risk factors, the risk of ON increases. While more effort is needed to better comprehend the role of GC in ON, newer data on GC action upon the endothelial cell and the regional endothelial bed dysfunction theory sheds new light on particular GC mechanisms. Better understanding of GC pathomechanisms can lead to better treatment options.","output":"Glucocorticoids in osteonecrosis of the femoral head: A new understanding of the mechanisms of action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID 19 has changed the practice of surgery vividly all over the world. Pediatric surgery is not an exception. Prioritization protocols allowing us to provide emergency surgical care to the children in need while controlling the pandemic spread. The aim of this study is to share our experiences with the outcome of children with COVID 19 who had a co existing surgical emergency. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study. We reviewed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data of all patients admitted in our surgery department through the emergency department and later diagnosed to have COVID 19 by RT PCR. The study duration was 3 months (April 2020 to June 2020). A nasopharyngeal swab was taken from all patients irrespective of symptoms to detect SARS CoV 2 by RT PCR with the purpose of detecting asymptomatic patients and patients with atypical symptoms. Emergency surgical services were provided immediately without delay and patients with positive test results were isolated according to the hospital protocol. We divided the test positive patients into 4 age groups for the convenience of data analysis. Data were retrieved from hospital records and analyzed using SPSS (version 25) software. Ethical permission was taken from the hospital ethical review board. Results: Total patients were 32. Seven (21.9%) of them were neonates. Twenty four (75%) patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was acute abdomen followed by infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), myelomeningocele, and intussusception. Only two patients had mild respiratory symptoms (dry cough). Fever was present in 13 (40.6%) patients. Fourteen (43.8%) patients required surgical treatment. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.5 days. One neonate with ARM died in the postoperative ward due to cardiac arrest. No patient had hypoxemia or organ failure. Seven health care workers (5.51%) including doctors & nurses got infected with SARS Co V2 during this period. Conclusion: Our study has revealed a milder course of COVID 19 in children with minimal infectivity even when present in association with emergency surgical conditions. This might encourage a gradual restart to mitigate the impact of COVID 19 on children surgery.

Given the high prevalence of obesity, and growing numbers of bariatric-metabolic surgeries performed, primary care physicians increasingly encounter patients who have had, or are considering, bariatric-metabolic surgery. OBJECTIVE The aim of this article is to provide guidance on common issues pertaining to bariatric-metabolic surgery that general practitioners (GPs) face, including patient selection, preoperative work-up, acute and long-term complications following the surgery, and long-term lifestyle and nutritional support. DISCUSSION In properly selected patients with clinically severe obesity, there is clear net benefit in terms of improved health outcomes and reduced mortality following bariatric-metabolic surgery. Similarly to other chronic conditions, GPs play a crucial role in the management of obesity, and in the multidisciplinary, long-term postoperative support and monitoring that is important for optimal outcomes after surgery.","output":"Bariatric-metabolic surgery: A guide for the primary care physician."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Retailers and their supply-chain partners should reconsider their competitive advantages in today's technology-enhanced environment and search for opportunities to collaborate. Mobile applications have emerged as a special form of e-commerce that provide convenience for consumers by saving time and effort. In the pandemic days, people prefer using mobile applications in particular to order food from restaurants and protect themselves from COVID-19. Even though there are many previous studies regarding mobile application usage, they have investigated the antecedents of mobile app adoption. Today, consumers already have adopted them, yet there is a need to understand the outcomes of mobile application usage, especially for mobile food-ordering apps (MFOAs). To fill this gap, this study first positions the MFOAs among other mobile food applications regarding their business models. Then, a structural model was developed and tested by focusing on the outcomes of MFOA usage. A survey of 217 participants was conducted, and the data were analyzed using partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM). The main contribution of the results is the finding that MFOA satisfaction plays a critical role in developing restaurants' brand satisfaction and loyalty. Thus, brands should cooperate with MFOA providers.","output":"Role of mobile food-ordering applications in developing restaurants brand satisfaction and loyalty in the pandemic period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While opioid use disorder (OUD) is prevalent, little is known about what patients with OUD in sustained remission think about the chronic disease model of OUD and their perspectives of the cause, course, and ongoing treatment needs of their OUD. OBJECTIVE: To (1) examine patient perceptions of the chronic disease model of addiction and disease identity and (2) use an explanatory model framework to explore how these perceptions inform ongoing treatment needs and help maintain abstinence. DESIGN: Qualitative study of a cross-sectional cohort of patients with OUD in long-term sustained remission currently receiving methadone or buprenorphine. Participants completed a single in-depth, semi-structured individual interview. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty adults were recruited from two opioid treatment programs and two office-based opioid treatment programs in Baltimore, MD. Half of the participants were Black, had a median (IQR) age of 46.5 (43C52) years and the median (IQR) time since the last non-prescribed opioid was 12 (8C15) years. APPROACH: Hybrid deductive-inductive thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews. KEY RESULTS: Some participants described a chronic OUD disease identity where they continue to live with OUD. Participants who maintain an OUD identity describe inherent traits or predetermination of developing OUD. Maintaining a disease identity helps them remain vigilant against returning to drug use. Others described a post-OUD/survivor identity where they no longer felt they had OUD, but the experience remains. Each perspective informed attitudes about continued treatment with methadone or buprenorphine and strategies to remain in remission. CONCLUSIONS: The identity that people with OUD in sustained remission maintain was the lens through which they viewed other aspects of their OUD including cause and ongoing treatment needs. An alternative, post-OUD/survivorship model emerged or was accepted by participants who did not identify as currently having OUD. Understanding patient perspectives of OUD identity might improve patient-centered care and improve outcomes.

As these systems got overwhelmed with the emergency care of the infected patients, widespread cancellations of elective surgery occurred. Our hospital utilised local private hospital as a dedicated cold site (CS) for urgent elective surgery during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to analyse the outcomes at this dedicated cold site. METHOD: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all the cases operated at the CS during a 2-month period (30 March 2020 to 29 May 2020) was carried out. The primary outcome was 30-day COVID-19 related mortality. The secondary outcomes were 30-day non-COVID-19 related mortality, complications, readmission and development of COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 153 patients were operated on at the CS over the study period with a median age of 57 years (Interquartile range, IQR 47C70). 62% were females and 82% had a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 30.73% of the operations were performed for cancer. 59% of the surgeries were graded as intermediate and 26% as major or complex. There was no mortality at 30 days from COVID-19 or non COVID-19 causes. There was only 1 (0.65%) readmission. 7 patients (4.57%) developed complications. 1 (0.65%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the postoperative period while 3 had COVID-19 symptoms but were tested negative.

Among different RES, solar PV is receiving major focus as it is most abundant in nature compared to others, complimented by falling prices of PV technology. However, variable, intermittent and non-synchronous nature of PV power generation technology introduces several technical challenges, ranging from short-term issues, such as low inertia, frequency stability, voltage stability and small signal stability, to long-term issues, such as unit commitment and scheduling issues. Therefore, such technical issues often limit the amount of non-synchronous instantaneous power that can be securely accommodated by a grid. In this backdrop, this research work proposes a tool to estimate maximum PV penetration level that a given power system can securely accommodate for a given unit commitment interval. The proposed tool will consider voltage and frequency while estimating maximum PV power penetration of a system. The tool will be useful to a system operator in assessing grid stability and security under a given generation mix, network topology and PV penetration level. Besides estimating maximum PV penetration, the proposed tool provides useful inputs to the system operator which will allow the operator to take necessary actions to handle high PV penetration in a secure and stable manner.","output":"A New Tool to Assess Maximum Permissible Solar PV Penetration in a Power System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common sleep disorder. Severe OSAS defined as apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)  30/h is a risk factor for developing cerebro-cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms of how repetitive sleep apneas/hypopneas damage cerebral hemodynamics are still not well understood. In this study, changes in blood volume (BV) and oxygen saturation (StO2) in the left forehead of 29 newly diagnosed severe OSAS patients were measured by frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy during an incremental continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration protocol together with polysomnography. The coefficients of variation of BV (CV-BV) and the decreases of StO2 (de-StO2) of more than 2000 respiratory events were predicted using linear mixed-effect models, respectively. We found that longer events and apneas rather than hypopneas induce larger changes in CV-BV and stronger cerebral desaturation. Respiratory events occurring during higher baseline StO2 before their onsets, during rapid-eye-movement sleep and those associated with higher heart rate induce smaller changes in CV-BV and de-StO2. The stepwise increased CPAP pressures can attenuate these changes. These results suggest that in severe OSAS the length and the type of respiratory event rather than widely used AHI may be better parameters to indicate the severity of cerebral hemodynamic changes.","output":"Predictors of changes in cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during obstructive sleep apnea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic has changed the world of education where the learning process is done remotely by using an online learning system (online) which is done at home.

The study also examined if any associations remained across the two timepoints of pregnancy and postpartum. METHODS: Women were interviewed during their first visit to one of three Australian public hospital antenatal clinics and re-interviewed at home six months after giving birth. A total of 1111 women completed both interviews, 583 were born in conflict-affected countries and 528 born in Australia. Associations between attitudes towards gender roles and mens use of IPV, socio-demographic characteristics and reported actual experiences of IPV were examined using bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Attitudes toward inequitable gender roles including those that condone mens use of IPV, and prevalence of IPV, were significantly higher (p<0.001) among women born in conflict-affected countries compared to Australia-born women. Women born in conflict-affected countries with the strongest held attitudes towards gender roles and mens use of IPV had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 3.18 for IPV at baseline (95% CI 1.85C5.47) and an aOR of 1.83 for IPV at follow-up (95% CI 1.11C3.01).

Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro, which has led to off-label use, but clinical in-vivo efficacy has not been previously described. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in South Florida with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 between March 15, 2020 through May 11, 2020. 280 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 173 were treated with ivermectin and 107 with usual care, were reviewed. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the treating physicians. Severe pulmonary involvement at baseline was defined as need for either FiO2 50%, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included subgroup mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates for patients requiring invasive ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to adjust for confounders. Findings: Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (150% versus 252%, OR 052, CI 029-096, P=003). Mortality was also lower among patients with severe pulmonary involvement treated with ivermectin (388% vs 807%, OR 015, CI 005-047, p=0001), but there were no significant differences in successful extubation rates (361% vs 154%, OR 311 (088-1100), p=007) or length of stay.

Several months later, and with new safety precautions in place, elective surgery gradually resumed. However, no data exist on the safety of plastic surgery during the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: This aim of this survey was to assess the safety of plastic surgery during the pandemic by quantifying: (1) the preoperative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2; (2) the risk of postoperative COVID-19; (3) outcomes and precious resource utilization for such cases; and (4) the risks to office staff. METHODS: Los Angeles plastic surgeons certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) were sent an online survey in July 2020, during a local COVID-19 surge, querying about the number of procedures performed in the 8- to 10-week period since reopening, testing policies, surgical complications, and cases among staff. RESULTS: In total, 112 surgeons reported 5633 surgeries since resuming elective surgery. Of these, 103 (91.96%) surgeons obtained a preoperative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for every patient. The preoperative PCR test was positive in 41/5881 (0.69%). Positive tests within 2 weeks postoperation occurred in 7/5380 (0.13%) of surgical patients, 3/8506 (0.04%) of injection patients, and 6/2519 (0.24%) of energy therapy patients. Nine offices reported at least 1 staff member who developed COVID-19. All cases were mild, with no hospitalizations or deaths.

This study aimed to quantify and describe the experiences of family medicine residents nationally during the early phases of the pandemic. Specific areas of interest included training received and the residents' personal sense of safety. The purpose of this study was to look for differences among residents based on geographic location. Method This May 2020 survey was conducted by the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) of a random sample of 5,000 resident members of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). Results The overall response rate for the survey was 5.66% (283/5,000). More than 40% of residents reported having felt in moderate to significant personal danger during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fewer than 20% had been tested for COVID-19 themselves. Among all respondents, 176 (65.7%) of the residents had provided direct patient care for COVID-19-positive patients. Most had been trained on personal protective equipment and the medical aspects of COVID-19, but 16.2% reported no training on how to care for COVID-19 patients. Minority residents, and residents in larger urban areas were less likely to receive timely training. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on family medicine residents' medical education and their sense of safety. Regional variations in residents' educational experiences during the pandemic exist. Training prior to COVID-19 exposure was not universal. In our sample, minority residents were less likely to receive timely training than White residents.","output":"Family Medicine Residents' Experience During Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is often related to affective symptoms and both predict cognitive decline. We investigated whether SCD status predicted higher anxiety/depression during the Covid19\\\\related confinement, along with amyloid positivity in cognitively unimpaired older adults. METHOD: We included 205 participants from the ALFA+ study (Table 1). During the confinement, anxiety and depression (Hospital Depression and Anxiety scale, HADS), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and stress resilience (Brief Resilience Scale) were measured. Participants completed HADS, SCD\\\\Questionnaire, and underwent a [(18)F]flutemetamol\\\\PET scan on average 2.4 years before confinement (baseline). We ran linear analyses with (i) cross\\\\sectional HADS scores during the confinement as well as (ii) change from baseline to confinement (delta scores) as dependent variables. SCD and amyloid status (+/\\\\, defined with a Centiloid threshold of 12) and their interaction were considered as predictors, and demographics, APOE\\\\4 status, and baseline HADS (for longitudinal analyses) as covariates. In a second step, perceived stress and stress resilience were considered in the models among covariates. RESULT: Twenty\\\\seven percent (n=56) of the participants were classified as SCD and 12.7% as amyloid positive. When main effects were tested, both SCD (p=0.03) and amyloid positivity (p=0.003) were associated with higher HADS scores during confinement (Table 2a). Further, a significant SCD*amyloid interaction was observed (p=0.001) such that only SCD participants with an amyloid positive scan showed higher HADS scores (p=0.001). SCD participants showed higher perceived stress than non\\\\SCD participants (p=.044), but no differences were found in stress resilience (p=0.6). The inclusion of perceived stress and stress resilience as covariates reduced the SCD effect to a trend (p=0.06) but not the effect of amyloid (p=0.003). Longitudinal analyses with delta scores showed similar results for amyloid but not for SCD main effects (Table 2b). The amyloid*SCD interaction was also significant in longitudinal analyses (p=0.002) with amyloid status predicting an increase in HADS scores only in participants with SCD (p=0.003) (Fig. 1). CONCLUSION: Having SCD and being amyloid positive is synergistically related to increased anxiety/depression during the Covid19\\\\related confinement. Longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate the impact of higher confinement related anxiety/depression in the clinical prognosis of the SCD population.","output":"Subjective cognitive decline is associated with higher anxiety and depression during the COVID\\\\19?related confinement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Although studies have evaluated the economic burden to medical students desiring a neurosurgery residency broadly, a detailed breakdown of costs has not been reported. Given that the Association of American Medical Colleges and Society of Neurological Surgeons have recommended neurosurgery residency programs for the 2021 residency application cycle cancel away rotations and in-person interviews, our objective was to evaluate cost savings to medical students applying during this time and the implications. METHODS: Using the 2019-2020 Texas STAR Dashboard database, we queried responses from neurosurgery residency applicants. We recorded application costs, away rotation costs, interview costs, and total costs for medical school seniors applying to neurosurgery residency. Demographic information for applicants was also recorded. Mean and median costs were reported with percentile distributions and geographic comparisons. A Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to determine differences in mean costs by medical school region. RESULTS: Our cohort included 121 U.S. allopathic applicants to neurosurgery residency. Mean application costs were $1711, away rotation costs were $3840, interview costs were $6400, and total costs were $11,882. No significant difference was observed for mean total costs for applicants from schools in the central ($10,525/applicant), northeast ($11,311/applicant), south ($12,660/applicant) and west ($12,404/applicant) regions (P = 0.181). There was no significant difference in the mean application fees, away rotation costs, or interview costs among regions. CONCLUSIONS: In the COVID-19 era, neurosurgery residency applicants could save >$10,000 through the use of virtual interviews and lack of away rotations.

We used multivariable logistic regression to associate lung POCUS findings with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients with COVID\\\\like symptoms were included, including 109 with confirmed COVID\\\\19. Among the included patients, 33 (30.3%) patients were intubated, and in\\\\hospital mortality was reported in 19 (17.4%).

Multivariable logistic regression incorporating binary and scored POCUS findings were able to identify those at highest risk for need of mechanical ventilation (area under the curve 0.80) and in\\\\hospital mortality (area under the curve 0.87). In the binary model ultrasound (US) findings in the anterior lung fields were significantly associated with a need for intubation and mechanical ventilation (odds ratio [OR] 3.67; 0.62C21.6).

To validate the applicability of the GTbPOE method, further research was undertaken to evaluate the building performance of another dormitory. Using face-to-face interviews, responses of 104 dormitory users were collected, of which the relative importance ratings of six essential aspects (namely: visual comfort, thermal comfort, aural comfort, fire safety, hygiene, and communication via information technology) were analyzed via the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).

In the 2008C2009 influenza season, Flushing Hospital Medical Center (FHMC; New York) adopted a push/pull point-of-dispensing (POD) vaccination model that was derived from emergency preparedness planning for mass vaccination and/or prophylaxis to respond to an infectious disease outbreak, whether occurring naturally or due to bioterrorism. LAUNCH OF THE HCW VACCINATION PROGRAM: In mid-September 2008, a two-week HCW vaccination program was launched using a sequential POD approach. In Push POD, teams assigned to specific patient units educated all HCWs about influenza vaccination and offered on-site vaccination; vaccinated HCWs received a 2009 identification (ID) validation sticker. In Pull POD, HCWs could enter the hospital only through one entrance; all other employee entrances were locked down. A 2009 ID validation sticker was required for entry and to punch in for duty. Employees without the new validation sticker were directed to a nearby vaccination team. After the Push/Pull POD was completed, the employee vaccination drive at FHMC was continued for the remainder of the influenza season by the Employee Health Service. RESULTS: Using this model, in two days 72% of the employees were reached, with 54% of those reached accepting vaccination.

In 2018, Switzerland experienced its largest nosocomial VRE outbreak. The national center for infection prevention (Swissnoso) elaborated recommendations for controlling this outbreak and published guidelines to prevent epidemic and endemic VRE spread. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate adherence to this new guideline and its potential impact on the VRE epidemiology in Swiss acute care hospitals. METHODS: In March 2020, Swissnoso distributed a survey among all Swiss acute care hospitals. The level of adherence as well as changes of infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies in the years 2018 and 2019 after publication of the national guidelines were asked along with an inventory on VRE surveillance and outbreaks. RESULTS: Data of 97/146 (66%) participants were available, representing 81.6% of all acute care beds operated in Switzerland in 2019. The vast majority72/81 (88%) responding hospitalshave entirely or largely adopted our new national guideline. 38/51 (74.5%) hospitals which experienced VRE cases were significantly more likely to have changed their IPC strategies than those 19/38 (50%) hospitals without VRE cases p = 0.017). The new IPC guidelines included (1) introduction of targeted admission screening in 89.5%, (2) screening of close contacts of VRE cases in 56%, and (3) contact precaution for suspected VRE cases 58% of these hospitals. 52 (54%) hospitals reported 569 new VRE cases in 2018 including 14 bacteremia, and 472 new cases in 2019 with 10 bacteremia. The ten largest outbreaks encountered between 2018 and 2019 included 671 VRE cases, of which most (93.4%) consisted of colonization events, 29 (4.3%) infections and 15 (2.2%) bacteremia. CONCLUSION: Wide adoption of this VRE control guideline seemed to have a positive effect on VRE containment in Swiss acute care hospitals over two years, even if its long-term impact on the VRE epidemiology remains to be evaluated. Broad dissemination and strict implementation of a uniform national guideline may therefore serve as model for other countries to fight VRE epidemics on a national level.

Our study showed that PCTAIRE1 is a mitotic kinase that localizes at centrosomes during G2 and at spindle poles as the cells enter mitosis, and then at midbody during cytokinesis. We also report that PCTAIRE1 protein levels fluctuate through cell cycle, and reach their peak at mitosis, during which there is an increase in PCTAIRE1 phosphorylation as well. Interestingly, knockdown of PCTAIRE1 resulted in aberrant mitosis by interfering with spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. Further, we found that PCTAIRE1 promotes resistance of cancer cells to antimitotic drugs, thus underscoring the significance of PCTAIRE1 as a potential drug target for overcoming chemotherapeutic resistance.

Over time, it has become clear that respiratory disease is not the only important entity as critically ill patients are also more prone to develop complications, such as acute cardiac injury. Despite extensive research, the mainstay of treatment still relies on supportive care and targeted therapy of these complications. The development of a prognostic model which helps clinicians to diverge patients to an appropriate level of care is thus crucial. As a result, several prognostic markers have been studied in the past few months. Among them are the cardiac biomarkers, especially cardiac troponins T/I and brain natriuretic peptide, which seem to have important prognostic values as several reports have confirmed their strong association with adverse clinical outcomes and death. The use of these biomarkers as part of a prognostic tool could potentially result in more precise risk stratification of COVID-19 patients and divergence to an adequate level of care.

To understand how to manage which patients are admitted to ICU, and receive mechanical ventilatory support, during periods of high demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, a systematic review was performed. Databases of indexed literature (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Global Health) and grey literature (Google.com and MedRxiv), published from 1 January until 2 April 2020, were searched. Search terms included synonyms of COVID-19, ICU, ventilation, and triage. Only formal written guidelines were included. There were no exclusion criteria based on geographical location or publication language. Quality appraisal of the guidelines was performed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II (AGREE II) and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument Recommendation EXcellence (AGREE REX) appraisal tools, and key themes related to triage were extracted using narrative synthesis. Of 1902 unique records identified, nine relevant guidelines were included. Six guidelines were national or transnational level guidance (UK, Switzerland, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand, Italy, and Sri Lanka), with one state level (Kansas, USA), one international (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) and one specific to military hospitals (Department of Defense, USA). The guidelines covered several broad themes: use of ethical frameworks, criteria for ICU admission and discharge, adaptation of criteria as demand changes, equality across health conditions and healthcare systems, decision-making processes, communication of decisions, and guideline development processes.

Methods: A three-part, sequential mixed-methods study was conducted that comprised (i) a thematic analysis of data from five focus groups (with 47 ALS health professionals from 41 UK organizations and four service user representatives), (ii) a nationwide cross-sectional survey (281 ALS healthcare professionals) and (iii) a freedom of information request (251 organizations). Results: UK nutritional management services for pwALS are coordinated from specialist (n = 22) and non-specialist care centers (n = 89), with national variability in the organization and delivery of services. Multidisciplinary working was highlighted to facilitate the coordination of nutritional care. However, the need to provide evidence-based continuing education for HCPs was evident. Overall, the lack of clear guidelines on the nutritional management of people with ALS was identified as a key barrier to the delivery of effective nutritional care, as was the lack of transparency and consistency in the commissioning of nutritional services. Further concerns over the timeliness of the dietetic intervention and equity of access and provision were raised. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that development of guidelines for nutritional management, particularly at diagnosis and pre-gastrostomy, could drive standardization of high quality nutritional care for pwALS. Such guidance has the potential to reduce inequalities in geographical provision by providing clarity for those commissioning specialist nutrition services.","output":"Delivery of nutritional management services to people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Societies in the 21st century require more proactive management of risks in many areas owing to the complexities people have built into socioeconomic systems, ranging from science and technology, economics, and finance to education, entertainment, and tourism infrastructure.

Testosterone deficiency may contribute to earlier onset of metabolic syndrome. The study aimed to assess connections between serum testosterone concentrations and metabolic disorders as well as body composition in TGCT survivors. 336 TGCT patients with over two years of complete post-treatment remission were divided into three groups: definite testosterone deficiency (< 8 nmol/L), 'grey zone' (8-12 nmol/L) and normal testosterone (> 12 nmol/L; control group) to assess differences in metabolism. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The multivariate analysis assessed the risk of metabolic disorders and changes in body composition with regard to testosterone concentrations adjusted for age, smoking history, clinical stage, type of treatment and follow-up period. 14% of patients presented with definite testosterone deficiency; 46% were in the 'grey zone'. On multivariate analysis, low testosterone levels were related to hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, inflammatory processes, procoagulant state and obesity. The odds ratio (OR) for the onset of metabolic syndrome was 2.87 (95% CI 1.74-4.73, p < 0.001) for the 'grey zone' patients and 7.92 (95% CI 3.76-16.70, p < 0.001) for those with definite testosterone deficiency. Testosterone concentrations were independently associated with metabolic disorders in TGCT survivors. Testicular cancer survivors often have lower testosterone and metabolic disorders.

There was an urgent need of a high-throughput molecular test for screening the COVID-19 patients in the community. The Luminex NxTAG CoV extended panel is a high-throughput FDA emergency use-authorized molecular diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This system targets three genes (ORF1ab, N, and E genes) of SARS-CoV-2, the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV, and the ORF5 region of MERS-CoV. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of this system with nasopharyngeal swab specimens of 214 suspected COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong. The results were compared with our routine COVID-19 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) protocol with a LightMix SarbecoV E-gene kit and an in-house RdRp/Hel RT-PCR assay. The NxTAG CoV extended panel demonstrated 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. On low-viral load specimens, the sensitivity of the NxTAG panel could still maintain at 85.71%. Strong agreement was observed between the NxTAG panel and the routine COVID-19 RT-PCR protocol (kappa value = 0.98). Overall, the E gene target of the NxTAG panel demonstrated the highest sensitivity among the three SARS-CoV-2 targets, while the N gene targets demonstrated the least. In conclusion, the NxTAG CoV extended panel is simple to use, and it has high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. We recommend this diagnostic system for high-throughput COVID-19 screening in the community.","output":"Clinical Performance of the Luminex NxTAG CoV Extended Panel for SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Nasopharyngeal Specimens from COVID-19 Patients in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context Long-term urinary and sexual outcomes after repair of anorectal malformations (ARMs) are currently affected by concomitant malformations of the urinary tract and genitalia, sacral anomalies, and the surgical approach. However, the overall prevalence of urinary and sexual dysfunction remains unclear. Objective To evaluate the prevalence of urinary and sexual dysfunction in patients aged >10 yr after repair of ARM in infancy. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature review was performed using the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Selected studies were reviewed according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) criteria. We included studies reporting the prevalence of the following outcomes: urinary incontinence (UI), lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD), sexual dysfunction (SD), erectile dysfunction (ED), ejaculatory dysfunction, and birth rate. We initially identified 588 studies, of which 17 were included for evidence synthesis. Evidence synthesis A probabilistic meta-analysis on each subgroup revealed the following combined prevalence estimates: UI 16% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7-27%), LUTS/NBD 36% (95% CI 13-62%), SD among women 50% (95% CI 34-66%), ED 12% (95% CI 7-18%), ejaculatory dysfunction 16% (95% CI 9-25%), and birth rate 20% (95% CI 7-38%). Subgroup analysis showed a higher prevalence of ED and ejaculatory dysfunction among patients with high ARM severity when compared to low ARM severity. Conclusions Among patients undergoing ARM repair, we found a high prevalence of long-term impairment of UI, ED, and SD. We stress the need for larger multicentre trials with more comparable populations to optimise treatment and follow-up regimens.

However, the effects of smoking on COVID-19 symptoms are not well described and controversial. In this study, we aim to explore the associations between smoking and COVID-19 symptoms. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study using the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), Qatar database was administered to a Qatari population with confirmed COVID-19 disease who filled in pre-defined phone-call questionnaire between 27th February 2020 and 31st December 2020. We analyzed 11,701 non-vaccinated COVID-19 individuals (2952 smokers and 8749 non-smokers) with confirmed RT-PCR test results. The association of smoking and the presence of symptoms as well as patient characteristics was calculated using Pearsons Chi-square and Fishers exact tests, adjusting for potential covariates. RESULTS: Compared with the non-smokers, symptomatic COVID-19 infection is significantly higher in smokers. In addition, we found fever as the most common symptom developed in COVID-19 patients followed by cough, headache, muscle ache, and sore throat. As compared to other symptoms, association of smoking with chills and abdominal pain was less evident (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). However, both groups showed similar rates of developing cough. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, smoking is associated with COVID-19 symptoms frequency in non-vaccinated patients; nevertheless, further investigations are necessary to understand the mechanism of this association which could generate new targets for the management of COVID-19 in smoker patients.","output":"Impact of Smoking on COVID-19 Symptoms in Non-Vaccinated Patients: A Matched Observational Study from Qatar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims: Although various reports indicated the presence of myalgia in 44C70% and skeletal muscle injury (increased CK and myalgia) in 23% of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the characterization of neuromuscular involvement is still unsatisfactory, and electrophysiologic studies have rarely been performed. Methods: We describe a case of acute myopathy at onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: A 73-year-old woman, with post-infarct ischemic heart disease in her medical history, presented with progressive weakness in the lower limbs and pain, without fever. On admission, neurological examination showed proximal tetraparesis, prevalent in the lower limbs, and reflexes were diminished. CK in the serum was to >6000 U/L (normal value 10C145 U/L), hepatic enzymes were elevated (GOT 814 U/L, n.v.1C31), urin Hb > 1 (n.v. absent).Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-COV-2 was positive. Chest X-ray showed right lower patchy opacities, but oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Motor nerve conduction studies (NCS) showed mild sensory polyneuropathy;the needle electromyography (EMG) demonstrated myopathic abnormalities with fibrillation potentials in the lower limbs, rapid recruitment on interference pattern and reduced compound muscle action potential amplitude. The therapy with high dose of steroids induced significative clinical improvement. In two weeks, CK levels almost normalized and the patient recovered the ability to walk with assistance. Conclusions: The severe immune activation known to occur in COVID-19 patients probably plays an important pathophysiological role for onset of rhabdomyolysis, but further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms, appropriate treatment, and long-term clinical outcomes of muscular manifestations associated with COVID-19 disease.

However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population. METHODS: We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULTS: As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

Recombinant BAV331 contains chemically synthesized E2 gene (nucleotides modified to remove internal cryptic splice sites) under the control of BAV-3 E3/major late promoter (MLP), while recombinant BAV338 contains original E2 gene under the control of human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. Since E2, a class I membrane glycoprotein, does not contain its own signal peptide sequence at the 5' end, the bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) glycoprotein D signal sequence was fused in frame to the E2 open reading frame (ORF) for proper processing of the E2 glycoprotein in both the recombinant viruses. Recombinant E2 protein expressed by BAV331 and BAV338 recombinant viruses was recognized by E2-specific monoclonal antibodies as a 53-kDa protein, which also formed dimer with an apparent molecular weight of 94 kDa. Insertion of an E2-expression cassette in the E3 region did not effect the replication of recombinant BAV-3s. Intranasal immunization of cotton rats with these recombinant viruses generated E2-specific IgA and IgG responses at the mucosal surfaces and in the serum.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 619 youth aged 14C28 years participated in the study (62.7% girls/young women; 61.4% Caucasian). MEASURES: Data on mood, substance use and COVID-19-related worries were collected over four time points, that is, every 2 months beginning in the early stages of the pandemic in April 2020. Latent class analyses were conducted on the longitudinal data to identify distinct groups of youth who have different trajectory profiles of pandemic impact on their mood, substance use and COVID-19-related worries. RESULTS: For the majority of participants, mood concerns increased early in the pandemic, declined over Canadas summer months and subsequently increased in autumn. Among the youth with the highest level of mood symptoms at the beginning of the pandemic, increases in mental health concerns were sustained. Substance use remained relatively stable over the course of the pandemic. COVID-19-related worries, however, followed a trajectory similar to that of mood symptoms. Girls/young women, youth living in urban or suburban areas, in larger households, and with poorer baseline mental and physical health are the most vulnerable to mental health concerns and worries during the pandemic.

METHODS: We included consecutive adults without known thyroid disorder admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for COVID-19 from July 2020 to January 2021 who had thyroid function tests (TFTs) and anti-thyroid antibodies measured both on admission and at three months. RESULTS: 226 patients were included (median age 55.0 years; 49.6% men): 135 were IFN-treated. There tended to be more abnormal TFTs upon reassessment in IFN-treated patients (8.1% vs 2.2%, p=0.080). 179 patients (65.4% IFN-treated) had a complete reassessment of anti-thyroid antibodies. There were significant increases in titres of both anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO: baseline 29.21 units [IQR: 14.97 C 67.14] vs reassessment 34.30 units [IQR: 18.82 C 94.65], p<0.001) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg: baseline 8.23 units [IQR: 5.40 C 18.44] vs reassessment 9.14 units [IQR: 6.83 C 17.17], p=0.001) in the IFN-treated group but not IFN-na?ve group. IFN treatment (standardised beta 0.245, p=0.001) was independently associated with changes in anti-TPO titre. Of the 143 patients negative for anti-TPO at baseline, 8 became anti-TPO positive upon reassessment (seven IFN-treated; one IFN-na?ve). Incident anti-TPO positivity was more likely to be associated with abnormal TFTs upon reassessment (phi 0.188, p=0.025). CONCLUSION: IFN for COVID-19 was associated with modest increases in anti-thyroid antibody titres, and a trend of more incident anti-TPO positivity and abnormal TFTs during convalescence. Our findings suggest that clinicians monitor the thyroid function and anti-thyroid antibodies among IFN-treated COVID-19 survivors, and call for further follow-up studies regarding the clinical significance of these changes.","output":"The Impact of Interferon Beta-1b Therapy on Thyroid Function and Autoimmunity Among COVID-19 Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is one of the earliest drugs that showed promise in the management of haemoglobinopathies that include -thalassaemia and sickle cell disease.

In this review, we aim to explore the available in vitro and in vivo mechanistic data and the clinical utility of hydroxyurea in -haemoglobinopathies with a special emphasis on its usefulness during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: Hydroxyurea is an S-phase-specific drug that reversibly inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme which catalyses an essential step in the DNA biosynthesis. In human erythroid cells, it induces the expression of -globin, a fetal globin gene that is suppressed after birth. Through several molecular pathways described in this review, hydroxyurea exerts many favourable effects on the haemoglobin content, red blood cell indices, ineffective erythropoiesis, and blood rheology in patients with -haemoglobinopathies. Currently, it is recommended for sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent -thalassaemia. A number of clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its usefulness in transfusion dependent -thalassaemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was widely used as an adjunct to transfusion therapy due to limitations in the availability of blood and logistical disturbances. Thus, it has become clear that hydroxyurea could play a remarkable role in reducing transfusion requirements of patients with haemoglobinopathies, especially when donor blood is a limited resource. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyurea is a well-tolerated oral drug which has been in use for many decades. Through its actions of reversible inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme and fetal haemoglobin induction, it exerts many favourable effects on patients with -haemoglobinopathies. It is currently approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent -thalassaemia. Also, there are various observations to suggest that hydroxyurea is an important adjunct in the treatment of transfusion dependent -thalassaemia which should be confirmed by randomised clinical trials.","output":"A comprehensive review of hydroxyurea for -haemoglobinopathies: the role revisited during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Ketamine has been shown to decrease sedative requirements in intensive care unit (ICU). Randomized trials are limited on patient-centered outcomes. We designed this pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility of a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effect of ketamine as an adjunct analgosedative compared with standard of care alone as a control group (CG) in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation (MV). We also provided preliminary evidence on clinically relevant outcomes to plan a larger trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pilot, active-controlled, open-label RCT was conducted at medical, surgical, and transplant ICUs at a large tertiary and quaternary care medical institution (King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Saudi Arabia). The study included adult patients who were intubated within 24 h, expected to require MV for the next calendar day, and had institutional pain and sedation protocol initiated. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to adjunct ketamine infusion 1C2 g/kg/min for 48 h or CG alone. RESULTS: Of 437 patients screened from September 2019 through November 2020, 83 (18.9%) patients were included (43 in CG and 40 in ketamine) and 352 (80.5%) were excluded. Average enrollment rate was 3C4 patients/month. Consent and protocol adherence rates were adequate (89.24% and 76%, respectively). Demographics were balanced between groups. Median MV duration was 7 (interquartile range [IQR] 3C9.25 days) in ketamine and 5 (IQR 2C8 days) in CG. Median VFDs was 19 (IQR 0C24.75 days) in ketamine and 19 (IQR 0C24 days) in the CG (p = 0.70). More patients attained goal Richmond AgitationCSedation Scale at 24 and 48 h in ketamine (67.5% and 73.5%, respectively) compared with CG (52.4% and 66.7%, respectively). Sedatives and vasopressors cumulative use, and hemodynamic changes were similar. ICU length-of-stay was 12.5 (IQR 6C21.2 days) in ketamine, compared with 12 (IQR 5.5C23 days) in CG. No serious adverse events were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine as an adjunct analgosedative agent appeared to be feasible and safe with no negative impact on outcomes, including hemodynamics. This pilot RCT identified areas of improvement in study protocol before conducting a large, adequately powered, multicenter RCT which is likely justified to investigate ketamine association with patient-centered outcomes further.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries faced excess mortality partly attributed to disruptions in essential healthcare services provision. This study aims to estimate the utilization of public primary care and hospital services during the COVID-19 epidemic in Greece and its potential association with excess non-COVID-19 mortality in the country. STUDY DESIGN This is an observational study. METHODS A retrospective analysis of national secondary utilization and mortality data from multiple official sources, covering the first nine months of the COVID-19 epidemic in Greece (February 26th to November 30th, 2020), was carried out. RESULTS Utilization rates of all public healthcare services during the first nine months of the epidemic dropped significantly compared to the average utilization rates of the 2017-19 control period; hospital admissions, hospital surgical procedures, and primary care visits dropped by 17.3% (95% CI: 6.6%-28.0%), 23.1% (95% CI: 7.3%-38.9%), and 24.8% (95% CI: 13.3%-36.3%) respectively. This underutilization of essential public services-mainly due to supply restrictions such as suspension of outpatient care and cancelation of elective surgeries-is most probably related to the 3778 excess non-COVID-19 deaths (representing 62% of all-cause excess deaths) that have been reported during the first 9 months of the epidemic in the country. CONCLUSIONS Greece's healthcare system, deeply wounded by the 2008-18 recession and austerity, was ill-resourced to cope with the challenges of the COVID-19 epidemic. Early and prolonged lockdowns have kept COVID-19 infections and deaths at relatively low levels. However, this \\"success\\" seems to have been accomplished at the expense of non-COVID-19 patients. It is important to acknowledge the \\"hidden epidemic\\" of unmet non-COVID-19 needs and increased non-COVID-19 deaths in the country and urgently strengthen public healthcare services to address it.","output":"Essential public healthcare services utilization and excess non-COVID-19 mortality in Greece."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) as a routine treatment in stroke patients is still controversial. The efficacy and safety of DAPT may vary with different regiments, initiating treatment time and race. Our study assessed the efficacy and safety of DAPT in patients with stroke and to determine the factors influencing the efficacy and safety of DAPT. Relevant studies published up to May 2019 from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials comparing DAPT with mono antiplatelet therapy (MAPT) for stroke secondary prevention were included. The primary endpoints were stroke recurrence, ischemic stroke recurrence and all-cause death. Subgroup analysis was made according to regiment, initiating treatment time and race. Eighteen studies (n=33353) were included. Comparing with MAPT, short-term DAPT reduced stroke recurrence (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.60-0.77) and ischemic stroke recurrence (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.59-0.77) but increased major bleeding (RR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.11-2.98). Long-term DAPT had no superiority compared with MAPT. Aspirin plus clopidogrel comparing with aspirin and early initiating treatment time comparing with MAPT decreased stroke recurrence (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67-0.83; RR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.61-0.78) and ischemic stroke recurrence ( RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.64-0.79; RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.59-0.77) but also increased major bleeding (RR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.38-2.09; RR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.07-2.85). DAPT reduced stroke and ischemic stroke recurrence in non-Asian group but only reduced ischemic stroke recurrence in Asian group. As stroke secondary prevention, short-term DAPT rather than long-term DAPT could be a better choice. Patients could benefit more from aspirin plus clopidogrel or given DAPT within 72 h after symptoms onset. Race may be a factor influencing the efficacy of DAPT.","output":"Efficacy and safety of dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack: An updated meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The infection of human fetal foreskin fibroblasts (HFFF2) with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) resulted in the induction of autophagy. This was demonstrated by the increased lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a hallmark of autophagy, and by the visualization of characteristic vesicles within infected cells. The response was detected first at 2 h postinfection and persisted for at least 3 days. De novo protein synthesis was not required for the effect, since HCMV that was irradiated with UV light also elicited the response, and furthermore the continuous presence of cycloheximide did not prevent induction. Infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) under conditions that inhibited viral gene expression provoked autophagy, whereas UV-irradiated respiratory syncytial virus did not. The induction of autophagy occurred when cells were infected with HCMV or HSV-1 that was gradient purified, but HCMV dense bodies and HSV-1 light particles, each of which lack nucleocapsids and genomes, were inactive. The depletion of regulatory proteins Atg5 and Atg7, which are required for autophagy, reduced LC3 modification in response to infection but did not result in any detectable difference in viral or cellular gene expression at early times after infection. The electroporation of DNA into HFFF2 cultures induced the lipidation of LC3 but double-stranded RNA did not, even though both agents stimulated an innate immune response. The results show a novel, early cellular response to the presence of the incoming virion and additionally demonstrate that autophagy can be induced by the presence of foreign DNA within cells.","output":"Early induction of autophagy in human fibroblasts after infection with human cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus 1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Indoor air quality (IAQ) in classrooms affects children's health and academic perfor-mance The aim of this pilot study was to determine IAQ in elementary schools different in their inter-nal and external characteristics, in settings of COVID-19 epidemics METHODS: IAQ parameters: fine particulate matter (PM2,5) mass concentration, CO2 concentration, tempera-ture and relative humidity were measured in parallel in four elementary schools/classrooms during October (non-heating season) and four months (including holiday in January) of heating season IAQ parameters were measured in settings of anti-epidemic restrictions (13 students in classroom, frequent ventilation) RESULTS: During October, except in one school, PM2,5 concentrations were below the upper recommended value (25 g/m3), but started rising in all schools in the heating season The highest concentrations of PM2,5 were registered in two schools with closed or shortly opened windows CO2 concentrations were mostly in the recommended range (up to 1000ppm) except in the school with constantly closed windows and in three schools in February when concentrations were higher Except in one, the same school, and in January, both temperature and relative humidity were out of the recommended range (24,0-27,0C in non-heating;20,0-24,0C in heating season;and 45-55%), with temperature mainly above and relative humidity mainly below it in three schools The largest deviation in temperature and relative humidity were registered in urban schools Registered differ-ences may be explained by different internal and external characteristics CONCLUSION: Despite anti-epidemic restrictions, most of the measured IAQ parameters were out of the recom-mended values in heating season In addition, further deterioration of IAQ could be expected if all students had been presented in the classroom Finally, to assure a healthy school environment in heating season, further optimisation of both indoor and outdoor conditions is needed in both pandemic and non-pandemic settings","output":"School Children Exposure to Low Indoor Air Quality in Classrooms during Covid-19 Pandemic: Results of a Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet hospitals, as a new forum for doctors to conduct diagnosis and treatment activities based on the internet, are emerging in China and have become integral to the development of the medical field in conjunction with increasing reforms and policies in Chinas medical and health system.

With this study, we sought to survey pediatric centers and highlight the variations in care related to perioperative medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the availability of protective equipment, the practice of pediatric anesthesia, and economic impact. AIM: The aim of the survey was to determine how COVID-19 directly impacted pediatric anesthesia practices during the study period. METHODS: A survey concerning four major domains (testing, safety, clinical management/policy, economics) was developed. It was pilot tested for clarity and content by members of the Pediatric Anesthesia COVID-19 Collaborative. The survey was administered by email to all Pediatric Anesthesia COVID-19 Collaborative members on September 1, 2020. Respondents had six weeks to complete the survey and were instructed to answer the questions based on their institution's practice during September 1 - October 13, 2020. RESULTS: Sixty-three institutions (100% response rate) participated in the COVID-19 Pediatric Anesthesia Survey. Forty-one hospitals (65%) were from the United States, and 35% included other countries. N95 masks were available to anesthesia teams at 91% of institutions (n = 57) (95% CI: 80%-96%).

DESIGN: Prospective observational study of RPE fit testing according to health and safety, and occupational health requirements. SETTING: A large tertiary referral UK healthcare facility. POPULATION: 1443 healthcare workers undergoing quantitative fit testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative fit test success (pass/fail) and the count of tests each participant required before successful fit. RESULTS: Healthcare workers were fit tested a median (IQR) 2 (1-3) times before successful fit was obtained. Males were tested a median 1 (1-2) times, while females were tested a median 2 (1-2) times before a successful fit was found. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Modelling each fit test as its own independent trial (n=2359) using multivariable logistic regression, male healthcare workers were significantly more likely to find a well-fitting respirator and achieve a successful fit on first attempt in comparison to females, after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR=2.07, 95% CI): 1.66 to 2.60, p<0.001). Staff who described their ethnicity as White were also more likely to achieve a successful fit compared with staff who described their ethnicity as Asian (OR=0.47, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.58, p<0.001), Black (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.71, p<0.001), mixed (OR=0.50 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.80, p=0.004) or other (OR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.99, p=0.043).

Patients suffer from impaired organ function, reduced physical functional capacity and decreased quality of life even after surviving sepsis. The identification of prognostic factors for the medium-term and long-term outcomes of this condition is necessary to develop personalised theragnostic approaches. Sepsis can cause cardiac impairment. The impact of this septic cardiomyopathy on patients long-term outcome remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate cardiovascular risk factors, particularly the occurrence of septic cardiomyopathy, regarding their suitability as prognostic factors for the short-term and long-term outcomes of septic patients. Additionally, the study seeks to validate preclinical pathophysiological findings of septic cardiomyopathy in the clinical setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this prospective monocentric cohort study, patients will be clinically assessed during the acute and postacute phase of sepsis and two follow-ups after 6 and 12 months. To determine the effect of septic cardiomyopathy and concomitant cellular and molecular changes on patient mortality and morbidity, a comprehensive cardiovascular and molecular deep phenotyping of patients will be performed. This includes an echocardiographic and electrocardiographic assessment, and the evaluation of heart rate variability, body composition, mitochondrial oxygen metabolism, macrocirculation and microcirculation, and endothelial barrier function. These analyses are complemented by routine immunological, haematological and biochemical laboratory tests and analyses of the serum metabolome and lipidome, microbiome and epigenetic modifications of immune cells. The reversibility of patients organ dysfunction, their quality of life and physical functional capacity will be investigated in the follow-ups. Patients with cardiomyopathy without infection and healthy subjects will serve as control groups.

This paper contrasts the framework of financial risk-sharing and the configuration and management of health service providers in these two high-income, small-population countries. Two main institutional distinctions emerge from this country case comparison: (1) Key differences exist in the practical configuration of solidarity for payment of health care services, reflecting differing cultural roots and social expectations, which in turn carry substantial implications for financing long-term care and pensions. (2) Differing arrangements exist in the organization of health service institutions, in particular balancing public as against private sector responsibilities for owning, operating and managing these two countries' respective hospitals. These different structural characteristics generate fundamental differences in health sector financial and delivery outcomes in one developed country in Far East Asia as compared with a well-respected tax-funded health system in Western Europe. In the post-COVID era, as Western European policymakers find themselves forced to adjust their publicly funded health systems to (further) reductions in economic growth rates and overall tax receipts, and as the cost of the information revolution continues to rise while efforts to fund better coordinated social and home care services for growing numbers of chronically ill elderly remain inadequate, this two-country case comparison highlights a series of health system design questions that could potentially provide alternative health sector financing and service delivery strategies.","output":"Can Asia provide models for tax-based European health systems?

In addition to ocular complications, it can cause systemic infections in the form of gastroenteritis, respiratory disease, and dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. HAdV causes lytic infection of the mucoepithelial cells of the conjunctiva and cornea, as well as latent infection of lymphoid and adenoid cells. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is the most severe ocular manifestation of HAdV infection, in which the presence of subepithelial infiltrates (SEIs) in the cornea is a hallmark feature of corneal involvement. SEIs have the tendency to recur and may lead to long-term visual disability. HAdV persistence and dissemination are linked to sporadic outbreaks of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. There is no FDA-approved antiviral for treating adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, and as such, solutions should be proffered to handle the challenges associated with viral persistence and dissemination. Several treatment modalities have been investigated, both systemically and locally, to not only mitigate symptoms but reduce the course of the infection and prevent the risk of long-term complications. These options include systemic and topical antivirals, in-office povidone-iodine irrigation (PVI), immunoglobulin-based therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, and immunotherapy. More recently, combination PVI/dexamethasone ophthalmic formulations have shown favorable outcomes and were well tolerated in clinical trials for the treatment of EKC. Possible, future treatment considerations include sialic acid analogs, cold atmospheric plasma, N-chlorotaurine, and benzalkonium chloride. Continued investigation and evaluation of treatment are warranted to reduce the economic burden and potential long-term visual debilitation in affected patients.

Applying strict bioequivalence criteria, we found that common cold/rhinitis slightly reduced the bioavailability of nicotine, both in its rate and extent; the geometric mean of the ratio of C(max), AUC and t(max) were 0.81, 0.93 and 1.36, respectively. The nasal vasoconstrictor, xylometazoline, normalised the extent of the bioavailability of nicotine, but further prolonged the time for absorption to almost twice that measured in the disease-free state, increasing the t(max) ratio to 1.72. The results suggest that a minor proportion of people stopping smoking with the help of a nicotine nasal spray may experience a minor reduction in the effect of the spray during common cold/rhinitis. However, the nicotine self-titration behaviour found with most smoking cessation products (except the nicotine patch) will automatically lead to an adjustment of the dosage to achieve the desired effect.","output":"Relative bioavailability of nicotine from a nasal spray in infectious rhinitis and after use of a topical decongestant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In Australia, COVID-19 diagnosis relies on RT-PCR testing which is relatively costly and time-consuming To date, few studies have assessed the performance and implementation of rapid antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 testing in a setting with a low prevalence of COVID-19 infections, such as Australia Methods This study recruited participants presenting for COVID-19 testing at three Melbourne metropolitan hospitals during a period of low COVID-19 prevalence The Abbott PanBioTM COVID-19 Ag point-of-care test was performed alongside RT-PCR In addition, participants with COVID-19 notified to the Victorian Government were invited to provide additional swabs to aid validation Implementation challenges were also documented Findings The specificity of the Abbott PanBioTM COVID-19 Ag test was 99 96% (95% CI 99 73 - 100%) Sensitivity amongst participants with RT-PCR-confirmed infection was dependent upon the duration of symptoms reported, ranging from 77 3% (duration 1 to 33 days) to 100% in those within seven days of symptom onset A range of implementation challenges were identified which may inform future COVID-19 testing strategies in a low prevalence setting Interpretation Given the high specificity, antigen-based tests may be most useful in rapidly triaging public health and hospital resources while expediting confirmatory RT-PCR testing Considering the limitations in test sensitivity and the potential for rapid transmission in susceptible populations, particularly in hospital settings, careful consideration is required for implementation of antigen testing in a low prevalence setting Funding This work was funded by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services The funder was not involved in data analysis or manuscript preparation","output":"Multi-site assessment of rapid, point-of-care antigen testing for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a low-prevalence setting: A validation and implementation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has sparked the interest in predictive models capable of forecasting virus-spreading, especially for boosting and supporting decision-making processes.

However, the horizontal components marginally overshoot the limits due to the tilt effect. Ambient noise conditions significantly vary with different installation techniques, analysis revealing that seismic sensors buried directly in the ground have reduced long-period noise in comparison to pier installations. Tectonic settings and anthropogenic activities are also noted to cause a significant rise across short-period and microseism noise spectrum, varying spatially and temporally across the region. Day-time records higher cultural noise than night-time, while the microseism noise dominates during the monsoonal season. An assessment of the effect of the nationwide lockdown imposed due to COVID-19 pandemic revealed a significant decrease in the short-period noise levels at stations installed across the foreland basin marked with higher anthropogenic activity.

With the advent of several COVID-19 vaccines, the dissemination and delivery of COVID-19 immunization across the nation is of concern. Previous immunization delivery patterns may reveal important components of a comprehensive and sustainable effort to immunize everyone in the nation. METHODS: The delivery of vaccinations were enumerated by provider type using 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service data and the 2013-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The delivery of these services was examined at the service, physician, and visit level. RESULTS: In 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service, primary care physicians provided the largest share of services for vaccinations (46%), followed closely by mass immunizers (45%), then nurse practitioners/physician assistants (NP/PAs) (5%). The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey showed that primary care physicians provided most clinical visits for vaccination (54% of all visits). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians have played a crucial role in delivery of vaccinations to the US population, including the elderly, between 2012-2017.

Currently, there is no effective treatment that targets the cytokine storm and helps regenerate the damaged tissue.

Second, it argues that the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to accelerate age-divisions in our societies and may contribute to the growth of ageist representations. Third, the way age was mobilised and depicted in debates surrounding the pandemic situation has also had an impact on intergenerational solidarity and may reinforce antagonism between generations.

Public health policies on myopia control, recommendations on screen time and information pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 on increased digital device use were presented. Recommendations to minimize the impact of the pandemic on myopia onset and progression in children were made. RESULTS: Increased digital screen time, near work and limited outdoor activities were found to be associated with the onset and progression of myopia, and could potentially be aggravated during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak period.

The law provides one set of answers to these questions; ethics offers another. With a focus on American law (developed over the past two centuries) and Jewish ethics (developed over millennia), this paper shows that the two systems are in accord with some respects and differ in others: Both law and Jewish ethics would excuse a party who cannot complete his contract due to a force beyond his control, like the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, all health systems delivering cancer treatment innovations require access to an educated and motivated nursing workforce to meet demand. This study by the European Oncology Nursing Society examines comparative features of cancer nursing in Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands (NL) and the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Descriptive qualitative study using focus groups and individual interviews drawing on the views of cancer nurses, managers and stakeholders from four European countries (n = 97). Data collection was designed around national cancer nursing conferences held in Berlin (Germany), Ede (NL), Harrogate (UK) and Tallinn and Tartu between May 2017 and April 2018. Participants included a mix of nursing grades and specialisms. FINDINGS: According to the participants education and career structure for cancer nursing was most well-developed in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In Germany and Estonia developments were taking place at Masters level. None of the countries had recordable qualifications in cancer nursing. Variations existed in terms of advanced practice roles and salary. Workload pressures were common, and were rising, and wellbeing initiatives were not identified. Nurses reported gaining positive feedback from caring for patients. DISCUSSION: As demand for cancer treatment continues to grow there is a need to ensure an adequate supply of cancer nurses with the appropriate education and career structure to support patients. This study provides insights from four countries and suggests the need for better recognition as well as working conditions, education and career structures that advance the potential of the cancer nursing role in Europe.","output":"The experiences of cancer nurses working in four European countries: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The respiratory tract and its resident immune cells face daily exposure to stress, both from without and from within Inhaled pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and toxins from pollution trigger a cellular defence system that reduces protein synthesis to minimise viral replication or the accumulation of misfolded proteins Simultaneously, a gene expression programme enhances antioxidant and protein folding machineries in the lung Four kinases (PERK, PKR, GCN2 and HRI) sense a diverse range of stresses to trigger this \\"integrated stress response\\" Here we review recent advances identifying the integrated stress response as a critical pathway in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases, including pneumonias, thoracic malignancy, pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension Understanding the integrated stress response provides novel targets for the development of therapies","output":"The integrated stress response in pulmonary disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work we analyse the growth of the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases by the COVID-19 until March 27th, 2020, from countries of Asia, Europe, North and South America.

Very recently, we genetically linked a short-peptide fusion inhibitor with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment signal, rendering modified cells fully resistant to HIV infection. In this study, GPI-anchored m36.4, a single-domain antibody (nanobody) targeting the coreceptor-binding site of gp120, was constructed with a lentiviral vector. We verified that m36.4 was efficiently expressed on the plasma membrane of transduced TZM-bl cells and targeted lipid raft sites without affecting the expression of HIV receptors (CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4). Significantly, TZM-bl cells expressing GPI-m36.4 were highly resistant to infection with divergent HIV-1 subtypes and potently blocked HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and cell-cell viral transmission. Furthermore, we showed that GPI-m36.4-modified human CEMss-CCR5 cells were nonpermissive to both CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates and displayed a strong survival advantage over unmodified cells. It was found that GPI-m36.4 could also impair HIV-1 Env processing and viral infectivity in transduced cells, underlying a multifaceted mechanism of antiviral action.

There is a need to determine whether such assays can predict immunity, as antibody levels wane and viral variants emerge. MethodsWe measured antibodies in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients using several high-throughput serological tests and functional neutralization assays. The effects of time and spike protein sequence variation on the performance and predictive value of the various assays was assessed. FindingsNeutralizing antibody titers decreased over the first few months post-infection but stabilized thereafter, at about 30% of the level observed shortly after infection. Serological assays commonly used to measure antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 displayed a range of sensitivities that declined to varying extents over time. Quantitative measurements generated by serological assays based on the spike protein were better at predicting neutralizing antibody titers than assays based on nucleocapsid, but performance was variable and manufacturer positivity thresholds were not able to predict the presence or absence of detectable neutralizing activity. Even though there was some deterioration in correlation between serological measurements and functional neutralization activity, some assays maintained an ability to predict neutralizing titers, even against variants of concern. InterpretationThe ability of high throughput serological assays to predict neutralizing antibody titers is likely crucial for evaluation of immunity at the population scale. These data will facilitate the selection of the most suitable assays as surrogates of functional neutralizing activity and suggest that such measurements may have utility in clinical practice.","output":"Longitudinal variation in SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and emergence of viral variants: implications for the ability of serological assays to predict immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID 19 infections may be associated with a wide range of bacterial and fungal co-infections.

We aimed to describe a clinical picture of delayed leukoencephalopathy and explore potential associations with procedural characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS We considered endovascular coiling procedures for cerebral aneurysms performed between January 2006 and December 2017 in our institution with follow-up MRIs. We used logistic regression models to estimate the ORs of delayed leukoencephalopathy for each procedural characteristic. RESULTS We reviewed 1754 endovascular coiling procedures of 1594 aneurysms. Sixteen of 1722 (0.9%) procedures demonstrated delayed leukoencephalopathy on follow-up FLAIR MR imaging examinations after a median period of 71.5 days (interquartile range, 30-101 days) in the form of high-signal changes in the white matter at locations remote from the coil mass. Seven patients had headaches or hemiparesis, and 9 patients were asymptomatic. All imaging-associated changes improved subsequently. We found indications suggesting an association between delayed leukoencephalopathy and the number of microcatheters used per procedure (P = .009), along with indications suggesting that these procedures required larger median volumes of contrast medium (225 versus 175 mL, OR = 5.5, P = .008) as well as a longer median fluoroscopy duration (123.6 versus 99.3 minutes, OR = 3.0, P = .06).

Treatment targeting this immune response might be beneficial but there is limited evidence on its efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine if early treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with tocilizumab and/or steroids was associated with better outcome. METHODS: This observational single-center study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were not intubated and received either standard of care (SOC, controls) or SOC plus early (within 3 days from hospital admission) anti-inflammatory treatment. SOC consisted of hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid plus, in those admitted before March 24(th), also darunavir/ritonavir. Anti-inflammatory treatment consisted of either tocilizumab (8mg/kg intravenously or 162mg subcutaneously) or methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg for 5 days or both. Failure was defined as intubation or death, and the endpoints were failure-free survival (primary endpoint) and overall survival (secondary) at day 30. Difference between the groups was estimated as Hazard Ratio by a propensity score weighted Cox regression analysis (HR(OW)). RESULTS: Overall, 196 adults were included in the analyses. They were mainly male (67.4%), with comorbidities (78.1%) and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (83.7%). Median age was 67.9 years (range, 30C100) and median PaO(2)/FiO(2) 200 mmHg (IQR 133C289).

Consequently, a sizable proportion of surgical patients in this age group may have a comorbid opioid use disorder (OUD). No previously published study has examined the prevalence of OUD and its impact on postoperative morbidity or mortality in the adolescent surgical population. Our objective was to investigate the prevalence of comorbid OUD and its association with surgical outcomes in a US adolescent surgical population. We hypothesized that OUD among adolescent surgical patients is on an upward trajectory and that the presence of OUD is associated with higher risk of postoperative morbidity or mortality. METHODS: Using the pediatric health information system, we performed a 1:1 propensity score-matched, retrospective cohort study of adolescents (10-18 years of age) undergoing inpatient surgery between 2004 and 2019. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. The secondary outcomes were surgical complications and postoperative infection. We also evaluated indicators of resource utilization, including mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and postoperative length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Of 589,098 adolescents, 563 (0.1%) were diagnosed with comorbid OUD (563 were matched on OUD). The prevalence of OUD in adolescents undergoing surgery increased from 0.4 per 1000 cases in 2004 to 1.6 per 1000 cases in 2019, representing an average annual percent change (AAPC) of 9.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7-13.9; P value < .001). The overall postoperative mortality rate was 0.50% (n = 2941). On univariable analysis, mortality rate was significantly higher in adolescents with comorbid OUD than those without comorbid OUD (3.37% vs 0.50%; P < .001). Among propensity-matched pairs, comorbid OUD diagnosis was associated with an estimated 57% relative increase in the risk of surgical complications (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.24-2.00; P < .001). The relative risk of postoperative infection was 2-fold higher in adolescents with comorbid OUD than in those without OUD (aRR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.62-2.51; P < .001). Adolescents with comorbid OUD had an increased risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and extended postoperative LOS. CONCLUSIONS: OUD is becoming increasingly prevalent in adolescents presenting for surgery. Comorbid OUD is an important determinant of surgical complications, postoperative infection, and resource utilization, underscoring the need to consider OUD as a critical, independent risk factor for postsurgical morbidity.","output":"Prevalence and Outcomes of Opioid Use Disorder in Pediatric Surgical Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a lack of clear evidence to guide healthcare professionals, the public and policymakers.

Some of these have now been linked to concerns about fraud or poor research reporting. This article will focus on the scientific literature and how apparently fraudulent studies were published and influenced treatment decisions, on-going research and public health guidelines.

These responsibilities apply in various ways to editors, peer-reviewers, news media reporters, and those making treatment decisions, including clinicians, policymakers and the general public. While research article authors have the primary ethical responsibility to reject fraudulent or inaccurate claims, the readers of health research must carefully evaluate all publications. To detect and reject fraudulent healthcare claims, readers need critical appraisal skills that match their level of engagement with those articles. The core principles of critical appraisal will be described in the article, and how they can be adapted for different types of readers. Exemplar tools that develop critical appraisal skills will be noted, with reviews of ivermectin's efficacy explored as examples.

However, almost all of the reported viral RdRp inhibitors (either repurposed drugs or new antiviral agents) lack selectivity against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Herein, I discovered a new favipiravir derivative, (E)-N-(4-cyanobenzylidene)-6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (cyanorona-20), as the first potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor with very high selectivity (209- and 45-fold more potent than favipiravir and remdesivir, respectively). Based on the significant reduction in the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication/copies, strong computational cyanorona-20 ligand-RdRp protein interactions, and anti-RdRp activity of the parent favipiravir drug, SARS-CoV-2 inhibition is thought to be mediated through the coronaviral-2 RdRp inhibition. This promising selective anti-COVID-19 compound is also, to the best of our knowledge, the first bioactive derivative of favipiravir, the known antiinfluenza and antiviral drug. This new nucleoside analog was designed, synthesized, characterized, computationally studied (through pharmacokinetic calculations along with computational molecular modeling and prediction), and biologically evaluated for its anti-COVID-19 activities (through a validated in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay). The results of the biological assay showed that cyanorona-20 surprisingly exhibited very significant anti-COVID-19 activity (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.45 M), and, in addition, it could be also a very promising lead compound for the design of new anti-COVID-19 agents. Cyanorona-20 is a new favipiravir derivative with promise for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It is unclear how shelter-in-place orders affected acute CVD hospitalizations, illness severity, and outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: COVID-19 pandemic was associated with reduced acute CVD hospitalizations (heart failure [HF], acute coronary syndrome [ACS], and stroke [CVA]), and worse HF illness severity. METHODS: We compared acute CVD hospitalizations at Duke University Health System before and after North Carolina's shelter-in-place order (January 1-March 29 vs. March 30-August 31), and used parallel comparison cohorts from 2019. We explored illness severity among admitted HF patients using ADHERE (\\"high risk\\": >2 points) and GWTG-HF (\\">10%\\": >57 points) in-hospital mortality risk scores, as well as echocardiography-derived parameters. RESULTS: Comparing hospitalizations during January 1-March 29 (N = 1618) vs. March 30-August 31 (N = 2501) in 2020, mean daily CVD hospitalizations decreased (18.2 vs. 16.1 per day, p = .0036), with decreased length of stay (8.4 vs. 7.5 days, p = .0081) and no change in in-hospital mortality (4.7 vs. 5.3%, p = .41). HF hospitalizations decreased (9.0 vs. 7.7 per day, p = .0019), with higher ADHERE (\\"high risk\\": 2.5 vs. 4.5%; p = .030), but unchanged GWTG-HF (\\">10%\\": 5.3 vs. 4.6%; p = .45), risk groups. Mean LVEF was lower (39.0 vs. 37.2%, p = .034), with higher mean LV mass (262.4 vs. 276.6 g, p = .014). CONCLUSIONS: CVD hospitalizations, HF illness severity, and echocardiography measures did not change between admission periods in 2019. Evaluating short-term data, the COVID-19 shelter-in-place order was associated with reductions in acute CVD hospitalizations, particularly HF, with no significant increase in in-hospital mortality and only minor differences in HF illness severity.","output":"Acute cardiovascular hospitalizations and illness severity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effective adoption of online learning depends on user satisfaction as distance education approaches suffer from a lack of commitment that may lead to failures and dropouts. The adaptive learning literature argues that an alternative to achieve student satisfaction is to treat them individually, delivering the educational content in a personalized manner.

The search for an optimal sequence from ever-growing databases is an NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem. Although some approaches have been proposed, it is challenging to assess their contributions due to the lack of benchmark data available. This paper presents a procedure to create synthetic dataset to evaluate ACS approaches and, as a concept proof, analyzes metaheuristics usually used in ACS approaches: Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and PreyCPredator Algorithm using students learning goals and their extrinsic and intrinsic information. We also propose an approach based on Differential Evolution (DE). The computational experiments include synthetic datasets with a varied amount of learning materials and real-world datasets for comparison.

However, it remains unknown whether the complexity of the procedure allows its duplication in other non-pioneer centers. We attempt to address this issue by presenting our cumulative experience with RARC and intracorporeal neobladder formation. METHODS We retrospectively identified 62 RARCs in 50 men and 12 women (mean age 63.6 years) in two tertiary centers. Intracorporeal Studer neobladders were created, duplicating the steps of standard open surgery. Perioperative and postoperative variables and complications were analyzed using standardized tools. Functional and oncological results were assessed. RESULTS The mean operative time was 476.9 min (range, 310 to 690) and blood loss was 385 ml (200 to 800). The mean hospital stay was 16.7 (12 to 62) days with no open conversion. Perioperative complications were grade II in 15, grade III in 11, and grade IV in 5 patients. The mean nodal yield was 22.9 (8 to 46). Positive margins were found in in 6.4%. The 90- and 180-day mortality rates were 0% and 3.3%. The average follow-up was 37.3 months (3 to 52). Continence was achieved in 88% of patients. The cancer-specific survival rate and overall survival rate were 84% and 71%, respectively.

The intervention efficacy or effectiveness hierarchy, however, is still not clear. Therefore, we propose to conduct a network meta-analysis to assess the relative effectiveness of various types of DTPs. We aim to establish the differential effectiveness of these therapies in terms of symptom reduction and provide high-quality evidence for treating PTSD. METHODS AND ANALYSES: We will search Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, clinical trials (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov) and other academic platforms for relevant studies, mainly in English and Chinese (as we plan to conduct a trial on PTSD patients in Wuhan, China, based on the results of this network meta-analysis), from inception to October 2020. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses investigating the effectiveness of any DTPs for PTSD patients for any controlled condition will be included. The number of intervention sessions and the research duration are unlimited; the effects for different durations will be tested via sensitivity analysis. For this project, the primary measure of outcome will be PTSD symptoms at the end of treatment using raw scores for one widely used PTSD scale, PCL-5. Secondary outcome measures will include (1) dropout rate; (2) effectiveness at longest follow-up, but not more than 12 months and (3) patients functional recovery ratio (such as the return-to-work ratio or percentage of sick leave). Bayesian network meta-analysis will be conducted for all relative outcome measures. We will perform subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis to see whether the results are influenced by study characteristics. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluation framework will be adopted to evaluate the quality of evidence contributing to network estimates of the primary outcome.

DESIGN: Qualitative interpretive description approach. METHODS: Between July and September 2020, a web\\\\based cross\\\\sectional study was conducted among RNs and LPNs in Quebec, Canada. Included in this survey was an open\\\\ended question allowing nurses to describe the occupational and personal life dimensions that were impacted by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Thematic analysis was used to interpret the qualitative data from this open\\\\ended question. Reporting followed the Standards For Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR). RESULTS: Of the 1860 survey respondents, 774 RNs and 43 LPNs responded to the open\\\\ended question (total n = 819). For the occupational dimension, six themes were identified: impacts of infection control on work, change in daily work tasks, offloading and reorganization of care, deterioration of working conditions, increased stress at work and issues related to the profession. For the personal dimension, four themes were found: impacts on the family, dealing with changes about leisure and personal life, impacts on physical and psychological health. CONCLUSION: Knowing the dimensions affected by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic could help to identifying appropriate interventions to support RNs and LPNs. IMPACT: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has significantly impacted the occupational and personal lives RNs and LPNs working in the Quebec healthcare system.

The appropriateness and usefulness of these technologies as a containment measure have since sparked political and academic discussions globally. The present paper contributes to this debate through an exploration of how the national daily newspapers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland reported on the development and adoption of digital contact-tracing apps during early and after stages of the lockdown. These countries were among the first in Europe to develop apps and were critical voices in the debate of decentralized vs. centralized data processing. We conducted thematic analysis on news coverage published between January and May 2020 in high-circulation national daily newspapers from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. A total of 148 articles from nine newspaper companies were included in the final analysis. From our analysis emerged six core themes of the development and adoption of digital contact tracing apps: 1) data governance; 2) role of IT giants; 3) scientific rigor; 4) voluntariness; 5) functional efficacy; 6) role of the app. These results shed light on the different facets of discussion regarding digital contact tracing as portrayed in German-speaking media.

We show that in the second and third weeks after the 2020 elections (held on October 9C10), new COVID-19 infections grew significantly faster in voting compared to non-voting constituencies. A temporarily related peak in hospital admissions and essentially no changes in test positivity rates suggest that the acceleration was not merely due to increased testing. The acceleration did not occur in the population above 65, consistently with strategic risk-avoidance by older voters.

While abuse by current partners as well as family members increased on average by 8.5% and 16.4% respectively over the lockdown period, abuse by ex-partners declined by 9.4%. Moreover, we disentangle the effects of the changes in the incidence and the changes in reporting. We show that all the increase in domestic abuse calls is driven by third party reporting, and this increase is 32% higher in areas with high density where neighbours can overhear the abuse, yet no changes in victim reporting. We also analyse the calls by their reporting times and find that reports of abuse after working hours rose by 10-15% indicating that what we are observing isnt purely a reporting effect. This suggests that under reporting is present in the lockdown, particularly in households where the abuse cannot be reported by a neighbour, and emphasizes community reporting.

Therefore, these caregivers need to have their hardiness empowered to provide proper and appropriate care to these older adults. From the introduction of the concept of hardiness, few studies have been conducted to assess the hardiness of caregivers of patients with AD. Presumably, one reason for this knowledge gap is the lack of a proper scale to evaluate hardiness in this group. This study was conducted to develop a reliable and valid Family Caregivers Hardiness Scale (FCHS) to measure this concept accurately among Iranian family caregivers sample. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study with a sequential-exploratory mixed-method approach. The concept of family caregivers hardiness was clarified using deductive content analysis, and item pools were generated. In the psychometric step, the samples were 435 family caregivers with a mean age of 50.26 (SD  13.24), and the data were gathered via an online form questionnaire. In this step, the items of the FCHS were evaluated using face and content validity. Then, the factor structure was determined and confirmed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) followed by convergent and divergent validity, respectively. Finally, scale reliability, including stability, and internal consistency were evaluated. RESULTS: The finding revealed that FCHS consists of five factors, namely, Religious Coping (5 items), Self-Management (6 items), Empathic Communication (3 items), Family Affective Commitment (3 items), and Purposeful Interaction (4 items) that explained 58.72% of the total variance. The results of CFA showed a good model fit. Reliability showed acceptable internal consistency and stability. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the psychometric evaluation of the FCHS, turned out that the concept of hardiness in Iranian family caregivers is a multidimensional concept that is most focused on individual-cultural values, emotional family relationships, and social relationships. The designed scale also has acceptable validity and reliability features that can be used in future studies to measure this concept in family caregivers.","output":"Development and Psychometric Evaluation of Family Caregivers Hardiness Scale: A Sequential-Exploratory Mixed-Method Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic raises significance for a potential influenza therapeutic compound, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), which has been extensively used in personal care products as a positively-charged quaternary ammonium antibacterial agent. CPC is currently in clinical trials to assess its effects on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) morbidity. Two published studies have provided mouse and human data indicating that CPC may alleviate influenza infection, and here we show that CPC (0.1 M, 1 hour) reduces zebrafish mortality and viral load following influenza infection. However, CPC mechanisms of action upon viral-host cell interaction are currently unknown. We have utilized super-resolution fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy to probe the mode of CPC action. Reduction in density of influenza viral protein hemagglutinin (HA) clusters is known to reduce influenza infectivity: here, we show that CPC (at non-cytotoxic doses, 5-10 M) reduces HA density and number of HA molecules per cluster within the plasma membrane of NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. HA is known to colocalize with the negatively-charged mammalian lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2); here, we show that nanoscale co-localization of HA with the PIP2-binding Pleckstrin homology (PH) reporter in the plasma membrane is diminished by CPC. CPC also dramatically displaces the PIP2-binding protein myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) from the plasma membrane of rat RBL-2H3 mast cells; this disruption of PIP2 is correlated with inhibition of mast cell degranulation. Together, these findings offer a PIP2-focused mechanism underlying CPC disruption of influenza and suggest potential pharmacological use of this drug as an influenza therapeutic to reduce global deaths from viral disease.","output":"Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) reduces zebrafish mortality from influenza infection: Super-resolution microscopy reveals CPC interference with multiple protein interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in immune function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reproductive success in the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) was measured using a diallel-mating scheme. Over a 48-month period we generated 4,448 litters, and provided 24,782 weaned pups for use in 16 different published experiments. We identified factors that affect the average litter size in a cross by estimating the overall contribution of parent-of-origin, heterosis, inbred, and epistatic effects using a Bayesian zero-truncated overdispersed Poisson mixed model. The phenotypic variance of litter size has a substantial contribution (82%) from unexplained and environmental sources, but no detectable effect of seasonality. Most of the explained variance was due to additive effects (9.2%) and parental sex (maternal vs. paternal strain; 5.8%), with epistasis accounting for 3.4%. Within the parental effects, the effect of the dams strain explained more than the sires strain (13.2% vs. 1.8%), and the dams strain effects account for 74.2% of total variation explained. Dams from strains C57BL/6J and NOD/ShiLtJ increased the expected litter size by a mean of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, whereas dams from strains WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and CAST/EiJ reduced expected litter size by a mean of 1.51, 0.81, and 0.90 pups. Finally, there was no strong evidence for strain-specific effects on sex ratio distortion. Overall, these results demonstrate that strains vary substantially in their reproductive ability depending on their genetic background, and that litter size is largely determined by dams strain rather than sires strain effects, as expected. This analysis adds to our understanding of factors that influence litter size in mammals, and also helps to explain breeding successes and failures in the extinct lines and surviving CC strains.","output":"A Diallel of the Mouse Collaborative Cross Founders Reveals Strong Strain-Specific Maternal Effects on Litter Size"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health threat posed by the novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic has particular implications for people with disabilities, including vulnerability to exposure and complications, and concerns about the role of ableism in access to treatment and medical rationing decisions.

Some of the main theoretical challenges include characterizing and measuring the dynamics of responses, relating social and individual aspects in group problem solving, incorporating soft skills (e.g., experience, social aspects, and emotions) to the theory of decision making in groups, and understanding the evolution of processes guided by soft utilities (hard-to-quantify utilities), e.g., social interactions and emotional rewards. This paper presents a novel theoretical model (TM) that describes the process of solving open-ended problems in small groups. It mathematically presents the connection between group member characteristics, interactions in a group, group knowledge evolution, and overall novelty of the responses created by a group as a whole. Each member is modeled as an agent with local knowledge, a way of interpreting the knowledge, resources, social skills, and emotional levels associated to problem goals and concepts. Five solving strategies can be employed by an agent to generate new knowledge. Group responses form a solution space, in which responses are grouped into categories based on their similarity and organized in abstraction levels. The solution space includes concrete features and samples, as well as the causal sequences that logically connect concepts with each other. The model was used to explain how member characteristics, e.g., the degree to which their knowledge is similar, relate to the solution novelty of the group. Model validation compared model simulations against results obtained through behavioral experiments with teams of human subjects, and suggests that TMs are a useful tool in improving the effectiveness of small teams.","output":"A novel agent-based, evolutionary model for expressing the dynamics of creative open-problem solving in small groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We propose a new minimally invasive technique by laparoscopic approach which minimizes parietal damage and allows precise location of the fistula, hence reduces blind dissection. METHODS Ten consecutive patients suffering from a HRVF benefited from the described technique. Location and time frame were east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and September 2012 through January 2014. By laparoscopy, dissection of the mesorectum in the \\"holy plane\\" is taken posteriorly as distally on the sacrum as possible. Dissection subsequently continues laterally beyond the fistula in an effort to maximally circumvene the fistulous area where no plane of cleavage can be found. If the cleavage plane beyond the fistula addresses a healthy rectum, a suture of vaginal and rectal defect is performed. If the cleavage plane beyond the fistula involves significant laceration of the rectum, while leaving at least 2 cm of healthy rectum above the sphincter, rectal resection and colorectal anastomosis are performed. If the rectal laceration involves the distal 2 cm but halts short of the sphincter (large fistula), the pull-through technique is performed. RESULTS Of ten participants, four had large HRVF and two presented significant fibrosis. Three underwent simple suture of rectal and vaginal defect, one rectal resection and six a \\"pull-through\\" technique. The median procedure time was 1h50 (1h00-3h30). There was no morbidity. None of the patients required protective ileostomy or colostomy. Nine patients were declared clinically cured with a median follow-up of 14.3 months (11-36).

The most likely explanation for these 573 discrepancies was related for 44.9% of the situations to the clinical evolution of the disease, 27.9% to preanalytical factors, and 25.3% to stochasticity of the assay. Finally, 11 discrepant results could not be explained, including 8 for which clinical data was not available. For patients repeatedly tested on the same day, the second result confirmed a first negative or positive result in 99.2% or 88.9% of cases, respectively. The implemented quality-monitoring strategy allowed to: i) assist the investigation of discrepant results ii) focus the attention of medical microbiologists onto results requiring a specific expertise and iii) maintain an acceptable turnaround time. This work highlights the high RT-PCR consistency for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and the necessity for automated processes to handle a huge number of microbiological results while preserving quality.","output":"Computer-Aided Medical Microbiology Monitoring Tool: A Strategy to Adapt to the SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic and That Highlights RT-PCR Consistency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 28, 2020, in response to the rapidly accelerating COVID-19 pandemic, U.S FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients based on limited in-vitro and anecdotal clinical data.

Nevertheless, several empirical studies as well as theoretical approaches from the past decade impugn this relation for real markets with their immanent inefficiencies. However, these questions are rather than academic in nature: Especially the influence of macroeconomic conditions on the market perception of debt issues is from high economic importance, since the need for new liquidity usually becomes even more urgent when the economic conditions worsen.Design/methodology/approachThis paper analyzes the reaction of shareholders to the issue of debt by Latin American firms under special consideration of the macroeconomic sentiment. To do so, a sample of debt issued by Latin American companies between 2003 and 2010 is empirically examined through an event study.FindingsThe authors empirically demonstrate that specifically in Latin America, debt issuing companies show a significant underperformance during recessionary periods and an overperformance during nonrecessionary periods. These findings differ from previous results for mature capital markets. The authors conclude that not only the overall economic conditions matter to explain stock market reactions on bond issues but also the maturity of the corporate debt market plays an important role.Originality/valueThe authors provide first evidence that the previously described changes in the returns on specific stocks depending on the economic sentiment (Baker and Wurgler, 2006) are under certain conditions also present in the market for corporate debt.","output":"The performance of corporate bond issuers in times of financial crisis: empirical evidence from Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early diagnostics and point-of-care (POC) devices can save peoples lives or drastically improve their quality.

Apart from the conflict of the potential predation of livestock, there is the insecurity perception of a potential attack on people. To gain a better understanding of how, when, and how close pumas approached human settlements, we analyze 51 puma records near populated areas over eight years in central Chile. The results show that pumas approached human-populated areas; in 23.5% of the records pumas are found between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement, 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m, and 51% are over 5000 m. We associate puma records with landscape features, such as mountain ranges, land-use, road, and urban infrastructure; and based on previous knowledge of puma biology, behavior, and habitat preference, we identify their area of occupation and the potential biological corridor used for their movements from the Andes Range to the coast. Our results show the adaptability of pumas to human-dominated landscapes, and their capacity to overcome landscape barriers, such as human infrastructure, contributing to a better understanding of the population dynamics in the study area. Studies on humanCcarnivore coexistence, through formulas that consider local realities and the reduction of implicit risks for humans, are urgently needed, both globally and locally, and likely the only way to secure the long-term conservation of pumas in human-dominated landscapes. ABSTRACT: The wildlandCurban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapescreating a number of management and conservation challenges. Wildlife sightings near human settlements have appeared to increase in the last years. This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the OHiggins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km(2) of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range. Our results contribute to the understanding of the presence and movements of P. concolor near urban areas and human settlements, confirming their persistence in and adaptation to human-dominated landscapes. We also provide insights into humanCcarnivore coexistence in the current global context in the densely populated central Chile.","output":"Puma (Puma concolor) in the Neighborhood?

We will develop an evidence-based catalogue of interventions (Oral Health Toolbox) and provide care-accompanying reinstruction and remotivation of nursing staff by dental assistants (DA). We hypothesise that such intervention will significantly improve OHrQL, daily oral hygiene/care behaviour and is cost-effective. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A scoping review will be used to identify possible intervention components. Mixed methods will be used to identify barriers and enablers of oral hygiene and care in German LRC. The result will be the Oral Health Toolbox, a two-phased instrument supporting both initial intervention allocation to improve oral health/hygiene and reinstruction/remotivation. A two-arm clustered, randomised controlled trial (ratio of 1:1 via block randomisation) will be performed in LRC in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Each nursing home represents a cluster. Based on a feasibility study, considering clustering and possible attrition, we aim at recruiting 618 residents in 18 clusters. In the intervention group, dentists will assign one or more intervention component from the box (phase 1). During follow-up, nursing staff will be reinstructed and remotivated by DA, who use the box to decide how to maintain the intervention (phase 2). In the control group residents will receive care as usual. The primary outcome, OHrQL, will be measured using the General Oral Health Assessment Index. Secondary outcomes include pain condition, general health-related quality of life, caries increment, oral/prosthetic hygiene and gingival status, incidence of dental emergencies and hospitalisations, and cost-utility/effectiveness. The endpoints will be measured at baseline and after 12 months. For our primary outcome, a mixed-linear model will be used within an intention-to-treat analysis. A process evaluation using mixed methods will be conducted alongside the trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval by the University of Kiel was granted (D480/18).

ParticipantsThe target population is hospitalized adults with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, hypoxemia that requires []40% oxygen or [] 5 L/min by nasal cannula, and abnormal chest x-ray. We will exclude patients with any of the following: immediate need for intubation; altered mental status; contraindication to prone positioning; hemodynamic instability; body mass index > 40 kg/m2; third trimester pregnancy; do not intubate status; previous enrolment or intubation within the same hospital admission; and prone positioning for more than one day prior to randomization.

The right to health has traditionally been included in the second generation of human rights;therefore, presumably, it does not in itself give rise to any specific rights for an individual. However, the European Court on Human Rights (ECtHR) has recently been linking the right to health with specific provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular with Articles 2, 3, and 8. We analyse the Court's relevant rulings and their possible consequences for the assessment of the actions taken by the States Parties in order to fight COVID-19, with special emphasis on possible State responsibility for violating the Convention. This can happen when the State's actions result in different levels of health care access available to different groups of patients (patients with COVID-19 and patients with other conditions).

Several sigma-1 receptor (Sig1R) ligands have been demonstrated to regulate the seizure threshold in acute and chronic seizure models. However, the mechanism by which Sig1R modulates the excitatory and inhibitory pathways in the brain has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility to seizures of wild type (WT) and Sig1R knockout (Sig1R-/-) mice in intravenous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and (+)-bicuculline (BIC) infusion-induced acute seizure and Sig1R antagonist NE-100-induced seizure models. To determine possible molecular mechanisms, we used quantitative PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to assess the possible involvement of several seizure-related genes and proteins. Peripheral tissue contractile response of WT and Sig1R-/- mice was studied in an isolated vasa deferentia model. The most important finding was the significantly decreased expression of the R2 subunit of the GABA-B receptor in the hippocampus and habenula of Sig1R-/- mice. Our results demonstrated that Sig1R-/- mice have decreased thresholds for PTZ- and BIC-induced tonic seizures. In the NE-100-induced seizure model, Sig1R-/- animals demonstrated lower seizure scores, shorter durations and increased latency times of seizures compared to WT mice. Sig1R-independent activities of NE-100 included downregulation of the gene expression of iNOS and GABA-A ?32 and inhibition of KCl-induced depolarization in both WT and Sig1R-/- animals. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the lack of Sig1R resulted in decreased expression of the R2 subunit of the GABA-B receptor and increased susceptibility to seizures. Our results confirm that Sig1R is a significant molecular target for seizure modulation and warrants further investigation for the development of novel anti-seizure drugs.","output":"Genetic inactivation of the sigma-1 chaperone protein results in decreased expression of the R2 subunit of the GABA-B receptor and increased susceptibility to seizures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Countries face different poliovirus risks, which imply different benefits associated with continued and future use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and/or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the ESRD patients at increased risk of COVID-19 -related death and its associated factors. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 74 patients with ESRD and 446 patients without ESRD hospitalized for COVID-19 in Alborz province, Iran, from Feb 20 2020 to Apr 26 2020. Data on demographic factors, medical history, Covid-19- related symptoms, and blood tests were obtained from the medical records of patients with confirmed COVID-19. We fitted univariable and multivariable Cox regression models to assess the association of underlying condition ESRD with the COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. Results were presented as crude and adjusted Hazard Ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In the ESRD subgroup, demographic factors, medical history, symptoms, and blood parameters on the admission of survivors were compared with non-survivors to identify factors that might predict a high risk of mortality. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with ESRD had in-hospital mortality of 37.8% compared to 11.9% for those without ESRD (P value < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, age, sex, and comorbidities, ESRD patients were more likely to experience in-hospital mortality compared to non-ESRD patients (Adjusted HR (95% CI): 2.59 (1.55-4.32)). The Log-rank test revealed that there was a significant difference between the ESRD and non-ESRD groups in terms of the survival distribution (&#967;2 (1) = 21.18, P-value < 0.001). In the ESRD subgroup, compared to survivors, non-survivors were older, and more likely to present with lack of consciousness or O2 saturation less than 93%; they also had lower lymphocyte but higher neutrophil counts and AST concentration at the presentation (all p -values < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that the presence of ESRD would be regarded as an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients, especially in those who are older than age 65 years and presented with a lack of consciousness or O2 saturation less than 93%.","output":"The risk factors associated with COVID-19-Related death among patients with end-stage renal disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the impact of implementation fidelity on community-based outcomes, it is important to understand how fidelity may change over time as providers learn an intervention. Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up is an evidence-based early intervention that assesses fidelity during weekly supervision. Providers are first trained in the infant model, with toddler model training considered to be a separate, specialized opportunity. The current study examined changes in fidelity, measured by in-the-moment commenting, as providers moved from infant to toddler certification. An initial drop, with a subsequent increase, in commenting fidelity over the training year was expected. Results were consistent with our hypotheses, demonstrating a main effect of time, with most indices of commenting data initially decreasing and then increasing. These findings are consistent with research suggesting that fluctuation in fidelity is typical within community dissemination and suggests that ongoing supervision after the initial training is useful in facilitating successful skill development.","output":"Changes in provider Fidelity after introducing a new model of intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by COVID-19, being a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, can predispose to arterial and venous thrombotic disease, in response to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and venous stasis.

This strategy has also been widely employed in veterinary medicine. These facts suggest a fast way out of the current pandemic crisis, namely that SARS-CoV-2 could be directly used as a live vaccine. Beyond the two traditional mechanisms to guarantee the LPV's safety (the LPV seed strain is properly selected; the LPV is inoculated bypassing the respiratory sites of pathology), three novel mechanisms to further ensure the LPV's safety are available (the virus replication is inhibited with early use of an antiviral drug; symptomatic LPV recipients are cured with convalescent plasma; the LPV is inoculated in the hot season). This LPV strategy has multiple potential advantages over other options and could reduce morbidity and mortality greatly as well as the economic loss caused by the pandemic.

We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulse therapy for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In this retrospective, observational cohort study, seventy patients (age, 35C91 years) who were admitted to Saitama Medical University Hospital in Japan between March 2020 and January 2021 due to COVID-19 pneumonia were included. The difference in mortality between the methylprednisolone pulse therapy (n = 22) and dexamethasone therapy (n = 48) groups was the primary outcome. Between-group differences in the average length of intensive care unit stay, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and incidence of treatment-related adverse events were the secondary outcomes. The methylprednisolone pulse therapy group showed a significantly lower mortality rate (3.8% vs. 20.2%, p = 0.006) and increased survival rate compared with the dexamethasone therapy group (p = 0.044). Additionally, without statistical significance, the average length of intensive care unit stay tended to be shorter in the methylprednisolone pulse therapy group (11.5 6.1 days) than in the dexamethasone therapy group (22.3 23.1 days) (p = 0.793). The average duration of invasive mechanical ventilation also tended to be shorter in the methylprednisolone pulse therapy group (15.3 10.1 vs. 28.8 9.2 days, p = 0.120). There were no significant differences in the incidence of treatment-related serious adverse events between the two groups.

To develop a deeper understanding of the contribution of PM2.5 in the propagation of the SAR-CoV-2 virus in the population, the deposition patterns and efficiencies (DEs) of PM2.5 laced with the virus in healthy and asthmatic airways are studied. Physiologically correct 3-D models for generations 10-12 of the human airways are applied to carry out a numerical analysis of two-phase flow for full breathing cycles. Two concentrations of PM2.5 are applied for the simulation, i.e., 30 ga? m-3 and 80 ga? m-3 for three breathing statuses, i.e., rest, light exercise, and moderate activity. All the PM2.5 injected into the control volume is assumed to be 100% contaminated with the SAR-CoV-2 virus. Skewed air-flow phenomena at the bifurcations are proportional to the Reynolds number at the inlet, and their intensity in the asthmatic airway exceeded that of the healthy one. Upon exhalation, two peak air-flow vectors from daughter branches combine to form one big vector in the parent generation. Asthmatic airway models has higher deposition efficiencies (DEs) for contaminated PM2.5 as compared to the healthy one. Higher DEs arise in the asthmatic airway model due to complex secondary flows which increase the impaction of contaminated PM2.5 on airways' walls.","output":"An investigation for airflow and deposition of PM2.5 contaminated with SAR-CoV-2 virus in healthy and diseased human airway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preprint servers, such as arXiv and bioRxiv, have disrupted the scientific communication landscape by providing rapid access to research before peer review. medRxiv was launched as a free online repository for preprints in the medical, clinical, and related health sciences in 2019. In this review, we present the uptake of preprint server use in nephrology and discuss specific considerations regarding preprint server use in medicine. Distribution of kidney-related research on preprint servers is rising at an exponential rate. Survey of nephrology journals identified that 15 of 17 (88%) are publishing original research accepted submissions that have been uploaded to preprint servers. After reviewing 52 clinically impactful trials in nephrology discussed in the online Nephrology Journal Club (NephJC), an average lag of 300 days was found between study completion and publication, indicating an opportunity for faster research dissemination. Rapid review of papers discussing benefits and risks of preprint server use from the researcher, publisher, or end user perspective identified 53 papers that met criteria. Potential benefits of biomedical preprint servers included rapid dissemination, improved transparency of the peer review process, greater visibility and recognition, and collaboration. However, these benefits come at the risk of rapid spread of results not yet subjected to the rigors of peer review. Preprint servers shift the burden of critical appraisal to the reader. Media may be especially at risk due to their focus on \\"late-breaking\\" information. Preprint servers have played an even larger role when late-breaking research results are of special interest, such as during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

METHODS: We searched three databases for relevant terms related to COVID\\\\19 and transplantation. 50 studies, including 337 patients, were reviewed. RESULTS: 236 patients were male, with a mean age of 49.9 years. The most prevalent group was the kidney 57.0%, followed by 17.2% heart, and 13.6% liver. Fever and Cough were the most reported clinical presentations. Infiltration (55.4%) in chest x\\\\ray and ground\\\\glass opacity (67.1%) in CT scans were the most radiological findings. It was found that 96.8% and 72.4% of patients present with CRP level and lymphocytopenia, respectively, and 70.6% of kidney recipients patients presented with high creatinine levels.

Although all residency programs are expected to provide didactic content for their residents, the format of these sessions vary by presenter and institution. Currently, it is not clear which didactic format provides the most educational benefit. Herein, we aimed to evaluate which attributes of didactic education are most preferred by contemporary urology trainees. METHODS: Urology trainees during the 2020-21 academic year were invited to complete an online choice-based conjoint analysis exercise assessing four attributes associated with didactic education: method of delivery, presentation style, presenter credentials, and curriculum design. The survey was distributed via social media platforms and the Urology Collaborative Online Video Didactics (COViD) website. A sensitivity analysis (Sawtooth Software, Inc. Utah USA) was used to determine relative importance of each attribute and predict trainee preferences in didactic format (online/virtual vs. inperson). RESULTS: Of the 431 trainees who received the survey, 73 (17%) completed the conjoint analysis exercise, including 60 participants from the United States and 11 from international training programs. Nearly all trainees (72/73) preferred at least 1 hour of dedicated didactic education per week, with 67% responding that 2-3 hours of didactic time per week is ideal. Overall, the majority of respondents preferred online/virtual presentations (77%, 95% CI 70-84%) compared to in-person presentations. Respondents placed the most importance on presenter credentials, preferring national experts from visiting institutions to faculty members from their local institutions. Conjoint analysis revealed a preference trend toward an online didactic curriculum by increasing PGY year, with senior residents and fellows showing stronger preferences for online didactics compared to more junior trainees (Figure 1). CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary urology trainees prefer didactic education that is available in an online/virtual format, standardized across training institutions, and organized and presented by national experts in the field.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 16,416 people covering three risk groups was conducted between 3C16 September 2020 using the state of Karnatakas infrastructure of 290 healthcare facilities across all 30 districts. Participants were further classified into risk subgroups and sampled using stratified sampling. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active and total prevalence (either IgG or active or both), while multinomial regression identified predictors. RESULTS: The overall adjusted total prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27.7% (95% CI 26.1C29.3), IgG 16.8% (15.5C18.1) and active infection fraction 12.6% (11.5C13.8).

The heterogeneity of mosquito bites of humans during the spread of dengue virus is an important factor that should be considered when modeling the dynamics. However, traditional models generally assumed homogeneous mixing between humans and vectors, which is inconsistent with reality. In this study, we proposed a compartmental model with negative binomial distribution transmission terms to model this heterogeneity at the population level. By including the aquatic stage of mosquitoes and incorporating the impacts of the environment and climate factors, an extended model was used to simulate the 2014 dengue outbreak in Guangzhou, China, and to simulate the spread of dengue in different scenarios. The results showed that a high level of heterogeneity can result in a small peak size in an outbreak. As the level of heterogeneity decreases, the transmission dynamics approximate the dynamics predicted by the corresponding homogeneous mixing model. The simulation results from different scenarios showed that performing interventions early and decreasing the carrying capacity for mosquitoes are necessary for preventing and controlling dengue epidemics.

Newer study designs are also increasingly implemented, based on in depth phenotypic profiling to achieve more individualized therapy, or on screening strategies to decrease placebo effect and contribute to increase assay sensitivity. These approaches are now considered the most promising to decrease therapeutic failures in neuropathic pain.

Physical distancing interventions and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in unprecedented reductions in many of the constraints on substance use and in critical evolutionarily salient sources of alternative reward, such as social interaction, physical activity, leisure activities and hobbies, and academic and occupational pursuits. Thus, behavioral economics suggests that the pandemic and necessary public health response have created a \\"perfect storm\\" for exacerbation of individual-level and population-level substance use problems and also points to multilevel intervention strategies. We summarize this perspective and research by highlighting 3 critical behavioral processes that will influence drug and alcohol consumption. First, the sudden absence of many effective constraints on substance use (work, school, community, or service obligations) will reduce the actual and perceived cost of use. Second, physical distancing measures will reduce the availability, and increase the cost, of many rewarding substance-free activities and commodities. Third, increased uncertainty around current and future events increases discounting of delayed rewards. These effects will be especially pernicious among populations with existing health disparities. Next, we outline interventions suggested by behavioral economics to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on substance use that are aimed at increasing perceived costs of use; increasing access to substance-free activities, including treatment; and lengthening the timeframe for behavioral allocation and altering environmental contexts to promote healthy choices.

The Morningside Group, a global consortium of interdisciplinary experts advocating for the ethical use of neurotechnology, suggests achieving this by treating legally ND as a body organ (i.e. protecting them through bodily integrity). Although the proposal is currently shaping ND-related policies (most notably, a Neuroprotection Bill of Law being discussed by the Chilean Senate), it is not clear what its conceptual and legal basis is. Treating legally something as something else requires some kind of analogical reasoning, which is not provided by the authors of the proposal. In this paper, I will try to fill this gap by addressing ontological issues related to neurocognitive processes. The substantial differences between ND and body organs or organic tissue cast doubt on the idea that the former should be covered by bodily integrity. Crucially, ND are not constituted by organic material. Nevertheless, I argue that the ND of a subject s are analogous to neurocognitive properties of her brain. I claim that (i) s ND are a medium independent property that can be characterized as natural semantic personal information about her brain and that (ii) s brain not only instantiates this property but also has an exclusive ontological relationship with it: This information constitutes a domain that is unique to her neurocognitive architecture.","output":"Is Your Neural Data Part of Your Mind?

Radiation oncologists at 8 academic institutions offered a presentation covering indications, logistics, efficacy, and toxicity of thoracic radiation. Participants completed a survey to assess their prior exposures to RO and perceived value of the lecture, and objective knowledge gained based on pre/post-lecture questions. Among 121 attendees, 76 completed the pre-test, and 25 the post-test (response rates 62.8% and 20.7%, respectively). Fifty-seven (75.0%) had never previously experienced a RO didactic about lung cancer, 62 (81.6%) had never seen a linear accelerator, and 65 (85.5%) had never rotated in a RO department. The mean pre-test score was 53.5% (SD 17.6%), with a trend (p = 0.066) towards thoracic surgeons (61.5%) performing better than medical oncologists (55.5%) or pulmonologists (48.3%). Level of training (p = 0.130), and prior RO exposures (p = 0.240), did not significantly impact pre-test scores. The mean post-test score of 75.1% (SD 3.6%) was significantly higher than mean pre-test score (p < 0.001). After the lecture, 25 participants (100%) felt more knowledgeable about RO, and 24 (96%) felt more comfortable making appropriate referrals to RO. A didactic lecture about RO for trainees and physicians who treat lung cancer at 8 academic institutions was feasible, filled a gap in exposure, and improved knowledge.

Despite growing research on corruption normalization, less is known about the cognitive and behavioral mechanisms in ethical decision making, the cognitive workings of how individuals reconcile unethical behavior and the social psychological processes behind corruption in society and organizations. Expert interviews reveal internally conflicted multi-layered social identities perpetuating corruption, some embedded in nationalistic history and others tied to the European Union, which supports the divergent paths of CEE countries since the fall of communism. Some moral disengagement mechanisms are common across all three countries, while others are linked to specific circumstances. Social identity mechanisms feed into moral disengagement, which individuals draw upon to reconcile the conflict between unethical behavior and moral codes.

ARDS is a clinical syndrome caused by intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary reasons, which has complex pathogenesis and high mortality rate, its also one of the important factors in death from the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic. It has been reported that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can exert a good effect in the process of treatment. The present study aimed to observe the protective effects of TCM formula Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD) on ARDS rats and explore the pharmacodynamic mechanism of the compound. Methods: : 24 male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=6), blank control group, model group, QFPD group (18.6gkg -1 d -1 ) and dexamethasone group (2mgkg -1 d -1 ). Blank control group rats were given saline, whereas other groups were injected with oleic acid (OA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) successively to establish ARDS model, and observed the behavioral performance of rats after model building. The morphological changes of lung tissue under optical microscope were observed;rat lung index (LI) and lung permeability index (LPI) were measured;blood PH, partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2 , mmHg), partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO 2 , mmHg), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) were measured by blood gas analyzer;the levels of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2 ), 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 (6-keto-PGF1), kerbs von lungren 6 antigen (KL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured via test kit. Results: : Compared with the model group, the two treatment groups could improve the respiratory and lung injury in rats, and could restore the expression levels of thromboxane, various cytokines and protein to varying degrees. Conclusions: : QFPD and dexamethasone have protective effects on ARDS rats induced by jointly injecting OA and LPS, and QFPD has the better effect in between. These may be related to reducing the expression levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, CRP, TXB 2 , KL-6, and increasing the contents of IL-10, 6Keto-PGF1a and SOD vitality in the body.","output":"Pharmacodynamic Study of QingFei Paidu Decoction in the Treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Caused by Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are important pathogens causing respiratory tract infections both in the community and health\\\\care facility settings. They are extremely common causes of morbidity in the competent hosts and some are associated with significant mortality in the compromised individuals. With wider application of molecular techniques, novel viruses are being described and old viruses are found to have new significance in different epidemiological and clinical settings. Some of these emerging pathogens may have the potential to cause pandemics or global spread of a severe disease, as exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza. Antiviral therapy of viral respiratory infections is often unnecessary in the competent hosts because most of them are self\\\\limiting and effective agents are not always available. In the immunocompromised individuals or for infections caused by highly pathogenic viruses, such as avian influenza viruses (AIV), antiviral treatment is highly desirable, despite the fact that many of the agents may not have undergone stringent clinical trials. In immunocompetent hosts, antiviral therapy can be stopped early because adaptive immune response can usually be mounted within 5C14 days. However, the duration of antiviral therapy in immunosuppressed hosts depends on clinical and radiological resolution, the degree and duration of immunosuppression, and therefore maintenance therapy is sometimes needed after the initial response. Immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis appear to be promising directions for future research.

Methods and Material: Participants from general public (n=6995) in 10 preselected areas of city were observed and then interviewed about their perceptions about EMU. Indirect observation of EMU was also done by screening CCTV footage, followed by another set of observation at same places after conducting a health education campaign. Data was entered in Microsoft excel and analyzed using SPSS. P value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: EMU was seen in nearly 62% participants. Younger age, native population, education above matric, persons driving two & four wheelers, had significantly higher compliance. During CCTV observation, EMU was 57.5%, and was highest near public places, roads and intersections while lowest near bus stand and religious places. Some improvement in compliance was seen after health education at these places. Breathing difficulty, no use of wearing mask and feeling uncomfortable were the most common reasons given by participants for non-compliance. Conclusions: EMU was lower in elderly, migrants, less educated, unemployed, daily wage workers, so these groups should be especially sensitized about preventive measures.

This was especially a concern for those who were considered high risk as they would be more prone to suffering from more severe COVID-19 symptoms and at times even death. In this abstract, we investigated which clinical characteristics of multiple myeloma (MM) cancer patients could make them more prone to contracting COVID-19. We also investigated which of these conditions make patients more at risk for experiencing more severe COVID-19 symptoms (PMID: 32950467, PMID: 32353254). Knowing what medical conditions that would make a patient more at risk for contracting or experiencing a more severe case of COVID-19 has been a concern for many, especially for those who suffer from more severe health conditions such as cancer. Methods: MM patient data and demographics were collected through HealthTree ? Cure Hub for Multiple Myeloma. We analyzed medical conditions including hypertension, heart condition, neuropathy condition, and BMI. We also looked into lung condition, kidney condition, diabetes, stroke, smoking history, drug use history, HIV, and Mediterranean descent but did not include in the figure due to small population sizes. We determined whether a patient had to be hospitalized, admitted to the ICU, needed oxygen therapy, or needed a D-dimer test as a severe COVID-19 case. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to quantify the risk for contracting COVID-19 for patients with specific medical conditions and which medical conditions made COVID-19 positive patients more at risk for experiencing a more severe case of COVID-19. Results: Out of the 962 patients that were involved in this study, we found that patients who were overweight were 2% more likely to contract COVID-19 than those who were not overweight. Other medical conditions did not increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, there were 35 patients that were involved in investigating how certain medical conditions may affect the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. We found that overweight patients were 12% more likely to suffer from more severe COVID-19 than those not overweight. Patients who suffered from neuropathy conditions were 3% more likely to experience a more severe COVID-19 case than those who do not have that condition. It is important to note that these results were not statistically significant, although are still informative. Conclusion: Our results show that MM patients who are overweight have a greater tendency to not only contract COVID-19 but experience a more severe case of COVID-19. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that patients who experience neuropathy, common among MM patients, had a higher tendency to experience a more severe case of COVID-19. We speculate whether MM patients, a high-risk group due to their immunocompromised state, took extra care to follow safety recommendations and caution to avoid contracting COVID-19. A logical next step would be to compare medical condition interactions to examine whether patients with more than one condition experience additive or synergistic risk, as well as comparing out results to other high-risk groups. These findings, although not statistically significant, may help MM patients identify which of their own medical conditions may put them more at risk for contracting COVID-19 and thus take precautionary measures.

Employment questions included current and pre-pandemic work status, reasons for not currently working as a dental hygienist, and estimated levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the primary work location. All statistical analysis was conducted in Qualtrics Core XM; cross tabulation was used to examine dental hygienist working patterns and attitudes by age, practice PPE supply, and other factors.Results: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an estimated 8% reduction in dental hygienist employment. The majority (59.1%, n=205) of this reduction is voluntary, with the main reason being general concerns over COVID-19 (48.3%, n=100). Other reasons include issues surrounding childcare and concerns over safety measures in the workplace. Dental hygienists aged 65 and older were most likely to have left the workforce voluntarily.

Among teachers, gaps emerged (Week 9) between e-teaching activities used and their perceived effectiveness. Despite pre-recorded lectures being the most frequently used method, the least gap was associated with live-stream lecturesthe least used. Over time, teacher's perceived effectiveness of e-teaching vs. in-person teaching did not differ significantly overall. When the results among students (Week 7) and teachers (Week 9) were corroborated, a slightly higher percentage of teachers viewed online teaching to be less effective than in-person teaching and a slightly higher percentage of teachers viewed online teaching as far less effective. For preferred learning modes after the resumption of in-person learning, students' preferences did not differ significantly overall (Week 3 vs. week 9). Surveys conducted in Week 9 found that a slightly higher percentage of students (~ 70%) than teachers (~ 60%) preferred some forms of hybrid learning and a lower percentage of students preferred face-to-face learning only. Approximately three quarters of teachers responded that at least 50% of course materials could be mastered by students on their own. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the perceived effectiveness of e-learning among students and teachers has not changed significantly over time. Nor have students' preferences shifted significantly for various learning modes after the in-person learning resumed. However, informative directional trends have emerged. Our research illustrates empirically the need to corroborate students' and instructors' experiences over time to inform more holistic improvements of e-learning.","output":"E-Learning during COVID-19: perspectives and experiences of the faculty and students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus causes viral pneumonia characterized by lower respiratory tract symptoms and 19severe inflammatory response syndrome.

In between these conditions, chronic systemic inflammation related to obese patients is associated with the development of atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, comorbidities that adversely affect the clinical outcome in critical patients with COVID-19. Obesity affects up to 40% of the general population in the USA and more than 30% of the adult population in Chile. Until April 2021, 1,019,478 people have been infected, with 23,524 deaths. Given the coexistence of this worldwide obesity epidemic, COVID-19 negative outcomes are seriously enhanced in the current scenario. On the other hand, obesity is characterized by endothelial dysfunction observed in different vascular beds, an alteration which can be associated with impaired vasodilation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory events. Emerging evidence shows that obesity-related conditions such as endothelial dysfunction are associated with detrimental outcomes for COVID-19 evolution, especially if the patient derives to Intensive Care Units (ICU). This implies the need to understand the pathophysiology of the infection in the obese population, in order to propose therapeutic alternatives and public health policies, especially if the virus remains in the population.

We conducted a mailed questionnaire survey of 2000 noninstitutionalized older adults who were randomly sampled. Of those who completed both the baseline and follow-up surveys in March and October 2020, respectively, participants aged &#8805;70 years without cognitive impairment at baseline were included in the analysis. METHODS: Participants were classified into 4 groups based on their baseline and follow-up social isolation status, which were as follows: \\"remained nonisolated,\\" \\"isolated from nonisolation,\\" \\"nonisolated from isolation,\\" and \\"consistent isolation.\\" Self-reported cognitive function was assessed using the Cognitive Performance Scale, and level 2 (mild impairment) or higher (moderate to severe impairment) was defined as cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Ultimately, 955 older adults were analyzed. The mean age of the participants was 79.6 years (standard deviation = 4.7) and 54.7% were women. During the follow-up period, 54 (5.7%) participants developed cognitive impairment.

However, there is limited understanding of the experiences of care among people affected by cancer and how their experiences may change and evolve against the shifting landscape of COVID-19 incidence, mortality, vaccination and refinements in service delivery. Objectives: This study explores the experiences of cancer care among people affected by cancer in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents the results of the initial cross-sectional semi-structured interviews and the longitudinal qualitative research design which will be employed in this study. Design: A longitudinal descriptive qualitative study. Setting: Ireland. Participants: People living with and after cancer or caring for someone with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Participants were recruited to the study via social media advertisements and consented to participate in up to three semi-structured interviews between January and July 2021. Initial semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 participants in January 2021. Participants completed measures of resilience (2-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale) and distress (The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer). Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically. Results: Participants reported low levels of distress and moderate to high levels of resilience on average. Three themes were generated from analysis of the first phase of cross-sectional interviews. Participants described a counterbalance of being cautious of infection and keeping safe through prevention and shielding strategies. Although hospitals felt safe and were working efficiently, some participants felt COVID-19 had compromised person-centredness and empathy in care. While participants valued the restrictions being taken to minimize infection risk, substitution of face-to-face appointments with telehealth services and attending essential face-to-face appointments alone restricted participants' access to professional and social support. Despite this, many participants felt public health measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 had created a sense of not missing out, feeling safe and reduced difficult social interactions requiring explanation of their diagnosis. Conclusions: There is an opportunity to learn from the experiences of healthcare delivery from the perspectives of people affected by cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results highlight the complexities and dualities of living with, after or caring for someone with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Opportunities for longitudinal qualitative research to explore the evolving experiences, concerns and persistent and emerging unmet information and clinical needs within the rapidly changing socio-political, socio-cultural and healthcare contexts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highlighted.","output":"Experiences of Cancer Care in COVID-19: Phase 1 Results of a Longitudinal Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the practicing gastroenterologist in several ways. Although majority of COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms are also seen. COVID-19 has also disrupted gastrointestinal endoscopy services in numerous ways. There are also concerns regarding the impact of these changes on gastrointestinal cancer screening and management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the implications of COVID-19 for the practicing gastroenterologist. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 patients can have gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and anorexia. Separate from the management of COVID-19 patients, there has been a reduction in endoscopy volume worldwide. This has also resulted in reduction/cessation of in-person clinic visits and an increasing use of telemedicine services. In addition, patients with certain chronic diseases like chronic liver disease or inflammatory bowel disease may have worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUMMARY: Gastroenterologists need to rapidly adapt to the challenges being faced and need to make both systems and practice-based changes to the endoscopy unit and outpatient clinic practices. Gastroenterologists should stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving literature regarding gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients as well as its impact on chronic gastrointestinal illnesses.","output":"Coronavirus disease-2019: implications for the gastroenterologist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed psychotherapists' and patients' ratings of their subjective perception of meaning related to different areas of life before the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the time during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a quantitative cross-sectional study, Austrian psychotherapists (N = 222) were recruited by e-mail, who in turn recruited their patients (N = 139). Therapists and patients were asked to rate the meaning of different areas of life before as well as during the COVID-19 crisis. The psychotherapists showed an overall higher rating of the importance of areas of life compared to their patients (p < 0.001). The rating of the importance of the domains of living was differently affected by the COVID-19 situation (p < 0.001). While the meaning of physical and mental health during COVID-19 was rated higher than before, the opposite was observed for work (p < 0.001). No differences were found for relationships and friends, as well as for hobbies. As no interactions between perspective (therapists vs. patients), area of life, and time point (before vs. during COVID-19) were observed, it can be concluded that the COVID-19 situation changed the subjective attribution of meaning concerning different aspects of life similarly in therapists as well as patients.

The MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G variant predisposes to profound aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity (AIO). Current genotyping approaches take several days, which is unfeasible in acute settings. OBJECTIVE: To develop a rapid point-of-care test (POCT) for the m.1555A>G variant before implementation of this technology in the acute neonatal setting to guide antibiotic prescribing and avoid AIO. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pragmatic prospective implementation trial recruited neonates admitted to 2 large neonatal intensive care units between January 6, 2020, and November 30, 2020, in the UK. INTERVENTIONS: Neonates were tested for the m.1555A>G variant via the rapid POCT on admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome assessed the proportion of neonates successfully tested for the variant of all infants prescribed antibiotics. Secondary outcomes measured whether implementation was negatively associated with routine clinical practice and the performance of the system. The study was statistically powered to detect a significant difference between time to antibiotic administration before and after implementation of the MT-RNR1 POCT. RESULTS: A total of 751 neonates were recruited and had a median (range) age of 2.5 (0-198) days. The MT-RNR1 POCT was able to genotype the m.1555A>G variant in 26 minutes. Preclinical validation demonstrated a 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 93.9%-100.0%) and specificity (95% CI, 98.5%-100.0%). Three participants with the m.1555A>G variant were identified, all of whom avoided aminoglycoside antibiotics. Overall, 424 infants (80.6%) receiving antibiotics were successfully tested for the variant, and the mean time to antibiotics was equivalent to previous practice. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The MT-RNR1 POCT was integrated without disrupting normal clinical practice, and genotype was used to guide antibiotic prescription and avoid AIO. This approach identified the m.1555A>G variant in a practice-changing time frame, and wide adoption could significantly reduce the burden of AIO.","output":"Rapid Point-of-Care Genotyping to Avoid Aminoglycoside-Induced Ototoxicity in Neonatal Intensive Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The inflammatory response in pediatric sepsis is highly dynamic and includes both pro- and anti-inflammatory elements that involve the innate and adaptive immune systems.

When severe, this is termed immunoparalysis and is associated with increased risks for nosocomial infection, prolonged organ dysfunction, and death. This review focuses on the pathophysiology and clinical implications of both over- and under-active immune function in septic children.

By semi-parametrically combining incomplete observed data from three different sourcesCthe monthly Longitudinal Labour Force Survey, the Survey of Income and Housing and administrative payroll dataCwe estimate the impact of Covid-19 on the Australian income distribution and decompose its impact into the income shock effect and the policy effect between February and June 2020, covering the immediate periods before and after the initial Covid-19 outbreak. Our results suggest that, despite growth in unemployment, the Gini coefficient of equivalised household disposable income dropped by more than 0.02 points between February and June 2020. This reduction is due to the additional wage subsidies and welfare supports offered as part of the policy response, offsetting the increase in income inequality from the income shock effect. The results shows the effectiveness of temporary policy measures both in maintaining living standards and avoiding increases in income inequality. However, the heavy reliance on the support measures shown in the modelling raises the possibility that the changes in the income distribution may be reversed, or even that inequality and living standards could substantially worsen once the measures are withdrawn.","output":"Estimating the Impact of Covid-19 and Policy Responses on Australian Income Distribution Using Incomplete Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Local, national, and international health agencies have advocated multi-pronged public health strategies to limit infections and prevent deaths.

Simulation of clinical trials allows in silico exploration of the uncertainties of clinical trial design and can rapidly inform their protocols. We previously published a preliminary model of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further our understanding of COVID-19 and treatment we significantly updated the model by matching a curated dataset spanning viral load and immune responses in plasma and lung. We identified a population of parameter sets to generate heterogeneity in pathophysiology and treatment and tested this model against published reports from interventional SARS-CoV-2 targeting Ab and anti-viral trials. Upon generation and selection of a virtual population, we match both the placebo and treated responses in viral load in these trials. We extended the model to predict the rate of hospitalization or death within a population. Via comparison of the in silico predictions with clinical data, we hypothesize that the immune response to virus is log-linear over a wide range of viral load. To validate this approach, we show the model matches a published subgroup analysis, sorted by baseline viral load, of patients treated with neutralizing Abs. By simulating intervention at different timepoints post infection, the model predicts efficacy is not sensitive to interventions within five days of symptom onset, but efficacy is dramatically reduced if more than five days pass post-symptom onset prior to treatment.","output":"A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Model of the Pathophysiology and Treatment of COVID-19 Predicts Optimal Timing of Pharmacological Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study compared barium esophagram with high-resolution esophageal manometry (HRM) results to determine whether esophagram is an adequate screening examination for esophageal motility disorders, a common cause of dysphagia.

To ensure balanced supplyCdemand of shared cars in the operational areas, ECS operators tend to explore user-based relocation strategies in addition to the costly operator-based ones. Through a stated preference experiment administered in the Netherlands, we study the travel preferences for ECS and user-based relocation strategies in a comprehensive framework integrating people's current mobility choices and contextual variables. Incentives for picking-up/dropping-off shared cars at distant alternative locations and sharing rides are embedded in two sub-experiments of varied trip distances. The results from an error component multinomial logit (EC-MNL) model show multi-faceted preferences. Particularly, we find that people interested in ECS are willing to collaborate with ECS operators. Alternative pick-up is the most favorite relocation strategy, followed by alternative drop-off and sharing rides. The willingness to accept the incentive for additional access and egress time is estimated as high as 0.33 EUR per walking minute. It is also found that respondents do not show significant differences in preferences for car sanitation by ECS operators or self-service during the times of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vaccination for COVID-19 is a critical intervention that is being rolled out globally to end the pandemic. Understanding the spatial inequalities in vaccination coverage and access to vaccination centres is important for planning this intervention nationally. Here, COVID-19 vaccination data, representing the number of people given at least one dose of vaccine, a list of the approved vaccination sites, population data and ancillary GIS data were used to assess vaccination coverage, using Kenya as an example. Firstly, physical access was modelled using travel time to estimate the proportion of population within 1 hour of a vaccination site. Secondly, a Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) model was used to estimate the COVID-19 vaccination coverage and the same framework used to forecast coverage rates for the first quarter of 2022. Nationally, the average travel time to a designated COVID-19 vaccination site (n=622) was 75.5 minutes (Range: 62.9 C 94.5 minutes) and over 87% of the population >18 years reside within 1 hour of a vaccination site.

In the CLARITY study, the safety and efficacy of adjunctive pimavanserin, an inverse agonist at 5-HT2A receptors, were demonstrated when added to existing treatment for MDD. This analysis provides a detailed assessment of the effects of pimavanserin on sexual function from the CLARITY study. METHODS Patients with a diagnosis of MDD in a depressive episode, inadequate response to ongoing antidepressant therapy, and a Montgomery-?sberg Depression Rating Scale total score >20 were randomized to pimavanserin 34 mg/day or placebo added to ongoing treatment with an immediate revision of all selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine for 5 weeks (Stage 1), and nonresponders (<50% improvement from baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAMD-17]) were re-randomized for an additional 5 week (Stage 2). Effects of pimavanserin on the Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Functioning Index (MGH-SFI) and HAMD-17 Item 14 (sexual interest) were examined. RESULTS Among 203 patients (51 on pimavanserin; 152 on placebo), pimavanserin demonstrated significant improvement from baseline to Week 5 on the MGH-SFI (least square [LS]mean difference -0.634, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.964, -0.304]; p = .0002; effect size [ES], Cohen's d: .614). Across Stages 1 and 2, the weighted LSmean difference was -0.468 (95% CI [-0.720, -0.216]; p = .0003) for pimavanserin versus placebo. Mean changes from baseline to Week 5 for MGH-SFI Items 1, 2, 3, and 5 and HAMD Item 14 were significantly (p < .05) greater with pimavanserin versus placebo.

Currently, the risk of blood-borne agent transmission of well-known viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV and HTLV) can be considered as under control in high-resource countries. However, other viruses unknown or unsuspected may be transmitted to recipients by blood-derived products. This is particularly relevant considering that a significant proportion of transfused patients are immunocompromised and more frequently subjected to fatal outcomes. Several measures to prevent transfusion transmission of unknown viruses have been implemented including the exclusion of at-risk donors, leukocyte reduction of donor blood, and physicochemical treatment of the different blood components. However, up to now there is no universal method for pathogen inactivation, which would be applicable for all types of blood components and, equally effective for all viral families. In addition, among available inactivation procedures of viral genomes, some of them are recognized to be less effective on non-enveloped viruses, and inadequate to inactivate higher viral titers in plasma pools or derivatives. Given this, there is the need to implement new methodologies for the discovery of unknown viruses that may affect blood transfusion.

METHODS: All adult patients who were placed on ECMO for ARDS due to COVID-19 between April 2020 and June 2020 (during the first wave of COVID-19) were identified. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients were analyzed with a specific focus on the differences between patients who survived to hospital discharge and those who did not. RESULTS: In total, 20 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. All patients were placed on veno-veno ECMO. Comparing survivors and non-survivors, older age was found to be associated with hospital mortality (p = .02). The following complications were observed: renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (35%, n = 7), bacteremia during ECMO (20%, n = 4), coinfection with bacterial pneumonia (15%, n = 3), cannula site bleeding (15%, n = 3), stroke (10%, n = 2), gastrointestinal bleeding (10%, n = 2), and liver failure (5%, n = 1). The complications associated with patient mortality were culture-positive septic shock (p = .01), culture-negative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (p = .01), and renal failure (p = .01). The causes of death were septic shock (44%, n = 4), culture-negative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (44%, n = 4), and stroke (11%, n = 1).

There are several aspects on counteracting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The f irst aspect covers preventive measures including educational campaigns on HIV/AIDS and promotion of a healthy lifestyle, protected sex, and pre-exposure prophylaxis of vulnerable groups. The second aspect is timely HIV testing and the use of antiretroviral therapy when test results come back positive. The third aspect is the scientif ic research associated with discovering new pharmaceutical agents and developing HIV-1 vaccines. Selecting an adequate tool for quick and accurate in vitro eff icacy assessment is the key aspect for eff icacy assessment of vaccines and chemotherapy drugs. The classical method of virology, which makes it possible to evaluate the neutralizing activity of the sera of animals immunized with experimental vaccines and the eff icacy of chemotherapy agents is the method of neutralization using viral isolates and infectious molecular clones, i. e. infectious viral particles obtained via cell transfection with a plasmid vector including the full-length HIV-1 genome coding structural, regulatory, and accessory proteins of the virus required for the cultivation of replication-competent viral particles in cell culture. However, neutralization assessment using viral isolates and infectious molecular clones is demanding in terms of time, effort, and biosafety measures. An alternative eliminating these disadvantages and allowing for rapid screening is the use of pseudoviruses, which are recombinant viral particles, for the analysis of neutralizing activity. Pseudotyped viruses have defective genomes restricting their replication to a single cycle, which renders them harmless compared to infectious viruses. The present review focuses on describing viral model systems for in vitro eff icacy assessment of vaccines and drugs against HIV-1, which include primary HIV-1 isolates, laboratoryadapted strains, infectious molecular clones, and env-pseudoviruses.

Key Points Question How did health insurance coverage change during the COVID-19 pandemic? Findings In this cross-sectional survey study of more than 1.2 million US adults, rates of employer-sponsored coverage declined and rates of other types of coverage increased after the pandemic began and throughout 2020. Rates of uninsurance increased, particularly during the spring and summer. Meaning While public programs played an important role in protecting US adults from pandemic-driven declines in employer-sponsored coverage, many people became uninsured during the pandemic. Importance While most working-age adults in the US obtain health insurance through an employer, little is known about the implications of the massive pandemic-related job loss in March 2020 and subsequent rebound for rates of employer-sponsored coverage and uninsurance. Objective To determine how health insurance coverage changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of trends in insurance coverage based on repeated cross sections of the US Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey data, using linear regression to adjust for respondents demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and state of residence. More than 1.2 million US adults aged 18 to 64 years were surveyed from April 23 through December 21, 2020. Exposures The COVID-19 pandemic, separated into spring and summer and fall and winter time periods during 2020, as well as state Medicaid expansion status. Main Outcomes and Measures Regression-based estimates of the weekly percentage-point change in respondents health insurance status, including having any health insurance, any employer-sponsored health insurance, or only nonemployer sponsored coverage. Nonemployer-sponsored coverage is categorized into private, Medicaid, and other public in some analyses. Results The study population included 1 212 816 US adults (51% female;mean [SD] age, 42 [13] years) across all 50 US states and Washington DC. Among these respondents, rates of employer-sponsored coverage declined by 0.2 percentage points each week during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other types of coverage, particularly from public sources, increased by 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points in the spring and summer and fall and winter periods, respectively. Overall, health insurance coverage of any type declined, particularly during the spring and summer period, during which uninsurance increased by 1.4 percentage points, representing more than 2.7 million newly uninsured people, over a 12-week period.

Several studies have demonstrated that long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) delivered by dry powder inhalers can promote lung deflation; however, the potential of nebulized LAMAs on improving hyperinflation in COPD is currently unknown. METHODS: This single-center, randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover study (NCT04155047) evaluated the efficacy of a single dose of nebulized LAMA [glycopyrrolate (GLY) 25 g] versus placebo in patients with COPD and lung hyperinflation. Patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and a residual volume (RV)  130% of predicted normal were included. The primary endpoint was changed from baseline in RV at 6 h post-treatment. Other endpoints included changes from baseline in spirometric and plethysmographic measures up to 6 h post-treatment. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients (mean pre-bronchodilator RV, 153.7% of predicted normal) were included. The primary objective of the study was not met; the placebo-adjusted least squares (LS) mean [95% confidence interval (CI) change from baseline in RV with GLY at 6 h post-treatment was ? 0.323 l (? 0.711 to 0.066); p = 0.0987]. A post hoc evaluation of the primary analysis was conducted after excluding a single statistical outlier; substantial improvements in RV with GLY compared with placebo was observed after exclusion of this outlier [placebo-adjusted LS mean change from baseline (95% CI) in RV was ? 0.446 l (? 0.741 to ? 0.150)]. Improvements from baseline were also observed with GLY compared with placebo in spirometric and plethysmographic measures up to 6 h post-treatment. GLY was generally safe, and no new safety signals were detected. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the effect of nebulized GLY on lung deflation. Nebulized GLY resulted in marked improvements in RV up to 6 h post-treatment, compared with placebo. Improvements were also observed with GLY in spirometric and plethysmographic parameters of lung function. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04155047.

The aim of Arcagen is to generate a multinational database integrating clinical and molecular information of patients with rare cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present the retrospective feasibility cohort of patients with rare cancers, with previously collected tumour samples available from any stage. Molecular analysis was performed using FoundationOne CDx for all histologies except for sarcoma where FoundationOne Heme was used. Clinical data including demographic data, medical history, malignant history, treatment and survival data were collected. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients from three centres were screened; molecular data were obtained for 77 patients (41 sarcomas, 9 yolk sac tumours, 14 rare head and neck cancers, 13 thymomas). The median age at the time of diagnosis was 48 (range 28C85). Most patients had reportable genomic alterations (89%). The most common alterations were linked to cell cycle regulation (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A/B deletions and MDM2 amplification). Multiple activating single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) could be detected in the RAS/RAF family. The tumour mutational burden status was globally low across all samples with a median of 3 Muts/MB (range 0C52). Only 4 cases (ie, 4.7% of tumours) had direct actionable mutations for a treatment approved in Europe within the patients tumour type.

In this study, we conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to evaluate the status of diseases at the livestockCwildlife interface in the United States. Specifically, the goals of the literature review were three fold: first to evaluate domestic animal diseases currently found in the United States where wildlife may play a role; second to identify critical issues faced in managing these diseases at the livestockCwildlife interface; and third to identify potential technical and policy strategies for addressing these issues. We found that of the 86 avian, ruminant, swine, poultry, and lagomorph diseases that are reportable to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), 53 are present in the United States; 42 (79%) of these have a putative wildlife component associated with the transmission, maintenance, or life cycle of the pathogen; and 21 (40%) are known to be zoonotic. At least six of these reportable diseasesbovine tuberculosis, paratuberculosis, brucellosis, avian influenza, rabies, and cattle fever tick (vector control)have a wildlife reservoir that is a recognized impediment to eradication in domestic populations. The complex nature of these systems highlights the need to understand the role of wildlife in the epidemiology, transmission, and maintenance of infectious diseases of livestock.

The aim of this study was to 1) evaluate the impact of DE by teachers in our department during the second semester of the 2019-20 academic year following the March-May 2020 Italian national lockdown and 2) evaluate the relationship between DE and the emotional well-being of teachers during the period of home confinement. METHODS: Ninety-seven university teachers (51.5% women; most represented age group 60-69 years range, 40.2%) responded to an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between July 15 - September 30, 2020, on the advantages and disadvantages of DE, developed by one online teacher focus group. The emotional conditions were assessed by a short version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The internal consistency reliability survey and the 10-item BDI-II were measured by Cronbach's alpha. A correlation analysis (r-Pearson) was conducted between the overall evaluation of the experience of DE and the variables included in the study. RESULTS: Teachers reported difficulties in technical aspects, and in psychological factors, as the discomfort of \\"speaking in the void\\" (64.7%). The absence of \\"face-to-face\\" eye contact with the students was complained by 81% of teachers. Significant impairments in sleep patterns and loss of energy were reported, with female teachers having greater difficulty concentrating than their male colleagues. A quarter of teachers showed depressive symptoms of varying severity. The most satisfied teachers were those most stimulated by DE (r = 0.752, p < 0.000), who showed a lower impact of depressive symptoms (r = - 0.289, p = 0.005). The teaching load in hours influenced the perception of disadvantages (r = 0.214, p = 0.035) and contributed to a lower appreciation of the challenges of DE. The more significant the manifestation of depressive symptoms during the lockdown was, the greater the subjective recovery of a good emotional condition once the domestic confinement was over (r = 0.344, p = 0.001), despite maintaining DE. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the impact of technical, didactic, and psychological difficulties of DE, reported by our teachers.

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is the latest innovation in minimally invasive surgery, and shortens incisions, improves cosmesis, and reduces postoperative pain. We report here the first description of a patient with epidermoid cyst of the cecum treated by ileocecal resection by single-incision laparoscopic surgery. CASE PRESENTATION A 20-year-old woman presented to our hospital with abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a 56  35-mm cystic mass in the ileocecal area. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 56  43-mm, T1-hypointense, T2-hyperintense mass attached to the cecum. Gastrointestinal tumor or duplication cyst was suspected, and ileocecal resection was performed using single-incision laparoscopic surgery. Intraoperative examination showed the tumor as a round, whitish mass arising from the cecum. Operation time was 162 min, and intraoperative blood loss was 10 ml. Macroscopic examination showed a 56  45-mm elastic-hard, whitish, round mass arising from the cecal wall. Microscopic examination revealed the cyst wall lined by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. No malignant findings were identified. The final diagnosis was epidermoid cyst of the cecum. The postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on postoperative day 5. CONCLUSIONS A rare case of cecal epidermoid cyst is reported.

METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION We reviewed 8,755 unique citations and included 53 studies that contained 50 or greater women using a specific fertility awareness-based method to avoid pregnancy, calculated life table pregnancy probabilities or Pearl rates, and prospectively measured pregnancy intentions and outcomes. We systematically evaluated study quality. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Of 53 included studies, we ranked 0 high quality, 21 moderate quality, and 32 low quality for our question of interest. Among moderate-quality studies, first-year typical use pregnancy rates or probabilities per 100 woman-years varied widely: 11.2-14.1 for the Standard Days Method, 13.7 for the TwoDay Method, 10.5-33.6 for the Billings Ovulation Method, 4-18.5 for the Marquette Mucus-only Method, 9.0-9.8 for basal body temperature methods, 13.2 for single-check symptothermal methods, 11.2-33.0 for Thyma double-check symptothermal methods, 1.8 for Sensiplan, 25.6 for Persona, 2-6.8 for the Marquette Monitor-only Method, and 6-7 for the Marquette Monitor and Mucus Method.

In response, this article reports one of the most detailed empirical examinations undertaken to date of the work involved in repurposing healthcare data for National Clinical Audits. METHODS: Fifty-four semi-structured, qualitative interviews were carried out with staff in five English National Health Service hospitals about their audit work, including 20 staff involved substantively with audit data collection. In addition, ethnographic observations took place on wards, in back offices and meetings (102 h). Findings were analysed thematically and synthesised in narratives. RESULTS: Although data were available within hospital applications for secondary use in some audit fields, which could, in theory, have been auto-populated, in practice staff regularly negotiated multiple, unintegrated systems to generate audit records. This work was complex and skilful, and involved cross-checking and double data entry, often using paper forms, to assure data quality and inform quality improvements.

However, only a few protein substrates have thus far been described and the mechanisms by which cathepsins B and L regulate cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis are poorly understood. Combined deficiency of both cathepsins results in early-onset neurodegeneration in mice reminiscent of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses in humans. Therefore, we intended to quantify accumulated proteins in brain lysosomes of double deficient mice. A combination of subcellular fractionation and LC-MS/MS using isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ?) allowed us to simultaneously assess wildtype and cathepsin B(?/?)L(?/?) cerebral lysosomes. Altogether, 19 different proteins were significantly increased in cathepsin B(?/?)L(?/?) lysosomes. Most elevated proteins had previously been localized to neuronal biosynthetic, recycling/endocytic or lysosomal compartments. A more than 10-fold increase was observed for Rab14, the Delta/Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER), calcyon, and carboxypeptidase E. Intriguingly, immunohistochemistry demonstrated that Rab14 and DNER specifically stain swollen axons in double deficient brains.

The objective of this study was to investigate how these factors were affected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown and impacted metabolic control in children with T1D. MATERIALS AND METHOD: One hundred children with T1D were enrolled in the study. Anthropometric measurements, snack and meal frequency, carbohydrate consumption, HbA1c levels, and exercise patterns were recorded and compared before and after the lockdown. Subjects were divided into two subgroupspatients with decreased and patients with increased HbA1c levels after the lockdownand comparisons of the same parameters were also made between these two subgroups. RESULTS: In the overall group, the mean HbA1c level was significantly higher after the lockdown compared to before (p = 0.035). Meal schedules changed due to delayed sleep and waking times, and total daily carbohydrate consumption increased in the subgroup with increased HbA1c while it decreased in the subgroup with decreased HbA1c (p < 0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: Our study supports the notion that blood sugar management in children with T1D worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it is not possible to explain this with any one factor, some behavioral changes observed in our study, such as inactivity, irregular meal frequency and timing, and irregular sleep and waking patterns appeared to be associated with blood sugar management.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 quarantine on metabolic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic requires the learning process to take place online;this has an impact on teachers who are required to creatively innovate unusual learning processes.

When zoonotic viruses jump to a new host, they undergo both mutational and natural selective pressures that result in non-synonymous and synonymous adaptive changes, necessary for efficient replication and rapid spread of diseases in new host species. The nucleotide composition and codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 indicate the presence of a highly conserved, gene-specific codon usage bias. The codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is mostly antagonistic to human and bat codon usage. SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias is mainly shaped by the natural selection, while mutational pressure plays a minor role. The time-series analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates that the virus is slowly evolving.

OBJECTIVES: We performed this study to identify the incidence of adverse events following SARS-CoV2 EUA vaccines and the incidence of new onset GVHD or worsening of existing GVHD after EUA vaccine administration and the incidence SAR-CoV2 positivity in vaccinated HCT patients. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed 113 HCT patients who received at least one dose of EUA vaccine to describe the safety/tolerability, any impact on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and incidence of SARS-CoV2 PCR positivity after vaccination. Patients received either Pfizer (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccines. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older and received at least one dose of vaccine in the post HCT setting. RESULTS: Most patients presented with myalgias/arthralgias (first dose 7.7%, second dose 14.6%), fatigue (first dose 15.4%, second dose 29.2%), and injection site pain (first dose 40.4%, second dose 43.8%).

Although intraoperative cholangiography is an important adjunct to cholecystectomy, its feasibility and safety in tvCCE have not been demonstrated to date. METHODS Patients undergoing tvCCE between April and October 2012 were included in this study. An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained routinely for all the patients. Patient characteristics, operation data, feasibility, and duration of the cholangiography as well as the postoperative course were recorded prospectively. RESULTS For 32 (97 %) of the 33 patients enrolled in this study, intraoperative cholangiography could be performed successfully. The median duration of cholangiography was 6 min (interquartile range, 4-7 min). Common bile duct stones were detected in three patients (10 %). Laparoscopic bile duct revision with the aid of one additional port was successful in two of these patients. One patient needed postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography due to the impossibility of extracting an impacted prepapillary concrement. One operation was converted to a four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One additional port was used in 11 patients (33 %) and two additional ports in three patients (9 %). Three intraoperative minor complications (9 %) and one postoperative minor complication (3 %) occurred. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative cholangiography during tvCCE is feasible, safe, and easy to perform.

Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 interactome in infected cells may represent a powerful tool to identify cellular proteins hijacked by viruses for their life cycle and develop host-oriented antiviral therapeutics. Here we report the proteomic characterization of host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein in infected Vero E6 cells. We identified 24 high-confidence proteins mainly playing a role in RNA metabolism and translation, including RNA helicases and scaffold proteins involved in the formation of stress granules, cytoplasmic aggregates of messenger ribonucleoproteins that accumulate as a result of stress-induced translation arrest. Analysis of stress granules upon SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that these structures are not induced in infected cells, neither eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, an upstream event leading to stress-induced translation inhibition. Notably, we found that G3BP1, a stress granule component that associates with the Nucleoprotein, is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, we showed that the Nucleoprotein-interacting RNA helicase DDX3X colocalizes with viral RNA foci and its inhibition by small molecules or small interfering RNAs significantly reduces viral replication. Altogether, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 subverts the stress granule machinery and exploits G3BP1 and DDX3X for its replication cycle, offering groundwork for future development of host-directed therapies.","output":"Proteomic analysis identifies the RNA helicase DDX3X as a host target against SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although first described over a hundred years ago, tissue optical clearing is undergoing renewed interest due to numerous advances in optical clearing methods, microscopy systems, and three-dimensional (3-D) image analysis programs.

In addition, exposure to allergens, especially seasonal allergens, in sensitized asthmatic individuals have been implicated in asthma attacks. Increased levels of exposure in sensitized asthmatics have been related to increases in hospital admissions and emergency room visits, increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, increased levels of exhaled nitric oxide, lower levels of lung function, increased treatment requirements, and even increased mortality. In recent years studies have suggested that viruses and allergens may have a synergistic effect on individuals with asthma, thus having a greater influence on exacerbation rate together than either factor alone.

Animal models are needed for studying pathogenesis and for development of preventive and therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV infection. Nonhuman primates (rhesus macaques and marmosets) are expensive models of limited availability. Although a mouse lung infection model has been described using adenovirus vectors expressing human CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), it is believed that a transgenic mouse model is needed for MERS-CoV research. We have developed this transgenic mouse model as indicated in this study. We show that transgenic mice globally expressing hCD26/DPP4 were fully permissive to MERS-CoV infection, resulting in relentless weight loss and death within days postinfection. High infectious virus titers were recovered primarily from the lungs and brains of mice at 2 and 4 days postinfection, respectively, whereas viral RNAs were also detected in the heart, spleen, and intestine, indicating a disseminating viral infection. Infected Tg(+) mice developed a progressive pneumonia, characterized by extensive inflammatory infiltration. In contrast, an inconsistent mild perivascular cuffing was the only pathological change associated with the infected brains. Moreover, infected Tg(+) mice were able to activate genes encoding for many antiviral and inflammatory mediators within the lungs and brains, coinciding with the high levels of viral replication. This new and unique transgenic mouse model will be useful for furthering knowledge of MERS pathogenesis and for the development of vaccine and treatments against MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Small and economical animal models are required for the controlled and extensive studies needed for elucidating pathogenesis and development of vaccines and antivirals against MERS. Mice are the most desirable small-animal species for this purpose because of availability and the existence of a thorough knowledge base, particularly of genetics and immunology. The standard small animals, mice, hamsters, and ferrets, all lack the functional MERS-CoV receptor and are not susceptible to infection. So, initial studies were done with nonhuman primates, expensive models of limited availability. A mouse lung infection model was described where a mouse adenovirus was used to transfect lung cells for receptor expression. Nevertheless, all generally agree that a transgenic mouse model expressing the DPP4 receptor is needed for MERS-CoV research. We have developed this transgenic mouse model as indicated in this study.

Two gravidas aged &#8805;35 years (12.5%) developed severe pneumonia; one patient (body mass index 32.9kg/m2) required transfer to intensive care.

Medical records, including demographic, platelet counts, heparin-involved treatments, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-(HIT) related laboratory tests, and fatal outcomes of COVID-19 patients were analyzed and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Findings Sixty-one critical COVID-19 patients treated in ICU included 15 survivors and 46 nonsurvivors. Forty-one percent of them (25/61) had severe thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count (PLT) less than 50x109/L, of whom 76% (19/25) had a platelet decrease of >50% compared to baseline; 96% of these patients (24/25) had a fatal outcome. Among the 46 nonsurvivors, 52.2% (24/46) had severe thrombocytopenia, compared to 6.7% (1/15) among survivors.

Surprisingly, HIT occurred not only in patients with heparin exposure, such as CRRT, but also in heparin-naive patients, suggesting that spontaneous HIT may occur in COVID-19. Interpretation Anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies are induced in critical COVID-19 patients, resulting in a progressive platelet decrease.

COVID-19 vaccination rollout is progressing at varied rates globally and data on the impact of mass vaccination on infection and case-fatality rates require definition. We compared the global reported cumulative case-fatality rate (rCFR) between top-20 countries with COVID-19 vaccination rates (>125 doses/100 people) and the rest of the world, before and after commencement of vaccination programmes. We considered the 28th day of receiving the first vaccine in the world as a cut-off to compare the pre-vaccine period (Jan 1, 2020 - Jan 5, 2021) and the post-vaccine period (Jan 6, 2021-Jan 5, 2022). We used a Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a beta distribution to investigate the association between the CFR and potential predictors of each country and reported the relative risk (RR) of each variable. The mean rCFR of COVID-19 in the top-20 countries with vaccination rates was 1.83 (95% CI: 1.24-2.43) on 5 Jan 2021 and 1.18 (95% CI: 0.73-1.62) on 5 Jan 2022. The CFR for the rest of the world on 5 Jan 2021 was 2.32 (95% CI: 1.86-2.79) and 2.20 (95% CI: 1.86-2.55) on 5 January 2022. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the CFR remained roughly unchanged at 1.97 (95% CI: 1.59-2.35) on 5 Jan 2021 and 1.98 (95% CI:1.58-2.37) on 5 Jan 2022.

This article divides all non-pharmaceutical interventions into three types according to their different roles. The results show that type-A and type-B non-pharmaceutical interventions both can delay the timing of large-scale infections of the susceptible population, timing of the number of exposed individuals to peak, and timing of peaking of the number of infected cases, as well as decrease the peak number of exposed cases. Moreover, type-B non-pharmaceutical interventions have more significant effects on susceptible and exposed populations. Type-C non-pharmaceutical interventions for improving the recovery rate of patients are able to effectively reduce the peak number of patients, greatly decrease the slope of the curve for the number of infected cases, substantially improve the recovery rate, and lower the mortality rate; however, these non-pharmaceutical interventions do not greatly delay the timing of the number of infected cases to peak.

The aim of the study is to understand how people living in 15 countries around the globe experience an unexpected crisis which threatens their health and that of loved ones, and how they make meaning of this disruption in their narratives. METHODS: Data were collected through an anonymous online survey during MayCSeptember 2020, which was during or just after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on the country. The questionnaire included demographic and three open-ended questions as prompts for stories about experiences during the initial months of the pandemic. The text was analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis and quantified for full sample description, demographic and subsequently international comparisons. RESULTS: The final qualitative dataset included stories from n = 1685 respondents. The sample was 73.6% women and 26.4% men. The mean age of participants was 39.55 years (SD = 14.71). The identified four groups of overarching themes were: The presence and absence of others; Rediscovering oneself; The meaning of daily life; Rethinking societal and environmental values. We discuss the prevalence of each theme for the sample as a whole and differences by demographic groups. The most prevalent theme referred to disruptions in interpersonal contacts, made meaningful by the increased appreciation of the value of relationships, present in (45.6%) of stories. It was more prevalent in the stories of women compared to men (2 = 24.88, p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The paper provides a detailed overview of the methodology, the main themes identified inductively in the stories and differences according to select demographic variables.

In addition, microalgae-based wastewater treatment is considered as an alternative for the conventional wastewater treatment in terms of energy consumption, which is suitable for microalgae biorefinery approaches. The energy consumption of a microalgae wastewater treatment system (0.2 kW/h/m(3)) was reduced 10 times when compared to the conventional wastewater treatment system (to 2 kW/h/m(3)). Microalgae are rich in various biomolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, pigments, vitamins, and antioxidants; all these valuable products can be utilized by nutritional, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries.

The paper reveals the problems of spatial transformation of the market in Russian regions. Analysis of the theoretical foundations of the research showed that the existing methodological approaches neglect the spatial aspect of this transformation. Methodologically, the study relies on theoretical provisions of regional and spatial economics, including Perroux's growth pole theory, Christaller's central place theory, and Friedmann's core-periphery model. Using the methods of spatial autocorrelation analysis, regression modelling and ARIMA-forecasting, the authors develop a system-based approach to modelling and forecasting the processes of spatial transformation of the public catering market. The research specifies the main methods for forecasting the development indicators of the market, as well as their advantages and disadvantages;it also substantiates the need to apply spatial autocorrelation analysis for assessing the distinguishing features of the market transformation and proposes a methodology for its implementation. The authors established a downward trend in the catering market differentiation and an upward trend in the number of regions similar in terms of their development. Regression analysis helped identify the major factors affecting the catering market's turnover, such as GRP and average per capita income of the population.

As was demonstrated during Ebola, preparedness is key to limiting a health crisis spread and impact on health systems and ensuring continued care for vulnerable populations including people living with HIV (PLHIV). To assess COVID-19 preparedness and inform interventions to ensure continuity of HIV services at health facilities (HFs) and community service points (CSPs), we conducted site readiness assessments in Freetown, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Sierra Leone. Data were collected at nine high-volume HIV HFs and seven CSPs in April 2020, a month after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. CSPs comprised three community drop-in centers providing HIV counseling and testing services as well as HIV prevention services (e.g., condoms and lubricants) for key and priority populations and four community-based support groups serving PLHIV. At the time of assessment, CSPs did not provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) but were considered potential sites for expansion of differentiated service delivery (DSD)a client-centered approach to HIV carein the context of COVID-19. Overall, 5/9 HFs had trained staff on use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Most had access to masks (5/9) and gloves (7/9) for management of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 4/9 HFs had triage procedures for isolation of suspected cases. Conversely, few CSPs had access to masks (2/7) or gloves (2/7) and no staff were trained on PPE use or COVID-19 transmission. 7/9 HFs had adequate ART stock for multi-month dispensing though few had procedures for (3/9) or had trained staff in providing DSD (2/9). Among CSPs where measures were applicable, 2/4 had procedures for DSD, 1/3 had staff trained on DSD and none had adequate ART stock. Identification of gaps in COVID-19 preparedness is a critical step in providing support for infection control and modified service delivery. Findings from this assessment highlight gaps in COVID-19 preparedness measures at sites supporting PLHIV in Sierra Leone and indicate CSPs may require intensive supervision and training to ensure HIV services are uninterrupted while minimizing COVID-19 risk, especially if used as sites to scale up DSD.","output":"COVID-19 preparedness at health facilities and community service points serving people living with HIV in Sierra Leone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a r ecent pandemic that is advancing at a r apid r ate The future course of the disease includes severe r espiratory infection and also leads to death if unattended Meticulous measures are necessary before attending any patient The dental operatories and the clinic surroundings must be well sanitized so as to prevent the spread of pandemic AIM AND OBJECTIVE: This r eview discusses in brief about the pathophysiology and course of COVID-19 Further, we discussed in detail the management aspects of patients in periodontal perspective and the sanitization procedures required for the dental clinic REVIEW RESULTS: The SARS coronavirus enters the human circulation via the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors which are also found on the oral mucosal surfaces Furin and Cathepsin L are the pro-inflammatory molecules released during pathogenesis of periodontitis and mediate the molecular pathways that help the virus invade into the host The clinic set-up should be modified to best suit the pandemic conditions This includes the three phases, i e , phase I: preparatory phase;phase II: implementation phase;and phase III: follow-up The patient management is explained based on the emergency needs of the patient based on the recent AAP classification of periodontal diseases and conditions 2017 as emergency, urgent, and elective treatment needs which have been explained in detail CONCLUSION: It can be strongly concluded that there is direct relationship between oral health and systemic health The treatment procedures and sanitization protocols must be definitely modified Further consensus and systematic reviews help us arriving at a more standardized protocol CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This review would help clinicians modify the way they treat patients in the clinic and provide better services depending upon the emergency needs of the patient","output":"COVID-19 and Periodontitis: A Reality to Live with"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The integration of behavioral health services into pediatric primary care settings has expanded rapidly in recent years, and pediatric psychologists have played a prominent role in this development.

Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association of ABO blood group types with three primary outcomes: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major arterial and venous thrombosis and all-cause mortality. 201, 121, 61 and 26 individuals had blood group O, A, B and AB, respectively. In multivariable analysis, blood group A was associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds of MACE than blood group O (OR 2.47[1.18-5.18]). There was an effect suggesting a 2-fold higher odds of major thrombotic events in blood group A vs. O that did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.15 [0.89-5.20]). No association between blood group type and all-cause mortality was found.

Patient demographics, laboratory results and catheter placement information were obtained from electronic records. Immediate technical success, early and late catheter associated complications were collected. Outcomes for TDC inserted with or without fluoroscopy were statistically analysed. RESULTS: A total of 351 TDC insertions and 253 TDC exchanges were performed. Out of 351 TDC insertions, 261 were done with fluoroscopy while 90 were done without. Out of 253 TDC exchanges, 219 were done with fluoroscopy while 34 were done without. For both TDC insertions and exchanges, there were no significant differences in complication rates when done with or without fluoroscopy. Mean duration of catheter patency was longer for TDC inserted without fluoroscopy, after adjusting for site of insertion and presence of previous TDC. CONCLUSIONS: The technique of inserting TDC in the right internal jugular vein (IJV) without fluoroscopy is a safe and effective method in selected patients. This supports the practice of performing the procedure without fluoroscopy, especially in institutions where fluoroscopy facilities are not readily available.

New modes of mechanical ventilation have been developed to better match the assistance delivered by the ventilator to the patient's needs. Among these modes, neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) delivers a pressure that is directly proportional to the integral of the electrical activity of the diaphragm recorded continuously through an esophageal probe. In clinical settings, NAVA has been chiefly compared with pressure-support ventilation, one of the most popular modes used during the weaning phase, which delivers a constant pressure from breath to breath. Comparisons with proportional-assist ventilation, which has numerous similarities, are lacking. Because of the constant level of assistance, pressure-support ventilation reduces the natural variability of the breathing pattern and can be associated with asynchrony and/or overinflation. The ability of NAVA to circumvent these limitations has been addressed in clinical studies and is discussed in this report. Although the underlying concept is fascinating, several important questions regarding the clinical applications of NAVA remain unanswered. Among these questions, determining the optimal NAVA settings according to the patient's ventilatory needs and/or acceptable level of work of breathing is a key issue. In this report, based on an investigator-initiated round table, we review the most recent literature on this topic and discuss the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of NAVA compared with other modes, as well as the risks and limitations of NAVA.","output":"Clinical review: Update on neurally adjusted ventilatory assist--report of a round-table conference."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amyloid -protein (A) toxicity is hypothesized to play a seminal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear how A causes synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss. We hypothesize that one mechanism of A-induced synaptic injury is related to the cleavage of amyloid  precursor protein (APP) at position D664 by caspases that release the putatively cytotoxic C31 peptide. In organotypic slice cultures derived from mice with a knock-in mutation in the APP gene (APP D664A) to inhibit caspase cleavage, A-induced synaptic injury is markedly reduced in two models of A toxicity.

Importantly, the time-dependent dendritic spine loss is correlated with localized activation of caspase-3 but is absent in APP D664A cultures.

The aim of the present study was two-fold. First, we estimated the costs of IPC in the Medical Centre of the Hungarian Defence Forces (MCHDF) in Hungary using a bottom-up microcosting approach. Second, we analysed how the involvement of the MCHDF in Covid-19 care changed the occurrence of multidrug-resistant infections in the hospital. Our results showed that depending on the type of ward, the daily costs of standard care ranged between 3,8098,589 HUF, while the costs of isolation were between 9,203-11,200 HUF. Daily costs were highest in the intensive care unit (ICU). Total costs per patient ranged between 20,875-78,904 HUF for standard care and 79,996-282,892 HUF for isolation with highest values in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The incremental isolation cost per patient compared to standard care ranged between 20,363-158,216 HUF. When the MCHDF became a Covid-19 care centre, the incidence of introduced Clostridium difficile and multidrug resistant cases increased by nearly 2 00 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively.

Although the underlying mechanism of COVID-19 coagulopathy remains unknown, early reports suggested that it may be a form of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, recent studies have highlighted the potential role of endothelial cell injury in its pathogenesis. AIMS The aims of our study were to analyze the coagulation parameters of critically and non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital, determine if coagulation factors consumption occurs, identify potential prognostic biomarkers of this new disease and explore possible underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 coagulopathy. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study performed at Gregorio Mara?on Hospital in Madrid, Spain. Adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized in our center were recruited, including those admitted to the ICU and to general wards. Patients were randomly selected from blood samples that arrived at our Hemostasis laboratory during April 2020. For each patient, we conducted a complete analysis of coagulation parameters, including basic coagulation tests, quantification of coagulation factors and physiological inhibitor proteins, evaluation of the fibrinolytic system and determination of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and ADAMTS13. Laboratory data were compared with clinical data and outcomes. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac, version 24. This study was approved by our institutional Ethics Committee and it was executed along with the international ethics recommendations for conducting research in humans following the latest revision of Declaration of Helsinki. RESULTS A total of 62 patients (31 ICU, 31 non-ICU) were analyzed. Mean age of the sample was 61.8 (SD 15.2) years and 69.4% of the patients were male. The coagulation parameters assessment demonstrated normal median PT, INR and APTT in our cohort and all coagulation factors were within normal range. Factor VIII showed an increasing trend (194.571.9) which could be interpreted as an acute phase reactant, and it was significantly higher in non-survivors (p=0.003). Similarly, we did not observe consumption of physiological inhibitor proteins and platelet counts were also within the normal limits, despite being slightly lower in non-survivor patients (p=0.006) (Table 1). Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) was above the normal range (median 216%, IQR 196-439, normal range 62-175%) in our cohort and higher levels of vWF-antigen (p=0.001) and vWF-activity (p=0.02) were associated with poor prognosis. Likewise, a lower ADAMTS13 activity was observed in non-survivors (p=0.008). Regarding the fibrinolytic pathway, PAI levels were above the normal range (median 52.6ng/ml, IQR 37.2-85.7, normal range 4-40ng/ml), but we found no statistically significant differences based on survival. The remaining parameters of the fibrinolytic pathway (plasminogen and alpha-2 antiplasmin) were within normal range (Table 1). ICU-patients had a poorer prognosis, with a higher rate of mortality (p=0.003). Likewise, they showed more elevated acute phase reactants (p<0.01) and higher levels of D-dimer (p=0.003) than patients hospitalized in general wards. ADAMTS13 activity was also significantly lower in this subgroup (p<0.001), as well as plasminogen levels (p=0.002) and PAI (p=0.003). Criteria of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as defined according to the ISTH DIC score, were met in 14.8% of ICU patients versus 0% of non-ICU patients (p=0.039) (Table 2). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 infection is associated with coagulopathy that correlates with poor prognosis. However, coagulation factors, physiological inhibitory proteins and alpha-2-antplasmin levels were preserved in our study. Similarly, we did not observe platelets or fibrinogen consumption, which leads us to assume that COVID-19 coagulopathy is not a form of DIC. Increased vWF and decreased ADAMTS13 activity in our cohort could indicate that the underlying mechanism of this coagulopathy may reside in the endothelial cells and share a similar pathogenesis with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), as it has been recently suggested in some scientific reports.

CIHI, Health Quality Council of Alberta, Health Quality Ontario and websites of heart and stroke associations in Canada, USA, UK, Australia and New Zealand were used as sources of grey literature. Searched reports were screened by title and abstract, and full texts were located for review. Articles quality was evaluated using National Institute of Health's Study Quality Assessment tools. Methods for improving DTN were categorised under 13 DTN reduction strategies, primarily adapted from the Target: Stroke Phase II recommendations, and including two additional categories: Strategies not encompassed by any Target: Stroke recommendation, and Combinations of Interventions. RESULTS 96 studies (4 randomised control trials, 1 review, 91 observational pre/post studies) were included in the review. All strategies and interventions resulted in a reduction of DTN. Approaches using combinations of interventions were the most effective at reducing DTN (33.77% DTN reduction, standard mean difference=1.857, 95% CI=1.510-2.205), and were more effective than approaches using only a single strategy (p=0.040). DTN reduction was associated with the duration of the DTN reduction programme at each facility (p=0.006).

The problems of water pollutions real-time traceability are as follows: non-uniqueness and dynamic real time of pollution sources. Aiming at these two difficulties, an intelligent traceability algorithm based on dynamic multi-mode optimization was designed and proposed in the work. As a multi-mode optimization problem, pollution traceability could have multiple similar optimal solutions. Firstly, the new algorithm divided the population reasonably through the optimal subpopulation division strategy, which made the nodes distribution in a single subpopulation more similar and conducive to local optimization. Then, a similar peak penalty strategy was used to eliminate similar solutions and reduce the non-unique solutions number, since real-time traceability required higher algorithm convergence than traditional offline traceability and dynamic problems with parameter changes, historical information preservation, and adaptive initialization strategies could make reasonable use of the algorithms historical knowledge to improve the population space and increase the population convergence rate when the problem changed.

The survey included rating scales such as the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9), Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 2 items (CD-RISC 2), and subjects also answered whether they were employed in COVID-19 related fields. RESULTS: Married, female, junior, public workers reported a higher level of stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic. Furthermore, high levels of stress and anxiety toward the epidemic are defined by high PHQ-9, high GAD-7, and low CD-RISC 2 scores.

The persistence of potentially infectious aerosol in public spaces, particularly medical settings, deserves close investigation; however, approaches for rapidly parameterizing the temporospatial distribution of particles released by an infected individual have not been reported in literature. This paper presents a methodology for mapping the movement of aerosol plumes using a network of low-cost PM sensors in ICUs. Mimicking aerosol generation by a patient, we tracked aerosolized NaCl particles functioning as tracers for potentially infectious aerosols. In positive (closed door) and neutral-pressure (open door) ICUs, an aerosol spike was detected outside the room, with up to 6% or 19% of all PM escaping through the door gaps, respectively. The outside sensors registered no aerosol spike in negative-pressure ICUs. The K-means clustering analysis of temporospatial data suggests three distinct zones: (1) near the aerosol source, (2) room periphery, and (3) immediately outside the room. These zones inform two-phase aerosol plume behavior: dispersion of the original aerosol spike throughout the room, and evacuation phase where \\"well-mixed\\" PM decayed uniformly. Decay rates were calculated for 4 ICUs in positive, neutral, and negative mode, with negative modes decaying the fastest.

This new human emergent infectious disease is dominated by severe lower respiratory illness and is aetiologically linked to a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV). METHODS Pulmonary pathology and clinical correlates were investigated in seven patients who died of SARS in whom there was a strong epidemiological link. Investigations include a review of clinical features, morphological assessment, histochemical and immunohistochemical stainings, ultrastructural study, and virological investigations in postmortem tissue. RESULTS Positive viral culture for coronavirus was detected in most premortem nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (five of six) and postmortem lung tissues (two of seven). Viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, could be detected in lung pneumocytes in most of the patients. These features suggested that pneumocytes are probably the primary target of infection. The pathological features were dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, with the presence of multinucleated pneumocytes. Fibrogranulation tissue proliferation in small airways and airspaces (bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia-like lesions) in subpleural locations was also seen in some patients.

In more dire cases, infected patients can experience severe symptoms that can cause breathing difficulties which lead to stern organ failure and die. The medical corps all over the world are overloaded because of the exponentially myriad number of contagions. Therefore, screening for the disease becomes overwrought with the limited tools of test.

Results The complexity of simulation models developed for HAIs significantly increased but heavily concentrated on transmission dynamics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the hospitals of high-income countries. Neither HAIs in other health care settings, the influence of contact networks within a health care facility, nor patient sharing and referring networks across health care settings were sufficiently understood.

The primary use case for this method is to estimate the functional integrity of an unknown device unit based on the behaviour of a known and proven reference unit. This method is based on the so-called virtual sensor network (VSN) approach, where the output quantity of a physical sensor measurement is replicated by a virtual model output. In the present study, this approach is extended to model the functional behaviour of electronic hardware by a neural network (NN) with Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) layers to encapsulate potential time-dependence of the signals. The proposed method is illustrated and validated on measurements from a remote-controlled drone, which is operated with two variants of controller hardware: a reference controller unit and a malfunctioning counterpart. It is demonstrated that the presented approach successfully identifies and describes the unexpected behaviour of the test device. In the presented case study, the model outputs a signal sample prediction in 0.14 ms and achieves a reconstruction accuracy of the validation data with a root mean square error (RMSE) below 0.04 relative to the data range. In addition, three self-protection features (multidimensional boundary-check, Mahalanobis distance, auxiliary autoencoder NN) are introduced to gauge the certainty of the VSN model output.","output":"Self-Protected Virtual Sensor Network for Microcontroller Fault Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The QT interval is of high clinical value as QT prolongation can lead to Torsades de Pointes and sudden cardiac death. Insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) have the capability of detecting both absolute and relative changes in QT interval. In order to determine feasibility for long-term ICM based QT detection, we developed and validated an algorithm for continuous long-term QT monitoring in patients with ICM. METHODS The QT detection algorithm, intended for use in ICMs, is designed to detect T-waves and determine the beat-to-beat QT and QTc intervals. The algorithm was developed and validated using real-world ICM data. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by comparing the algorithm detected QT interval with the manually annotated QT interval using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland Altman plot. RESULTS The QT detection algorithm was developed using 144 ICM ECG episodes from 46 patients and obtained a Pearson's coefficient of 0.89. The validation data set consisted of 136 ICM recorded ECG segments from 76 patients with unexplained syncope and 104 ICM recorded nightly ECG segments from 10 patients with diabetes and Long QT syndrome. The QT estimated by the algorithm was highly correlated with the truth data with a Pearson's coefficient of 0.93 (p<0.001), with the mean difference between annotated and algorithm computed QT intervals of -7 msec. CONCLUSIONS Long-term monitoring of QT intervals using ICM is feasible.

DESIGN: Survey of cases. PARTICIPANTS: The study included Qubec HCWs from private and public institutions with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosed between March 1 and June 14, 2020. HCWs aged &#8805;18 years who worked during the exposure period and survived their illness were eligible for the survey. METHODS: After obtaining consent, 4,542 HCWs completed a standardized questionnaire. COVID-19 rates and proportions of exposures and practices were estimated and compared between ACHs and LTCFs. RESULTS: HCWs represented 13,726 (25%) of 54,005 reported COVID-19 cases in Qubec and had an 11-times greater rate of COVID-19 than non-HCWs. Their secondary household attack rate was 30%. Most affected occupations were healthcare support workers, nurses and nurse assistants working in LTCFs (45%) and ACHs (30%). Compared to ACHs, HCWs in LTCFs had less training, higher staff mobility between working sites, similar PPE use, and better self-reported compliance with at-work physical distancing. Suboptimal IPC practices declined over time but were still present at the end of the first wave. CONCLUSION: Qubec HCWs and their families were severely affected during the first wave of COVID-19.

These measures carry a high economic and social cost. They may have little impact on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared to imported cases. Methods: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we compared the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to the expected COVID-19 cases arising from internal spread on an average day in May 2020 in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. Findings: With May 2019 travel volumes, imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 103 (95% credible interval: 76 - 130) out of 142 countries, and <1% in 48 (95% CrI: 9 - 95). If we assume that travel would decrease compared to May 2019 even in the absence of formal restrictions, then imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 109-123 countries and <1% in 61-88 countries (depending on the assumptions about travel reductions). Interpretation: While countries can expect infected travellers to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions, in most countries these imported cases likely contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions may have limited impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries.","output":"The effect of international travel restrictions on internal spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute symptomatic epileptic seizures occur in close temporal relationship with an acute structural or functional damage of the brain, which can have many different causes.

The management of limited resources such as mechanical ventilators has remained a contentious issue both at an individual and institutional level since the beginning of the pandemic. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges to critical care practitioners to find innovative ways to provide supplemental oxygen therapy to their patients. We present a single-center experience: a case series of five COVID-19 infected patients managed with a novel approach to provide supplemental oxygen and positive end-expiration pressure (PEEP) via the helmet. Three of the five patients responded to therapy, did not require intubation, and survived to discharge. The other two patients continued to deteriorate clinically, required endotracheal intubation, and subsequently expired during their hospitalization. We extrapolated our accumulated experience with non-invasive oxygen support by helmet in COVID-19 patients to a non-COVID-19 postoperative patient who underwent sinus surgery and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure also resulting in avoidance of endotracheal intubation. We conclude that oxygen therapy via a helmet is a safe, cost-effective technique to prevent intubation in carefully selected patients with infectious and non-infectious causes of hypoxic respiratory failure.

Studies on simulation-based learning supported by technology are increasing in nursing education, but no scoping reviews have mapped the literature on simulation-based learning supported by technology to enhance critical thinking in nursing students. OBJECTIVE: The proposed scoping review aims to systematically map research on the use of simulation-based learning supported by technology to enhance critical thinking in nursing students. METHODS: The proposed scoping review will use the framework established by Arksey and OMalley and will be reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews. A systematic, comprehensive literature search was performed in the LILACS, ERIC, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. Pairs of authors independently selected the articles by screening titles, abstracts, full-text papers, and extract data. The data will be analyzed and thematically categorized. RESULTS: The development of a comprehensive and systematic search strategy was completed in June 2021. The database searches were performed in July 2021, and the screening of titles and abstracts was completed in September 2021. Charting the data began in February 2022. Analysis and synthesis will be performed sequentially, and the scoping review is expected to be complete by May 2023. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this proposed scoping review may identify gaps in the literature and provide an overview of research on the topic of simulation-based learning supported by technology to enhance critical thinking in nursing students. The research may identify nursing students reported barriers and enablers for learning critical thinking skills through simulation-based learning supported by technology, and the results may help educators enhance their educational approach through knowledge of students firsthand experiences and further development of successful teaching strategies in nursing education.

The group was also tasked with looking at ways to partner with the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), our medicine counterparts to develop a plan for collaborating with them to advance interprofessional practice. In this unique year, all standing committees were charged with reading all the reports last year to put President Lin's charges into perspective with the hopes of carrying over the overall theme and work of the previous years committee. Overall, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been several expansions on the scope of practice for pharmacists and vary by state. We hope to draw out some of those expansions to see how we can build upon efforts to make those permanent.","output":"Report of the 2020-2021 Strategic Engagement Standing Committee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transdermal vaccination route using biodegradable microneedles is a rapidly progressing field of research and applications The fear of painful needles is one of the primary reasons most people avoid getting vaccinated Therefore, developing an alternative pain-free method of vaccination using microneedles has been a significant research area Microneedles comprise arrays of micron-sized needles that offer a pain-free method of delivering actives across the skin Apart from being pain-free, microneedles provide various advantages over conventional vaccination routes such as intramuscular and subcutaneous Microneedle vaccines induce a robust immune response as the needles ranging from 50 to 900 m in length can efficiently deliver the vaccine to the epidermis and the dermis region, which contains many Langerhans and dendritic cells The microneedle array looks like band-aid patches and offers the advantages of avoiding cold-chain storage and self-administration flexibility The slow release of vaccine antigens is an important advantage of using microneedles The vaccine antigens in the microneedles can be in solution or suspension form, encapsulated in nano or microparticles, and nucleic acid-based The use of microneedles to deliver particle-based vaccines is gaining importance because of the combined advantages of particulate vaccine and pain-free immunization The future of microneedle-based vaccines looks promising however, addressing some limitations such as dosing inadequacy, stability and sterility will lead to successful use of microneedles for vaccine delivery This review illustrates the recent research in the field of microneedle-based vaccination","output":"Microneedles: A New Generation Vaccine Delivery System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic performance of the Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM2), ferritin, lactate, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocytes, alone and in combination, in pediatric patients with sepsis admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in a PICU in Brazil. All patients aged 6 months to 18 years admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis were eligible for inclusion. Those with ferritin and C-reactive protein measured within 48a?h and lactate and leukocytes within 24a?h of admission were included in the prognostic performance analysis. RESULTS: Of 350 eligible patients with sepsis, 294 had undergone all measurements required for analysis and were included in the study. PIM2, ferritin, lactate, and CRP had good discriminatory power for mortality, with PIM2 and ferritin being superior to CRP. The cutoff values for PIM2 (> 14%), ferritin (> 135a?ng/mL), lactate (> 1.7a?mmol/L), and CRP (> 6.7a?mg/mL) were associated with mortality. The combination of ferritin, lactate, and CRP had a positive predictive value of 43% for mortality, similar to that of PIM2 alone (38.6%). The combined use of the three biomarkers plus PIM2 increased the positive predictive value to 76% and accuracy to 0.945. CONCLUSIONS: PIM2, ferritin, lactate, and CRP alone showed good prognostic performance for mortality in pediatric patients older than 6 months with sepsis. When combined, they were able to predict death in three-fourths of the patients with sepsis.

Neutralizing antibody responses were observed after a single dose, with exceptionally high titers achieved after boosting. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers elicited by a dose-sparing regimen in mice were similar to those obtained from a high dose regimen.

These collections can be used by several information-seeking portals and applications, such as AI chatbots. Automatically identifying and extracting such high-utility question-answer pairs is a challenging endeavor, which has been tackled by little research work. For a question-answer pair to be useful to a broad audience, it must (i) provide general information - not be specific to the Web site or Web page where it is hosted - and (ii) must be self-contained - not have references to other entities in the page or missing terms (ellipses) that render the question-answer pair ambiguous. Although identifying general, self-contained questions may seem like a straightforward binary classification problem, the limited availability of training data for this task and the countless domains make building machine learning models challenging.

The development of effective drugs and vaccines against Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the current research priority. Thus, we aimed to find out effective drug and vaccine targets using a comprehensive genome-based analysis. A total of 4822 proteins were screened from V. parahaemolyticus proteome. Among 16 novel cytoplasmic proteins, VIBPA Type II secretion system protein L and VIBPA Putative fimbrial protein Z were subjected to molecular docking with 350 human metabolites, which revealed that Eliglustat, Simvastatin and Hydroxocobalamin were the top drug molecules considering free binding energy. On the contrary, Sensor histidine protein kinase UhpB and Flagellar hook-associated protein of 25 novel membrane proteins were subjected to T-cell and B-cell epitope prediction, antigenicity testing, transmembrane topology screening, allergenicity and toxicity assessment, population coverage analysis and molecular docking analysis to generate the most immunogenic epitopes. Three subunit vaccines were constructed by the combination of highly antigenic epitopes along with suitable adjuvant, PADRE sequence and linkers. The designed vaccine constructs (V1, V2, V3) were analyzed by their physiochemical properties and molecular docking with MHC molecules- results suggested that the V1 is superior. Besides, the binding affinity of human TLR-1/2 heterodimer and construct V1 could be biologically significant in the development of the vaccine repertoire. The vaccine-receptor complex exhibited deformability at a minimum level that also strengthened our prediction. The optimized codons of the designed construct was cloned into pET28a(+) vector of E. coli strain K12.

We demonstrated, using a viral-like particle formation system, that the S mutations were involved in the lower incorporation of the S protein into virions, although the M mutation that disrupts the glycosylation was not present in this phenotype. Further mutational experiments identified two substitutions, Y442C and L472F, within the receptor binding domain that could be critical for the reduced S incorporation, as well as reduced binding affinity between the S protein and ACE2 receptor.

ACORN is a cross-sectional community-based observational study of adult residents presenting asymptomatic for COVID-like illness, defined as the self-reported absence of the following three symptoms in the last 7 days: fever (&#8805;100F), new-onset or worsening cough, and new-onset or worsening shortness of breath. SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swab samples. SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence was expressed as a point estimate with 95% confidence interval (CI). Test results are reported for 2953 participants who enrolled and underwent nasopharyngeal swab testing between 7 April 2020 and 16 May 2020. Among tested participants, 91 (3.1%; 95% CI: 2.5%-3.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2.

However, studies on the impact of alcohol addiction on the risk of COVID-19 infection are very scarce and inconclusive. This research offers a descriptive observational retrospective cohort study using real world data obtained from the Electronic Health Records. We found that patients with a personal history of alcohol abuse were 8% more likely to extend their hospitalization length of stay for 1 day (95% CI = 1.04C1.12) and 15% more likely to extend their Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay (95% CI = 1.01C1.30).

Review articles, editorials and studies that did not implement a video-based interview were excluded. Results: Forty-three studies were included in our scoping review, of which 17 were conference s and 26 were peer-reviewed manuscripts. The risk of bias was moderate or high in most studies. Both financial costs and opportunity costs were reported to be improved with video-based interviewing, while environmental costs were not well explored. Technical limitations, which were not prevalent, were easily managed during the interview process. There were limited studies that evaluated how nonverbal cues are interpreted in a video-based format. Overall, video-based interviews were well received by both applicants and interviewers, although most participants still reported a preference for face-to-face interviews.

Methods: A total of 104 patients with HT after reperfusion treatment from the West China hospital, Sichuan University, were retrospectively included in this study between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2020. The preprocessed initial non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NECT) imaging brain images were used for radiomic feature extraction. A synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to the original data set. The after-SMOTE data set was randomly split into training and testing cohorts with an 8:2 ratio by a stratified random sampling method. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were applied to identify candidate radiomic features and construct the radiomic score. The performance of the score was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and a calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate the clinical value of the model. Results: Among the 104 patients, 17 patients were identified with hemorrhage expansion after HT detection. A total of 154 candidate predictors were extracted from NECT images and five optimal features were ultimately included in the development of the radiomic score by using logistic regression machine-learning approach. The radiomic score showed good performance with high area under the curves in both the training data set (0.91, sensitivity: 0.83; specificity: 0.89), test data set (0.87, sensitivity: 0.60; specificity: 0.85), and original data set (0.82, sensitivity: 0.77; specificity: 0.78). The calibration curve and DCA also indicated that there was a high accuracy and clinical usefulness of the radiomic score for hemorrhage expansion prediction after HT.

Here, we utilized a unique dataset of ACE2 sequences from 410 vertebrate species, including 252 mammals, to study the conservation of ACE2 and its potential to be used as a receptor by SARS-CoV-2. We designed a five-category binding score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories and only catarrhine primates into the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (frequency <0.001) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we found significant signals of selection and accelerated evolution in the ACE2 coding sequence across all mammals, and specific to the bat lineage.

RESULTS: Twelve (10.8%) patients showed mild increase of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine (<26 mol/L within 48 h), and 8 (7.2%) patients showed trace or 1+ albuminuria in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). All these patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria of AKI. In addition, 5 patients with CKD who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before admission were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed as COVID-19. In addition to therapy for COVID-19, CRRT was also applied 3 times weekly during hospitalization for these 5 patients with CKD. In the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable state in all 5 patients with CKD, without exacerbation of CKD, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CKD were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without CKD, and 1 patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab from 5 cases with CKD. CONCLUSION: AKI was uncommon in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not result in AKI, or aggravate CKD in the COVID-19 patients.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 19 Infection Does Not Result in Acute Kidney Injury: An Analysis of 116 Hospitalized Patients from Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the novel coronavirus Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province, People's Republic of China, as the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has hence spread worldwide causing a global pandemic (1-3)..","output":"Isolation and Full-Length Genome Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 Cases in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Minimal-disease (MD) cats raised in a barrier-maintained feline breeding colony routinely become coronavirus (CV) antibody-positive at 5C8 weeks of age and remain seropositive indefinitely.

The applicants were equally qualified except that, in each pair, one applicant informed about mental health problems as an explanation for a past employment break. The results show that applicants who disclose mental health problems are discriminated against in hiring processes. Applicants with mental health problems have about 27% lower probability of receiving an invitation to a job interview and about 22% lower probability of receiving any positive employer response. These results do not seem to have been driven by the COVID-19 crisis that unfolded during the course of the study.

Patients receiving care at a large, community-based cancer center in Seattle, Washington were sent an email requesting voluntary participation in a survey to assess their experiences with telemedicine. Surveying took place during the interval from March 1, through May 31 2020, in the early phase of the pandemic. The survey queried participants regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, included a panel of questions designed to assess reasons for choosing telemedicine and their satisfaction with care, and a NCCN-validated distress scale. Descriptive statistics were tabulated and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of satisfaction with telemedicine. Surveys were completed by 155 patients. Mean age of respondents was 65 years old, 69% were female, and 41% were treated for a gynecologic condition. Most used an audiovisual (v audio-only) platform (70%) and stated they were offered the choice to use telehealth (88%). Overall, 82% found the platform easy to use, 87% were satisfied with the care provided, 84% found they could connect emotionally with their provider, and 93% stated they would use telemedicine again. Reasons for continued interest in using telemedicine again included convenience, safety, and transportation issues. In a multivariable model, being offered the choice to use telehealth was the only significant predictor of satisfaction with care (odds ratio 4.81). Male gender, living close to the clinic, and self-reported worry were negatively associated with their ability to connect emotionally with their provider, but high distress scores did not impact having an emotional connection with their provider. Rates of patient satisfaction with telemedicine were high, but not being offered the choice of an in-person visit emerged as an important predictor of dissatisfaction with care. This information may be important for clinics planning to incorporate telemedicine in the future.

Respondents answers to introductory questions about the frequency of IV indicated its absence (78.1%). However, the answers to the questions about specific forms of violent peer behavior indicated forms as well as the time and place where IV most often occurs. They underlined that IV takes place mainly after training or competition and during sports camps; and that the dressing room is the most favorable place for these behaviors. They also confirmed that the most prevalent subtypes of IV are psychological (roughly 40%) and physical (approximately 30%). The respondents opinions and experiences about IV (psychological, physical, sexual) revealed that factors such as gender, location, and parents education level may influence the IV manifestation.

DESIGN: A repeated-measures design was used to evaluate the auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded in background noise with transparent and opaque face masks, and without a mask (N=154). In a smaller follow-up study (N=29), the same files were presented via auditory-only presentation to determine if differences observed in the transparent and opaque mask conditions were attributable to additional visual cues or to acoustic differences between the recordings of the two mask types. Listeners completed the 40-minute online session on a computer, laptop, or tablet in a quiet room via their personal listening devices (earbuds or hearing assistive device). The adult volunteers who used English as their first language were recruited through social media links and email and categorized into three groups: normal hearing and confirmed or suspected hearing loss either with or without the use of assistive listening devices. RESULTS: Auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded with the transparent mask was significantly better (M=68.9%) than for sentences recorded with the opaque mask (M=58.9%) for all participants. There was a trend for those who used hearing assistive technology to score lower than the other two groups who had similar performance across all conditions regardless of mask type. Subjective ratings of confidence and concentration followed the expected pattern based on objective scores. Results of the auditory-only presentation of the sentences to listeners with normal hearing suggested that the transparent-mask benefits were not attributable to an acoustic advantage but rather to the addition of the visual cues of the talker's face available through the transparent mask. In fact, performance in the auditory-only presentation was significantly lower with the transparent mask (M=40.7%) compared to the opaque mask (M=58.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of transparent masks can significantly facilitate speech recognition in noise even for persons with normal hearing and thus may reduce stressful communication challenges experienced in medical, employment, and educational settings during the global pandemic. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and facilitate communication, safety-approved transparent masks are strongly encouraged over opaque masks.","output":"Communicating During COVID-19: The Effect of Transparent Masks for Speech Recognition in Noise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prospective parents whose fetus is diagnosed with a neurological anomaly go through a complex range of emotions.

Sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of two ORFs encoding proteins of 12.9 and 9.5 kDa. These two proteins were identified as putatively nonstructural (ns) due to their homology to the corresponding BCV ns gene products. Northern blot analysis indicated that each of these two genes was present on a separate mRNA (5 and 5-1, respectively). In vitro translation analyses demonstrated that the HCV-OC43 9.5-kDa protein, like its BCV counterpart, is poorly translated when situated downstream of the 12.9-kDa ORF, although immunofluorescence studies did confirm its presence in infected cells. Sequence analysis showed that a large portion of the 3-end of the leader sequence is present within the viral genome, upstream of the 12.9-kDa ORF. In addition, two ORFs encoding potential 4.9- and 4.8-kDa ns proteins in BCV are absent in HCV-OC43, although a corresponding mRNA 4 was found at a very low level. These results demonstrate that these two putative ns proteins are not essential for virus replication, at least in HRT-18 cells.","output":"Human Coronavirus OC43 RNA 4 Lacks Two Open Reading Frames Located Downstream of the S Gene of Bovine Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The purpose of this work was to evaluate the action of the botanic insecticide neem oil on larvae of Ceratitis capitata, as well as in the parasitism of these larvae by Diachasmimorpha longicaudata.

To reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its risk to the public, the government and health care providers have encouraged social distancing, use of face masks, hand hygiene, and quarantines. Unfortunately, COVID-19 information has rarely been available in ASL, which puts the deaf community at a disadvantage for accessing reliable COVID-19 information. OBJECTIVE: This study's primary objective was to compare COVID-19Crelated information access between participants who are deaf and participants who are hearing. METHODS: The study included 104 adults who are deaf and 74 adults who are hearing who had participated in a prior health literacy study. Surveys were conducted between April and July 2020 via video conference, smartphone apps, or phone calls. COVID-19 data were linked with preexisting data on demographic and health literacy data as measured by the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) and the ASL-NVS. KEY RESULTS: Neither group of participants differed in their ability to identify COVID-19 symptoms. Adults who are deaf were 4.7 times more likely to report difficulty accessing COVID-19 information (p = .011), yet reported using more preventive strategies overall. Simultaneously, adults who are deaf had 60% lower odds of staying home and calling their doctor versus seeking health care immediately or doing something else compared with participants who are hearing if they suspected that they had COVID-19 (p = .020). CONCLUSIONS: Additional education on recommended COVID-19 management and guidance on accessible health care navigation strategies are needed for the deaf community and health care providers. Public health officials should ensure that public service announcements are accessible to all audiences and should connect with trusted agents within the deaf community to help disseminate health information online in ASL through their social media channels.

We propose an algorithmic approach using cardiac biomarkers to triage, risk-stratify and prognosticate patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until May 31st, 2020, and accessed the available data on the role of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury in around 7C28% of patients, significantly increasing its associated complications and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more prone to develop acute cardiac injury as a result of COVID-19. The use of cardiac biomarkers may aid in differentiating the cardiac cause of dyspnea in patients with severe COVID-19. Cardiac biomarkers may also aid in triaging, risk-stratification, clinical decision-making, and prognostication of patients with COVID-19. However, there are concerns that routine testing in all patients with COVID-19 irrespective of severity, may result in unnecessary downstream investigations which may be misleading. In this brief review, using an algorithmic approach, we have tried to rationalize the use of cardiac biomarkers among patients with severe COVID-19. This approach is also likely to lessen the infection exposure risk to the cardiovascular team attending patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: It appears beneficial to triage, risk-stratify, and prognosticate patients with COVID-19 based on the evidence of myocardial injury and the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease.

It sheds light on the new normal and its overarching implications for hotel operations from the user experience perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method strategy was adopted for data collection. Qualitative data was gathered from a video analysis of two webinars with high-profile panels of thought leaders about the challenges arising from the global health crisis and related post-pandemic recovery strategies. This data has been triangulated with desk research and data collected through an online survey which sought to map guest sentiments with respect to resuming the use of hospitality services and their attitude towards the proposed tech transformation initiatives in the Indian luxury hospitality industry. Findings: The research data indicates that despite their pandemic-related trepidations, people still have a strong urge to be social and to travel. Technology can play a pivotal role in creating safe spaces for social distancing, facilitating a contactless guest interface to alleviate guest concerns for safe hygiene and rebuilding customer confidence to address the trust deficit. Practical implications: Hospitality organisations must be discerning in the investments they make in new technology and contactless experiences because hasty investments in extensive automation may be perceived as gimmicky by guests. Intelligent and astute use of technology tools can minimise human error, optimise service efficiency and enhance guest experience through elevated levels of personalised hospitality in luxury hotels by judiciously marrying high touch with high tech.

However, these trials usually experience many challenges, such as extensive time frames, high financial cost, regulatory and administrative barriers, and insufficient workforce. In addition, CTs face several data management challenges pertaining to protocol compliance, patient enrollment, transparency, traceability, data integrity, and selective reporting. Blockchain can potentially address such challenges because of its intrinsic features and properties. Although existing literature broadly discusses the applicability of blockchain-based solutions for CTs, only a few studies present their working proof-of-concept. METHODS: We propose a blockchain-based framework for CT data management, using Ethereum smart contracts, which employs IPFS as the file storage system to automate processes and information exchange among CT stakeholders. CT documents stored in the IPFS are difficult to tamper with as they are given unique cryptographic hashes. We present algorithms that capture various stages of CT data management. We develop the Ethereum smart contract using Remix IDE that is validated under different scenarios. RESULTS: The proposed framework results are advantageous to all stakeholders ensuring transparency, data integrity, and protocol compliance. Although the proposed solution is tested on the Ethereum blockchain platform, it can be deployed in private blockchain networks using their native smart contract technologies. We make our smart contract code publicly available on Github. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the proposed framework can be highly effective in ensuring that the trial abides by the protocol and the functions are executed only by the stakeholders who are given permission. It also assures data integrity and promotes transparency and traceability of information among stakeholders.","output":"Ensuring protocol compliance and data transparency in clinical trials using Blockchain smart contracts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to the disaster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG) established a patient facility for mild condition patients other than hospital. This study was conducted to investigate the operation and necessary resources of a community treatment center (CTC) operated in Seoul, a metropolitan city with a population of 10 million. METHODS: To respond COVID-19 epidemic, the SMG designated 5 municipal hospitals as dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and implemented one CTC cooperated with the Boramae Municipal Hospital for COVID-19 patients in Seoul. As a retrospective cross-sectional observational study, retrospective medical records review was conducted for patients admitted to the Seoul CTC. The admission and discharge route of CTC patients were investigated. The patient characteristics were compared according to route of discharge whether the patient was discharged to home or transferred to hospital. To report the operation of CTC, the daily mean number of tests (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and chest X-ray) and consultations by medical staffs were calculated per week. The list of frequent used medications and who used medication most frequently were investigated. RESULTS: Until May 27 when the Seoul CTC was closed, 26.5% (n = 213) of total 803 COVID-19 patients in Seoul were admitted to the CTC. It was 35.7% (n = 213) of 597 newly diagnosed patients in Seoul during the 11 weeks of operation. The median length of stay was 21 days (interquartile range, 12-29 days). A total of 191 patients (89.7%) were discharged to home after virologic remission and 22 (10.3%) were transferred to hospital for further treatment. Fifty percent of transferred patients were within a week since CTC admission. Daily 2.5-3.6 consultations by doctors or nurses and 0.4-0.9 tests were provided to one patient. The most frequently prescribed medication was symptomatic medication for COVID-19 (cough/sputum and rhinorrhea). The next ranking was psychiatric medication for sleep problem and depression/anxiety, which was prescribed more than digestive drug.

These natural compounds have potential utility in glioblastoma (GBM), a malignant central nervous system tumor derived from astrocytes. Conventional GBM treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical tumor resection are beneficial but limited by extensive tumor invasion and drug/radiation resistance. Therefore, dietary flavonoidswith demonstrated anti-GBM properties in preclinical researchare potential alternative therapies. This review explores the synergistic enhancement of the anti-GBM effects of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs by flavonoids. Primary studies published between 2011 and 2021 on flavonoidCchemotherapeutic synergy in GBM were obtained from PubMed. These studies demonstrate that flavonoids such as chrysin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), formononetin, hispidulin, icariin, quercetin, rutin, and silibinin synergistically enhance the effects of canonical chemotherapeutics. These beneficial effects are mediated by the modulation of intracellular signaling mechanisms related to apoptosis, proliferation, autophagy, motility, and chemoresistance. In this light, flavonoids hold promise in improving current therapeutic strategies and ultimately overcoming GBM drug resistance. However, despite positive preclinical results, further investigations are necessary before the commencement of clinical trials. Key considerations include the bioavailability, bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) permeability, and safety of flavonoids; optimal dosages of flavonoids and chemotherapeutics; drug delivery platforms; and the potential for adverse interactions.","output":"Flavonoids Synergistically Enhance the Anti-Glioblastoma Effects of Chemotherapeutic Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China.

To monitor the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, through international collaborations, we performed genomic epidemiology analyses on a weekly basis with SARS-CoV-2 samples collected from a border region between Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic in a global background. For identified virus mutant variants, active viruses were isolated and functional evaluations were performed to test their replication fitness and neutralization sensitivity against vaccine-elicited serum neutralizing antibodies. Thereby we identified a new B.1.1.7 sub-lineage carrying additional mutations of nucleoprotein G204P and open-reading-frame-8 K68stop. Of note, this B.1.1.7 sub-lineage is the predominant B.1.1.7 variant in several European countries such as Czech Republic, Austria, and Slovakia. The earliest samples belonging to this sub-lineage were detected in November 2020 in a few countries in the European continent, but not in the UK. We have also detected its further evolution with extra spike mutations D138Y and A701V, which are signature mutations shared with the Gamma and Beta variants, respectively. Antibody neutralization assay of virus variant isolations has revealed that the variant with extra spike mutations is 3.2-fold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies as compared to the other B.1.1.7 variants tested, indicating potential for immune evasion, but it also exhibited reduced replication fitness, suggesting lower transmissibility.

However, there are few randomized control trials studying medical cannabis indicating expert guidance on how to dose and administer medical cannabis safely and effectively is needed. METHODS: Using a multistage modified Delphi process, twenty global experts across nine countries developed consensus-based recommendations on how to dose and administer medical cannabis in patients with chronic pain. RESULTS: There was consensus that medical cannabis may be considered for patients experiencing neuropathic, inflammatory, nociplastic, and mixed pain. Three treatment protocols were developed. A routine protocol where the clinician initiates the patient on a CBD-predominant variety at a dose of 5 mg CBD twice daily and titrates the CBD-predominant dose by 10 mg every 2 to 3 days until the patient reaches their goals, or up to 40 mg/day. At a CBD-predominant dose of 40 mg/day, clinicians may consider adding THC at 2.5 mg and titrate by 2.5 mg every 2 to 7 days until a maximum daily dose of 40 mg/day of THC. A conservative protocol where the clinician initiates the patient on a CBD-predominant variety at a dose of 5 mg once daily and titrates the CBD-predominant dose by 10 mg every 2 to 3 days until the patient reaches their goals, or up to 40 mg/day. At a CBD-predominant dose of 40 mg/day, clinicians may consider adding THC at 1 mg/day and titrate by 1 mg every 7 days until a maximum daily dose of 40 mg/day of THC.

Research Question What is the impact of treatment variability on mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS in the United States (US)? Study Design and Methods We conducted a multicenter, observational cohort study of mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS and PaO2/FiO2 < 150 on positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) > 5 cm H2O, who were admitted to 29 US centers between October 1, 2016 and April 30, 2017. The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Center variation in ventilator management, adjunctive therapy use, and mortality were also assessed. Results A total of 2,466 patients were enrolled. Median baseline PaO2/FiO2 was 105 (IQR 78.0, 129.0). In-hospital 28-day mortality was 40.7%. Initial adherence to lung protective ventilation (tidal volume < 6.5 ml/kg predicted body weight, plateau pressure and/or peak inspiratory pressure < 30mm H2O) was 31.4% and varied between centers (0%-65%), as did rates of adjunctive therapy use (27.1%-96.4%), types of modalities used (neuromuscular blockade, prone positioning, systemic steroids, pulmonary vasodilators, and extracorporeal support), and mortality (16.7-73.3%). Center standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), calculated using baseline patient-level characteristics to derive expected mortality rate, ranged from 0.33 to 1.98. Of the treatment-level factors explored, only center adherence to early lung protective ventilation (LPV) was correlated with SMR. Interpretation Substantial center-to-center variability exists in ARDS management, suggesting that further opportunities for improving ARDS outcomes exist. Early adherence to LPV was associated with lower center mortality and may be a surrogate for overall quality of care processes.

In this study, we create a DCNN based on a residual network (Resnet-50) that can identify COVID-19 from two other classes (pneumonia and normal) in chest X-ray images. DCNN was evaluated using two classification methods: Binary (BC-1: COVID-19 vs. normal, BC-2: COVID-19 vs. pneumonia) and multi-class (pneumonia vs. normal vs. COVID-19). In all experiments, four fold cross-validation was used to train and test the model. This architecture's average accuracy is 99.9% for BC-1, 99.8% for BC-2, and 97.3% for multi-class cases. The experimental findings demonstrated that the suggested system detects COVID-19 with an average precision and sensitivity of 95% and 95.1% for multi-class classification, respectively.

Methods: This ecological study was based on freely available governmental data and consisted in comparing 2020-2021 total deaths with the average deaths of the five previous years. The relative excess mortality was then analyzed in function of time (waves) and of space (distribution maps). Findings: Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, Mexico recorded 2,136,611 deaths out of 1,385,240 expected deaths, representing 751,371 excess deaths (95% CI: 697347 to 805363). During this period, we identified three waves of excess deaths that are related to COVID-19 deaths, the second being the most severe, with 109,846 more deaths than expected. When examining each wave, spatial variation in excess mortality was identified, with all 32 states experiencing more deaths than expected (values >0%). However, Mexico City, Tlaxcala and Quertaro recorded values greater than 100% at different times, which resulted in twice as many deaths as the rest. Interpretation: During two years of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 - 2021) the number of deaths increased excessively in the 32 states, which demonstrates the inadequate response to the effects of the pandemic in Mexico.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The design of the present study was descriptive correlation. The present study population included all students of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in the academic year 2020. Two hundred and fifty-one students were selected and completed the COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Questionnaire, Compassion Scale, and COVID-19 Burnout Scale. Pearson correlation coefficient test and structural equation model were performed using SPSS version 18 and LISREL 8.8. RESULTS: The results showed that COVID-19 burnout had a positive and significant relationship with the overall score of anxiety syndrome (r = 0.42, P = 0.01), while it has a negative and significant relationship with compassion (r = ?0.37, P = 0.01). Compassion also has a significant negative relationship with anxiety syndrome (r = ?0.35, P = 0.01). In addition, the results of path analysis showed that compassion plays a mediating role in the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety syndrome and COVID-19 burnout. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of the present study, it can be said that compassion acts as a protective factor against the negative effects of anxiety syndrome.

Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE: The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHODS: IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.","output":"Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the first 7,755 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Korea as of March 12(th), 2020.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the transition to an online teaching format created a unique environment for undergraduate incivility to take place. Further, student incivility has historically been disproportionately experienced by instructors of particular demographic groups, including women and People of Color, but it is currently unknown whether these demographic differences exist in the online environment. In this study, we designed a survey based on previous literature to measure instructor perceptions of student incivility during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed 283 science instructors from a random subset of research-intensive institutions, Masters-granting institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, and community colleges who taught undergraduate courses with synchronous online components in the fall 2020 semester about their experiences with student incivility. Using binary logistic regression and open-coding to analyze our data, we found that over half of instructors surveyed reported experiencing student incivility during fall 2020, with women being significantly more likely to report student incivility than men (Figure 1). Compared to white instructors, Instructors of Color were significantly more likely to report an increase in student incivility in fall 2020 compared to teaching the same course in previous semesters (Figure 1). The most common uncivil behaviors reported by instructors were requests to change student grades, sleeping in class, and excessively communicating with the instructor outside of class. When discussing how they handled experiences of student incivility, over half of instructors reported being irritated or annoyed as a consequence and tolerating or ignoring the behavior as a coping strategy, which could have detrimental effects on the learning environment for all students.

RESULTS A total of 78 responses were obtained (approximately 10% of SNIS membership). Prior to January 2015, two-thirds of respondents reported performing 1-5 thrombectomies per month (67%), with 31% performing more than 5 per month. Following January 2015, 62% of respondents reported performing more than 5 thrombectomies per month; 45% of respondents reported a higher number of thrombectomies after trial publication. 73% and 80% of respondents indicated that inpatient consultations and hospital to hospital transfers for thrombectomy have increased, respectively. A plurality of respondents reported using A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique (40%) as the first strategy for revascularization. Most commonly, neurointerventionalists reported using conscious sedation (56%) for anesthesia. 74% of respondents indicated being successful with their primary technique in at least 70% of cases.

Methods: Serum levels of 11 cytokines and chemokines, in 14 patients with SARS and 24 patients with CAP, were serially checked using a bead\\\\based multiassay system.

CF is associated with abnormalities in fatty acids, ceramides, and cholesterol, their relationship with CF lung pathology is not completely understood. Therefore, we examined the impact of CFTR deficiency on lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory signaling in airway epithelium using mass spectrometric, protein array. We observed a striking imbalance in fatty acid and ceramide metabolism, associated with chronic oxidative stress under basal conditions in CF mouse lung and well-differentiated bronchial epithelial cell cultures of CFTR knock out pig and CF patients. Cell-autonomous features of all three CF models included high ratios of -6- to -3-polyunsaturated fatty acids and of long- to very long-chain ceramide species (LCC/VLCC), reduced levels of total ceramides and ceramide precursors. In addition to the retinoic acid analog fenretinide, the anti-oxidants glutathione (GSH) and deferoxamine partially corrected the lipid profile indicating that oxidative stress may promote the lipid abnormalities. CFTR-targeted modulators reduced the lipid imbalance and oxidative stress, confirming the CFTR dependence of lipid ratios. However, despite functional correction of CF cells up to 60% of non-CF in Ussing chamber experiments, a 72-h triple compound treatment (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor surrogate) did not completely normalize lipid imbalance or oxidative stress. Protein array analysis revealed differential expression and shedding of cytokines and growth factors from CF epithelial cells compared to non-CF cells, consistent with sterile inflammation and tissue remodeling under basal conditions, including enhanced secretion of the neutrophil activator CXCL5, and the T-cell activator CCL17. However, treatment with antioxidants or CFTR modulators that mimic the approved combination therapies, ivacaftor/lumacaftor and ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, did not effectively suppress the inflammatory phenotype. We propose that CFTR deficiency causes oxidative stress in CF airway epithelium, affecting multiple bioactive lipid metabolic pathways, which likely play a role in CF lung disease progression.

The sample consisted of 444 e-learners, including 189 computer programming e-learners, the mean age was 25.19 years. It was found that computer programming e-learners demonstrated significantly lower scores of extraversion, and significantly lower scores of motivating factors of individual attitude and expectation, reward and recognition, and punishment. No significant differences were found in the scores of self-reported cognitive abilities between the groups. In the group of computer programming e-learners, extraversion was a significant predictor of individual attitude and expectation; conscientiousness and extraversion were significant predictors of challenging goals; extraversion and agreeableness were significant predictors of clear direction; open-mindedness was a significant predictor of a diminished motivating factor of punishment; negative emotionality was a significant predictor of social pressure and competition; comprehension-knowledge was a significant predictor of individual attitude and expectation; fluid reasoning and comprehension-knowledge were significant predictors of challenging goals; comprehension-knowledge was a significant predictor of clear direction; and visual processing was a significant predictor of social pressure and competition.

Indeed, citrulline is highly correlated with residual bowel length in patients with short bowel syndrome. It is known to be synthesised in epithelial cells of the small intestine from other amino acids (precursors). Citrulline is then released into systemic circulation and interconverted into arginine in kidneys. If plasma citrulline concentration depends on abundance of intestinal amino acid transporters is not known. The aim of the present study was to explore whether plasma citrulline concentration correlates with the expression of intestinal amino acid transporters. Furthermore, we assessed if arginine in urine correlates with plasma citrulline. METHODS: Duodenal samples, blood plasma and urine were collected from 43 subjects undergoing routine gastroduodenoscopy. mRNA expression of seven basolateral membrane amino acid transporters/transporter subunits were assessed by real-time PCR. Plasma and urine amino acid concentrations of citrulline, its precursors and other amino acids were analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography measurements. Amino acid transporter mRNA expression was correlated with blood plasma and urine levels of citrulline and its precursors using Spearman's rank correlation. Likewise, urine arginine was correlated with plasma citrulline. RESULTS: Plasma citrulline correlated with the mRNA expression of basolateral amino acid transporter LAT4 (Spearman's r = 0.467, p = 0.028) in small intestine. None of the other basolateral membrane transporters/transporter subunits assessed correlated with plasma citrulline. Plasma citrulline correlated with urinary arginine, (Spearman's r = 0.419, p = 0.017), but not with urinary citrulline or other proteinogenic amino acids in the urine. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we showed for the first time that small intestinal basolateral LAT4 expression correlates with plasma citrulline concentration. This finding indicates that LAT4 has an important function in mediating citrulline efflux from enterocytes. Furthermore, urine arginine correlated with plasma citrulline, indicating arginine in the urine as possible additional marker for small intestine enterocyte mass.

The results of the survey revealed that compared with the CON group, more students from CDYS and SIDYS groups did not pass at least one exam in the summer semester. CDYS and SIDYS groups experienced higher stress due to epidemiological restrictions, they had more difficulties than CON with the organisation of learning and obtaining credit during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate a need for special consideration of additional support for students experiencing reading difficulties (whether or not they have a formal diagnosis).","output":"Remote learning among students with and without reading difficulties during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report explores the available curative molecules directed against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Limited efficiency as well as other drawbacks of existing molecules led to the search for promising potential alternatives. Understanding of the cell signaling mechanisms propelling carcinogenesis and driven by cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis can offer valuable information for the investigation of efficient treatment strategies. The complexity of the mechanisms behind carcinogenesis inspires researchers to explore the ability of various biomolecules to target specific pathways. Natural components occurring mainly in food and medicinal plants, are considered an essential resource for discovering new and promising therapeutic molecules. Novel biomolecules normally have an advantage in terms of biosafety. They are also widely diverse and often possess potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. Based on quantitative structureCactivity relationship studies, biomolecules can be used as templates for chemical modifications that improve efficiency, safety, and bioavailability.

Guidelines recommend titration of oxygen to achieve a target oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) range. Information regarding whether this is being achieved is limited. METHODS: In this two-centre non-interventional study we used continuous pulse oximetry in acutely unwell medical patients over a 24-h period to determine the proportion of time spent with SpO(2) within the prescribed target range and whether this is influenced by the target range, age, care in a high-dependency area and the number of oxygen adjustments. RESULTS: Eighty participants were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) proportion of time spent in target range was 55.6% (23.6), this was lower in those with a reduced hypercapnic target range (88C92% or below) compared to those with a range of 92C96%; difference ? 13.1% (95% CI ? 3.0 to ? 23.2), P = 0.012. The proportion of time spent above range was 16.2% (22.9); this was higher in those with a reduced hypercapnic range; difference 21.6% (31.4 to 12), P < 0.001. The proportion of time below range was 28.4% (25.2); there was no difference between target ranges.

This study aims to assess the vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers and their confidence and hesitancy of the COVID19 vaccine. This was a multicenter cross-sectional survey conducted among healthcare providers in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Data collection was carried out between October and November of 2020 through a web-based survey. COVID19 vaccine hesitancy was assessed using eight structured items adapted from the 5Cs. About 34.6% (95% CI: 27.6%-42.4%) of participants were willing to vaccinate against COVID-19 and 44% (95% CI: 36.5%-51.9%) will recommend the vaccine to their patients.

Methods: A retrospective study on prospectively maintained database, including women aged 18-45 who underwent POEM during 2012-2017 at a university hospital. Results: During the study period, POEM was performed in 86 patients. Of them, 23 were women of childbearing age (median age 31.9 [26.0-40.7] years). Follow-up data were available for a median of 24 [16-41] months. Treatment success (Eckardt score <3) was achieved in 22 (95.7%) women. Six (26.1%) women reported attempting to conceive after POEM. Overall, 7 post-POEM pregnancies among 5 women were encountered. All 7 pregnancies were naturally conceived with a median surgery-to-conception interval of 16 [10-21] months. The median gestational weight gain was 10 kg, and was insufficient in all pregnancies. None of the women was hospitalized during the index gestation. All pregnancies resulted in term live-birth vaginal delivery. The median neonatal birthweight was 2940 g, with only one case of a small-for-gestational age infant.

METHODS: Stratum corneum and plasma samples from 15 AD subjects with a history of EH, 13 age- and gender-matched AD subjects without EH history, and 13 healthy non-atopic controls (NA) were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for sphingolipid content. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide levels were validated in plasma samples from the ADVN/ADRN repository (12 NA, 12 AD, 23 EH) and plasma from 7 EV and 7 matched AD subjects. S1P lyase was down-regulated in human primary keratinocytes to evaluate its effect on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) replication in vitro. RESULTS: The stratum corneum of EH patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of free sphingoid bases than NA patients, indicating enhanced sphingolipid turnover in keratinocytes (p<0.05). Plasma from two independent cohorts of EH patients had a significantly increased S1P/ceramide ratio in EH subjects versus AD and NA subjects (p<0.01). The S1P level in plasma from EV subjects was twice its level in AD subjects (mean=1533 vs 732 pmol/ml, p<0.001).

Comparative genomics of phylogenetically diverse mammalian species showed that cGAS and its interaction partner Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) have been inactivated by mutations in the Malayan pangolin whereas other mammals retained intact copies of these genes. The coding sequences of CGAS and STING1 are also disrupted by premature stop codons and frame-shift mutations in Chinese and tree pangolins, suggesting that expression of these genes was lost in a common ancestor of all pangolins that lived more than 20 million years ago.

As the population of patients recovering from COVID-19 grows, it is paramount to establish an understanding of the healthcare issues surrounding them. COVID-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on post-acute COVID-19, its pathophysiology and its organ-specific sequelae. Finally, we discuss relevant considerations for the multidisciplinary care of COVID-19 survivors and propose a framework for the identification of those at high risk for post-acute COVID-19 and their coordinated management through dedicated COVID-19 clinics.","output":"Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has presented unique challenges for people with diabetes, in addition to their high-risk stratification for infection. Supporting people with diabetes to self-care has been critical to reduce their risk of severe infection. This global pandemic has presented an opportunity to digitalize diabetes care and rapidly implement virtual diabetes clinics, with the aim of optimizing diabetes management and well-being, while keeping patients safe. We performed a rapid review of the literature to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of virtual clinics in diabetes care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and have combined these findings with our own reflections in practice. We identified examples demonstrating safety and feasibility of virtual diabetes clinics, which aligns with our own clinical experience during the pandemic. The advantages of virtual clinics include reduced treatment burden, improved therapeutic alliances, societal and psychological benefits, and in our experience, innovative solutions to overcome the challenges presented by the transition from in-person to virtual care. We have provided three infographics to illustrate lessons learned and key recommendations, including steps to establish a virtual diabetes clinic, a checklist guide for health care professionals conducting virtual clinics, and a patient guide for making the most out of the virtual clinic.

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are another pollutant originating from the occupants. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the impact of occupants on the VOC level. In this paper, continuous measurements of CO$_2$, VOC, light, temperature, and humidity were recorded in a 17,000 sqft open office space for around four months. Using different statistical models (e.g., SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest) we evaluated which combination of environmental factors provides more accurate insights on occupant presence. Our preliminary results indicate that VOC is a good indicator of occupancy detection in some cases. It is also concluded that proper feature selection and developing appropriate global occupancy detection models can reduce the cost and energy of data collection without a significant impact on accuracy.","output":"Using Statistical Models to Detect Occupancy in Buildings through Monitoring VOC, CO$_2$, and other Environmental Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related epidemic was first observed in Wuhan, China. In 2020, owing to the highly infectious and deadly nature of the virus, this widespread novel coronavirus disease 2019 (nCOVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic. Studies have revealed that various environmental factors including temperature, humidity, and air pollution may also affect the transmission pattern of COVID-19. Unfortunately, still, there is no specific drug that has been validated in large-scale studies to treat patients with confirmed nCOVID-19. However, remdesivir, an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), has appeared as an auspicious antiviral drug. Currently, a large-scale study on remdesivir (i.e., 200 mg on first day, then 100 mg once/day) is ongoing to evaluate its clinical efficacy to treat nCOVID-19. Good antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 was not observed with the use of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Nonetheless, the combination of umifenovir and LPV/r was found to have better antiviral activity. Furthermore, a combination of hydroxychloroquine (i.e., 200 mg 3 times/day) and azithromycin (i.e., 500 mg on first day, then 250 mg/day from day 2C5) also exhibited good activity. Currently, there are also ongoing studies to evaluate the efficacy of teicoplanin and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

The clinical characteristics of COVID-19-related stroke are not clearly defined, and few controlled studies assessed the underlying mechanisms of cerebrovascular complications of COVID-19. This single-center retrospective observational study compared stroke characteristics between patients with and without COVID-19. Methods: This study included all patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020, in Colmar Hospital for ischemic stroke as confirmed by imaging. The characteristics of patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serology were compared with those without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Result: Among 772 patients, nine COVID-19 patients were compared with 50 patients without COVID-19. The following inflammatory and procoagulant marker levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than those in the control group: C-reactive protein, 57.3  43.4 vs. 15.0  30.6 mg/L, p < 0.001; fibrinogen, 5.89  1.75 vs. 4.03  1.26 g/L, p < 0.001; and D-dimer, 4,833.9  6,549.4 vs. 1,028.6  942.6 ng/ml, p < 0.001.

The Department of Laboratory Medicine of La Paz University Hospital in Madrid (LMD-HULP) was designated to provide laboratory services. Due to the emergency, the IFEMA field hospital had to be prepared for patient admission in less than 1 week and the laboratory professionals had to collaborate in a multidisciplinary group to assure that resources were available to start on time. The LMD-HULP participated together with the managers in the design of the tests portfolio and the integration of the healthcare information systems (IS) (hospital IS, laboratory IS and POCT management system).

Digitalization has changed the workflow and settings of specialized diabetes practices; however, the extent of changes and adaption varies greatly between physicians. In the implementation of digitalization in daily work, it is important to also take expectations and anxieties of practitioners into consideration. AIM: The goal is to evaluate the current status of digitization in outpatient diabetes clinics in Germany based on surveys and personal interviews. In addition to the question of the status of digitization in clinical practice, the question arises as to what factors are considered part of digitization in an outpatient diabetes clinic. Finally, possibilities for digitalization and its use in a diabetes clinic in 2030 will be pointed out. CONCLUSION: Digitalization changes the workflow and the possibilities for diabetes clinics. Due to the obvious advantages and the expectations of patients, digitization can no longer be stopped.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy are largely understood as genetic diseases of sarcomere or desmosome proteins, respectively. In contrast, >250 genes spanning >10 gene ontologies have been implicated in DCM, representing a complex and diverse genetic architecture. To clarify this, a systematic curation of evidence to establish the relationship of genes with DCM was conducted. METHODS: An international panel with clinical and scientific expertise in DCM genetics evaluated evidence supporting monogenic relationships of genes with idiopathic DCM. The panel used the Clinical Genome Resource semiquantitative gene-disease clinical validity classification framework with modifications for DCM genetics to classify genes into categories on the basis of the strength of currently available evidence. Representation of DCM genes on clinically available genetic testing panels was evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty-one genes with human genetic evidence were curated. Twelve genes (23%) from 8 gene ontologies were classified as having definitive (BAG3, DES, FLNC, LMNA, MYH7, PLN, RBM20, SCN5A, TNNC1, TNNT2, TTN) or strong (DSP) evidence. Seven genes (14%; ACTC1, ACTN2, JPH2, NEXN, TNNI3, TPM1, VCL) including 2 additional ontologies were classified as moderate evidence; these genes are likely to emerge as strong or definitive with additional evidence. Of these 19 genes, 6 were similarly classified for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 3 for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Of the remaining 32 genes (63%), 25 (49%) had limited evidence, 4 (8%) were disputed, 2 (4%) had no disease relationship, and 1 (2%) was supported by animal model data only. Of the 16 evaluated clinical genetic testing panels, most definitive genes were included, but panels also included numerous genes with minimal human evidence. CONCLUSIONS: In the curation of 51 genes, 19 had high evidence (12 definitive/strong, 7 moderate). It is notable that these 19 genes explain only a minority of cases, leaving the remainder of DCM genetic architecture incompletely addressed. Clinical genetic testing panels include most high-evidence genes; however, genes lacking robust evidence are also commonly included.

The pandemic has triggered an unprecedented increase in the production, consumption and disposal of multiple types of plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPE) as a measure to reduce the infection. Recent research shows that plastic surfaces can serve as a fomite for coronavirus transmission as it can remain stable and be viable on polypropylene for up to 72 h or on other plastic surfaces for up to 9 days. While it is unknown whether or to what extent macroplastic debris and ubiquitous microplastics emitted into the environment can serve as physical vectors or fomites of pathogenic viruses, recent studies have reported that both macroplastic and microplastics can serve as vectors for harmful pathogens and invasive species (biological pollution). Here, hypothetical scenarios based on the weight of evidence are proposed to plausibly state the role of plastic debris (e.g., single-use-plastics), discarded PPE supplies, including facemasks, sanitizer bottles, gloves, and plastic bags, as well as microplastics as potential physical vectors of SARS-CoV-2, serving as a route of exposure to humans and wildlife in the terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.","output":"Microplastics and Macroplastic Debris as Potential Physical Vectors of SARS-CoV-2: A Hypothetical Overview with Implications for Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The RNase T2 family consists of evolutionarily conserved endonucleases that express in many different species, including animals, plants, protozoans, bacteria, and viruses.

Methods: We compared the results from ClotPro with results from the well-established ROTEM? Delta device and conventional coagulation tests in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Results: Viscoelastic parameters indicated the presence of a potentially hypercoagulable state in the majority of patients. In up to 95 paired measurements, we found strong correlations between several parameters routinely used in clinical practice: (i) EX test vs. EXTEM CT, A5, A10, MCF, (ii) IN test vs. INTEM A5, A10, MCF, and (iii) FIB test vs. FIBTEM A5, A10, MCF (all R > 0.7 and p < 0.001).

We aimed to understand challenges faced by Rwandas CHWs during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown that occurred between March and May 2020 by assessing the availability of trainings, supplies and supervision while exploring perceived needs and challenges. DESIGN AND SETTING: This study was a mixed-method study conducted in three Rwandan districts: Burera, Kirehe and Kayonza. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Using data collected via telephone, we assessed the availability of trainings, supplies and supervision during the first national lockdown, while exploring perceived needs and challenges of CHWs who were engaged in COVID-19 response, in addition to their existing duties of delivering health services in the community. RESULTS: Among the 292 quantitative survey participants, CHWs were responsible for a median of 55 households (IQR: 42C79) and visited a median of 30 households (IQR: 11C52) in the month prior to the survey (July 2020). In the previous 12 months, only 164 (56.2%) CHWs reported being trained on any health topic. Gaps in supply availability, particularly for commodities, existed at the start of the lockdown and worsened over the course of the lockdown. Supervision during the lockdown was low, with nearly 10% of CHWs never receiving supervision and only 24% receiving at least three supervision visits during the 3-month lockdown. In qualitative interviews, CHWs additionally described increases in workload, lack of personal protective equipment and COVID-specific training, fear of COVID-19, and difficult working conditions. CONCLUSION: Many challenges faced by CHWs during the lockdown predated COVID-19 and persisted or were exacerbated during the pandemic. To promote the resilience of Rwandas CHW system, we recommend increased access to PPE; investment in training, supervision and supply chain management; and financial compensation for CHWs.","output":"Rwandas community health workers at the front line: a mixed-method study on perceived needs and challenges for community-based healthcare delivery during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychiatry and psychology have a long history of competition that too often interferes with the collaboration that can characterize complementary contributions to our common missions.

Endoscopists and radiologists provided their respective independent assessment of OV grading after being blinded to the clinical details. Performance of CT grading of OVs was compared with the reference standard endoscopic grading using weighted kappa (k). Non-invasive scores such, as aspartate transaminase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index, platelet: spleen (PS) ratio were correlated between the two techniques. Results OV grading between endoscopists and radiologists showed 81.73% agreement (85 out of 104 patients) in the comparative analysis of 104 cirrhotic patients, of which no varices (57.1%, n=4), small (85.1%, n=23), medium (72.2%%, n=26), and large varices (94.1%, n=32) with a weighted k score of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.94).

PURPOSE: To evaluate potential differences in days on mechanical ventilation for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on route of administration of analgesic and sedative medications: intravenous (IV) alone vs IV + enteral (EN). SUMMARY: This institutional review board-approved study evaluated ventilation time and fentanyl or midazolam requirements with or without concurrent EN hydromorphone and lorazepam. Patients were included in the study if they were 18 to 89 years old and were admitted to the intensive care unit with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction or antigen test and respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 72 hours. In total, 100 patients were evaluated, 60 in the IV-only group and 40 in the IV + EN group. There was not a significant difference in ventilation time between the groups (mean [SD], 19.6 [12.8] days for IV + EN vs 15.6 [11.2] days for IV only; P = 0.104). However, fentanyl (2,064 [847] g vs 2,443 [779] g; P < 0.001) and midazolam (137 [72] mg vs 158 [70] mg; P = 0.004) requirements on day 3 were significantly higher in the IV-only group, and the increase in fentanyl requirements from day 1 to day 3 was greater in the IV-only group than in the IV + EN group (378 [625] g vs 34 [971] g; P = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Addition of EN analgesic and sedative medications to those administered by the IV route did not change the duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19, but the combination may reduce IV opioid requirements, decreasing the impact of IV medication shortages.","output":"Clinical outcomes of concomitant use of enteral and intravenous sedatives and analgesics in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly strained healthcare systems worldwide. The reference standard for diagnosis is a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, but results are not immediate and sensibility is variable. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound compared to chest X-ray for COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective analysis of symptomatic patients admitted into one primary care centre in Spain between March and September 2020. METHOD: Patients' chest X-rays and lung ultrasounds were categorized as normal or pathologic. RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection. Pathologic lung ultrasound images were further categorized as showing either local or diffuse interstitial disease. McNemar and Fisher tests were used to compare diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Most of the 212 patients presented fever at admission, either as a standalone symptom (37.74% of patients) or together with others (72.17% of patients). The positive predictive value of the lung ultrasound was 90% for the diffuse interstitial pattern and 46.92% for local pattern. The lung ultrasound had a significantly higher sensitivity (82.75%) (p < 0.001), but lower specificity (71%) than the chest X-ray (54.02% and 86%, respectively) (p = 0.008) for identifying interstitial lung disease. Moreover, sensitivity of the lung ultrasound for severe interstitial disease was 100%, and was significantly higher than the chest X-ray (58.33%) (p = 0.002).

Such schisms have profound implications for the way in which we manage and conceptualize agrobiodiversity and its benefits. This paper explores the relationship between farmers rights, as recognized in the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, and the dematerialization of genetic resources. Using concepts of stewardship and ownership we emphasize the need to move away from viewing agrobiodiversity as a commodity that can be owned, toward a strengthened, proactive and expansive stewardship approach that recognizes plant genetic resources for food and agriculture as a public good which should be governed as such. Through this lens we analyze the relationship between digital sequence information and different elements of farmers rights to compare and contrast implications for the governance of digital sequence information. Two possible parallel pathways are presented, the first envisaging an enhanced multilateral system that includes digital sequence information and which promotes and enhances the realization of farmers rights; and the second a more radical approach that folds together concepts of stewardship, farmers rights, and open source science.

Positive-sum thinking is associated with less progressive preferences. However, despite theoretical attention, there is no evidence of systematic zero-sum thinking among the public. On the other hand, some descriptions focus on conflict between rich and poor, and these do predict support for greater progressivity. Further analysis is required to differentiate alternative causal explanations of the patterns observed, but different modes of descriptive economic thinking are an important feature of the mass politics of progressivity.","output":"Taxing the rich: public preferences and public understanding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: As the nation implements SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in adults at an unprecedented scale, it is now essential to focus on the prospect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in pediatric populations. To date, no children younger than 12 years have been enrolled in clinical trials. Key challenges and knowledge gaps that must be addressed include (1) rationale for vaccines in children, (2) possible effects of immune maturation during childhood, (3) ethical concerns, (4) unique needs of children with developmental disorders and chronic conditions, (5) health inequities, and (6) vaccine hesitancy. Because COVID-19 is minimally symptomatic in the vast majority of children, a higher acceptable risk threshold is required when evaluating pediatric clinical trials. Profound differences in innate and adaptive immunity during childhood and adolescence are known to affect vaccine responsiveness for a variety of childhood diseases. COVID-19 and the accompanying social disruption, such as the school shutdowns, has been disproportionately damaging to minority and low-income children. In this commentary, we briefly address each of these key issues, specify research gaps, and suggest a broader learning health system approach to accelerate testing and clinical trial development for an ethical and effective strategy to implement a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as rapidly and safely as possible. IMPACT: As the US begins an unprecedented implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, substantial knowledge gaps have yet to be addressed regarding vaccinations in the pediatric population. Maturational changes in the immune system during childhood have influenced the effectiveness of pediatric vaccines for other diseases and conditions, and could affect SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responsiveness in children. Given that COVID-19 disease is far milder in the majority of children than in adults, the riskCbenefit of a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must be carefully weighed. The needs of children with developmental disabilities and with chronic disease must be addressed. Minority and low-income children have been disproportionately adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; care must be taken to address issues of health equity regarding pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials and allocation. Research and strategies to address general vaccine hesitancy in communities must be addressed in the context of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccine testing and trials in the pediatric population: biologic, ethical, research, and implementation challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic brought significant disruption to in-hospital medical training. Virtual reality simulating the clinical environment has the potential to overcome this issue and can be particularly useful to supplement the traditional in-hospital medical training during the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospital access is banned for medical students. The aim of this study was to assess medical students' perception on fully online training including simulated clinical scenarios during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From May to July 2020 when in-hospital training was not possible, 122 students attending the sixth year of the course of Medicine and Surgery underwent online training sessions including an online platform with simulated clinical scenarios (Body Interact&#8482;) of 21 patient-based cases. Each session focused on one case, lasted 2 h and was divided into three different parts: introduction, virtual patient-based training, and debriefing. In the same period, adjunctive online training with formal presentation and discussion of clinical cases was also given. At the completion of training, a survey was performed, and students filled in a 12-item anonymous questionnaire on a voluntary basis to rate the training quality. Results were reported as percentages or with numeric ratings from 1 to 4. Due to the study design, no sample size was calculated. RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen students (94%) completed the questionnaire: 104 (90%) gave positive evaluation to virtual reality training and 107 (93%) appreciated the format in which online training was structured. The majority of participants considered the platform of virtual reality training realistic for the initial clinical assessment (77%), diagnostic activity (94%), and treatment options (81%). Furthermore, 97 (84%) considered the future use of this virtual reality training useful in addition to the apprenticeship at patient's bedside. Finally, 32 (28%) participants found the online access difficult due to technical issues. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, online medical training including simulated clinical scenarios avoided training interruption and the majority of participant students gave a positive response on the perceived quality of this training modality. During this time frame, a non-negligible proportion of students experienced difficulties in online access to this virtual reality platform.","output":"Pre-graduation medical training including virtual reality during COVID-19 pandemic: a report on students' perception"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Due to community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), social distancing and stay-at-home orders were implemented statewide in an effort to limit spread of disease This posed unique challenges for patients on medications requiring close and continued monitoring by clinic staff, such as anticoagulation clinics Thus, innovative measures were implemented at Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS) to maintain the health and care of ambulatory patients An initiative to evaluate patients for warfarin to direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) conversion was employed in the pharmacist-run anticoagulation clinics This article describes how patients were screened for eligibility, the education to pharmacists, the utilization of student learners in the process, and the workflow for provider notification of conversion Follow up monitoring, challenges encountered, and future directions are also described This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved","output":"Implementation of Warfarin to Direct Oral Anticoagulant Conversion Initiative in Pharmacist-run Anticoagulation Clinics during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growth of the information economy and globalization of labor markets will be marked by exponential growth in emerging technologies that will cause considerable disruption of the social and economic sectors that drive the global job market. These disruptions will alter the way we work, where we work, and will be further affected by the changing demographic characteristics and level of training of the available workforce. These changes will likely result in scenarios where existing workplace hazards are exacerbated and new hazards with unknown health effects are created. The pace of these changes heralds an urgent need for a proactive approach to understand the potential effects new and emerging workplace hazards will have on worker health, safety, and well-being. As employers increasingly rely on non-standard work arrangements, research is needed to better understand the work organization and employment models that best support decent work and improved worker health, safety, and well-being. This need has been made more acute by the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic that has resulted in dramatic changes in employment patterns, millions of lost jobs, an erosion of many economic sectors, and widespread disparities which further challenge occupational safety and health (OSH) systems to ensure a healthy and productive workplace. To help identify new research approaches to address OSH challenges in the future, a virtual workshop was organized in June 2020 with leading experts in the fields of OSH, well-being, research methods, mental health, economics, and life-course analysis. A paradigm shift will be needed for OSH research in the future of work that embraces key stakeholders and thinks differently about research that will improve lives of workers and enhance enterprise success. A more transdisciplinary approach to research will be needed that integrates the skills of traditional and non-traditional OSH research disciplines, as well as broader research methods that support the transdisciplinary character of an expanded OSH paradigm.

We hypothesized that reduced modulation of heart rate may be helpful in identifying persons with COVID-19 at risk for developing ARDS. METHODS: : We prospectively enrolled 60 consecutive COVID-19 positive persons presenting at the University Hospital of Tuebingen. Arterial blood gas analysis and 24h-Holter ECG recordings were performed and analyzed at admission. The primary end point was defined as development of ARDS with regards to the Berlin classification. RESULTS: : 61.7% (37 of 60 persons) developed an ARDS. In persons with ARDS DC was significantly reduced when compared to persons with milder course of infection (3.2 ms vs. 6.6 ms, p < 0.001).

Moreover, we sought to understand the interplay of type I interferon (IFN-I) with ACE2, furin and TMPRSS2 by evaluating their gene expression with respect to ISG15, a well-known marker of IFN activation, in upper respiratory samples and after ex vivo IFN exposure. Lower ACE2 levels and trends toward the reduction of furin and TMPRSS2 were found in CF patients compared with the healthy controls; decreased ACE2 amounts were also detected in CF individuals with pancreatic insufficiency and in those receiving inhaled antibiotics. Moreover, there was a strong positive correlation between ISG15 and ACE2 levels. However, after ex vivo IFN stimulation of nasopharyngeal cells, the truncated isoform (dACE2), recently demonstrated as the IFN stimulated one with respect to the full-length isoform (flACE2), slightly augmented in cells from CF patients whereas in those from healthy donors, dACE2 levels showed variable levels of upregulation.

While this is shifting somewhat, there remains a considerable need to address the underprioritization of mental health and well-being, perhaps even more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the history of mental health interventionswhich have overemphasized the biomedical model and have thus resulted in coercion, denial of life in the community, and unnecessary pathologization of human experiencethere is also a need to ensure that increased funding does not simply replicate these mistakes. This is particularly true in the current landscape, where efforts to scale up mental health and to reduce treatment gaps are gaining momentum and where post-pandemic responses are still being formulated. As the potential for global mechanisms for funding mental health increases, national and international funders should look to practices that are rights affirming and contextually relevant. In this paper, I explore the current landscape of mental health financing, in terms of both national resource allocation and development assistance.

However, in this system, it is difficult to immediately act against infectious disease because of missing and delayed reports. Moreover, infectious disease trends are not known, which means prediction is not easy. This study predicts infectious diseases by optimizing the parameters of deep learning algorithms while considering big data including social media data. The performance of the deep neural network (DNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) learning models were compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) when predicting three infectious diseases one week into the future. The results show that the DNN and LSTM models perform better than ARIMA. When predicting chickenpox, the top-10 DNN and LSTM models improved average performance by 24% and 19%, respectively. The DNN model performed stably and the LSTM model was more accurate when infectious disease was spreading.

Here, we investigated which determinants in SARS S control cleavage and activation by TMPRSS2. We found that SARS S residue R667, a previously identified trypsin cleavage site, is also required for S protein cleavage by TMPRSS2. The cleavage fragments produced by trypsin and TMPRSS2 differed in their decoration with N-glycans, suggesting that these proteases cleave different SARS S glycoforms. Although R667 was required for SARS S cleavage by TMPRSS2, this residue was dispensable for TMPRSS2-mediated S protein activation. Conversely, residue R797, previously reported to be required for SARS S activation by trypsin, was dispensable for S protein cleavage but required for S protein activation by TMPRSS2.

However, little is known about the protection an immunised individual confers to their sexual partner or its impact on HPV transmission dynamics. In this context, the Transmission Reduction and Prevention with HPV vaccination (TRAP-HPV) study was designed to determine the efficacy of an HPV vaccine in reducing transmission of genital and oral HPV infection in sexual partners of vaccinated individuals. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The TRAP-HPV study is an ongoing randomised controlled trial among heterosexual couples living in Montreal, Canada. Sexually active couples, aged between 18 and 45 years, who have been in a relationship no longer than 6 months are considered eligible. Participants are independently randomised to receive either the intervention HPV vaccine, Gardasil 9, or a placebo hepatitis A vaccine, Avaxim, creating four vaccination groups among couples: interventionCintervention, interventionCplacebo, placeboCintervention and the placeboCplacebo. Participants provide genital (vaginal/penile) and oral samples at baseline and five follow-up visits over a 1-year duration. Linear Array HPV genotyping is used to detect 36 HPV types. Cox proportional hazard regression models will be used to estimate the effect of vaccination on HPV transmission.

Mitigation efforts, like shelter-in-place orders, have taken a particular toll on parents who have had to navigate disruptions in work and/or school schedules. Research from high-income countries demonstrates increased parental anxiety, stress, depression, and burnout resulting from the pandemic. It is unclear if these outcomes are the same for parents in high-risk communities in low-income countries where pre-pandemic conditions were deleterious. This study addresses this gap and examines the mental health impact of the pandemic on parents in high-risk communities in Guatemala. METHODS: A total of 330 individuals from 11 districts in Guatemala participated in the study and were assessed for sociodemographic characteristics and mental health impairment. Chi-squares were conducted for bivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis revealed differences between groups on burnout, with parents more often reporting feelings of burnout than nonparents (p < .001). Binary regression demonstrated that non-parents were 70% less likely to endorse feelings of stress as compared to parents (OR = .285; p = .014). CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the importance of identifying the unique mental health impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on parents in high-risk communities. In high-risk communities, parental stress is a pressing problem that, if unaddressed, has the potential to result in even greater psychological distress and child maltreatment. Training community healthcare providers to assess and address parental stress can lead to increased community capacity and the development of a community-based network to serve as a first line of support for parents and their children.","output":"Mental health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on parents in high-risk, low income communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the attitudes, beliefs, and practice patterns of vitreoretinal specialists regarding the utilization of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify features which may predict future telemedicine use. Methods: An 11-question anonymous survey was completed electronically in July 2020 by vitreoretinal specialists practicing in the United States. Results: The survey response rate was 13.0% (361/2,774). Thirty-five respondents (9.7%) had used telemedicine before March 1, 2020; after March 1, 2020, 170 (47.1%) reported using telemedicine (p < 0.001). Of the 170 respondents who reported telemedicine use, a majority (65.3%;111/170) performed 0-5 patient visits per week. Female retina specialists, younger physicians, and those with prior telemedicine usage were more likely to use telemedicine. Barriers to telemedicine use included concern for misdiagnosis (332/361, 92.0%), inability to obtain optical coherence tomography imaging (330/361, 91.4%), inability to obtain fundus imaging (327/361, 90.6%), lack of access to and/or comfort with the technology (261/361, 72.3%), potential legal liability (229/361, 63.4%), and low reimbursement (227/361, 62.9%). The majority of respondents (225/361; 62.3%) reported that telemedicine without ancillary imaging was not an acceptable way to evaluate patients. However, 59.2% (214/361) would find telemedicine acceptable if remote imaging was available. Conclusions: The pandemic led to a rapid adoption of telemedicine by vitreoretinal specialists.

We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.","output":"A comparison of bats and rodents as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses: are bats special?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Atherosclerosis, inflammation, and vascular stiffness are prominent interrelated risk factors contributing to the high incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with CKD. Conventional CVD management strategies in CKD largely target atherosclerotic CVD and have had a limited impact on the cardiovascular mortality in this population. Multiple in vivo and in vitro studies and epidemiological evidence from the rheumatologic cohorts have shown that low-dose hydroxychloroquine has beneficial effects on inflammation, endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic syndrome. Our recent proof-of-concept animal study showed that hydroxychloroquine has marked protection against atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness. We hypothesize that hydroxychloroquine has the potential to provide significant cardiovascular benefits in patients with CKD. METHODS The Management of Cardiovascular disease in Kidney disease study (NCT03636152) is a phase 2B, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effects of low-dose hydroxychloroquine therapy on the parameters of atherosclerosis, inflammation, and vascular stiffness in patients with CKD. The study plans to enroll 100 CKD patients estimated to be at high cardiovascular risk by a combination of low estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria and treat them for 18 months with hydroxychloroquine or placebo in 1:1 allocation. RESULTS The study will assess the change in the total carotid plaque volume as measured by serial noncontrast carotid MRI as the primary outcome and the serial changes in plasma inflammation markers, vascular stiffness, renal function, and the composition characteristics of the carotid plaque as secondary outcome measures. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION The results of this trial will provide the proof-of-applicability for hydroxychloroquine in the CVD in CKD. If positive, this trial should lead to phase-3 trials with clinical end points for this potentially transformative, novel, and inexpensive therapy for CVD in CKD.","output":"Management of Cardiovascular Disease in Kidney Disease Study: Rationale and Design."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Analysis of placental genes could unravel maternal-fetal complications. However, inaccessibility to placental tissue during early pregnancy has limited this effort. We tested if exosomes (Exo) released by human placenta in the maternal circulation harbor crucial placental genes. Methods: Placental alkaline phosphate positive exosomes (ExoPLAP) were enriched from maternal blood collected at the following gestational weeks; 6C8th (T1), 12C14th (T2), 20C24th (T3), and 28th?32nd (T4). Nanotracking analysis, electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and immunoblotting were used for characterization. We used microarray for transcriptome and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for gene analysis in ExoPLAP. Results: Physical characterization and presence of CD63 and CD9 proteins confirmed the successful ExoPLAP enrichment. Four of the selected 36 placental genes did not amplify in ExoPLAP, while 32 showed regulations (n = 3C8/time point). Most genes in ExoPLAP showed significantly lower expression at T2CT4, relative to T1 (p < 0.05), such as NOS3, TNFSF10, OR5H6, APOL3, and NEDD4L. In contrast, genes, such as ATF6, NEDD1, and IGF2, had significantly higher expression at T2CT4 relative to T1. Unbiased gene profiling by microarray also confirmed expression of above genes in ExoPLAP-transcriptome. In addition, repeated measure ANOVA showed a significant change in the ExoPLAP transcriptome from T2 to T4 (n = 5/time point). Conclusion: Placental alkaline phosphate positive exosomes transcriptome changed with gestational age advancement in healthy women. The transcriptome expressed crucial placental genes involved in early embryonic development, such as actin cytoskeleton organization, appropriate cell positioning, DNA replication, and B-cell regulation for protecting mammalian fetuses from rejection. Thus, ExoPLAP in maternal blood could be a promising source to study the placental genes regulation for non-invasive monitoring of placental health.","output":"Circulating Placental Alkaline Phosphatase Expressing Exosomes in Maternal Blood Showed Temporal Regulation of Placental Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging and re-emerging infections cause huge concern among public health workers and international and national bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Whilst COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, in severe cases it can cause kidney and multi-organ failure. It is unknown if immunocompromised hosts are at higher risk of more severe systemic disease. Therefore, we report on seven cases of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (median age 54 (range 45-69), three females, from a cohort of 2082 managed transplant follow-up patients) over a six-week period in three south London hospitals. Two of seven patients presented within three months of transplantation. Overall, two were managed on an out-patient basis, but the remaining five required hospital admission, four in intensive care units. All patients displayed respiratory symptoms and fever. Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, lymphopenia and high C-reactive protein. Very high D dimer, ferritin and troponin levels occurred in severe cases and likely prognostic. Immunosuppression was modified in six of seven patients. Three patients with severe disease were diabetic. During a three week follow up one patient recovered, and one patient died. Thus, our findings suggest COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant patients may be severe, requiring intensive care admission. The symptoms are predominantly respiratory and associated with fever.

Viral antigen topographical distribution, presence of influenza A virus receptors in the brain, as well as, the role of the olfactory route in virus CNS invasion were studied using different immunohistochemistry techniques. Besides, viral RNA load in CSF and blood was quantified by means of a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Viral antigen was observed widely distributed in the CNS, showing bilateral and symmetrical distribution in the nuclei of the diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Viral RNA was detected in blood and CSF at one dpi, indicating that the virus crosses the blood-CSF-barrier early during infection. This early dissemination is possibly favoured by the presence of Sia2,3 Gal and Sia2,6 Gal receptors in brain vascular endothelial cells, and Sia2,3 Gal receptors in ependymal and choroid plexus cells. No viral antigen was observed in olfactory sensory neurons, while the olfactory bulb showed only weak staining, suggesting that the virus did not use this pathway to enter into the brain. The sequence of virus appearance and the topographical distribution of this H7N1 HPAIV indicate that the viral entry occurs via the haematogenous route, with early and generalized spreading through the CSF.","output":"Neuropathogenesis of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H7N1) in experimentally infected chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parent education programs, offered via familyCschool partnerships, offer an effective means for promoting the mental health and educational functioning of children and adolescents at a whole-school level.

Consequences for mental and physical health have been reported, but population-level estimates of risk of death during childhood that are adjusted for confounders have not been published to date. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of documented child protection concerns regarding maltreatment with risk of death from infancy to 16 years of age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study was nested in a population birth cohort of 608 547 persons born in South Australia, Australia. Case children were those who died between 1 month and 16 years of age (with the death registered by May 31, 2019). Control children were randomly selected individuals from the same population who were alive at the age at which the case child died, matched 5:1 for age, sex, and Aboriginal status. Data were analyzed from January 2019 to March 2021. EXPOSURE: Children were assigned to 1 of 4 child protection concern categories (child protection system notification[s] only, investigation[s] [not substantiated], substantiated maltreatment, and ever placed in out-of-home care) based on administrative data from the South Australia Department for Child Protection or were classified as unexposed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality rate ratios for death before 16 years of age, by child protection concern category, were estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusted for birth outcomes, maternal attributes, and area-based socioeconomic status. Patterns of cause of death were compared for children with vs without child protection concerns. RESULTS: Of 606 665 children included in the study, 1635 were case children (57.9% male [when sex was known]; mean [SD] age, 3.59 [4.56] years) and 8175 were control children (57.7% male; mean [SD] age, 3.59 [4.56] years [age censored at the time of death of the matched control child]). Compared with children with no child protection system contact, adjusted mortality rate ratios among children who died before 16 years of age were 2.69 (95% CI, 2.05-3.54) for children with child protection system notification(s) only; 3.16 (95% CI, 2.25-4.43) for children with investigation(s) (not substantiated); 2.93 (95% CI, 1.95-4.40) with substantiated maltreatment; and 3.79 (95% CI, 2.46-5.85) for children ever placed in out-of-home care. External causes represented 136 of 314 deaths (43.3%) among children with a documented child protection concern and 288 of 1306 deaths (22.1%) among other children. Deaths from assault or self-harm were most overrepresented, accounting for 11.1% of deaths in children with child protection concerns but just 0.8% of deaths among other children. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this case-control study, children with documented child protection concerns, who were known to child protection agencies and were typically seen by clinicians and other service providers, had a higher risk of death compared with children with no child protection service contact.

The incidence was small in the first part of the pandemic (2,6%) compared with the national incidence, and it was higher in C than in B (5,6% vs 1,1%) The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 disease in the population of Extremadura's hemodialysis patients and to study the clinical evolution, treatment and mortality in patients with confirmed infection with Polymerase chain reaction(PCR) during the second wave. METHOD: Multicenter, retrospective, observational study of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 disease between August and December of 2020. There were 683 hemodialysis patients in this period distributed in 5 hospital units and 7 out of hospital Units. RESULTS: Incidence: 6,8% (46 infected of SARS-Cov 2), with almost one patient in each center (the highest with 16,1%) and higher incidence in B than in C (8,1% vs 4,1%). Males (58,7%), media age, (69,311,9) and median renal replacement therapy time 29 months (RIC 47,4).

The goal was to generate insights for tool providers and policymakers regarding the development and funding of ideally designed and priced tools. Ultimately, healthcare systems can only benefit from quality enhancing AI when provider adoption is considered. METHODS: Since there is no established market for AI-based assistance tools in radiology yet, a discrete choice experiment was conducted. Respondents from the two major German professional radiology associations chose between hypothetical tools composed of five attributes and a no-choice option. The attributes included: provider, application, quality impact, time savings and price. A conditional logit model was estimated identifying preferences for attribute levels, the no-choice option, and significant subject-related interaction effects. RESULTS: 114 respondents were included for analysis of which 46% were already using an AI-based assistance tool. Average adoption probability for an AI-based tool was 81% (95% CI 77.1% ? 84.4%). Radiologists preferred a tool that assists in routine diagnostics performing at above-radiologist-level quality and saves 50% in diagnostics time at a price-point of 3 per study. The provider is not a significant factor in the decisions. Time savings were considered more important than quality improvements (i.e., detecting more anomalies). CONCLUSIONS: Radiologists are overall willing to invest in AI-based assistance tools. Development, funding, and research regarding these tools should, however, consider providers preferences for features of immediate everyday and economic relevance like time savings to optimize adoption.

Even though there is not much material basis to these rights, transgender communities have been protesting against the state and at times negotiating with it to get laws that are more in alignment with their rights. In the wake of serialised deaths and precarity intensified by the Covid-19 pandemic, transgender communities also stage other negotiations in the everyday with activists, transnationally funded NGOs and academics researching their communities, encounters that are not as spectacular as the protests against the state, but that which ensures their daily sustenance. This paper investigates how they inhabit these systemically violent institutions. Deploying ethnographic field notes from eastern India, this paper argues that they inhabit them subjunctively, which is not about refusing engagement with what is oppressive but about the ceaseless conjuring of improvisatory and contingent gestures that are marked by hope as well as uncertainty. The simultaneity of protests, rage, hopelessness, hope, negotiations, supplications and scepticism allow them to not only endure the violence of institutions but also to rupture them and imagine them otherwise.","output":"Inhabiting the state subjunctively: Transgender life-making alongside death and a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Findings from CCC19 and TERAVOLT suggest that patients with cancer may be more likely to die from COVID-19 than people in the general population.

The subsequent need for social distancing when traveling has driven many cities to reduce public transport services, as urban residents simultaneously stay at home and avoid crowded spaces. As a result, cities are turning to cycling to meet the mobility needs of their inhabitants, particularly those who lack access to a private vehicle. Infrastructure plays a critical role in encouraging cycling by protecting cyclists and providing safe and comfortable conditions for users of various confidence levels. Due to the pandemic, this infrastructure has been rapidly constructed, in many cases, as pop-up or temporary installations. In this article, we present and examine the design methods and community response to an emergent bike lane along Avenida Guadalupe in Zapopan, Mxico during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this examination, the paper distills and highlights the key features of a successful emergent bike lane in the urban Global South and identifies gaps in need of filling. The emergent intervention is 4.2 km and includes a number of traffic calming elements such as bollards and markings, connecting the peripheral part of the city to the existing cycle infrastructure.

Progress will depend on future advances in prophylactic vaccine activity, including advancement of candidates capable of generating more potent induction of cross-reactive T cells and durable cross-reactive antibody responses. Here we evaluated an Amphiphile (AMP) adjuvant, AMP-CpG, admixed with SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) immunogen, as a lymph node-targeted protein subunit vaccine (ELI-005) in mice and non-human primates (NHPs). AMP-mediated targeting of CpG DNA to draining lymph nodes resulted in comprehensive local immune activation characterized by extensive transcriptional reprogramming, inflammatory proteomic milieu, and activation of innate immune cells as key orchestrators of antigen-directed adaptive immunity. Prime-boost immunization with AMP-CpG in mice induced potent and durable T cell responses in multiple anatomical sites critical for prophylactic efficacy and prevention of severe disease. Long-lived memory responses were rapidly expanded upon re-exposure to antigen. In parallel, RBD-specific antibodies were long-lived, and exhibited cross-reactive recognition of variant RBD. AMP-CpG-adjuvanted prime-boost immunization in NHPs was safe and well tolerated, while promoting multi-cytokine-producing circulating T cell responses cross-reactive across variants of concern (VOC). Expansion of RBD-specific germinal center (GC) B cells in lymph nodes correlated to rapid seroconversion with variant-specific neutralizing antibody responses exceeding those measured in convalescent human plasma. These results demonstrate the promise of lymph-node adjuvant-targeting to coordinate innate immunity and generate robust adaptive responses critical for vaccine efficacy.","output":"Programming the lymph node immune response with Amphiphile-CpG induces potent cellular and humoral immunity following COVID-19 subunit vaccination in mice and non-human primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People who are homeless experience significantly poorer health than the general population and often face multifaceted challenges engaging with public healthcare services.

Individuals in both A and I may go directly to an immune class V, and in I to a dead class D. Upon this SCLAIV formulation we impose a set of drivers that can be used to develop policy to manage current Covid-19 and similar type disease outbreaks. These drivers include surveillance, social distancing (rate and efficacy), social relaxation, quarantining (linked to contact tracing), patient treatment/isolation and vaccination processes that can either be a non-negative constant or an s-shaped switching curve. The latter are defined in terms of onset and switching times, initial and final values, and abruptness of switching. We built a Covid-19 NMB-DASA web app to generate both deterministic and stochastic solutions to our SCLAIV and drivers model and use incidence and mortality data to provide both maximum-likelihood frequentist and Bayesian fitting of parameters. In the context of South African and English Covid-19 incidence data we demonstrate how to both identify and evaluate the role of drivers in ongoing outbreaks. In particular, we show that early social distancing in South Africa likely averted around 80,000 observed cases (actual number is double if only half the case are observed) during the months of June and July. We also demonstrated that incidence rates in South Africa will increase to between a conservative estimate of 15 and 30 thousand observed cases per day (again, actual number considerably higher) by the end of August if stronger social distancing measures are not effected during July and August, 2020. On different a note, we show that comparably good local optimal fits of the English data using surveillance, social distancing and social relaxation drivers can represent very different kinds of outbreaks---one with close to 90% and another with under 8% immune individuals. This latter result provides a cautionary tale of why fitting SEIR-like models to incidence or prevalence data can be extremely problematic when not anchored by other critical measures, such as levels of immunity in the population.

This situation thus highlights the significance of balancing the economy with safety and health. Safety economics, considering the interdependencies between safety and micro-economics, is ideal for supporting this kind of decision-making. Although economic approaches such as cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis have been used in safety management, little attention has been paid to the fundamental issues and the primary methodologies in safety economics.

Firstly, safety economics is defined as a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field of academic research focusing on the interdependencies and coevolution of micro-economies and safety. Then we explore the role of safety economics in safety management and production investment. Furthermore, to make decisions more profitable, economic approaches are summarized and analyzed for decision-making about prevention investments and/or safety strategies.

Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 123 [95% CI 087-175]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 152 [095-243]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early. INTERPRETATION: In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.

Abstract The characteristics of pandemic influenza 2009 differ from those of seasonal influenza. In Australia-New Zealand the number of admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) increased by 15-fold in the southern winter. We compared the characteristics of the Spanish series of the first ICU admissions in July with those of series published in Canada and Australia-New Zealand up to October 2009. Unlike the situation in Spain, only half the admissions in Canada and Australia-New Zealand were due to primary viral pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia was much more frequent. In all series, young people, many of whom had no comborbidities, were the most frequently affected population. The most common comorbidities were obesity, chronic pulmonary disease, pregnancy and heart disease. Diagnosis through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction can have a false-negative rate of 10%. Shock and acute renal insufficiency were more frequent in the Spanish series. A total of 10-30% of patients required ICU admission and 6 of 10 patients required mechanical ventilation with a high frequency of failure of non-invasive ventilation (75%). Mortality was similar among the series (14-25%) but was higher in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (30%). Early oseltamivir administration (< 48h after symptom onset) has been associated with better outcome. Therefore, early administration of this drug in patients with risk factors or those who, although free from risk factors, show clinical progression, could reduce ICU admissions and mortality.","output":"Gripe A (H1N1)v pandmica en UCI: ?qu hemos aprendido?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we ?write-to? time from an autoethnographic perspective Working intra-actively via a dialogic play script form, we collaboratively wonder about time during our experiences of COVID-19 as it relates to a compression of offline into online spaces Presenting conversations we?ve had together over email, WhatsApp, and Google docs, with the reviewers of this Special Issue, and with scholarship, we foreground three main questions: What does time mean?

Herpes zoster virus encephalitis if not treated promptly can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of herpes zoster virus encephalitis is based on clinical history, examination, neuroradiological imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography scan), cerebrospinal fluid analysis and identification of the pathogen in cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or anti-herpes zoster virus immunoglobulin G antibody in cerebrospinal fluid. Although ischemic intracerebral infarcts in patients with herpes zoster virus encephalitis or vasculopathy are reported in the literature, multiple intracerebral hemorrhages as a complication of herpes zoster virus encephalitis in an immunocompetent individual are extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old Indian man presented with an acute history of four episodes of seizures, fever, headache, drowsiness, focal neurological deficits and vesicular eruptions over the abdomen in a typical dermatomal distribution. His head computed tomography scan revealed multiple cerebral hemorrhages. Investigations (positive ratio between the cerebrospinal fluid/serum quotients for anti-herpes zoster virus immunoglobulin G and total immunoglobulin G antibodies) established its infective origin due to herpes zoster virus. He developed bilateral pneumonia during the hospital course. He had an excellent recovery following a 2 weeks course of intravenous acyclovir. CONCLUSION: Herpes zoster virus encephalitis or vasculopathy is a rare cause of multiple intracerebral hemorrhages and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with an acute history of fever, altered consciousness, and focal neurologic deficits with history of a typical herpetic rash.

We reported 2 cases of shoulder weakness and amyotrophy related to spinal accessory nerve (SAN) palsy due to neuralgic amyotrophy occurring after COVID-19 infection. METHODS: For both patients, clinical history, clinical examination, electrodiagnostic (EDX), and imaging examinations invalidated other diagnoses but confirmed NA diagnosis. RESULTS: The NA involved only the SAN in both cases. EDX revealed a characteristic axonal lesion found in NA. SAN conduction study revealed normal latencies and low compound motor action potential amplitude for trapezius muscle when needle examination demonstrated a neurogenic pattern and denervation signs in the trapezius muscle. Both patient's MRI revealed denervation T2 hypersignal in impaired muscles, and hypersignal of the involved roots, trunks, or nerves without any mass, cyst, injury, fibrous band, or tearing signs along SAN course. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 infection could be the trigger for NA as many other viruses, and as it is a possible trigger for Guillain-Barr syndrome.","output":"Neuralgic amyotrophy and COVID-19 infection: 2 cases of spinal accessory nerve palsy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As soon as it became clear that our economy was going to be paralyzed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons leadership acted swiftly to ensure that our members were going to be eligible for the anticipated federal economic stimulus.

The BA.1 and BA.2 sublineages of Omicron are circulating in Europe and it is urgent to evaluate the transmissibility of these sub-lineages. Using a mathematical model describing trajectories of variant frequencies that assumes a constant ratio in generation times and a constant ratio in effective reproduction numbers among variants, trajectories of variant frequencies in Denmark from November 22, 2021 to February 26, 2022 were analyzed. We found that the generation times of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 are 0.60 (95%CI: 0.59-0.62) and 0.51 (95%CI: 0.50-0.52) of the length of that of Delta, respectively. We also found that the effective reproduction number of Omicron BA.1 is 1.99 (95% CI: 1.98-2.02) times and that of Omicron BA.2 is 2.51 (95% CI: 2.48- 2.55) times larger than the effective reproduction number of Delta. The generation times of Omicron BA.2 is 0.85 (95% CI:0.84-0.86) the length of that of BA.1 and that the effective reproduction number of Omicron BA.2 is 1.26 (95% CI:1.25-1.26) times larger than that of Omicron BA.1. These estimates on the ratio of generation times and the ratio of effective reproduction numbers has epidemiologically important implications. The duration of quarantine for people who contacted with an Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 patient can be reduced to 60% and 51% of that for Delta, respectively.

Implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) has also made an impact on COVID-19 transmission, changing the transmission pattern to intrahousehold transmission under stringent containment measures. Therefore, it is necessary to re-estimate the influence of air temperature on COVID-19 transmission while excluding the influence of NPIs. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study is a data-based comprehensive modelling analysis. A stochastic epidemiological model, the ScEIQR model (contactable susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-removed), was established to evaluate the influence of air temperature and containment measures on the intrahousehold spread of COVID-19. Epidemic data on COVID-19, including daily confirmed cases, number of close contacts, etc, were collected from the National Health Commission of China. OUTCOME MEASURES: The model was fitted using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a cost function based on the least squares method. The LOESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) regression function was used to assess the relationship between air temperature and rate of COVID-19 transmission within the ScEIQR model. RESULTS: The ScEIQR model indicated that the optimal temperature for spread of COVID-19 peaked at 10 (50H), ranging from 5 to 14 (41H?57.2H). In the fitted model, the fitted intrahousehold transmission rate (¡) of COVID-19 was 10.22 (IQR 8.47C12.35) across mainland China. The association between air temperature and ¡ of COVID-19 suggests that COVID-19 might be seasonal. Our model also validated the effectiveness of NPIs, demonstrating that diminishing contactable susceptibility (Sc) and avoiding delay in diagnosis and hospitalisation () were more effective than contact tracing ( and ). CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a novel epidemic model to estimate the effect of air temperature on COVID-19 transmission beyond implementation of NPIs, which can inform public health strategy and predict the transmission of COVID-19.","output":"Impact of air temperature and containment measures on mitigating the intrahousehold transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a data-based modelling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The role of children and young people (CYP) in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in household and educational settings remains unclear. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of contact-tracing and population-based studies at low risk of bias. Methods We searched 4 electronic databases on 28 July 2021 for contact-tracing studies and population-based studies informative about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from 0-19 year olds in household or educational settings. We excluded studies at high risk of bias, including from under-ascertainment of asymptomatic infections. We undertook multilevel random effects meta-analyses of secondary attack rates (SAR: contact-tracing studies) and school infection prevalence, and used meta-regression to examine the impact of community SARS-CoV-2 incidence on school infection prevalence. Findings 4529 abstracts were reviewed, resulting in 37 included studies (16 contact-tracing; 19 population studies; 2 mixed studies). The pooled relative transmissibility of CYP compared with adults was 0.92 (0.68, 1.26) in adjusted household studies. The pooled SAR from CYP was lower (p=0.002) in school studies 0.7% (0.2, 2.7) than household studies (7.6% (3.6, 15.9) . There was no difference in SAR from CYP to child or adult contacts. School population studies showed some evidence of clustering in classes within schools. School infection prevalence was associated with contemporary community 14-day incidence (OR 1.003 (1.001, 1.004), p<0.001). Interpretation We found no difference in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from CYP compared with adults within household settings. SAR were markedly lower in school compared with household settings, suggesting that household transmission is more important than school transmission in this pandemic. School infection prevalence was associated with community infection incidence, supporting hypotheses that school infections broadly reflect community infections. These findings are important for guiding policy decisions on shielding, vaccination school and operations during the pandemic.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and young people in households and schools: a meta-analysis of population-based and contact-tracing studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed an immense burden on healthcare systems worldwide.

In severe cases, there can be widespread activation of the immune system, vascular injury and a resultant pro-thrombotic state. Severe COVID-19 is widely regarded as a risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Interim European and American guidelines have been created to guide anticoagulation strategies in COVID-19 patients.

We hypothesized that genetic variants in ADRB2 associated with a response to asthma therapy during an asthma exacerbation were also associated with severity of acute respiratory tract infections. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 5 common polymorphisms in the promoter region and coding block of the ADRB2 gene (loci -2387, -2274, -1343, +46, and +79) from 374 Caucasian and African American term infants who were enrolled at the time of acute respiratory illness over four respiratory viral seasons. Severity of respiratory tract infections was measured using a bronchiolitis severity score (BSS; range = 0-12, clinically significant difference = 0.5) with a higher score indicating more severe disease. We assigned the promoter, coding and combined promoter and coding haplotypes to the unphased genotype data. The associations between each of these five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as the haplotypes and infant BSS were analyzed using nonparametric univariate analysis and multivariable proportional odds model separately in Caucasians and African Americans. RESULTS: There was no significant association between infant BSS and each of the SNPs in both Caucasians and African Americans. However, promoter haplotype CCA was associated with a decreased BSS in African Americans in a dose dependent manner. The median (interquartile range) BSS of infants with no copies of the CCA haplotype, one copy, and two copies of the CCA haplotype were 5.5 (2.0, 8.0), 4.0 (1.0, 7.5), and 3.0 (1.0, 4.0), respectively. This dose dependent relationship persisted after adjusting for infant age, gender, daycare exposure, secondhand smoke exposure, prior history of breastfeeding, siblings at home, and enrollment season (adjusted odds ratio: 0.59, 95 % confidence interval: 0.36, 0.98). There was no similar protective relationship of haplotype CCA on severity of respiratory tract infections identified in Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: ADRB2 genotype may be predictive of severity of acute respiratory tract infections in African Americans, and potentially identify a subset of infants who may respond to beta-agonist therapy.

In response, New York State permitted medical students with appropriate clinical experience to administer vaccinations. Albert Einstein College of Medicine students rapidly stepped in to administer vaccines and serve as clinic navigators. Student leaders at Einstein collaborated with Montefiore Medical Center to rapidly implement a student vaccination initiative. Medical students underwent virtual and on-site training regarding COVID-19 vaccines and their administration. In January 2021, students began to staff vaccine clinics across the Bronx.

The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (a4%) compared to health care professionals (a14%). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from severe forms of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition, to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20-200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (30-100 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: Our hypothesis is that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter time to response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ+standard-of-care (CPZ+SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ+SOC group, compared to the SOC group: (A) superior clinical improvement; (B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); (C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); (D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; (E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; (F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps and can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its \\"LARGe ACTion\\" properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Repositionnement de la chlorpromazine dans le traitement du COVID-19 : tude reCoVery./ [Repurposing of chlorpromazine in COVID-19 treatment: the reCoVery study]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Enpatoran, formerly known as M5049, is a potential first-in-class small molecule antagonist of toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, which may prevent viral-associated hyperinflammatory response and progression to cytokine storm in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The objective of this study was to leverage existing population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (popPK/PD) models for enpatoran to inform dose selection for an accelerated Phase II study in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. METHODS: The popPK/PD models were based on plasma PK and PD biomarker (ex vivo-stimulated interleukin [IL]6 and interferon  [IFN] secretion) data from the enpatoran first-in-human Phase I study in healthy participants (Port A, et al. Lupus Sci Med 2020;7(Suppl. 1): Abstract P135). A two-compartment model describing PK used a sigmoidal E(max) model with proportional decrease from baseline characterizing the PD response across the investigated single and multiple daily dose range of 1C200 mg (N=72). Concentrations that inhibited 50% and 90% (IC(50)/IC(90)) of cytokine secretion were estimated and stochastic simulations were performed to assess target coverage under different dosing regimens. RESULTS: Simulations suggested that, to achieve maximal inhibition of IL-6 over time, enpatoran PK concentrations would be maintained above the IC(90) throughout the dosing interval with doses of 100 mg and 50 mg twice daily in 90% and 30% of participants, respectively. In comparison, IFN inhibition was predicted to be lower, with IC(90) coverage in 60% and 8% of participants with twice daily doses of 100 mg and 50 mg enpatoran, respectively. CONCLUSION: Utilization of existing popPK/PD models allowed for the accelerated development of enpatoran in COVID-19 to address an unprecedented global pandemic. Rational model-informed dose selection was supported by data from a Phase I study in which there were no safety concerns.

One hundred and seven (47.5%) received BNT162b2 mRNA, 34 (15.1%) Ad5-nCoV, 29 (12.8%) mRNA-1273, 28 (12.4%) ChAdOX1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), 22 (9.7%) CoronaVac and 5 (2.2%) Ad26.COV2.S. The vaccines that had the most AE proportionally to the number of patients vaccinated were Janssen (5; 100%) followed by Pfizer-BioNTEch (86; 80%) and CanSinoBIO (27; 79.4%). Localized pain was the most frequent (158; 70.2%) AE. Fatigue (78; 34.7%), headache (69; 30.6%) and muscle ache (66; 29.3%) were the most common systemic symptoms. No serious AE that required medical attention or hospitalization were reported. The current results support the safety of different COVID-19 vaccines in patients with AIIRD. This information can help fight vaccine hesitancy in this population.","output":"Adverse events of six COVID-19 vaccines in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly experienced in the aftermath of major incidents such as terrorism and pandemics. Well-established principles of response include effective and scalable treatment for individuals affected by PTSD. In England, such responses have combined proactive outreach, screening and evidence-based interventions (a screen-and-treat approach), but little is known about its cost-effectiveness. The objective of this paper is to report the first systematic attempt to assess the cost-effectiveness of this approach. METHODS: A decision modelling analysis was undertaken to estimate the costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from a screen-and-treat approach compared with treatment-as-usual, the latter involving identification of PTSD by general practitioners and referral to psychological therapy services. Model input variables were drawn from relevant empirical studies in the context of terrorism and the unit costs of health and social care in England. The model was run over a 5-year time horizon for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 exposed adults from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services in England. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained was 7931. This would be considered cost-effective 88% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20 000 per QALY gained, the threshold associated with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England. Sensitivity analysis confirmed this result was robust. CONCLUSIONS: A screen-and-treat approach for identifying and treating PTSD in adults following terrorist attacks appears cost-effective in England compared with treatment-as-usual through conventional primary care routes. Although this finding was in the context of terrorism, the implications might be translatable into other major incident-related scenarios including the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of screen-and-treat interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder following major incidents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides an application of William Glasser's (1998) choice theory and Randy Pausch's (2007) \\"lessons learned\\" to the current worldwide health pandemic, COVID-19 Furthermore, reflective questions are included to support mental health workers as they engage with people impacted by COVID-19","output":"A Beacon of Light: Applying Choice Theory to the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the summer of 2020, a survey-based study was conducted at North Carolina State University, a land-grant university, to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on pre-veterinary students' ability to gain experience hours for Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) admissions.

The Dutch Radiological Society developed CO-RADS as a diagnostic indicator for assessing suspicion of lung involvement of COVID-19 on a scale of 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). We investigated retrospectively 154 adult patients with clinically suspected COVID-19, between April and June 2020, who underwent chest CT and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patients average age was 61.3 years (range, 21C93), 101 were male, and 76 were RT-PCR positive. Using CO-RADS, four radiologists evaluated the chest CT images. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Interobserver agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) by comparing the individual readers score to the median of the remaining three radiologists. The average sensitivity was 87.8% (range, 80.2C93.4%), specificity was 66.4% (range, 51.3C84.5%), and AUC was 0.859 (range, 0.847C0.881); there was no significant difference between the readers (p > 0.200).

Whether the chloroplast employs recoding is unknown. I-iota, a plastome mutant of Oenothera (evening primrose), carries a single adenine insertion in an oligoA stretch [11A] of the atpB coding region (encoding the -subunit of the ATP synthase). The mutation is expected to cause synthesis of a truncated, nonfunctional protein. We report that a full-length AtpB protein is detectable in I-iota leaves, suggesting operation of a recoding mechanism. To characterize the phenomenon, we generated transplastomic tobacco lines in which the atpB reading frame was altered by insertions or deletions in the oligoA motif. We observed that insertion of two adenines was more efficiently corrected than insertion of a single adenine, or deletion of one or two adenines. We further show that homopolymeric composition of the oligoA stretch is essential for recoding, as an additional replacement of AAA lysine codon by AAG resulted in an albino phenotype. Our work provides evidence for the operation of translational recoding in chloroplasts. Recoding enables correction of frameshift mutations and can restore photoautotrophic growth in the presence of a mutation that otherwise would be lethal.","output":"Correction of frameshift mutations in the atpB gene by translational recoding in chloroplasts of Oenothera and tobacco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IL-35, a relatively newly discovered cytokine belonging to the larger IL-12 family, shows unique anti-inflammatory properties, believed to be associated with dedicated receptors and signaling pathways. IL-35 plays a pivotal role in the development and the function of both regulatory B (Bregs) and T cells (Tregs). In order to further its therapeutic potential, a dairy Lactococcus lactis strain was engineered to express murine IL-35 (LL-IL35), and this recombinant strain was applied to suppress collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Oral administration of LL-IL35 effectively reduced the incidence and disease severity of CIA. When administered therapeutically, LL-IL35 abruptly halted CIA progression with no increase in disease severity by reducing neutrophil influx into the joints. LL-IL35 treatment reduced IFN- and IL-17 3.7- and 8.5-fold, respectively, and increased IL-10 production compared to diseased mice. Foxp3(+) and Foxp3(?) CD39(+) CD4(+) T cells were previously shown to be the Tregs responsible for conferring protection against CIA. Inquiry into their induction revealed that both CCR6(+) and CCR6(?) Foxp3(+or?)

This method, as with all microarray applications, requires adequate coverage of probes targeting the regions of interest. An unbiased tiling of probes across the entire length of the genome is the most flexible design approach. However, such a whole-genome tiling requires that the genome sequence is known in advance. For the accurate analysis of uncharacterized bacteria, an array must query a fully representative set of sequences from the species' pan-genome. Prior microarrays have included only a single strain per array or the conserved sequences of gene families. These arrays omit potentially important genes and sequence variants from the pan-genome. RESULTS: This paper presents a new probe selection algorithm (PanArray) that can tile multiple whole genomes using a minimal number of probes. Unlike arrays built on clustered gene families, PanArray uses an unbiased, probe-centric approach that does not rely on annotations, gene clustering, or multi-alignments. Instead, probes are evenly tiled across all sequences of the pan-genome at a consistent level of coverage. To minimize the required number of probes, probes conserved across multiple strains in the pan-genome are selected first, and additional probes are used only where necessary to span polymorphic regions of the genome. The viability of the algorithm is demonstrated by array designs for seven different bacterial pan-genomes and, in particular, the design of a 385,000 probe array that fully tiles the genomes of 20 different Listeria monocytogenes strains with overlapping probes at greater than twofold coverage. CONCLUSION: PanArray is an oligonucleotide probe selection algorithm for tiling multiple genome sequences using a minimal number of probes. It is capable of fully tiling all genomes of a species on a single microarray chip. These unique pan-genome tiling arrays provide maximum flexibility for the analysis of both known and uncharacterized strains.","output":"Efficient oligonucleotide probe selection for pan-genomic tiling arrays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic etiology of Vici syndrome in a Chinese family.

Therefore, there is an imperative to develop novel highly efficient (synthetic) agents against both drug-sensitive-TB and DR-TB. The exploration of various heterocycles as prospective core scaffolds for the discovery, development and optimization of anti-TB drugs remains an intriguing scientific endeavour. Telacebec (Q203; TCB), a molecule containing an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IPA) structural motif, is considered a novel very promising anti-TB agent showing a unique mechanism of action. The compound blocks oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting a mycobacterial respiratory chain due to interference with a specific cytochrome b subunit (QcrB) of transmembrane bc1 menaquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase as an essential component for transporting electrons across the membrane from menaquinol to other specific subunit, cytochrome c (QcrC). Thus, the ability of mycobacteria to synthesize adenosine-5-triphosphate is limited and energy generating machinery is disabled.

How viroplasms form remains unknown. We previously found two forms of NSP2 in RV-infected cells: a cytoplasmically dispersed dNSP2, which interacts with hypophosphorylated NSP5; and a viroplasm-specific vNSP2, which interacts with hyperphosphorylated NSP5. Other studies report that CK1, a ubiquitous cellular kinase, hyperphosphorylates NSP5, but requires NSP2 for reasons that are unclear. Here we show that silencing CK1 in cells before RV infection resulted in (i) >90% decrease in RV replication, (ii) disrupted vNSP2 and NSP5 interaction, (iii) dispersion of vNSP2 throughout the cytoplasm, and (iv) reduced vNSP2 protein levels. Together, these data indicate that CK1 directly affects NSP2. Accordingly, an in vitro kinase assay showed that CK1 phosphorylates serine 313 of NSP2 and triggers NSP2 octamers to form a lattice structure as demonstrated by crystallographic analysis.

Use of neuraxial or regional anesthesia instead of general anesthesia may represent one approach to improving outcomes and reducing resource use among these patients. OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether receipt of neuraxial or regional anesthesia instead of general anesthesia in adults undergoing lower limb revascularization surgery for PAD results in improved health outcomes and costs and a shorter length of hospitalization. METHODS We will search electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the seven databases in Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, medRxiv, bioRxiv, and Google Scholar), review articles identified during the search, and included article bibliographies. We will include randomized and non-randomized studies comparing use of neuraxial or regional anesthesia instead of general anesthesia in adults undergoing lower limb revascularization surgery for PAD. Two investigators will independently evaluate risk of bias. The primary outcome will be short-term mortality (in-hospital or 30-day). Secondary outcomes will include longer-term mortality; major adverse cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal events; delirium; deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; major adverse limb events; neuraxial or regional anesthesia-related complications; graft-related outcomes; length of operation and hospital stay; costs; and patient-reported or functional outcomes. We will calculate summary odds ratios and standardized mean differences using random-effects models. Heterogeneity will be explored using stratified meta-analyses and meta-regression. We will assess for publication bias using Begg's and Egger's tests and use the trim-and-fill method to estimate the potential influence of this bias on summary estimates. Finally, we will use Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to make an overall rating of the quality of evidence in our effect estimates. RESULTS The protocol was registered in Prospero, the international register of systematic reviews. We executed the peer-reviewed search strategy on March 2, 2021. We completed the review of titles and abstracts on July 30. CONCLUSIONS This study will synthesize existing evidence regarding whether receipt of neuraxial or regional anesthesia instead of general anesthesia in adults undergoing lower limb revascularization surgery for PAD results in improved health outcomes, graft patency, and costs, and a shorter length of hospital stay. Study results will be used to inform practice and future research, including creation of a pilot and then multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Our study investigated the optimal size and design for such shields. METHODS: Two sets of shields were made; each set included five cardboards of the following dimensions: 1 (44  52 cm), 2 (44  44 cm), 3 (22  52 cm), 4 (22  33.5 cm), and 5 (44  22.5 cm). Cardboards in set 1 were kept flat whereas those in set 2 were curved using plastic frames. Aerosol was generated at the patient's position using a water spray bottle, and aerosol levels were measured at the face position of the examiner and on the slit lamp table using two GP2Y1014AU0F sensors. The measurements were recorded in particles/0.01f(3) and analyzed using a Mann Whitney U test. RESULTS: Mean background indoor aerosol was 559. After aerosol generation, the level increased to a mean of 571 in the absence of any kind of shield but to a mean of 567 when shields were in place (P < 0.05). Flat shield 1 provided the best protection against inhaled aerosol. Flat shield 2, despite its shorter height compared to shield 1, provided the best protection against precipitated aerosol on the table. Curving shield 5 significantly improved its protective properties against both inhaled and precipitated aerosol while keeping the short height that allowed better access during examinations. CONCLUSIONS: Shields reduced aerosol spread with curved shields being more effective while creating fewer physical restrictions. GP2Y1014AU0F particle sensors are effective tools for quantifying aerosol spread.

Conditions causing a hyperosmolar state can also cause CPM, but it is rarely seen in diabetes.

Examination showed decreased muscle strength, and laboratory investigations showed high HbA1c, high blood glucose, increased serum osmolality, and normal sodium. A diagnosis of CPM was made after MRI showed restricted diffusion in the bilateral pons and CT showed pontine hypodensities. The patient was started on insulin therapy, and she showed clinical improvement with improving blood glucose levels. After five days of hospital stay, she was discharged home with appointments to neurology and endocrinology clinics. This case shows that CPM is a potential complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus in the presence of normal serum sodium. Timely treatment of hyperglycemia can lead to improvement of symptoms, but it is a potentially fatal condition.

We report population-based, age- and-sex-specific background incidence rates of conditions representing potential vaccine adverse events of special interest (AESI) for the Swedish general population using register data. Methods We studied an age/sex-stratified random 10% sample of the Swedish population on 1 Jan 2020, followed for AESI outcomes during 1 year, as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged and developed, before the start of vaccinations. We selected and defined the following outcomes based on information from regulatory authorities, large-scale adverse events initiatives and previous studies: aseptic meningitis, febrile seizure, Kawasaki syndrome, MISC, post-infectious arthritis, arthritis, myocarditis, ARDS, myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, kidney failure, liver failure, erythema multiforme, disseminated intravascular coagulation, autoimmune thyroiditis, and appendicitis. We calculated incidence rates stratified by age, sex and time period (quarters of 2020), and classified them using Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) categories: very common, common, uncommon, rare, or very rare. Results We included 972,723 study subjects, representing the Swedish national population on 1 Jan 2020. We found that AESI incidence rates vary greatly by age and in some cases sex. Several common AESIs showed expected increase with age, while some (e.g. appendicitis, aseptic meningitis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Kawasaki syndrome and MISC) were more common in young people, and others exhibited a flatter age pattern (e.g. myocarditis, DIC and erythema multiforme). Consequently, the CIOMS classification for AESIs varied widely according to age. Considerable variability was suggested for some AESI rates across the 4 quarters of 2020, potentially related to pandemic waves, seasonal variation, healthcare system overload or other healthcare delivery effects. Conclusion Age, sex, and timing of rates are important to consider when background AESI rates are compared to corresponding rates observed with COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Adverse events of special interest for COVID-19 vaccines - background incidences vary by sex, age and time period and are affected by the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Musculoskeletal symptoms are often not recognised as a prominent feature of COVID-19 infection. We hypothesised that viral arthralgia is an uncommon but distinct manifestation of COVID-19 infection. In addition, we aimed to characterise the other musculoskeletal presentations of COVID-19 infection and study their prognostic implications. METHODS: Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection were divided into 2 groups: those with and without musculoskeletal symptoms. Those with musculoskeletal symptoms were subdivided according to 4 patterns of musculoskeletal involvement: myalgia, arthralgia, backache and generalised bodyache. Using binary regression logistic analysis, we compared the risk of developing a viral pneumonia in patients with and without musculoskeletal complaints. RESULTS: Of 294 hospitalised patients with COVID-19, 88 (30%) reported musculoskeletal complaints. Among these 88 patients, 37.5% had myalgia, 5.7% arthralgia, 6.8% new-onset backache and 50% generalized bodyache. The presence of musculoskeletal complaints was not associated with the risk of developing viral pneumonia (6.8% versus 9.7%, OR: 0.68, 95%CI: 0.26-1.76, p = 0.426). COVID-19 arthralgia was often more severe and had variable onset, while generalised bodyache and myalgia were milder and coincided with the occurrence of fever or respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: Viral arthralgia is novel clinical manifestation of COVID-19, not typical of a viral prodrome nor a reactive arthropathy. While musculoskeletal symptoms were not associated with developing a pneumonia, clinicians should be aware of its variable onset to avoid missing a diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly when respiratory symptoms are absent at the time of presentation.","output":"Viral arthralgia a new manifestation of COVID-19 infection?

Introduction The use of telepresent faculty to train providers in the use of mechanical ventilation using medical simulation as a teaching methodology is not well established. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of telepresent faculty versus traditional in-person instruction to teach mechanical ventilation to medical students. Materials and methods Medical students for this small cohort pilot study were instructed using either in-person instruction or telementoring. Initiation and management of mechanical ventilation were reviewed. Effectiveness was evaluated by pre- and post-multiple choice tests, confidence surveys and summative simulation scenarios. Students evaluated faculty debriefing using the Debriefing Assessment for Simulation in Healthcare Student Version (DASH-SV). Results A 3-day pilot curriculum demonstrated significant improvement in the confidence (in person P<0.001; telementoring P=0.001), knowledge (in person P<0.001; telementoring P=0.022) and performance (in person P<0.001; telementoring P<0.002) of medical students in their ability to manage a critically ill patient on mechanical ventilation. Participants favoured the in-person curriculum over telepresent education, however, resultant mean DASH-SV scores rated both approaches as consistently to extremely effective. Discussion While in-person learners demonstrated larger confidence and knowledge gains than telementored learners, improvement was seen in both cases. Learners rated both methods to be effective. Technological issues may have contributed to students providing a more favourable rating of the in-person curriculum.

However, the techniques for predicting HFNC outcome remain scarce. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched until April 20, 2021. We included the studies that evaluated the potential predictive value of ROX (respiratory rate-oxygenation) index for HFNC outcome. This meta-analysis determined sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic score, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and pooled area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. RESULTS: We assessed nine studies with 1933 patients, of which 745 patients experienced HFNC failure. This meta-analysis found that sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, diagnostic score, and DOR of ROX index in predicting HFNC failure were 0.67 (95% CI 0.57C0.76), 0.72 (95% CI 0.65C0.78), 2.4 (95% CI 2.0C2.8), 0.46 (95% CI 0.37C0.58), 1.65(95% CI 1.37C1.93), and 5.0 (95% CI 4.0C7.0), respectively.

In detail, we mainly explored the potential impact on immunotherapy outcome/safety of (1) bacterial infections, with a detailed focus on antibiotics; and (2) viral infections, discriminating among (a) human immune-deficiency virus (HIV), (b) hepatitis B/C virus (HBV-HCV), and (c) Sars-Cov-2. A series of studies suggested the prognostic impact of antibiotic therapy administration, timing, and exposure ratio in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, probably through an antibiotic-related microbiota dysbiosis. Although cancer patients with HIV, HBV, and HCV were usually excluded from clinical trials evaluating immunotherapy, some retrospective and prospective trials performed in these patient subgroups reported similar results compared to those described in not-infected patients, with a favorable safety profile. Moreover, patients with thoracic cancers are particularly at risk of COVID-19 severe outcomes and mortality.

We compared the ED treatment and comorbidities in adult males aged 18+ years with ED in the same 3-month periods before (01March - 31May, 2019) and during (01March C 31May, 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. ED treatment included any ED-related claims, prescriptions of any and individual phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) medications (avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil). Results See the table below for number of patients having ED-related claims, having any and individual PDE5i prescriptions, number of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, and percentage of patients with each of the top 10 comorbidities, in the 3-month periods before and during COVID-19. Conclusions RWD showed that ED-related claims significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the pandemic's impact on ED patients health. However, the use of PDE5i medications remained stable during the pandemic. Key comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms, testicular hypofunction, and malignant neoplasm of the prostate, during the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic period, highlighted the impact of the pandemic on ED patients health and need for managing their other comorbid chronic diseases.

Besides, mechanical attributes such as tensile strength, modulus, elastic recovery, and inelastic behaviors were monitored. The survival rate and cellular attachment capacity were studied using human endothelial cells during a 7-day culture period. The results showed that electrospun nanofibers with 6 wt.% POSS-PCUU had better surface properties in terms of richness of POSS nanocage with notable improved mechanical strength and hysteresis loss properties (p < 0.05). The surface roughness of electrospun 6 wt.% POSS-PCUU reached 646  10 nm with statistically significant differences compared to the control PCUU and groups containing 2, 4 wt.% POSS-PCUU (p < 0.05). The addition of 6 wt.% POSS increased the ultimate mechanical strength of nanofibers related to control PCUU and other groups (p < 0.05). The expansion of human endothelial cells on the 6 wt.% POSS-PCUU surface increased the viability reaching maximum levels on day 7 (p < 0.05).

We look forward to providing policy experience for other countries still in severe epidemics. METHODS: We analyzed data provided by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center for the period 10 January 2020 to 25 May 252,020. We used generalized linear model to evaluate the associations between the main control policies and the number of confirmed cases and the policy disparities in response to the first wave of COVID-19 between China and Germany. RESULTS: The generalized linear models show that the following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China: the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism; locking down the worst-hit areas; the highest level response to public health emergencies; the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients; makeshift hospitals; residential closed management; counterpart assistance. The following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Germany: the Novel Coronavirus Crisis Command; large gathering cancelled; real-time COVID-19 risk assessment; the medical emergency plan; schools closure; restrictions on the import of overseas epidemics; the no-contact protocol. CONCLUSIONS: There are two differences between China and Germany in non-pharmaceutical interventions: China adopted the blocking strategy, and Germany adopted the first mitigation and then blocking strategy; China's goal is to eliminate the virus, and Germany's goal is to protect high-risk groups to reduce losses. At the same time, the policies implemented by the two countries have similarities: strict blockade is a key measure to control the source of infection, and improving medical response capabilities is an important way to reduce mortality.","output":"Policy disparities in response to the first wave of COVID-19 between China and Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors argue that plague should be taken much more seriously by the international health community.","output":"Plague: Past, Present, and Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The frequency and intensity of droughts are increasing in many parts of the world as a result of global climate change and human activity, posing a serious threat to regional ecological security. The climate in the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin (MRYRB) has been warm and dry in recent years, with frequent droughts. In order to investigate the temporal trend of drought, and reveal the resistance of vegetation to drought in the MRYRB, this study used remotely-sensed vegetation index products (MODIS-NDVI and SPOT-NDVI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The results indicated that: (1) drought intensity showed a weak upward trend in the study area from 2000 to 2018, with linear growth rates of SPEI at temporal scales of 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of -0.002, 0.0034, 0.0198, 0.0234, and 0.0249, respectively; (2) drought was positively correlated with vegetation in most areas (97.6%), and vegetation was most affected by drought on long-term time scales (9 and 12 months); (3) with the extension of drought, vegetation resistance index decreased, then gradually recovered after the end of the drought.

The secondary aim was to identify factors associated with an increased risk of a VTE event in this low-risk group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing THR during a 63-month period. Patient demographics, socio-economic status, ASA grade, type of anaesthetic, length of surgery and BMI were recorded. A diagnosis of VTE was assigned to symptomatic patients with positive imaging for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or a pulmonary embolism (PE) within 8 weeks of surgery. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify factors associated with VTE after THR. RESULTS: 3880 patients underwent THR during the study period, of which 2740 (71%) were low risk and prescribed aspirin for VTE prophylaxis. There were 34 VTE events, of which 15 were DVTs and 18 were PEs, with 1 patient diagnosed with both. The incidence of VTE was 1.2%, with no VTE-related deaths. Patients incurring a VTE postoperatively were more likely to be male (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, p = 0.022), of older age (OR 0.43, p = 0.047) and were more likely to be socially deprived (OR 0.32, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference with patients given low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as an inpatient prior to discharge on aspirin (p = 0.806), nor any difference with the type of anaesthetic used during surgery (p = 0.719). CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin is a relatively safe and effective choice for VTE prophylaxis in low-risk patients undergoing THR. Male sex and age >70 years were twice as likely to sustain a VTE and patients from the most deprived socio-economic background are 3 times as likely.","output":"Incidence and risk factors associated with venous thromboembolism following primary total hip arthroplasty in low-risk patients when using aspirin for prophylaxis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People experiencing homelessness face a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, as well as health complications and death due to COVID-19. Despite being prioritised for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in many regions, little data are available on vaccine uptake in this vulnerable population. Using population-based health-care administrative data from Ontario, Canadaa region with a universal, publicly funded health systemwe aimed to describe COVID-19 vaccine coverage (ie, the estimated percentage of people who have received a vaccine) and determinants of vaccine receipt among individuals with a recent history of homelessness. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of adults (aged 18 years) with a recent experience of homelessness, inadequate housing, or shelter use as recorded in routinely collected health-care databases between June 14, 2020, and June 14, 2021 (a period within 6 months of Dec 14, 2020, when COVID-19 vaccine administration was initiated in Ontario). Participants were followed up from Dec 14, 2020, to Sept 30, 2021, for the receipt of one or two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine using the province's real-time centralised vaccine information system. We described COVID-19 vaccine coverage overall and within predefined subgroups. Using modified Poisson regression, we further identified sociodemographic factors, health-care usage, and clinical factors associated with receipt of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. FINDINGS: 23 247 individuals with a recent history of homelessness were included in this study. Participants were predominantly male (14 752 [635%] of 23 247); nearly half were younger than 40 years (11 521 [496%]) and lived in large metropolitan regions (12 123 [522%]); and the majority (18 226 [784%]) visited a general practitioner for an in-person consultation during the observation period. By Sept 30, 2021, 14 271 (614%; 95% CI 608C620) individuals with a recent history of homelessness had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 11 082 (477%; 470C483) had received two doses; in comparison, over the same period, 866% of adults in the total Ontario population had received a first dose and 816% had received a second dose. In multivariable analysis, factors positively associated with COVID-19 uptake were one or more outpatient visits to a general practitioner (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 137 [95% CI 131C142]), older age (50C59 years vs 18C29 years: 118 [114C122], 60 years vs 18C29 years: 127 [122C131]), receipt of an influenza vaccine in either of the two previous influenza seasons (125 [123C128]), being identified as homeless via a visit to a community health centre versus exclusively a hospital-based encounter (113 [110C115]), receipt of one or more SARS-CoV-2 tests between March 1, 2020, and Sept 30, 2021 (123 [120C126]), and the presence of chronic health conditions (one condition: 105 [103C108]; two or more conditions: 111 [108C114]). By contrast, living in a smaller metropolitan region (aRR 092 [95% CI 090C094]) or rural location (093 [090C097]) versus large metropolitan regions were associated with lower uptake. INTERPRETATION: In Ontario, COVID-19 vaccine coverage among adults with a recent history of homelessness has lagged and, as of Sept 30, 2021, was 25 percentage points lower than that of the general adult population in Ontario for a first dose and 34 percentage points lower for a second dose. With high usage of outpatient health services among individuals with a recent history of homelessness, better utilisation of outpatient primary care structures might offer an opportunity to increase vaccine coverage in this population. Our findings underscore the importance of leveraging existing health and service organisations that are accessed and trusted by people who experience homelessness for targeted vaccine delivery.

We aimed to design an algorithm based on clinical signs and host biomarkers to identify bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among patients with LRTI. METHODS: Participants with LRTI were selected in a prospective cohort of febrile ( 38 C) adults presenting to outpatient clinics in Dar es Salaam. Participants underwent chest X-ray, multiplex PCR for respiratory pathogens, and measurements of 13 biomarkers. We evaluated the predictive accuracy of clinical signs and biomarkers using logistic regression and classification and regression tree analysis. RESULTS: Of 110 patients with LRTI, 17 had bacterial CAP. Procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble triggering receptor expressed by myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) showed an excellent predictive accuracy to identify bacterial CAP (AUROC 0.88, 95%CI 0.78C0.98; 0.84, 0.72C0.99; 0.83, 0.74C0.92, respectively). Combining respiratory rate with PCT or IL-6 significantly improved the model compared to respiratory rate alone (p = 0.006, p = 0.033, respectively). An algorithm with respiratory rate ( 32/min) and PCT ( 0.25 g/L) had 94% sensitivity and 82% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: PCT, IL-6 and sTREM-1 had an excellent predictive accuracy in differentiating bacterial CAP from other LRTIs.

However, NTBs predominantly exist at academic and/or specialized centers. In addition to increasing centralization throughout the healthcare system, changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic have arguably resulted in advantages by conducting clinical meetings virtually. We therefore asked about the experience and acceptance of (virtualized) NTBs and their potential benefits. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was developed and distributed via a web-based platform. Specialized neuro-oncological centers in Germany were identified based on the number of brain tumor cases treated in the respective institution per year. Only one representative per center was invited to participate in the survey. Questions targeted the structure/organization of NTBs as well as changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 65/97 institutions participated in the survey (response rate 67%). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, regular conventions of NTBs were maintained by the respective centers and multi-specialty participation remained high. NTBs were considered valuable by respondents in achieving the most optimal therapy for the affected patient and in maintaining/encouraging interdisciplinary debate/exchange. The settings of NTBs have been adapted during the pandemic with the increased use of virtual technology. Virtual NTBs were found to be beneficial, yet administrative support is lacking in some places. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual implementation of NTBs was feasible and accepted in the centers surveyed. Therefore, successful implementation offers new avenues and may be pursued for networking between centers, thereby increasing coverage of neuro-oncology care.

Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) may quantify the rate of clinically significant exposure in an institutional setting and identify those HCWs who are at greatest risk. METHODS: We conducted a survey and SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among a convenience sample of HCWs from 79 non-COVID and 3 dedicated COVID hospitals in District Srinagar of Kashmir, India. In addition to testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), we collected information on demographics, occupational group, influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing status, history of close unprotected contacts, and quarantine/travel history. RESULTS: Of 7,346 eligible HCWs, 2,915 (39.7%) participated in the study. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%), while HCWs who had ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a substantially lower seroprevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.9%). Higher seroprevalence rates were observed among HCWs who reported a recent ILI (12.2%), a positive RT-PCR (27.6%), a history of being put under quarantine (4.9%), and a history of close unprotected contact with a person with COVID-19 (4.4%). Healthcare workers who ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a lower multivariate-adjusted risk of seropositivity (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation suggests that infection-control practices, including a compliance-maximizing buddy system, are valuable and effective in preventing infection within a high-risk clinical setting. Universal masking, mandatory testing of patients, and residential dormitories for HCWs at COVID-19-dedicated hospitals is an effective multifaceted approach to infection control. Moreover, given that many infections among HCWs are community-acquired, it is likely that the vigilant practices in these hospitals will have spillover effects, creating ingrained behaviors that will continue outside the hospital setting.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Among Healthcare Workers by Workplace Exposure Risk in Kashmir, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to discuss the most recent data describing the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the pediatric population with chronic pulmonary disease. We specifically focus on children with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and lung transplant recipients. RECENT FINDINGS: Children with asthma, CF, and lung transplant recipients do not appear to have an increased risk of morbidity or mortality with COVID-19 infection compared to the general pediatric population. Data does not support the change or withdrawal of any asthma or CF maintenance medications; however, does advocate for the cessation of aerosolized medications whenever possible to minimize transmission risk. It may not be necessary to adjust immunosuppressive therapy when managing COVID-19 in pediatric lung transplant patients. Mechanisms of infection in airway epithelial cells in children may differ from adults, resulting in a milder phenotype. SUMMARY: Current data about pediatric patients with chronic lung disease infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is promising but remains scarce. Additional study is needed to definitively understand the complex interplay of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the airway of children with chronic lung disease, how it differs from adults, and how best to manage the symptoms of acute infection.","output":"Management of chronic pulmonary disease in the time of coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1. Chronic pathogen carriage is one mechanism that allows diseases to persist in populations. We hypothesized that persistent or recurrent pneumonia in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations may be caused by chronic carriers of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (Mo). Our experimental approach allowed us to address a conservation need while investigating the role of chronic carriage in disease persistence. 2. We tested our hypothesis in two bighorn sheep populations in South Dakota, USA. We identified and removed Mo chronic carriers from the Custer State Park (treatment) population. Simultaneously, we identified carriers but did not remove them from the Rapid City population (control). We predicted removal would result in decreased pneumonia, mortality, and Mo prevalence. Both population ranges had similar habitat and predator communities but were sufficiently isolated to preclude intermixing. 3. We classified chronic carriers as adults that consistently tested positive for Mo carriage over a 20\\\\month sampling period (n = 2 in the treatment population; n = 2 in control population). 4. We failed to detect Mo or pneumonia in the treatment population after chronic carrier removal, while both remained in the control. Mortality hazard for lambs was reduced by 72% in the treatment population relative to the control (CI = 36%, 91%). There was also a 41% reduction in adult mortality hazard attributable to the treatment, although this was not statistically significant (CI = 82% reduction, 34% increase). 5. Synthesis and Applications: These results support the hypothesis that Mo is a primary causative agent of persistent or recurrent respiratory disease in bighorn sheep populations and can be maintained by a few chronic carriers.

METHODS: We undertook a systematic search of three databases using a tiered search strategy. Studies were included if they: (a) assessed employment conditions such as working hours, precarious employment, contract type, insecurity, and flexible work, or psychosocial workplace exposures such as violence, harassment and bullying, social support, job demand and control, effort-reward imbalance, and organizational justice; (b) included a validated mental health measure; and (c) presented results specific to young people aged &#8804; 30 years or were stratified by age group to provide an estimate for young people aged &#8804; 30 years. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the review. Four were related to employment conditions, capturing contract type and working hours. Five studies captured concepts relevant to psychosocial workplace exposures including workplace sexual harassment, psychosocial job quality, work stressors, and job control. The quality of the included studies was generally low, with six of the nine at serious risk of bias. Three studies at moderate risk of bias were included in the qualitative synthesis, and results of these showed contemporaneous exposure to sexual harassment and poor psychosocial job quality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes among young workers. Longitudinal evidence showed that exposure to low job control was associated with incident depression diagnosis among young workers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review illustrate that even better studies are at moderate risk of bias. Addressing issues related to confounding, selection of participants, measurement of exposures and outcomes, and missing data will improve the quality of future research in this area and lead to a clearer understanding of how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young people. Generating high-quality evidence is particularly critical given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on young people's employment. In preparing for a post-pandemic world where poor-quality employment conditions and exposure to psychosocial workplace exposures may become more prevalent, rigorous research must exist to inform policy to protect the mental health of young workers.","output":"How do employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young workers?

As COVID-19 unfortunately has demonstrated, these asset owners cannot diversify away from systemic risks such as climate change, inequality, and pandemics, and can only mitigate whole-system threats by effecting change in the real economy. The following paper examines the current state of responsible investment and its impact across asset classes and through shareholder engagement, suggesting that responsible investment in its current guise is not fit for purpose as a means to address systemic risks C particularly climate change. This is because responsible investment tends to aim to protect individual portfolios from systemic environmental and social risks, without mitigating these risks in the real economy. In contrast, universal owners interest is in mitigating systemic risks themselves, which would have the effect of internalising externalities and protecting the long-term health of the system as a whole.

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study; patients diagnosed with OSA but not receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy were enrolled in our study. These participants completed basic information and the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) at baseline and were divided into the living alone and living with others groups. Telephone follow-up was performed 1 year later to re-evaluate the SF-36. Differences in health status between and within groups were assessed. In addition, variables associated with changes in the health of the whole population were examined. RESULTS: A total of 402 patients with OSA were enrolled, including 120 in the living alone group and the rest in the living with others group. After a year, mental health scores of the living alone group decreased (55.7  21.5 versus 54.1  22.7, p = 0.001), while physical functioning scores of the living with others group increased significantly (82.1  24.7 versus 82.6  24.2, p = 0.006).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients who underwent elective robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery between February 2006 and December 2013 were identified. Robotic procedures were performed using the da Vinci robotic system. Patient demographic data and operative outcomes were prospectively collected in a computerized database and extracted for this study. RESULTS Two hundred and ninety eight patients were identified during the study period. One case was converted to conventional laparoscopy due to mechanical failure of the robot system before the procedure and excluded from review. The median age and body mass index of patients were 48 years and 23.0 kg/m2, respectively. The majority (n=130, 43.6%) of operative procedures was radical hysterectomy, followed by endometrial cancer staging (n=112, 37.6%), total hysterectomy (n=39, 13.1%), and myomectomy (n=17, 5.7%). The median operative time, estimated blood loss, and postoperative hospital stay were 208.5 min, 184.8 mL, and 8.9 days, respectively. The overall complication rate was 18.8% and that for only oncologic cases was 16.1%. Intraoperative complications (n=5, 1.7%) consisted of three vessel injuries, one bowel content leakage during an appendectomy during endometrial cancer staging and one case of bladder injury during radical hysterectomy. Early and late postoperative complications were 14.4% and 2.7%, respectively. Five patients (1.7%) experienced grade 3 complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification and therefore needed further intervention.

Deformed wing virus (DWV), an RNA virus described from honeybees (Apis mellifera), has been shown to have a broad host range. Since ants are often scavenging on dead honeybees, foodborne transmission of these viruses may occur. However, the role of the ant Myrmica rubra as an alternative host is not known and foodborne transmission to ants has not been experimentally addressed yet. Here, we show with a 16-week feeding experiment that foodborne transmission enables DWV type-A and -B to infect M. rubra and that these ants may serve as a virus reservoir. However, the titers of both plus- and minus-sense viral RNA strands decreased over time. Since the ants were fed with highly virus-saturated honeybee pupae, this probably resulted in initial viral peaks, then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected individuals later. Since DWV infections were also found in untreated field-collected M. rubra colonies, our results support the wide host range of DWV and further suggest foodborne transmission as a so far underestimated spread mechanism.","output":"Foodborne Transmission of Deformed Wing Virus to Ants (Myrmica rubra)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regular exercise is known to boost immunity, increase immune response to fight infection, as well as speeding up recovery times and healing processes.

The pathophysiologic bases of hypokalemia, systematic approach for an early diagnosis, and therapeutic strategy to avert life-threatening complications are highlighted. By promoting skeletal muscle uptake, intense physical exercise (post), severe trauma, and several toxins produce profound hypokalemia. Hypovolemia due to renal and extra-renal fluid losses and ineffective circulation activate secondary aldosteronism causing urinary potassium wasting. In addition to hypokalemic alkalosis, primary aldosteronism causes low-renin hypertension. Non-aldosterone mineralocorticoid activation leading to low-renin and low-aldosterone hypertension occurs in Liddles syndrome and apparent mineralocorticoid excess. Although there is enzymatic inhibition of cortisol synthesis in congenital adrenal hyperplasia, precursors of aldosterone produce low-renin hypokalemic hypertension. In addition to the glucocorticoid effect, hypercortisolism activates mineralocorticoid receptors in Cushings syndrome. Genetic mutations involving furosemide-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(?) co-transporters and thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-Cl(?) transporters result in (non-hypertensive) salt-wasting nephropathy. Proximal and distal renal tubular acidosis is associated with hypokalemia. Eating disorders causing hypokalemia include bulimia, laxative abuse, and diuretic misuse.

METHODS A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed at two academic hospitals in Montreal, Canada. Patients  18 years of age with MSSA BSI receiving either cefazolin or cloxacillin monotherapy were considered for inclusion. In addition to the standard of care treatment, participants received a 5-day course of adjunctive daptomycin or placebo. The primary outcome was the duration of MSSA BSI in days. RESULTS Of 318 participants screened, 115 were enrolled and 104 were included in the intention to treat analysis (median age 67 years; 34.5% female). The median duration of bacteremia was 2.04 days among patients who received daptomycin versus 1.65 days in those who received placebo (absolute difference 0.39 days, p=0.40). A modified intention to treat analysis involving participants who remained bacteremic at the time of enrollment found a median duration of bacteremia of 3.06 days among patients who received daptomycin versus 3.0 days in those who received placebo (absolute difference 0.06 days, p=0.77).

It is not clear if prolonged continuous use of an N-95 during clinical duties results in any detrimental physiological effects and clinical features from increased carbon dioxide. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate for carbon dioxide retention and/or clinically significant changes in pH with prolonged use of N-95 masks. Secondary objective assessed for changes in vital signs and any unexpected subjective symptoms experienced by the study participants. Methods: 10 healthy emergency medicine residents between the ages of 27 and 31 years old provided written consent. All subjects denied history of structural lung disease (asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease) and had been previously fit-tested for the correct size of N-95 mask. Each participant was provided a new N-95 mask and instructed to don as if they were about to enter a clinical scenario that would require this degree of respiratory protection. All subjects remained in a seated position and asked to refrain from speaking in order maximize fit of the mask. Venous blood gas samples were obtained prior to donning their mask followed by three additional intervals at, 20, 40, and 60 minutes. In addition, vital signs (heart rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure and respiratory rate) were recorded at each of those four intervals and subjects were ask to self-record any symptoms they experienced prior to each blood draw. Each sample collected consisted of acquiring 2 ml of venous blood, which were analyzed within 30 minutes at the University of Nebraska Medical Centers core lab. PCO2 and pH was assessed at each of the time intervals and fit with a linear mixed effect model to determine if statistically significant change over time for these measurements. Mean and standard deviations were used to describe the values at each time point. Pairwise comparisons between time points were adjusted using Tukeys method. All analysis was done using SAS, Version 9.4 and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean carbon dioxide levels at time 0 and 60 minutes were 48.9 (CI, 49.0-56.0) and 48.5 (CI 39.0- 57.0) and there was no statistically significant change across any of the time intervals (p=0.20).

The migration to create and manage customer experience in social commerce has become an essential issue that will bring new challenges for companies. Despite the increasing investment in this area, few studies have been conducted on the challenges of managing customer experience in social commerce. To fill this theoretical gap, the current study aims at comprehensively exploring the main challenges of customer experience management (CEM) in social commerce and investigating their importance and possible effects in relation to each other.Design/methodology/approachUsing the mixed method, first, the main challenges regarding CEM in social commerce were identified by reviewing the related literature. Then the challenges were enriched and categorized by expert opinions. Next, the challenges and the categorizations were confirmed by conducting a survey analysis applying the t-test and the factor analysis method. Afterwards, the main challenges were identified and weighted. Finally, the Social Network Analysis (SNA) approach was applied to investigate the causal relationship network among the challenges.FindingsThe results indicated that the main challenges of CEM in social commerce can be categorized into eight groups. Their weights and causal effects were calculated to identify the high priority challenges. By calculating the main SNA metrics such as degree and betweenness centralities, the high priority challenges of CEM in social commerce were identified. It was revealed that challenges with high out-degree centrality can create many other challenges and those with high betweenness centrality act as intermediary points, through which cause challenges may create effect challenges.Research limitations/implicationsThe research results can help marketers to get a big picture of the challenges to successfully implement CEM in social commerce and select the appropriate migration strategies more effectively. They are further recommended to pay due attention to customers' issues as well as the organizational challenges of CEM in social commerce.Originality/valueSocial media has become a priority for businesses to create and improve the customer experience;yet there is no tool to identify the challenges of CEM in this context.

Though cardiothoracic patients are at high risk for Covid\\\\19 severe illness, postponing surgeries would translate to increased mortality and morbidity. We reviewed our practice during the initial time of the pandemic, with emphasis on safety protocols. METHODS: From 11 March to 15 May 2020, 148 patients underwent surgery at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery of Centro Hospitalar Universitrio de S?o Jo?o. The clinical characteristics of the patients were retrospectively registered, along with novel containment and infection prevention measures targeting the new coronavirus. RESULTS: The majority of adult cardiac patients were operated on an emergency basis. Hospital mortality was 1.9% (n = 2 patients).

This review identifies the strategies used to engage patients in safety during direct care, explores who is engaged and determines the mechanisms that impact effectiveness. METHODS A systematic review was performed of seven databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, Cochrane-Central, Embase, ISI Web of Science, Medline, PsycINFO) that included research published between 2010 and 2020 focused on patient engagement interventions to increase safety during direct care and reported using PRISMA. All research designs were eligible; two reviewers applied criteria independently to determine eligibility and quality. A narrative review and realist synthesis were conducted. RESULTS Twenty-six papers reporting on twenty-seven patient engagement strategies were included and classified as consultation (9), involvement (7) and partnership (11). The definitions of 'patient engagement' varied, and we found limited details about participant characteristics or interactions between people utilizing strategies. Collaborative strategy development, a user-friendly design, proactive messaging and agency sponsorship were identified as mechanisms to improve engagement about safety at the point of direct care. CONCLUSIONS Agency sponsorship of collaboration between staff and patients is essential in the development and implementation of strategies to keep patients safe during direct care. Insufficient details about participant characteristics and patient-provider interactions limit recommendations for practice change. More needs to be learned about how patients are engaged in discussions about safety, particularly minority groups unable to engage with standard information.

COVID-19 has the potential to decimate surgical health care services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect health care workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for patients. Among these measures, the timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is paramount to ensure the use of protective measures and isolation of patients to prevent transmission to health care personnel caring for patients with an unknown COVID-19 status or contact during the pandemic. Besides molecular and antibody tests, chest computed tomography (CT) has been assessed as a potential tool to aid in the screening or diagnosis of COVID-19 and could be valuable in the emergency care setting. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for an umbrella review that aims to identify and summarize the available literature on the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 in trauma surgery patients requiring urgent care. The objective is to inform future recommendations on emergency care for this category of patients. METHODS: We will conduct several searches in the LOVE (Living Overview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and over 30 other sources. The search results will be presented according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis). This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies, as well as individual studies of such design, if not included in the systematic reviews, that assessed the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in emergency trauma surgery patients. Critical appraisal of the included studies for risk of bias will be conducted. Data will be extracted using a standardized data extraction tool. Findings will be summarized narratively, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to grade the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review, as there will be no patient involvement. The search for this systematic review commenced in October 2020, and we expect to publish the findings in early 2021. The plan for dissemination is to publish the findings in a peer-reviewed journal and present our results at conferences that engage the most pertinent stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting health care workers from infection is essential. Up-to-date information on the efficacy of diagnostic tests for detecting COVID-19 is essential. This review will serve an important role as a thorough summary to inform evidence-based recommendations on establishing effective policy and clinical guideline recommendations.

To date, the heterogeneity and incompleteness of data sources does not allow to quantify the multifaceted impact of the pandemic at country level and, consequently, to compare the effectiveness of country responses. Here, we tackle this challenge from a complex systems perspective, proposing a model to evaluate the impact of systemic failures in response to the pandemic shock.

AIM: To describe how transgender youth perceived changes in their gender expression, in the course of the gender-affirming path, and the effect of social connectedness and social support on depression and anxiety during the pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, transgender youth completed an online survey developed to evaluate the perceived changes in gender expression and affirmation path that occurred during COVID-19 and the age-stratified lockdown. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the effect of social connectedness and social support on depression and anxiety in this population during the pandemic. The participants completed the following scales: Social Connectedness Scale Revised (SCS-R), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The effect of lockdown on life conditions, gender expression, social and medical gender-affirming path, social connectedness, social support, depression, and anxiety levels were examined. Linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationships between BDI and STAI scores and other variables. OUTCOMES: The relationship between the levels of perceived social connectedness, and social support, the pandemic-related changes in living conditions and depression and anxiety scores were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 49 transgender youth with a mean age of 20.53  1.86 years were enrolled. Participants reporting discomfort at the place they live and who had difficulties concerning gender expression and affirmation had higher depression and anxiety scores and perceived lower social support from their family. Social connectedness score was a significant negative predictor of depression severity, whereas social connectedness and social support were both significant negative predictors of anxiety severity. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results show increased adversity for transgender youth when connectedness with supportive people is diminished. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social connectedness and social support perceived by transgender youth are associated with better mental health. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: This is one of the first studies to evaluate the changes that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in transgender youth with relation to social support and connectedness, during an age-stratified lockdown. The main limitations were the small study size, skewed gender ratio and that the study sample came from a single gender clinic. CONCLUSION: As social connectedness and social support are significant predictors of depression and anxiety severity, special attention is needed to increase contact and support for transgender youth during the pandemic.","output":"Social connectedness matters: Depression and anxiety in transgender youth during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early diagnosis of cancer, followed by timely and appropriate therapy, are the cornerstones of the secondary prevention of cancer, thus the NHS has set a 2028 target to achieve 75% early stage (TNM I/II) at cancer diagnosis.

Radical surgery is the best treatment strategy for patients with early lung adenocarcinoma; however, some patients present with postoperative recurrence and poor prognosis. Through this study, we hope to establish a model that can identify patients that are prone to recurrence and have poor prognosis after surgery for early lung adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened prognostic and relapse-related genes using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the GSE50081 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The GSE30219 dataset was used to further screen target genes and construct a risk prognosis signature. Time-dependent ROC analysis, calibration degree analysis, and DCA were used to evaluate the reliability of the model. We validated the TCGA dataset, GSE50081, and GSE30219 internally. External validation was conducted in the GSE31210 dataset. RESULTS: A novel four-gene signature (INPP5B, FOSL2, CDCA3, RASAL2) was established to predict relapse-related survival outcomes in patients with early lung adenocarcinoma after surgery. The discovery of these genes may reveal the molecular mechanism of recurrence and poor prognosis of early lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, ROC analysis, calibration analysis and DCA were used to verify the genetic signature internally and externally. Our results showed that our gene signature had a good predictive ability for recurrence and prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: We established a four-gene signature and predictive model to predict the recurrence and corresponding survival rates in patients with early lung adenocarcinoma after surgery.

This study analyses how healthcare workers (HCWs) perceived risks, protection and preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to medically approved risks and organisational measures. The aim is to explore blind spots of pandemic protection and make mental health needs of HCWs visible. Methods. We have chosen an optimal-case scenario of a high-income country with a well-resourced hospital sector and low HCW infection rate at the organisational level to explore governance gaps in HCW protection. A German multi-method hospital study at Hannover Medical School served as empirical case; document analysis, expert information and survey data (n=1163) were collected as part of a clinical study into SARS-CoV-2 serology testing during the second wave of the pandemic (November 2020-February 2021). Selected survey items included perceptions of risks, protection and preventive measures. Descriptive statistical analysis and regression were undertaken for gender, profession and COVID-19 patient care. Results. The results reveal a low risk of 1% medically approved infections among participants, but a much higher mean personal risk estimate of 15%. The majority (68.4%) expressed some to very strong fear of acquiring infection at the workplace. Individual protective behaviour and compliance with protective workplace measures were estimated as very high. Yet only about half of the respondents felt strongly protected by the employer; 12% even perceived no or little protection. Gender and contact with COVID-19 patients had no significant effect on the estimations of infection risks and protective workplace behaviour, but nursing was correlated with higher levels of personal risk estimations and fear of infection. Conclusions. A strong mismatch between low medically approved risk and personal risk perceptions of HCWs brings stressors and threats into view, that may be preventable through better information and risk communication and through investment in mental health and inclusion in pandemic preparedness plans.","output":"Healthcare workers perceptions and medically approved COVID-19 infection risk: understanding the mental health dimension of the pandemic.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the differential expression of miRNAs in COVID-19. METHODS: The total RNA was extracted and purified from the peripheral blood of ten patients with COVID-19 and four healthy donors. The expression levels of various miRNAs were detected by high-throughput sequencing, and correlation analysis was performed on the target genes that are primed by miRNAs. KEY FINDINGS: Compared with the healthy controls, 35 miRNAs were upregulated and 38 miRNAs were downregulated in the human patients with COVID-19. The top 10 genes were listed below: hsa-miR-16-2-3P,hsa-miR-5695,hsa-miR-10399-3P,hsa-miR-6501-5P,hsa-miR-361-3P,hsa-miR-361-3p, hsa-miR-4659a-3p, hsa-miR-142-5p, hsa-miR-4685-3p, hsa-miR-454-5p, and hsa-miR-30c-5p. The 10 genes with the greatest reduction were listed below: hsa-miR-183-5p, hsa-miR-627-5p, hsa-miR-941, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, hsa-miR-146b-5p, hsa-miR-454-3p, hsa-miR-18a-5p, hsa-miR-340-5p, and hsa-miR-17-5p. Remarkably, miR-16-2-3p was the most upregulated miRNA, with a 1.6-fold change compared to that of the controls. Moreover, the expression of miR-6501-5p and miR-618 was 1.5-fold higher in the COVID-19 patients than in the healthy donors. Meanwhile, miR-627-5p was the most downregulated miRNA, with a 2.3-fold change compared to that of the controls. The expression of other miRNAs (miR-183-5p, miR-627-5p, and miR-144-3p) was reduced by more than 1.3-fold compared to that of the healthy donors. Cluster analysis revealed that all of the differentially expressed miRNA target genes were clustered by their regulation of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. Importantly, peptidases, protein kinases, and the ubiquitin system were shown to be the highest enrichment categories by enrichment analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The differential miRNA expression found in COVID-19 patients may regulate the immune responses and viral replication during viral infection.","output":"Differential microRNA expression in the peripheral blood from human patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There is no specific antiviral therapy recommended for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ). Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19. Methods We performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Eligible participants were allocated to receive orally or via nasogastric tube high dose CQ (600mg CQ twice daily for 10 days or total dose 12g); or low dose CQ (450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g). In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527. Findings Out of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled. The high dose CQ arm presented more QTc>500ms (25%), and a trend toward higher lethality (17%) than the lower dosage. Fatality rate was 13.5% (95%CI=6.9-23.0%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%). In 14 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only one patient. Interpretation Preliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards. Such results forced us to prematurely halt patient recruitment to this arm. Given the enormous global push for the use of CQ for COVID-19, results such as the ones found in this trial can provide robust evidence for updated COVID-19 patient management recommendations.","output":"Chloroquine diphosphate in two different dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with severe respiratory syndrome in the context of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection: Preliminary safety results of a randomized, double-blinded, phase IIb clinical trial (CloroCovid-19 Study)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both for new higher education students and especially for individuals with visual impairment (VI), becoming digitally literate is a necessity in order to be able to fully participate in society and to overcome certain educational barriers.

But how consistent were the country's print media in reporting on this population group before the crisis? This paper reports the findings of a study that examines the representation of migrants and refugees and their health in the Indian print media prior to the pandemic. A secondary objective was to examine any variations in their representation based on their social positions (for example, ethnicity, nationality, gender, religion). Using frame and content analyses, three English language newspapers were examined for the period January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. A total of 1,111 articles were retrieved. Analysis revealed that migrants were most frequently framed as \\"villains\\", posing a threat to the security, culture, health and economy in their destination states/cities, and less often as victims. On health coverage, the study found that the media frequently pathologised migrants and projected them as carriers of infection. Migrants' religion, ethnicity and class, and their proximity to the majoritarian population appeared most prominent in determining the frame imposed. The articles mostly relied on accounts of state officials and political leaders, whereas migrants' voices comprised less than a quarter of the sources of information. The media thus play a vital role in crystallising these disparities and, through acts of both omission and commission, end up vilifying migrants.","output":"Victims, villains and the rare hero: Analysis of migrant and refugee health portrayals in the Indian print media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about an urgent need for effective treatment, while conserving vital resources such as intensive care unit beds and ventilators.

METHODS: Clinical data and methylation profiles from the NOA-08 (104, elderly glioblastoma) and the EORTC 26101 (297, glioblastoma) studies and 398 patients with glioblastoma from the Heidelberg Neuro-Oncology center have been analyzed focused on the predictive effect of DNA damage response (DDR) gene methylation. Candidate genes were validated in vitro. RESULTS: Twenty-eight glioblastoma 5'-cytosine-phosphat-guanine-3' (CpGs) from 17 DDR genes negatively correlated with expression and were used together with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations in further analysis. CpG methylation of DDR genes shows highest association with the mesenchymal (MES) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) II glioblastoma subgroup. MES tumors have lower tumor purity compared to RTK I and II subgroup tumors. CpG hypomethylation of DDR genes TP73 and PRPF19 correlated with worse patient survival in particular in MGMT promoter unmethylated tumors. TERT promoter mutation is most frequent in RTK I and II subtypes and associated with worse survival. Primary glioma cells show methylation patterns that resemble RTK I and II glioblastoma and long term established glioma cell lines do not match with glioblastoma subtypes. Silencing of selected resistance genes PRPF19 and TERT increase sensitivity to temozolomide in vitro.
